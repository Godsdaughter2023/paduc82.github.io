<h2>            How to set and position File Explorer page to open the same place and postion everytime on Windows 10</h2>
                    How do you set and position the File Explorer page to open in the same size and postion everytime you open it. becasue everytime I open mines, the page seems to move a little bit more to the right of the screen. If I open it again it moves even more to
 right of the screen. I want to set&nbsp;it and when I open it again in the future it opens on the same postion on the screen.

            Yes, only with File Explorer. I thought I would have this same problem with Windows 10 Mail, but it always open to the same size and postion that I want.&nbsp; I have had this issue ever since I downloaded and installed Wondows 10. Ever since, ever time&nbsp;I open
 File Explorer that page little by little keeps opening up more to the right side of the screen. Than I have to manually adjust the page with the cursor arrows back to the position and size that I wanted in the beginning. I have not made any changes to my PC
 since. I have always just had to manually move that page further back to the left side of the screen with the cursor arrows.

<h2>            UFC Undisputed 3 - Career mode currupt data</h2>
                    
<p>I've just started playing UFC Undisputed 3 and created a fighter to go through career mode and just as i click to start my first fight I get a message saying 'Failed to load CAF data NO.1 [My name]. The data may be corrupted and cannot be used'. I've also
 transfered the data onto another hard drive to see if that made a difference and had the same problem. I've checked my storage system for corrupt UFC files and there are none and I've also&nbsp;deleted all saved files and re-created a new fighter twice. Still having
 the same problem.</p>

<p>Hey, just wanted to let you know that this is also happening to me ... and it's frustrating as balls.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't do forums, I simply found this post and another one of yours (i think) on UFC3's website. &nbsp;I was searching for "Failed to load CAF UFC 3 glitch??"</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn't an answer, so much as it is a concurrence of occurrences. &nbsp;Let me start by saying that I did successfully create and retire my 1st career CAF on the 1st go-around ... then I downloaded CAFs from LIVE. &nbsp;I believe this is what made it happen
 to me ... did you by chance download any CAFs from LIVE?? &nbsp;Also, I have an OLD XBOX AND OLD HARD DRIVE ... one of the older white ones that were the 2nd gen with the HDMI output (manf in '09) ... do you have an older XBOX too??</p>
<p>So I retired my first CAF with ease; no issues with loading the save game, no issues with loading fights. &nbsp;However, I was never able to "Save New." &nbsp;When I did, it would NOT load the new save, and would give the same message you're getting. &nbsp;When I loaded
 the orig, there were no problems.</p>
<p>I digress; back to downloaded CAFs. &nbsp;I retired my dude, then downloaded some CAFs. &nbsp;I could not load the CAFs to edit them, and would get the same message you're getting. &nbsp;I said *** it, I'll just run another CAF through career mode 'cause it was hella fun!
 ... nope. &nbsp;THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS YOU DESCRIBED; created, saved, trained, error msg trying to go into the 1st WFA fight.</p>
<p>I tried several times to create new CAFs in career mode, but to no avail. &nbsp;I deleted ALL of the CAFs from LIVE. &nbsp;I then tried keeping corrupt CAFs and using new slots, I tried deleting corrupt CAFs and using the same slot, I even tried deleting highlight
 reels (WHICH NEVER SAVE PROPERLY, BUT DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT!!), but nothing worked. &nbsp;I gave up, powered the XBOX down, and went to bed ... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Got home from work the next day and decided to try again (roughly 20 hrs later), and it worked!! &nbsp;I dunno how or why, but it did! &nbsp;I was able to run another CAF all the way through career mode in a number of days.</p>
<p>Now it's a week later, and I keep getting the same message when trying to create/load a career CAF. &nbsp;I retired those 2 career CAFs, and I want to create another, but the same thing is happening!! &nbsp;So frustrating ... soooo frustrating. &nbsp;All I can do is apologize,
 and express my sympathy that you can't even get 1 CAF into career mode. &nbsp;That's lame.</p>
<p>Lastly, THQ needs to monitor their forums. &nbsp;I saw your post on 2/17, and I've also noticed their complete and udder disregard for our problems. &nbsp;BS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Umm, hey, THQ? ... When you take 2 years to make UFC 4, you better make sure that the save/load features are golden ... nothing is more frustrating than putting hours into creating a fighter just to have him not load. &nbsp;Also, we complained about replays as
 a community after the 1st &amp; 2nd installments ... you guys really botched the highlight system. &nbsp;All you had to do was look at the Skate franchise, or pretty much any mainstream sports game. &nbsp;You had a great idea, but it needs more freedom, AND YOU NEED TO
 BE ABLE TO SAVE IT!! &nbsp;WHAT GOOD IS MINING GOLD, IF YOU CAN'T SHARE IT WITH THE TOWNSPEOPLE?!?!? &nbsp;HUH, THQ?!?! &nbsp;HUH?????</p>
<p>Peace-peace!</p>

<p>Thanks, I appreciate the reply. First off, I haven't downloaded any CAF fighters &amp; yes I am using an old xbox, almost ancient, one of the originial models that I had at the release of the 360.
</p>
<p>As for the hard drives, I started off with a 12GB 05 model hard drive and thats when I found the problem &amp; so I deleted all UFC related data from the 12GB hard drive thinking that may be the problem and transfered my data over onto the 120GB hard drive.
 switching the data over onto the new hard drive made no different at all even though I had started a fresh career on the new one.</p>
<p>I also tried deleting the saved replays but that had no affect, however it may be worth giving it a go again since deleting yours possibly temporarily solved the problem.</p>
<p>I did have the one time where for one fight, a fighter that I had created quickly to test if one of my possible fixes had worked was able to go thorugh the first WFA fight, but afterwards, the same message returned.</p>
<p>As for THQ's feedback &amp; support efforts, its extremely dissapointing. I've even sent some developers on twitter the problem and they seem to have no issue answering stupid questions such as 'How do you uppercut', however when it comes down to the real questions
 they aren't interested.</p>
<p>Then we have the servers, but thats a whole 'nother post for another thread. </p>
<p>To sum it up, 'WTF IS THQ DOING?'.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help anyway, You've been much more helpful than THQ developers, thats for sure!</p>

Probably because they haven't worked out the cause or solution yet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Go through all your UFC saved data and check for exclamation marks next to any entries. Keep any data that doesn't have exclamation marks and delete any that do (since they're corrupt). No guarantees if that'll fix your issue but chances are the game is falsely
 reporting the relevant data as corrupt. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware<br />
is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now<br />
than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when
<br />
you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them in
<br />
regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone. (If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />

Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can download it here.<br />

            Hi Pastor, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to tell you that it's impossible to get Google Play store running in Windows directly. But you could use an Android Emulator to do this, have a try with Bluestacks:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bluestacks.com/</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    With the latest upgrades I can no longer use Skype on my iPad 2 is there any way the old version of Skype can be used rather than me having to go to expense of new iPad. &nbsp;This is not the first time this has happened.&nbsp;

            Hi Chris324
<br />
<br />I am sorry, it is no longer possible to run Skype on an iPad 2 or 3. 
<br />
<br />The Skype App requires version 10.xx of iOS and Apple does not support that version of iOS on those iPads . . .
<br />
<br />While in the past, this was resolved by Apple, it looks like this time, they will not be pushing a fix for this . . .

    <title>Games for Windows Marketplace to merge with Xbox.com on July 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games for Windows Marketplace to merge with Xbox.com on July 11</h2>
                    
<p>It's about time. Microsoft is finally consolidating the Games for Windows Marketplace and Xbox.com into one big ultra mega site. Makes sense, right?<br />
<br />
The transition will take place on July 11, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-01-microsoft-to-merge-gfw-and-xbox-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Eurogamer</a> confirmed, when all of the Games For Windows content will find a new home at Xbox.com. Back in November, the GFW site received
<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/15/games-for-windows-marketplace-relaunches-right-on-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
quite the overhaul</a> in an attempt to bring a more accessible experience to its web hub.<br />
<br />
Currently, there's a thread on the Xbox.com forums discussing the move, if you feel like being part of the conversation. You know, if you
<em>want</em>. No pressure!</p>

<h2>            New Microsoft Designer Mouse and Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Got my new Microsoft Bluetooth Designer Mouse and Keyboard.</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 13 with Windows 10</p>
<p>The Mouse paired normally and it's working.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Tried to Pair the keyboard with my Samsung Phone and it worked 100%</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>Hi Carlos, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing pairing issues on the keyboard. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Ensure to login to the pc as admin and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to the Admin account or the MSA to test if that helps with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also suggest you to install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, you may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there
 are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting
 automatically.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, I would like to let you know that if Bluetooth is turned on, and the driver is up to date, but your device still doesn’t work, try removing the device and re-pairing it. Here's how: Go to start, enter Devices,
 select Bluetooth, select the device, select Remove device, and then try pairing again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Make sure that the Bluetooth-enabled audio device is on and discoverable. How you do this varies with devices, so check the info that came with your device or go to the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>

            <p>This is not very helpful. &nbsp;It is hard for most non-technical people to follow.</p>
<p>A good product should not require so complex debugging procedure.</p>
<p>A simple improvement is to dump internal error messages instead of vaguely say "that didn't work".</p>

OK. Then it is a POP3 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two most common reasons for what you describe is disruption of the compacting process, (never touch anything until it's finished), or bloated folders. More on that below.</p>
<p>Why does OE insist on compacting folders when I close it?:<br />

<p>Recovery methods:</p>
<p>If you are running XP/SP2, or SP3, and are fully patched, then you should have a backup of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, (or possibly the message store), copied as bak files.</p>
<p>To restore a bak folder to the message store folder, first find the location of the Message Store.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, the .dbx files are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>Close OE and then in Windows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the missing, or empty, folder and drag it to the Desktop. It can be deleted later once you have successfully restored the bak file. Minimize the Message Store.</p>
<p>Open OE and, if the folder is missing, create a folder with the *exact* same name as the bak file you want to restore but without the .bak. Eg: If the file is Saved.bak, the new folder should be named Saved. Open the new folder and then close OE. If the
 folder is there, but just empty, continue on to the next step.</p>
<p>First, check if there is a bak file already in the message store. If there is, and you removed the dbx file, go ahead and rename it to dbx.</p>
<p>If it isn't already in the message store, open the Recycle bin and right click on the bak file for the folder in question and click Restore. Open the message store back up and change the file extension from .bak to .dbx. Close the message store and open
 OE. The messages should now be back in the folder.</p>
<p>If the messages are successfully restored, you can go ahead and delete the old dbx file that you moved to the Desktop.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you do not have bak copies of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, then:</p>
<p>DBXpress run in Extract From Disk Mode is the best chance to recover messages:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p>And see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4</a></p>
<p>A general warning to help avoid this in the future:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in default OE folders. They will eventually become corrupted. Create your own user defined folders for storing mail and move your mail to them. Empty Deleted Items folder regularly. Keep user created folders under 300MB, and Default folders
 as empty as is feasible.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for
 lose of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />

<h2>            DUAL Licenses for Familes with MULTI consoles&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously!!! You guys need to fix this. I just spent $400+ on another xbox 360 with Kinect, 250GB Hard Drive, Kinect games, etc. And my kids can't play their $5 XBLA games on both consoles??? You NEED to fix this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks
 this is a bad practice. I bought the game, I should be able to play it on both of my consoles. It's not like I can sell it or copy it to someone else, without you guys know I don't own that machine. You KNOW what machines I own, therefore you should not have
 a problem with this.</p>

<p><i><span>So long as your kids account is signed into XBL they can play their games on ANY console. They just won't be able to play the game on multiple consoles at the same time as an XBL account can only be logged
 into one console at a time. </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>All they have to do is download the content onto the console they want to play it on and if it is not the original console it was purchased on they would have to be signed into XBL to play the full version.
 (they only have to download it the first time, then from there on all they have to do is be logged into XBL to play it).
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>The best way to move profiles from console to console is to use a USB flash drive to store the profile on. You could use the Recover GT tool but 1) it takes too long and 2) it is not to be used for daily
 use as it has been known to corrupt a profile over time. </span></i></p>

<p>[quote user="viper1829"]You guys need to fix this.[/quote]There's nothing to "fix". Licenses have been the same since the 360 launched. You get one console license per XBL item and one gamertag license per XBL item. The console license is bound to the first

<p>Thank you for the very informative post. I have run into this problem recently myself. My girlfriend was getting more into gaming, specifically XBLA games like ilomilo and plants v zombies, so I began purchasing titles for us to play. Recently she purchased
 her own xbox so she could have kinect and this is where problems begin. </p>
<p>She does not live with me and we both wanted her to have access to the games that led to her purchasing an xbox so I upgraded to a family account so she could have a profile associated with mine and could play games elsewhere. I thought this would be okay
 as other profiles had played these games on my console without being associated with my gamertag.
</p>
<p>Long story medium-length: I want her to have access to my games on her console elsewhere. If there is a license associated with console, would trading consoles allow this? I could use my gamertag license on the new console and she use console license with
 her new gamertag. </p>

<p>not really</p>
<p>you own the licenses on your console</p>
<p>all profiles on the purchasing console has the right to access the content</p>
<p>however on any other console the original purchasing gamertag must be signed into live at all times</p>
<p>you can use the drm transfer tool at www.xbox.com/drm however you will need to signed into her xbox and redownload it for her
</p>
<p>but your console will no longer have the lconsole license and your gamertag tag must remain connected to live at all times if other profiles want to use the content or even you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but either way only one console can use it at a time on live</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth and Voice Input Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just upgraded to Windows 8 from Vista. My laptop is Toshiba Satellite M300-PSMD4L series.</p>
<p>Before upgrading, my Bluetooth was working fine. Also I could make a phone call and talk without microphone (just simply talk close to the machine). After upgrading, the following problems occur:</p>

<ol>
<li><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>Seems like Bluetooth is gone from my laptop. I can’t even find where it is. Search
 function finds nothing. Before, the Bluetooth symbol appears on my tray (where the date and time are shown) but now nothing.</span></li><li><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>When making a phone call, there seem to be no voice input even though I speak loudly. This never happened before. And as before, I don’t use microphone, just talk close to the laptop.</span></li></ol>


<p>Since I use both features very often, I really hope anybody can help me with this.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For your info, in the device manager there is one “unknown device”. I don’t know what this is but when I see the properties, it says:</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.</p>
<p>To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.</p>
<p>The location is: on Microsoft ACPI compliant system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However when I clicked update driver, it says that windows can’t find the driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Help please. Thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>Hello Niyamath,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your assistance. Problems about Bluetooth and unknown device are now solved. However problem with call is not solved yet. I usually use Skype and a VOIP client to make phone calls. I have updated the sound driver as well.
 Any idea?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It is recommended to create a separate (free) account for each of your kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also do NOT use your own adult parent account for your kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should create a separate account for each of your kids with the proper birthdate entered in the account (so the Xbox service can enable online and privacy settings specifically for children), and if not already done so, create an adult account for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
add your children to your parent account</a>, and <a href="https://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
control what the kids are allowed to do (or not allowed to do)</a> on the console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With each kid having their own account, they can later go separate ways when they get older, and take their own gaming progress with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With one shared account for both your kids, it's like giving one kid the crossword puzzle that the other kid has already solved and filled out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the Xbox One's "Home Console" feature, each kid can play the other kid's games on their own account. So it's sufficient, if one kid buys a game or a Xbox Live Gold membership for online multiplayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other kid can then benefit from the Gold membership, as long as the owner account of the Gold membership enabled the console where both kids play on as their "Home Console" (on the console under Settings-&gt;Personalization).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions about "best practices" for child accounts, please feel free to ask here. We're here to help!</p>

<h2>            &#34;Critical Process Died&#34; Error, Help&#33; Can&#39;t Even Restore To Factory Settings&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a huge problem, I was on my PC earlier today and it was working fine. All I did before I shut it down was update the beta for a game called Overwatch. When I tried turning my computer on later this afternoon I was met with the error "Critical
 Process Died." I can't even get to the login screen, once the Windows loading logo pops up I get a blue screen with the error "Critical Process Died." I've tried looking everywhere for a fix and even tried restoring my computer to factory settings (with my
 files) but got an error for that too. It just seems I've tried everything at this point with no luck and I have a lot of important documents on my hard drive that I don't want to lose. Please if you have a solution let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Anthony &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. My PC originally came preloaded with Windows 8 and I updated to Windows 10 months ago. I'm not sure if that's relevant.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for not being able to address your concern in a timely manner.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED </strong>occurs when a process needed for the operating to run properly, well, dies. Processes are like programs, but multiple processes can be used by a single program- and processes directly interact with your processor, hence
 their name. The bad thing about this error is that it could be just about anything critical to the operation of your computer: namely, your hard drive, your memory, or, if you’re especially unfortunate, your processor.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Please refer the link below and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Troubleshoot blue screen errors</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I suggest you to boot in Safe mode with Networking and look for the latest installed update. Try to uninstall the Update and check if it helps.
<br />
Safe Mode with Networking is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode with Networking.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: After the troubleshooting, make sure to boot your computer to normal mode.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Do let us know if the issue is resolved. For any further information, feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since the issue is that you <strong>could not raise another site other than the Default Web Site by Visual Studio 2012</strong> ,the issue is suitable in MSDN Forums. I would request you to post the query in those forums for better assistance.

            Thanks for the feedback. We found that the -debug argument this not working (win10), and every request is going to the Default Web Site.<br />
<br />
At this time we will use the Default Web Site this meeting I and my workmates.

<h2>            Black bar at the top of the screen</h2>
                    I have a black bar at the top of my screen. It hides all of my options (minimize, maximize, exit, tabs, etc.) whenever I am using an app. Yesterday everything was displaying just fine, but now I have a black bar that hides everything at the top of the
 screen. The computer still recognizes that there are buttons up there so I can still click on the exit button and exit a program that way. I have tried adjusting my scaling option, display size options, and the fit of my background. It has persisted. Does
 anyone have any ideas about what is going on?

            So, I was able to eliminate the black bar at the top by briefly pushing the power button (reset) on my monitor. (I discovered this by accident) That caused the monitor to reposition the picture. I was then able to do any final adjusting with my video card's
 (NVIDIA) control panel. Thanks for the help

            I have tried this again and again, however all I get is an endless blue screen. Tried changing bios setting to normal boot (disable fast boot) and even removed all hard drives except an empty one to make sure it's not just booting from old hard drive.
 Nothing but an empty blue screen with a cursor.&nbsp;

            Doing this gives me a blank blue screen no matter which USB port I use. I tested this multiple with every option only to get a blank blue screen.. Is there anything else it could be?&nbsp;

            Probably a hardware error.
<br />Did you disable quickboot and changed the boot order?

            You need to take it in to a local PC shop or if you have warranty then call your vendor.  This is hardware issue now.

<p>Yes I tried that too.. I also from start thought It was a hardware issue but needed every option I might have missed before spending money to buy parts to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just didnt want to spend money when the problem will persist..&nbsp;</p>

            I put it together so I would have to have an idea which hardware could be the culprit.. I don't think most are covered in warranty but the pricier stuff is. I don't have much money so taking it to a repair shop will only increase the cost is there a way
 of narrowing which parts it could be. Any website with detailed information about malfunctioning hardware effects and causes?

<h2>            Sticky Video or Streaming Player for Right Bottom of Taskbar in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Well... I want to watch news channels or any&nbsp;other sporting channel, while when I work in my Laptop. I want a Video or Stream link player, which should be stuck&nbsp;on Right Bottom of my Windows Taskbar. Or it should be moved and resized anywhere on the screen
 but it should come in front of rest the programs including files, browser, or other apps.</p>
<p>So, if you have any idea for this.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are ways that you can do to play/stream videos while working on your computer.<span>
</span>You may resize the window, and pin videos to the side. There are settings on the application that you'll be using that you can choose to keep the video playing while you're using a different application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you have further queries.</p>

                    <p>This morning I upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10. Since then I have been getting this (0xc000007b unable to start correctly error) on several of my applications. i.e my Secondlife Plugin and Photoshop Cs6

<p>I have tried looking up some ways to fix this on my own, and I have had no luck at all. Please help, this issue is very annoying!</p>

            I tried that several times, even tried downloading older versions. Because I use photoshop a lot, and the error popped up every 10 secs during my work, I was forced to just go back to Windows 8.1.<br />
