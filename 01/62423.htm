<h2>            How do I fix irql not less or equal blue screen error</h2>
                    I've had these blue screen errors and various other blue screen errors for over a year now. They usually happen on almost any game I play no matter the graphic quality. If someone could help me that would be much appreciated.

</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security
<br />
products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />
corrupt or go out of bounds.&nbsp;The video driver or something affecting it would <br />
be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by <br />
manually checking&nbsp;at the System maker and device makers' sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Sound does not work after upgrading to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound does not work after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    Since installing windows 10 sound doesn't work. Although not tech savvy have tried to follow all the trouble shooting tips like updating drivers but report says that I have the most appropriate driver the "fix sound problem" comes back with "no speakers
 connected etc" At some point in the process I think I saw that the sound device seemed to have disappeared unfortunately I have tried so many things as the help would suggest that I don't know where I am now and seem to be going round in circles without resolving
 the problem. Wish I had stuck to windows 8. Can anyone help bearing in mind that I am not tech savvy.

            Have you tried @windows logo bottom left of screen right click with mouse&gt;&gt;&gt;select device manager&gt;at top of list should be audio input and output&gt;^expand that by selecting the "&gt;"will show your speakers hopefully&gt;&gt;&gt;right click your speakers and gives many
 options uninstall and restart computer if you have already checked for updates. Could work and has eliminated a possible fix if does not. Sound, Video and game controllers is also in that list. One can also try the same attempted fixes there.

<br />	How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update version 1803 using ISO File from Versions 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703 or 1709 
<br />	<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Detailed steps:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a Drive with Limited Space
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update-on-a/d7cdba8b-c59b-4a23-86e2-6635a7e44489">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.

            What error does the media creation tool throw?
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt answer. If there's issues with&nbsp;version 1803 as you mentioned, is there any way to update to a specific version? Because I'm gonna install AutoCAD 2019 and version 1607 and above is requested. And which version
 you would recommend?</p>

            I personally would try out version 1703 instead of making such a big jump from 1511 to 1803:
<br />
<br />I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Perform the upgrade.

            Hi Roger, see if you can get into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />G to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally       
        </p>

            Thank you. I tried what you said but it did not come up to the Recovery Environment. 1 time it came up to the "Window Boot Manager" and said there was an error booting and a corrupted file. I couldn't write what it said exactly because it shutdown. It
 said to use the utility disc to do the repair, but I did not get any discs with the computer.&nbsp;

            On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<h2>            Change Folder Destination access Denied</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Recently I found my Local Disk (C) is very crowded and they I knew that the problem is my Iphone Back up folder so I searched for a solution on apple's official site and I found that I can change the directory Folder as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4977359?tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4977359?tstart=0</a></p>
<p>But when I tried to do the mentioned steps on the administrator command prompt I always get this message:<br />
</p>
Access is denied.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 dir(s) moved.
<p>so I changed the formula from &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(Move "C:\Users\...) to (</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Move"C:\Users)</span>&nbsp;without the space after the word move and now I get this message:</p>
<p>The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which of them is correct and How to solve this problem?</p>
<p>

<h3> barrymsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rise of Nations on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to run Microsoft's Rise of Nations on my Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game played fine on Windows 7 and on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 and this is the first time I have tried to play the game since the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get an error message saying "<span>Please login with administrator privileges and try again". The game is being run under
 a child account with Family Safety the same as it was on Windows 8.1, but the game has never needed admin rights before. What has changed?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The game has already been fully installed so no changes need to be made to the system, I just want my son to be able
 to play it?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am unable to grant him admin privileges so I am stuck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Why has Windows 10 suddenly&nbsp;imposed this restriction?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Please advise as to how I should resolve this issue?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Many thanks,</span></span></span></p>
<p>

            <p>Suvarna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I have looked at the comment you have suggested and have already gone through this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of my boys, (15 &amp; 13), have their own email addresses, which are registered as Microsoft accounts and we're used to sign in to their Windows 8.1 PCs. These accounts were 'moved', (removed and 'asked' to join the family under Win 10). I had tonnes up
 their times and filters again, but this was not a major issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have now is why they are unable to play this game under their child accounts when they could before??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft decided to 'outdate' the software to encourage users to purchase newer software? Or is this an update issue. I, as an administrator, &nbsp;can still play the game without any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p>(I think I noticed yesterday, but didn't when re-reading today).</p>
<p>I've been getting a bit overzealous about Win10 and it's dictatorial DRM blocking.&nbsp;

<p>Previous comments about DRM blocking (in this instance) have been scrapped.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do believe it is related to a security issue with the DRM file that checks for the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried giving admin rights to the program under my son's account and running it with compatibility set to Windows 7, but neither work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It would appear that I can no longer get it to run under my admin account any more either, so instead of getting better, the situation is now getting worse!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard that Microsoft have made the game available for purchase through Steam, without the DRM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe they need to offer this option, for free, to all existing owners with a valid RoN Product Key??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently Microsoft are stopping owners of one of their own games, from playing it, on their latest OS version, without any solution, or warning. I had RoN installed when I upgraded to Windows 10 and the pre-upgrade checker gave me no warnings of it being
 an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see some major issues for them occurring if they don't find a solution / fix very soon.</p>
<p>

            As an older person (48) I like many of the older games, Microsoft are bullying in a way because of laziness, I don't mind running windows 10, anything is better than 8 or 8.1, but it doesn't take much for a simple code to be written in to the main OS,
 but Microsoft is all about money, so if old games can be cut they'll do it. Sorry if this offends, (like that's going to Happen!!!!!), but I honestly like the older games of this type.

            <p>Until Microsoft admit and correct the issue, there is no immediate solution, unless you want to spend another £14.99 and buy the game again on Steam.<br />
<br />
I would like to see Microsoft offer a discount code or a refund option to existing game owners who purchase a new version on Steam, if this is the only way forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like the way the end user is having to pay out for a second time, for an existing game, due to a decision Microsoft have made. In any other business world, this would be considered an act of fraud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, get your act together!!</p>

            <p>AndrewJones1967,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are willing to pay £14.99, you can re-buy the game through Steam, as a download and it works fine.<br />
<br />
The game itself is fully compatible with Windows 10, the issue is with the security check for the disc, before you can play it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps you find a solution, as for me, I'm still chasing Microsoft for them to help resolve this issue.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; We all know Microsoft does this as a money grab. This way, they force you to purchase their products via planned-obsolescence.&nbsp; One must remember, corporations actually tell people they do not 'OWN' the software they purchase, that they are only 'renting'
 them. I beg to differ. I own my copy of 'Rise of Nations', therefore I should be able to run it on any Windows machine.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My copy (that I OWN) worked fine on Windows 8.1. I then upgraded to Windows 10. Now, the game no longer works. It denies me access to the game. I know it is not the game itself, but Windows 10. Microsoft's Windows 10 has already destroyed my laptop's
 card-reader. I would suggest Microsoft is responsible for that destruction and should pay me for a means of replacing it immediately, AND for a copy of RON that will work on my computer. You see, you have my money, but I have no game. I do believe this is
 the definition of THEFT. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Microsoft are crooks. They know it. I know it. Everyone knows it. I do hope Microsoft collapses as a company.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should he have to 're-buy' a game he already owns? The 'compatibility' issue is not his problem. It is Microsoft's problem. This is precisely why Microsoft made Windows 10 'free' to begin with. This was all planned. This way, they destroy all of your
 previous purchases, forcing you to purchase all over again. It is how these corporations become wealthy beyond belief, because we are stupid enough to allow them to keep reselling us items we already own.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course it is the 'security check'. This was done on purpose. It prevents the consumer from accessing **** they own, forcing you to replace it, thus awarding Microsoft more of your cash. It is theft. Pure and simple.

    <title>Bad System Config Info after Windows 10 April 2018 Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bad System Config Info after Windows 10 April 2018 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer shows a blue screen saying "Bad System Config Info" when it boots after installing the April 2018 update. It'll then try automatic repair but it'll fail again and ultimately the computer will just roll back to the previous version of the windows
 that was there before the update. I've tried installing the update a couple of times now and the same thing happens every single time. Please suggest a solution to this problem. Thanks.</p>

            Hi Aran, is that update the Feature update 1803?
<br />
<br />If so, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade

<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>
</p><p>The "BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO" error is a system critical stop error, also known as a Blue Screen of Death, and most often occurs during boot. If someone is getting this error then their system is unable to boot into windows in the first place. The error is
 caused by a broken MBR and usually requires a full system wipe and reinstall to fix. Your "solution" only works when the system can boot into Windows in the first place.</p>

Thanks for your reply. Is a full system wipe the only way to fix this issue? Can I reset my PC while keeping my apps and settings instead?

<p>Those very solutions are the ones that made me accuse the support tech that posted here of being unqualified. They only work if the system actually manages to boot in the state that causes the error. If the system is unable to boot in that state and system
 repair can't fix it, the only option is a clean reinstall.</p>

<p><strong>Hi there, ever since purchasing my computer which cam vista home premium already installed on it I have been unable to modify almost all of the settings in network and sharing centre. The only two I can change are "Password protected sharing" and
 "Media sharing". The other options are all turned off and when I select the option to turn them on and click ok UAC pops up and asks for&nbsp;confirmation&nbsp;which I give but after that nothing happens and they remain turned off.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have made sure that all the required services are switched on also. I do not think that this is related to windows defender or firewall as they are both switched off as I have a third party internet security package (Kaspersky Internet Security
 2010). I have tried to change the settings with kaspersky turned off but this instead throws up an error saying "Class not registered". I an thinking that some kind of windows module is damaged or malfunctioning somewhere?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can anyone help me with this problem?</strong></p>

<p>This service depends on Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and DCOM Server Process Launcher so check both of those services and make sure they are set to Automatic and Started before you try to start the Function Discovery Resource Publication service (or it will
 not start).&nbsp; Check this out and fix it if necessary.</p>
<p>The other error concerns Service Control Manager. That's a tough one as there is no screen for it - it does its work in the registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Service Control Manager maintains a database of installed services in the registry. The database is used by the SCM and programs that add, modify, or configure services. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services registry key is used for
 storing this database. An initial copy of the database is created when the system is installed. The database contains entries for the device drivers required during system boot. The database includes the service type, startup type, error control level, fully
 qualified path of the service executable, optional dependency information and optional account name and password about each installed service and driver service.<br />
<br />
During system boot, the SCM starts all auto-start services and the services on which they depend. For example, if an auto-start service depends on a demand-start service, the demand-start service is also started automatically. The user can also manually start
 a service with the Services management console. The user can specify arguments for the service in the Start parameters field. A service control program can start a service and specify its arguments with the StartService function.<br />
<br />
When a service is started, the SCM performs the following steps:<br />
<br />
* Retrieve the account information stored in the database.<br />
* Log on the service account.<br />
* Load the user profile.<br />
* Create the service in the suspended state.<br />
* Assign the logon token to the process.<br />
* Allow the process to execute.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Function Discovery Ressource Publication Service is not properly registered and I'm afraid I have no idea how to fix that problem through the registry (or how or why it got removed given the other tests we tried above).</p>
<p>If the above procedures didn't work, then I can only suggest a system repair/upgrade or, if there's no other choice, a clean installation.&nbsp; Here are those procedures:</p>
<p><span><span>We'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be
 able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span>I'm sorry, but I have run out of ideas other than these.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Interestingly Serif does not specify the System Information on their product page, at least I couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
Serif - PhotoPlus X5<br />
<a href="http://www.serif.com/photoplus/photoplusx5.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.serif.com/photoplus/photoplusx5.asp</a><br />
<br />
Check with Serif Support and their Community (Forums).<br />
<br />
Serif -&nbsp;Support and Community<br />
<a href="http://www.serif.com/Support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.serif.com/Support/</a><br />
<br />
I did find this chart :<br />
<br />
FAQ - Which versions of Windows are Serif products compatible with? - see note <br />
<a href="http://support.serif.com/KB/a213/faq-which-versions-windows-are-serif-products-compatible.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.serif.com/KB/a213/faq-which-versions-windows-are-serif-products-compatible.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Note: All Serif products that are compatible with Windows Vista and Windows 7 are compatible with both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.<br />
<br />
So it is compatible however the information is certainly difficult to find.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Enforcement Team</h2>
                    <p>My account was suspended recently and I find the suspension to be unfair. My account was filed against Harassment and Threats when neither one of those things occurred. My suspension was filed by players who were upset at the game (me killing them)&nbsp;and not at me. Therefore, leading to false complaints. Moreover, I am confused on why my suspension is for 2 weeks and not 1. &nbsp;Also, I filed a case review and an agent contacted me back with a case summary saying that my account was only suspended for 7 days... though, when I click on my enforcement history, it still shows a 2 week suspension.</p>

            <p>I don't understand why suspensions are unfairly given. I don't even think they review the other people who filed complaints but they suspend the person who didn't say anything at all or the person who didn't say anything as offensive as the other player who filed a complaint. I believe I got banned because this guy and his team were jumping me on the division (that game doesn't have game chat in it right now because of the update so you have to send messages) and my friends&nbsp;get&nbsp;on, we kill the multiple times. So, I message one of the players and I say "All you guys can do is jump someone. You guys suck. lol" That was all I said, was I being serious? No, it's a game and in every game there's gonna be some kinda smack that someone talks. Sometimes out of seriousness but majority of the time, it's out of fun and it's what gamers do. But, this guys messages me back saying "it's pathetic that you have to message, you had to get randoms to team up with you because you have no friends" all b

            <p>I understand that Daft Badger, but, at the same time if people are upset with the game, they can report you for the option that microsoft/xbox give. Harassment, Cheating, Gamer pic, etc. So, people would be then reporting you for no reason, just to report you because they're upset at the game, killing them, or they claim that you're hacking. I don't fully know why I was reported/suspended. But, in my eyes I don't think I've done or said anything harsh and if I did, 9 times out of 10, people have said things way worse than me. Most of the time, those people have a shorter ban for saying things along the lines of "go kill yourself." Compared to &nbsp;me saying "you guys suck." I understand that complaints filed tally up but, I do not recollect saying anything threatening or harassing any other gamer.&nbsp;That's my opinion. I don't understand why the suspension is for 2 weeks instead of one. I don't understand if I got banned for communication then why I'm not allowed to play multiplayer? I'm gen

<h2>            M.2 SSD fails to boot-How to repair the boot sector from the Command Prompt&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: M.2 SSD fails to boot - INACESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 is installed on an M.2 SSD (Kingston HyperX Predator). It has been working fine for over three months. It developed a problem and failed to boot. W10 enters Automatic Repair Mode, says "Diagnosing your PC" then gets stuck in "Repairing disk
 errors. This might take over an hour to complete". I've left it running over 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the SSD boot drive by booting from remote W10 DVD and from the Command Prompt I can see the drive contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, let me know is there are any DOS commands I can use to repair the boot sector from the Command Prompt? I don't want to have to carry out a secure erase then reload the operating system and all the other software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

 whether this model of M.2 SSD can overheat because it is located behind the motherboard, against the chassis side, in a location with little airflow? I don't want to Secure Erase the SSD, install the OS and software again to find I have the same problem in

<h2>            no dvi signal  on dual monitor setup on windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original title: dual monitor issues on windows 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought a Zoostorm PC with windows 8. I have a dvi and a vga socket on the back of the tower. My main monitor is connected via dvi. I can pug the second monitor into the vga once the pc is up and running and the display extends no problem. When
 i shut the machine down and go to use it again i get no dvi signal to main monitor and both screens remain black. Any ideas on how to fix this? I'm stumped</p>

            <blockquote>Hello, we have this same problem too on all of our Windows 8 Zoostorm PC's. Did you get any luck with this?
</blockquote>
<br />
I have finally solved the issue!!!!!! My power supply blew and after replacing with an upgraded unit both monitors function perfectly. Im guessing the original PSU didn't have the power to fire everything up on startup. So there's the answer, upgrade the power
 supply. <br />
<br />
P.S. If you get an issue with the PC fix it yourself, Zoostorm's warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on. Lots of aggro to get the repair sorted and they charge you the shipping to get it to them.<br />

<p>I have completed the game 100%, finished all the challenges and this acheivement did not pop. &nbsp;My says 100% overall complete so it is not stuck at 99% like ive read has happend to some people. &nbsp;Before anybody asks, yes I did do the challenge at Cliffside
 Bunker. &nbsp;I have gone through every area on my map and it is all finished. &nbsp;I am looking for any suggestions as to getting it to pop short of another playthrough as I dont think my brain could take it at the moment.</p>

            This is even more serious when using a phone. I dont think Microsoft gets that they lose customers because of this. My friend dumped windows phone for this reason, and I have felt the frustration time and time again.

<p>explain to me how you can "accidentally" move tiles on the phone's screen. you have to tap and hold to activate the editing mode and THEN move the tiles. that's not accidental. the original behaviour described on this thread was that on the desktop OS, you
 only had to swipe down on a tile to move it about. that is NOT how the phone has ever worked, and its not how the desktop works anymore either.</p>

            <p>It's October 2115 ... I just bought 2 new PC's, Win 8.1, and Tiles are still being rearranged or lost on an e-whim.</p>
<p>This is incredible;&nbsp; is there no fix for the time wasted perpetually having to hunt for Tiles and rearrange my Desktop as I need it -- again and again?&nbsp; Is this really the "State of The Art?"</p>
<p>Does anyone out there (MS?) have a simple fix for this sinkhole for time?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who can help!</p>

            This has happened to me frequently on my Nokia 950 XL when the phone is in my shirt pocket. It seems to be an issue that should have a simple solution. Add a function to lock the screen and protect it with a password before changes can be applied.

<p>on the phone, that's called a lock screen password. use it. it's been there since Windows Phones have been on the market.</p>

            The reply does not address the right issue. We needscre to lock the START screen TILES so they don't get moved around accidentally. Don't ask me how they get moved in my pocket but they do

<p>they get moved in your pocket because you don't have a lock screen password on the phone.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 blue screen Driver_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Netwtw04.sys</h2>
                    <p>This is a new laptop I just bought, it's dell inspiron 13. &nbsp;It has blue screen frequently, sometime it says Driver_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Netwtw04.sys, and there was also another error, but I forgot to take a picture. &nbsp; Also, whenever I plug in my headphones
 and unplug it, the sound is completely gone. Sometimes when I restart it works, but sometimes it does. &nbsp; AND!! Sometimes my computer would just completely freeze up on me. I can't move the cursor, Ithe keyboard won't respond. The only way to get it moving
 again was to force to restart using the power button. &nbsp; Please help. &nbsp;zipped minidump file.&nbsp;</p>

 code netwtw04.sys. &nbsp;I reverted back to driver version &nbsp;18.40.0.12 via Device Manager and the problem was fixed. &nbsp;I do not know if Intel and Microsoft know that this driver is causing serious crashes on Windows 10.</span>

<h2>            Lego Pirates - Where is my strategy guide&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>To the Australian audience,</p>
<p>Just picked up my copy of Lego Pirates (Special Edition)&nbsp;from EB only to find I didn't get my strategy guide, instead I got a DVD of the movie. Surely they can't substitue that for a strategy guide?</p>
<p>There is no mention of getting a DVD on the EB website. </p>
<p>Has this happend to anyone else?</p>

<p>Same with me. I'm extremely disappointed. We already have the movie on DVD, why would I want another copy of it? EB Games really should have either published this on their website, or advised me when I picked up my pre-ordered copy. I probably wouldn't have
 paid the extra money for the special edition package!</p>
