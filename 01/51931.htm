<h2>            Windows 7 will not allow me to download or open PDF&#47;pdfx files.</h2>
                    <p>Need answer for downloading pdf/pdfx documents from my Earthlink Webmail using Internet Explorer 7, Windows 7. I have downloaded the latest version of Adobe Reader X, reinstalled it, but I still cannot download/save pdf/pdfx docs from my webmail.</p>
<p>When I click on Save As, my only option is All Files, instead of Adobe Reader.&nbsp; Save and Open is greyed out.&nbsp; Won't even allow me to open the doc straight from the e-mail.&nbsp; When I right click on the doc, there is no response at all.</p>
<p>Please help.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Where are you saving the file?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen only with PDF/PDFX files or with other files as well?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot</a> </span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the link “<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change which programs Windows
 uses by default</a>” to know how to change the program Windows uses by default.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Perform System File Check to fix the corrupted system files and then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link<span>&nbsp;
</span>"<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</a>" to perform System File Check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>It may ask for windows DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>

                    I did a disk compression and now my computer will not boot because the boot files are compressed. I reinstalled the OS using the disk expecting that to solve the problem but when the computer restarted I received the same start up message in a DOS like
 screen.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
EIther the monitor or the video card is probably bad. If you switch monitors and it's still there, then it's the video card. Either way, you're likely going to need to replace one or the other.

    <title>Windows 10 Switch User Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie_horse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Switch User Missing</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought my kids an Xbox and thought it would be fun to try logging in to the Xbox on my PC with her account. Ever since doing so, her account has taken over my PC and I cannot figure out how to switch users. Yes, I go to the start menu, I see her
 icon, I click or right click on it, and there are only three options available: Change Account Settings, Lock, or Settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried Ctrl+Alt+Del to "switch user" which brings me to the log in screen with my daughter's account ready for the password. There is no option to access any other accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, I removed admin access from her profile (via Run: control userpasswords2) in hopes that might give me the ability to log in as myself with admin rights, but to no avail. Now, not only am I still unable to log in to my profile, hers
 doesn't have admin rights and I cannot add them back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beyond frustrated. What do I do?</p>

Hi&nbsp; Jlodell,</p>
<p>1. I would suggest you to run the compatibility troubleshooter and check:-<br />
Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.<br />
Refer this link:-<br />
“Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Program-Compatibility-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Program-Compatibility-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>2. You may check the compatibility of the software with Windows 7 in this link:-<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
3. As a work around you may try running the software in Vista or XP compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
Here are the steps to go in to the Vista or XP compatibility mode.<br />
To change compatibility settings manually for a program:<br />
1. Right-click on the software, <br />
2. Click Properties, and then <br />
3. Click the Compatibility tab. <br />
4. Put a check mark on “Run this program in a compatibility mode”.<br />
5. Select the operating system as Vista or Windows XP<br />
6. Click “Apply”<br />
7. Click “OK”<br />
Check this link for more information.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Apps don&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billythorne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Apps don&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to Windows 10, where at first everything was working fine. However the next day and ever since then basically none of the built-in Windows 10 apps open. Everytime I try to open one it says 'This app can't open; check the Windows Store...'
 however everytime I try to open the store it tries to open but crashes immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it was because I downloaded Windows 10 from the website itself rather than waiting for my reservation, but now I don't think that's the case as the apps still don't open.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a solution to my problem? Thanks.</p>

                    I hear this is a common problem. Anyway, today I tried to install Windows 8.1 through the store app (my computer notified me that I could do so, so I clicked on the notification, sending me to the store). However, whenever I access the Windows 8 Store
 app, I get this error:

<div><em><font color="#555555"><span>"We&nbsp;weren't&nbsp;able to connect to the store. This might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection timed out. Please wait a few minutes and try again."</span></font></em></div>

            <p>Hi Cinos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest to try the steps mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/dennis_schnell/archive/2013/10/26/cannot-connect-to-windows-store-windows-8-1-8-rt-and-pro.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.technet.com/b/dennis_schnell/archive/2013/10/26/cannot-connect-to-windows-store-windows-8-1-8-rt-and-pro.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: you may have to create a new local account and then switch it to Microsoft account and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a link where the user has fixed the issue by running the Windows update troubleshooter from Control Panel. Give t a try and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/have-internet-but-windows-store-not-responding/38571a6e-4669-4e27-a1dc-000237118d04">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/have-internet-but-windows-store-not-responding/38571a6e-4669-4e27-a1dc-000237118d04</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

            <div>Hello Kevin,&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to thank you for responding and for reading, but those fixes are not helping, unfortunately.</div>
<div><br />
I have tried to relink my microsoft account, but it just errors and says it cannot connect to the server ("Sorry, we cannot connect to Microsoft Services right now").&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As for the second suggestion, that seems to be an issue where Windows Update doesn't work too (which it does in my case), but I ran it anyway and it did find and fix two issues. Despite this, the Store app still did not work after running the troubleshooter.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please confirm that the time and date set are accurate on your computer. If not, please adjust them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure Internet Explorer is not using the Proxy settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Type Internet Options in the Search Charms.</p>
<p>- Go to the connections tab.</p>
<p>- Click on LAN settings.</p>
<p>- Go ahead and uncheck the <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN</strong> box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try disabling the Windows Firewall and the antivirus software and then check if you are able to open the Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't
 disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks. </font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this makes any difference. </p>

            Kevin,
<div><br />
<div>I have already tried disabling proxies through Internet Options ("Use a proxy server for your LAN" was not checked to begin with). As for disabling my antivirus (Windows Defender) and Windows Firewall, I just tried that now. Same result as before, I get
 an error when trying to access the store.</div>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the reply. I tried the suggestion, and although it seemed to work (no errors, etc.), &nbsp;it didn't change anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Suggestion #3 on the page you mentioned also did not work (I had not done it before, so I tried to run the troubleshooter mentioned, but it inevitably errored since Windows 8 fails to log in to my Microsoft account even though it did when I first got the
 computer).</div>

    <title>32 bits instead of 64 bits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philippeba  say:</h3>
<h2>            32 bits instead of 64 bits</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 months of hesitations, I have agreed to upgrade my Windows 7 pro to&nbsp;Windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it upgraded to win 10 pro 32 bit instead of 64 bit. My Win 7 was 32 bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was already considering upgrading to 64b since my pc is fully compatible, upgrading now for a 32b is quite disappointing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Is there any way to reinstall W10 but the 64 bits (I was not prompted to chose during the install)?</p>
<p>&gt; If not, can I reinstall my W7 to where it was?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 months of hesitations, I have agreed to upgrade my Windows 7 pro to&nbsp;Windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it upgraded to win 10 pro 32 bit instead of 64 bit. My Win 7 was 32 bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was already considering upgrading to 64b since my pc is fully compatible, upgrading now for a 32b is quite disappointing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Is there any way to reinstall W10 but the 64 bits (I was not prompted to chose during the install)?</p>
<p>&gt; If not, can I reinstall my W7 to where it was?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Philippe</p>

I don't know why you would expect the <em>upgrade</em> of a 32-bit OS would be 64-bit.&nbsp; Changing architecture requires a clean installation and the free offer is for an in-place upgrade. &nbsp; You can use the
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install?ocid=ms_wol_win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool</a></strong> to install the 64-bit version, but it will need to be a clean installation.<br />

<p>
</p><p>How much RAM does your computer have? 4GB or less and 32-bit is more than enough to secure good and reliable performance..

            <p>Actually, I expected only to be prompted 32 or 64.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. If possible I have further questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) MCT:</p>
<p>- W10 32b completed fully, and activated</p>
<p>- I checked my PC to confirm 64 compatibility ("32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", RAM = 6Go)</p>
<p>- I loaded the Media Creation Tool for x64, but when launched it replied "cannot run on this computer"</p>
<p>- I checked all other specs and they are met (graphic card, etc...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; any idea would be welcome, I may have missed a step</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Activation key: W10 32 is activated automatically (I did not have to input the key when installing W10 32). Will W10 64 ask an activation key the&nbsp;same as the one I have on my W7 DVD or will I receive another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cordially,</p>
<p>

<p>Often the other side can't hear what I am saying but I can hear the other side. The video is OK.</p>
<p>When I reinstall Skype the sound is alright, but after a while the sound does not work anymore and I have to reinstall Skype again to make it work.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To work with this issue, refer these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to go to the folder where the shortcut has been created.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;In the library folder, make the view to <strong>details</strong>, not icons.<br />
b)&nbsp;In the pictures library, you will see the options “<strong>Name</strong>” “<strong>Date</strong>” “<strong>Tags</strong>” “<strong>Size</strong>” “<strong>Rating</strong>”.<br />
c)&nbsp;Click on the “<strong>Size</strong>”, arrange in the <strong>descending</strong>
<strong>order</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
That would arrange the least sized files at the bottom. You can select the shortcut files and delete them.&nbsp;
<div><br />
Check if it helps.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To work with the issue, refer the step mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;Right click on the folder that contain the pictures.<br />
b)&nbsp;Scroll down and click </span><b><span>Properties</span></b><span>.<br />
c)&nbsp;Select the “</span><b><span>Previous versions</span></b><span>” tab.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You will be able to see the modified information. You can remove the latest modified details. That will revert the pictures in the folder to a earlier date.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:

<p><b><span>NOTE</span></b><span>: If you select

<h2>            My Windows 10 stuck on blank blue screen with rotating dots for hours.</h2>
                    <p>*Posted this before but i think i might posted it on the wrong place *</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>installed Win 10 about 2 days ago by the free upgrade because i &nbsp;had a preinstalled Win 8 when i bought the laptop but at the time of the upgrade i had Win 8.1 and after i finished the upgrade everything was working in order, at least as far as
 i could tell. So i spent a couple of hours on the web amognst other things then i went to sleep and put my laptop to sleep as well by closing the lid. When i woke up i opened my laptop lid and to my surprise the HP sign came on(like the one that comes on when
 you turn on a shut down computer) which was weird but thought there might have been some forced update while i was sleeping that shut down my computer so i carried on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 5-10 mins i was on this blank light blue page with dots arranged in a circle in the center of the page spinning. Didn't think much about it and waited but after like 10 mins noticed nothing was happening and thought maybe it was the final
 step of he upgrade and left because i had to do something. I came became an hour later and it was still on the same screen, this page normally says "Please wait" but that disappears after a couple of mins. I left again to give it more time and came back like
 3 hours later thinking it surely would have finished by now. But to my surprise it hadn't, so i forcibly shut it down deciding it was probably frozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting 5 mins i turned it on again and the entire process began again and i ended up o the same blue screen with rotating dots, decided to leave for another couple of hours and after i came back in like 4 hours it hadn't changed. So i went
 on the internet with another PC and searched hours on a solution or at least what the problem was and haven't found anything yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manged to get to a screen that let me do a some start up repair by starting and turn my computer 3 times in a quick succession and after i clicked on repair it ran some diagnostics ad a blue screen with the words "Startup repair couldn't repair
 your PC. Press "Advanced options" to try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC options &nbsp;Log file: c /windows/system32/logfiles/srttrail.txt ."</p>

</p><p>By clicking on "Advanced option" I have tried a system restore but could only had two options for a restore point for the 28/07/15 and second for the &nbsp;2/08/15. Clicked on the 28/07/15 and after about an hour of restoring it gave me a text box saying
 restore failed, So went for the 2/08/15 one and after 30 mins and to the best of my knowledge it seemed like it worked except when i restarted the laptop i was left with the same the blue screen with rotating dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried a PC reset but i opted to keep my personal files and settings but a blue screen came up saying "inaccesible boot device" &nbsp;so i forcibly shut down the system. After browsing the web the next day i was able to get to safe mode but it
 was strange because it started out like i had just installed Windows again with the comment like &nbsp;" we are getting your PC ready" after it finished was able to log in and all my files where still there and noting seemed to be wrong, and i even watched a video
 but wit no sound because it was safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here i am hopeing someone knows what to do, sorry about the very long post but wanted to include every detail .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok update it been on for 14 hours+ because i left it on all night and i just checked it and its no longer a blue screen but the windows 10 log in screen. But the space where your meant to put your password isn't there but another rotating white
 dote in a circle with my my user name and email address above it. God knows if i have to wait another 14 hours</p>

            <p>Update 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting for another 10-14 hours nothing happened so i shut down the computer again. &nbsp;After waiting a couple of mins i tuned it on again and a blue screen with writing came up for the first time it said " Configuring updates " and some other things
 that i cant remember. It would get to 30% and seemed like my laptop would restart itself it did this for about three time and on the forth time on restart the blue screen with the rotating dot came up again. I left for another 5 -7 hours but nothing changed
 so i gave up. Luckily i have been able to come across a work around safe mode that allows internet connection and sound, so have been able to browse the internet and watch things online with the said laptop. This update was actually posted on the said laptop,
 can somebody help me please i haven't gotten a reply yet or at least acknowledgement that my problem is being looked into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want my laptop back, also don't mean to sound rude but really couldn't care less about Win 10 anymore would happily go back to 8.1 if it meant i get my laptop back. Even worse is this feeling that its all my fault for trying to fix something that
 was broken by upgrading, i feel like i was lied into upgrading.</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue.&nbsp; Mine was working fine with the exception of internet.&nbsp; I couldn't get the wifi enabled no matter what I did.&nbsp; I was told I had numerous registry errors and to do repairs in safe boot, which I did, and when the computer, a PC, restarted
 it came back on to the please wait screen and it's still there THREE AND A HALF DAYS LATER!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything I can think of and nothing works.&nbsp; My laptop updated beautifully, no problems whatsoever, but I can't work on my laptop and this is really screwing with my business!&nbsp; I haven't gotten any work done for nearly four days now!&nbsp; I need

            <p>I've been running Windows 10 for a week or two, and it was mostly fine except an update caused a reboot loop, and I found an article online to edit the registry entry which solved that. However one of applications stopped working at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I decided I would troubleshoot the non-working program (Fender Fuse, which is based on Silverlight). When I logged in there was a reboot required for an update, so I did that first and the system booted fine afterwards. Troubleshooting Fender Fuse
 suggested uninstalling it and Silverlight and then reinstalling them which I did and that seemed to go smoothly, but Fuse still wasn't working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step in troubleshooting it was to create a new local account to try it under. When I tried to make the new account windows would only show a please wait window and do nothing. After trying several times, and waiting up to 30 minutes or so, it clearly
 was not working. I searched online and found how to make a new account from the command promt. So I then tried to log out from my main account and the system froze at that point. I was forced to reboot and ended up on the blue screen with spinning dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore from the recovery options did not work for any dates, because of trouble scanning drive D:, which is odd since that's my DVD drive so system restore should not touch it. So went to safe mode instead, where system restore reported that it worked,
 but a reboot brought me back to the same problem. Booting back to safe mode now says that the system restore failed (not sure why it said it was successful before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm stuck. I guess my next step is to try going back to Windows 7, but I'd rather not so that.</p>

            <p>I have experienced a similar situation. &nbsp;My Windows 10 upgrade went smoothly and I had almost no issues for the past month. &nbsp;The other night I decided to check out the XBOX app which asked for my Microsoft login which I provided. &nbsp;The system then changed
 my user profile to my Microsoft account and ever since I cannot get past the blue screen with the spinning dots. &nbsp;Not sure how many things cause spinning dots issue but at least one seems to be associated with user accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            Mine was like that for two days, took it into Office Max, they had to do a complete restore back to windows 8 then reinstall windows 10, of course, I lost everything. &nbsp;A good think, I had backed all my docs and pics to a flash drive. &nbsp;I still had to install
 printer, quickbooks, microsoft 2007, and everything, so far, has been working good. What is seems like, is we are the guinea pigs, that is why we got it for free. &nbsp;Everytime we have a problem it gets sent back to microsoft so they can fix it and hopefully
 get patches. &nbsp;In the next 5 months, I guess it sells for $150. &nbsp;I told my friends to wait at least two months and hopefully things will get better.

            I had a similar problem...and so far, I hit control, alt and delete, it gave me a different screen..so instead of shutdown, I clicked restart, and all of the sudden, it was loading updates, then restarted, and now it's working...will have to try that again
 when it does it...it wasn't doing this all the time, just once in a while..but in the past I left it alone for a while, and it was back to normal after some time...not sure if this is any help...just passing along what I've had so far.

            <p>I had the same problem with a Dell PC about 3 days after upgrading from Windows 8.1 to 10. I got the blue screen with rotating white dots and it got stuck there. I then started trying things and the following worked and the PC appears now to be fine.</p>
<p>Using F8 and F12 on start up, I entered the PC Bios screen and selected the option for UEFI OS and it immediately booted up properly. Next day it booted up as normal and I am praying that is the end of it!</p>

            <p>So I'm taking it that there still hasn't been a solution other than doing a complete system restore back to the previous window's version?</p>
<p>I have the same blue screen with rotating dots on my HP Pavilion 17. I left it running over night to see if it would restore itself but after about 16 hrs. it hasn't. At least yesterday I was able to ctrl-alt-delete into the screen where I could either,
 shutdown, restart or sleep. Today it doesn't even let me do that. The only thing I can do is a hard shutdown but after several attempts of doing it over and over it did nothing.
</p>
<p>I had been holding off for months on this update to W10 from W8 and somehow I accidently launched the update, figured eh what the heck let's go for it. Now I wish I would've stopped the update.</p>
<p>Shame on Microsoft for not helping out all of the people like myself that have had to endure this loss of time and loss in profit (if you use your systems like myself to make a living). I see that no one over there truly cares to put out a fix as I have
 tirelessly been on line looking for something and have come up with nothing but dead ends.</p>
<p>This is lame to say the least.</p>

            <p>I'm so sorry you got stuck, quite literally, with that update!&nbsp; I lost completely two PC's, one an accident just like yours, the other I tried the installation.&nbsp; Both a total loss, neither had built in wireless.&nbsp; I was so mad!!!&nbsp; With the first one I was
 on the phone with Microsoft for almost two hours trying everything they could think of to fix it and had already gone through the list of my own ideas.&nbsp; It made no difference and a storm eventually cut off my call and I was never able to get back to that person.&nbsp;
 I eventually had to replace the PC again even though I'd only had it a couple of months.&nbsp; It was the same with the back-up PC only I didn't intend to run the update and I'm not sure how I triggered it.&nbsp; I have my third new PC in eight months or so and all
 the pertinent updates are hidden, no auto updates here!, and so far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I also have laptops with built in wifi.&nbsp; The first had W10 installed the same day as the first PC and worked great for a while then got iffy.&nbsp; I read Bob Rankin's reports and he said something about the updates and W10 being a great way
 to re-vamp an old slow laptop.&nbsp; I had one I packed up for that reason so I took it out and installed W10 on it and it's awesome.&nbsp; I decided to re-install on my current laptop when I noticed the release of a new version, or very large update, in November.&nbsp;
 I tried that first and now have two wonderful laptops that I love using!&nbsp; I don't know what is in that November release but it fixed the issues I had with W10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost the ability to work for almost two weeks before I got one of my laptops set up to do business.&nbsp; I own my own company and all my "stuff" which included the info for my back-up was in that PC and all was lost.&nbsp; Both of the PC's I lost had adapters for
 the internet, not built in wifi cards, and that is the only difference between the installations.&nbsp; I don't know if it was the same for everyone else but my PC's will continue to run W7 even though I love W10 on the laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have better luck and I wish I had a better answer for you.&nbsp; You might try contacting Bob Rankin for help.&nbsp; He takes and answers questions through his web site, is currently writing a book on Windows and may know what to do now that it's been out
 for a while.&nbsp; Other than that all I can say is after all this time my issue is still open.&nbsp; I should mention that when I called support I did it from the support button on the laptop with W10 and got through almost immediately.&nbsp; They tried their best remotely
 for about two hours until the weather cut us off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One fail to boot</h2>
                    <p>I was playing Fallout 4 when I got an error message about a bad save file. I created a new save&nbsp;hopping that would solve the issue, but a couple minuets later the xbox shut down randomly. Now, when I try to boot the system, it turns on and shuts down after 3 seconds. I've tried a factory reset but the console will just shut down like it always does. I've checked my power supply and its fine, I've blown out the dust and tried a cold boot but nothing is working. My warranty is up and I'm not quite sure what to do.&nbsp;</p>

                    Out of curiosity I just installed Windows 8, 64 bit on my laptop which had Windows 7. I like Win. 8 fine. It works great.&nbsp; I don't understand what all the fuss is about. This is coming from a 75 year old chap.<br />
<br />
QUESTION: I also have a couple of machines with Windows XP, 32 bit on which I run a MS-DOS database and text editor. Can I expect my MS-DOS program to run under Windows 8, 32 bit?&nbsp;

            If it worked under Windows 2000, it will probably work under Windows XP, and might work under Windows 7. But Windows 8 threw all claims of compatibility out the window. DosBox is designed around the original MS-DOS, and doesn't address the Y2K problem,
 which is probably why the program won't work there. My suggestion would be to download and install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads, and then install Windows 2000 as a virtual machine, and then run your program there. VirtualBox doesn't
 support MS-DOS, and VirtualPC (the Microsoft product) doesn't work on Windows 8, so this is the only solution. You might try vdos, but I haven't had much luck with it.<br />

    <title>Windows Crashes after Start up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianedobor.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Crashes after Start up.</h2>
                    On boot up, Windows would load up as far as the desktop and the bar at the bottom, and before I could do anything; the computer freezes.<br />
<br />
This began yesterday night when I was downloading Zone Alarm for my computer. Half way through the installation it froze. Nothing responded, the mouse did not move, keyboard didn't work. nothing.
<br />
&nbsp;I had no other option but to hold the power button and turn it off.<br />
I turned on my computer again, to see if it was an accident, or that it wouldn't occur again. However the problem still remained - It would crash 4-5 seconds after the Welcome screen.<br />
<br />
Unlike other people's problems here, I don't get a Blue Screen, or an Error Message. It just crashes.<br />
<br />
However, it did work this one time recently, when it allowed me to use normal mode for a while, until I needed to restart. When I restarted however, the same thing happened.<br />
<br />
I'm currently on Safe Mode with Network and have deleted Zone Alarm, but I am not sure if Zone Alarm had been installed or not. It was half way through installing when I switched off my computer.<br />
<br />
Another reason could be because I had been downloading torrents off Utorrent, which meant that I would be keeping my desktop on for days.<br />
Before the problem occurred, my computer had been on for around 5 days straight.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<h2>            System and compressed memory background high cpu usage after resuming from Hibernation</h2>
                    <p>The step to reproduce (always works on my laptop):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Power on, the machine works normally. 'System and compressed memory background' process doesn't consume any significant CPU and memory (my system has 8 cores CPU&nbsp;and 16 GB RAM).</p>
<p>- Close lid and leave it long enough, system enters to hibernation. After resuming, 'System and compressed memory background' process consumes constantly 15% of CPU (1/8 core), it is needed to reboot to make the system work normally. Very annoying
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is up to date (Windows 10 Pro 1511).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are experiencing. This performance issue might be due to various reason like processes system and system interrupts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Kindly provide the make and model of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Even though no programs or applications are running, some background services can show memory usage and disk usage. In order to check which particular program is using the memory, I would suggest you to check the Task manager.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to these steps: </div>
<div>1. Press Windows key + X, select task manager.</div>
<div>2. Click on the ‘Processes’ tab and it will show you show you a list of programs and services running and their corresponding memory usage and disk usage.</div>
<div>3. Check if any of the item listed is consuming more memory or disk usage than normal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>You need to increase this virtual memory.</strong> </div>
<div>Make it equivalent to your RAM size for the initial size and twice of the initial size in maximum size and make sure you have the same amount of free space in your hard drive in each drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To do this, follow the following steps:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Go to Control Panel (Press Windows key + X)&gt; All control panel items &gt; System<br />
&nbsp; 2. Click on Advanced system settings.<br />
&nbsp; 3. Under Performance, click on settings<br />
&nbsp; 4. Go to Advanced tab<br />
&nbsp; 5. Under Virtual memory, click on Change<br />
&nbsp; 6. Un-check "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" check box<br />
&nbsp; 7. Select your windows drive (where OS is installed)<br />
&nbsp; 8. Click on Custom size radio button<br />
&nbsp; 9. Set Initial size equivalent to your RAM size in MB<br />
&nbsp; 10. Set Maximum size to twice of your RAM size in MB<br />
&nbsp; 11. Click on Set<br />
&nbsp; 12. Click on OK thrice<br />
&nbsp; 13. Restart your system</div>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            it doesn't help. I increased initial size 17GB and maxium size to 32GB. Still need to reboot machine to prevent the CPU running at maxium clock!

            Any news on the solution to this problem? I also notice high CPU usage by "system and compression memory" and large fan noise after coming back from hibernation. This is bad since sleep is not working so we have to use hibernation unless shutdown the computer
 every time.

    <title>Computer freezes and wont shut down&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emily fera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer freezes and wont shut down&#63;</h2>
                    When I turn on my computer, I have just enough time to open the internet to one page (~1 minute) before my computer freezes. After that period, nothing will open, no programs, no nothing. If I try CTRL-ALT-DEL, the task manager won't even open. After a
 while it says "the logon process was unable to display security" or something like that. And then, when I try to shut it down, nothing happens, so i'm forced to hold in the power button. I've tried scanning for malware and viruses, as well as resetting Winsock.
 Nothing worked. I have to use safemode to get anything done. How do I fix this??

 anywhere. &nbsp;Anyways, back on topic. &nbsp;Lavis, have you by chance found that video yet? :)</p>

<p>I could care less if you glitch personally, but ever since Ive been here in the forums, ANY information and/or videos about glitching (including tutorials) was always frowned upon and/or shut down/deleted, just saying. If you wanna elevator glitch in the
 sky, your easily killed, if you wanna hide in the rock on Fuel, your easily killed or avoided, but you are NOT suppossed to be in those places during MP games and its an exploit within the game and/or rules.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;April update&#41; unable to get a list of devices from Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I get error message when I try to update printer driver list:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was unable to get a list of devices from Windows Update. Please try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only using built in Windows defender and didn't mess up with firewall. I tried Windows Update troubleshooter and I tried to solve it by deleting&nbsp;SoftwareDistribution folder (fist stop service and then after delete starting it), all without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two PC's (desktop and laptop), both with the same problem. The only difference is desktop is 1 year old (laptop is brand new) so I already have wanted driver on desktop because driver update worked before. Both PC's are running up-to-date Windows.<br />
</p>
<p>Regular Windows Update work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know transferring driver from one PC to the other is probably doable, but I would like normal solution - a driver Windows Update if possible.</p>
<p>Printer is HP Color Laserjet 2600n (and I want driver without "Class driver" in the name so I can print on both sides of paper).</p>

<p>Printer driver works even on April update W10, just the Windows Update can not download additional drivers (mostly for older printers). Additional drivers download is unrelated to actual printer. It is general, it downloads for multiple printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not guarantee, but I think download ("Windows Update") worked on Creators Fall update, but in theory it maybe only worked with Anniversary update because I have desktop since 06 February 2017. I don't have "Windows.old" anymore :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried it with my second laptop (Windows installation in 2016), but also running April update and download also doesn't work.</p>
<p>So, it doesn't work on all 3 PC's, all running Admin rights users.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />If you have a spare computer, you could pilot this on one of them and see if it works. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:
