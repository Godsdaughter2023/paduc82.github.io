<h2>            Not showing correct amount of RAM</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell 4700 that I have installed a 64 bit CPU in and 6GB of Ram. The bios show the RAM there but when I installed WINDOWS 7&nbsp;Home Premium 64 bit edition It shows only 3GB. If I remove a stick it shows that 4GB are there but only 3 are usable. Any
 ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>From the manual:</p>
<p>"Your computer supports a maximum of 4 GB of memory when you use four 1-GB DIMMs. Current operating systems, such as Microsoft� Windows� XP, can only use a maximum of 4 GB of address space; however, the amount of memory available to the operating system
 is less than 4 GB. Certain components within the computer require address space in the 4-GB range. Any address space reserved for these components cannot be used by computer memory."</p>
That applies to Windows 7, too. You could bypass this limitation with a 64-bit version of Windows if you 1) could install
<strong>more than</strong> 4 GB RAM (which isn't supported as you may only use 128-, 256-, 512- and 1024 MB non-ECC RAM modules) and 2) had an option to
<strong>remap</strong> the memory in BIOS (which isn't listed in the BIOS setup options). I'm afraid there is no solution for your problem.

<p>That's my take as well, but I'm perplexed by the statement (emphasis added): "I have a Dell 4700 that I have installed a 64 bit CPU in<strong>&nbsp;and 6GB of Ram. The bios show the RAM there</strong>".</p>
<p>That suggests that a slot may in fact hold a DIMM with a capacity greater than 1 GB. &nbsp;Perhaps that is normal, as I have never intentionally tried to exceed the reported specifications for a motherboard, and nor have I accidentally done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems that with the information at hand, the motherboard itself can support at most 4 GB of RAM and the OS, whether 32-bit or 64-bit, will see and be able to use some quantity less than that.</p>
<p>Upgrading the motherboard for the system likely means a new case as well, and at that point it may be worth considering a new system, if more RAM is truly necessary.</p>

    <title>Problem with wifi adapter in new windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gretawiseth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with wifi adapter in new windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed the new version of Windows 10 when it came out, and everything went smoothly, except that my Wifi was disabled afterward. I tried enabling the Wifi from the Network Connections settings, but it did not work. I tried disabling my adapter and enabling
 it again, with no success. I also tried uninstalling my adapter, once by itself, and once with the software as well, and neither worked. In the Device Manager, my Wifi adapter is&nbsp;shown as installed and running fine.&nbsp;When I go to View network connections in
 the Control Panel, Ethernet is the <em>only</em> option shown. It does not show Wifi at all, like it used to. How can I fix the adapter/driver and connect to Wifi as opposed to just Ethernet?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for any help!</p>

            Hi Hulmanova 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Take actions related to Display Driver as the first level of troubleshooting
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are getting a pop up saying USB device not recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Have you installed any antivirus security software program on your computer?</li></ol>
<p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would first suggest you to remove all the external devices connected to your computer and try the steps given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ghost devices are the previously installed devices which are not connected but the drivers for that device is still present in the computer and sometimes shows in the devices list.
</p>
<p>To get rid of unwanted drivers, devices, or services, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the<strong> Start</strong> menu.</li><li>Swipe to the upper right corner to bring charm bar.</li><li>Type <strong>cmd</strong> in search box.</li><li>Select <strong>cmd </strong>from the displayed list, right click and <strong>
Open as administrator.</strong></li><li>At the command prompt, type in <strong>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1</strong> and press
<strong>Enter.</strong> </li><li>(Note that nothing seems to happen. This is expected. You are actually setting an environment variable which is going to help you to see hidden devices.)</li><li>On the next command prompt line, type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press Enter. This will launch the Windows Device Manager Console.</li><li>In the Device Manager Console, from the <strong>View </strong>menu, select <strong>
Show Hidden Devices</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>As you expand the different drivers and devices in the device manager, you will see not only the items that Windows currently detects as installed on your PC; but you will also see drivers, devices, and services which have been loaded in the past but were
 not uninstalled or are not currently started. You can find your offending device, right-click, and choose
<strong>uninstall </strong>to remove it from the system completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note that ghost devices, drivers, and services are “grayed” out, but that does not necessarily mean that you should delete all of them. Only remove items you know you do not need. Be careful that you do not change too many devices.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have removed the ghost drivers completely from the system, try to reinstall the drivers for the Webcam and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issues still persists, I suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong> and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 - How do you move users, programdata, program files, program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eniledahs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - How do you move users, programdata, program files, program files&#40;x86&#41;, etc folders to another hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I found one of the answers many times over, but it requires something like a unattended xml and reinstalling the whole windows system!&nbsp; Let me stress that I do&nbsp;not what to reinstall my system at all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may have a backup software Acronis, but I would probally most likely add a new hard drive (80 gig SSD), than create a new install.&nbsp; It would be a major pain and would take a couple of (whole) days.&nbsp; That is alot of time wasted where I could be working
 on a project for money.&nbsp; I'm sure you understand, because I'm sure that some of you work on the computer also for money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally like the way I have windows&nbsp;currently setup.&nbsp; I would truely hate to have to sign into my software&nbsp;accounts to Disable certain softwares for moving them to another computer, like Cakewalk Sonar, Celemony Melodyne, quicktime pro, Avid, etc.&nbsp;
 All of them having a login to server type of system that you must deactivate in order to put on a new system.&nbsp; It is very time consuming process because I have a ton of&nbsp;paid software I would have to do&nbsp;this to.&nbsp; I don't trust freeware products because of friends
 whom got viruses and stuff from them, so do not suggest me download anything that isn't from microsoft themselves.&nbsp; AND After you move them, you have to reinstall and the new updates!&nbsp; Which in itself could take days because they are such huge updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own the SSD drive and a data drive setup.&nbsp; 40gig intel SDD and a 320g hard drive.&nbsp; My 40gig only has 2 gigs of space left and keeps getting smaller and smaller!&nbsp; My SSD drive is my windows drive.&nbsp; It is where windows is C:\.&nbsp; My data drive is D:\ which
 is the 320g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of late, all software I install, when I can have the option or it has a custom setup.. I'll tell it to install into D: drive (320g data drive).&nbsp; Sometimes the software will install some stuff there, then for some reason unknown to me, it will install
 stuff in C: drive!&nbsp; I've complained to the software companies with no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The users folder is the biggest folder.. 8 gigs.&nbsp; I can save 8 gigs of hard drive space on my SSD if I can copy and move just the Users folder alone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave it some thought.. I own Acronis also.&nbsp; I could backup my whole system, and install a 80 gig SSD and solve this problem for a little while longer?&nbsp; I was thinking I may have to use that method if it all comes down to not getting a answer at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider myself very good with getting into and out of a computer system.&nbsp; I program software in Delphi language, and a few others.&nbsp; Even though I know about C language, and can port it to Delphi, I prefer Delphi language.&nbsp; I'm no idiot at the computer
 and can modify the computer registry with no problems.&nbsp; I consider myself above average at the computer, but no hacker or genius.&nbsp; So.... with that in mind, could you basically tell me steps I can try or take in order to solve my problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just keep in mind when answering, I want to do this on a system that is already made and not a restalling of windows.&nbsp; I have already found the answer to reinstalling windows with a unattended XML.&nbsp; And 32+ people liked the answer and solved their problems,
 but that is not enough for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I do not understand, is why Microsoft won't just let you move folders around just by going into Windows software and changing something that would change what ever it needed to inside windows so you don't have to mess with all the little happy registry
 codes, or do any special typing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a few articles on MKLINK.. symbolic linking .. Is that safe?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, please answer as best you can.&nbsp; I may even take the option of paying Microsoft for the answer, if anyone thinks I will get a good answer for it?&nbsp; Would microsoft give me the best answer to solve my problem or would they tell me to reinstall like
 the others or what?&nbsp; I'd hate to pay for a no good answer that does not solve the issue.&nbsp; I am willing to pay though, just wanted to try this option first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your time in reading my question.&nbsp; Please answer the best you know how.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS.&nbsp; I was going to put this in Files, Folders and Search, but I thought.. I don't think there is going to be anyone smart in that topic group .. and all the smart people will probably be in the Maintenance topic area.. that is where I'm putting this question
 at.&nbsp; Its a maintenance question anyhow.. I'm trying to maintain my windows!</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'll start out by saying that from your list of system folders, the only supported system folders that can be moved to another drive&nbsp;is the Users folder. The only 'supported' way to move this folder&nbsp;is during the initial install using the WAIK (Windows Automated
 Installation Kit) with an unattended installation file.</p>
<p>You will find many websites who say that this can be done, using very complex procedures. The bottom line is that even if you did accomplish this, your computing experience on such a system would be much less than pleasant and definitely not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Windows 7 is designed so that you can easily move the personal files (Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, Recordings, etc) very easily. These folders usually contain the bulk of a typical users system.</p>
<p>What you need to do is post this question over on our Technet ITPro Forums. The experts there will be able to provide more details.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the exact same issue. When logging in from one PC the xbox app states:</p>
<p>"This PC is not connected to an xbox controller. Attach one and try again."</p>
<p>I have verified that the xbox one controller does indeed work in PC games and calibration etc.</p>
<p>When I use the exact same controller and cable on another PC streaming works fine, so we can put to rest any issue with the controller, cable, xbox one os version etc. This must be down to the PC/xbox controller drivers.</p>
<p>On the PC which does _not_ work the controller shows in device manager as:</p>
<p>Microsoft Xbox One Controller</p>
<p>Properties show as:</p>
<p>Driver version: 6.2.11059.0</p>
<p>WdfCoInstaller01011.dll</p>
<p>xb1usb.sys</p>
<p>On the PC which _does_ work the controller shows in device manager as:</p>

<p>Same problem here. Two PCs, one working (with dc1-controller.sys), the other doesn't (xb1usb.sys).</p>
<p>Judging from the version number (6.2...) I suspect xb1usb is an old driver from Windows 8.1 before upgrading to Windows 10 and it's incompatible with the Xbox App (even though it works fine as a normal gamepad elsewhere). I tried various ways to throw that
 old driver from my system or prevent Windows 10 from automatically installing it. No dice. Windows doesn't give me any other choice for an alternate or built-in driver either.</p>
<p>Some support would be helpful here.</p>

<p>Smart*ss, the guy keeps making threads over and over again with referral links.&nbsp; It's not a matter of one particular thread.&nbsp; The mods should just instantly permaban each silver creating these things.&nbsp; That's obviously the only reason the account was created
 so there's no mistake or loss of money on MSs part.&nbsp; All of his threads still exist.&nbsp; It's simple... yet the mods aren't doing anything about it.</p>

<p>Socom 4. I really haven't played as many games as I would have hoped and the ones I have played have been alright or just bad. Socom 4 is the only one that I have REALLY enjoyed so far.</p>
<p>Uncharted 3 will easily take Game of the Year for me though. Game looks phenomenal. Probably wouldn't be Game of the Year if Mass Effect 3 released this year though, bummer that it got delayed.</p>

<p>Try installing the software before plugging in the printer.</p>
<p>Are you using the latest drivers form the Canon website?</p>

<h2>            How do I fix the following - &#34;Profile error occurred. Your preferences file is corrupt or invalid. NW.js is unable to recover your settings.&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The last few times I have started my desktop it has made a slow beeping alarm-type noise. I&nbsp; turned it off and restarted it, and it then went through a CHKDSK procedure which deleted a number of corrupt files. This took just a minute or two then it seemed
 to work fine.</p>
<p>This time when I started it up it went through a similar procedure but took a lot longer, and scrolled through pages of files and removed a lot more corrupt ones. The procedure started with 'Checking file system on C: the fype of the file system is NTFS....'.
 There were also other messages - </p>
<p>' deleting corrupt attribute record (128, " ")', </p>
<p>'deleting orphan file record segment 234874', then the same with 3 other record numbers,</p>
<p>'deleting index entry',</p>
<p>'deleting index entry components',</p>
<p>and a whole series of other message that scrolled too fast for me to note.</p>
<p>This all ended with a message box showing 'Profile error occurred. Your preferences file is corrupt or invalid. NW.js is unable to recover your settings.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had also been getting an 'apps/data' C drive error on startup for a little while but it didn't seem to be affecting anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can suggest a fix....it'd be much appreciated!!</p>

                    <p>Recently I have seen&nbsp;2 Driver updates in Windows 10&gt;Settings&gt;Updates listed as &nbsp; "CREATIVE - MEDIA - 2/7/2017 12:00:00 AM - 6.0.103.34" and "CREATIVE - MEDIA - 12/20/2016 12:00:00 AM - 6.0.102.50"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed the first one yesterday I figured I should check the Creative website for new downloads.&nbsp; I have the Creative Media Sound&nbsp;Blaster Z card installed and there was a new driver released by them on January 25th, 2017 so I downloaded it and
 installed it.&nbsp; Set everything up and it seems to be a little smoother now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I see the second one and installed it too, I checked the Creative site and there is nothing new there so I'm wondering what this is all about? &nbsp;As per usual Microsoft is making zero&nbsp;details available about it beyond the actual title.&nbsp; Can anyone illuminate
 me?</p>

            I have a similar issue but only with&nbsp;CREATIVE - MEDIA - 2/7/2017 12:00:00 AM - 6.0.103.34 except my computer blue screens every time it tries to install. In update history CREATIVE - MEDIA - 12/20/2016 12:00:00 AM - 6.0.102.50 is listed as successful so
 one of two is complete. Luckily it's manual so for now I'll ignore it but I do agree, Microsoft need to give more info!

<p>
</p><p>I noticed also in the Soundblaster control panel there's only 2 tabs to choose from.</p>

</p><p>One is <strong>Cinematic</strong> and the other is <strong>Advanced features </strong>
the rest of the tabs are not showing</p>

<p>Yeah mine does too. &nbsp;I should run it again I suppose,&nbsp;although they have a way of making&nbsp;bloatware seem essential.&nbsp; To be honest I was hoping that the new Creative Media driver updates would allow me to run the card without the SoundBlaster Z Control Panel
 and still give some sort of eq&nbsp;function.&nbsp; Other than that, I am very curious as to what Microsoft is adding that isn't included in the new Creative package if anything at all.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When a system appears to hang or get stuck on mup.sys most folks assume that there is a problem with mup.sys and set about trying to replace it - but that is a waste of time since that is not the problem (pay attention Microsoft engaged Support Engineer
 "experts").</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see that happen, mup.sys has already loaded and the "problem" is what comes after mup.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time it happens during some kind of troubleshooting effort and the user has somehow either scheduled a chkdsk with error correction to run on the next reboot or the volume on which XP resides has been marked "dirty" - probably from a power failure,
 reset button, power button, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When XP boots it always checks the dirty bit on all volumes to see if it needs to run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) on the volume - and it will do that if it finds a dirty volume.&nbsp; If there is a chkdsk with error correction scheduled to run
 on the next reboot, XP will run it on the next reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot in Safe Mode and after you see mup.sys load, that is when XP checks the dirty bit on the volumes and it will start a chkdsk with error correction to try to fix it.&nbsp; If there is a chkdsk with error correction scheduled to run on the next reboot
 it will also run after mup.sys loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing to do when you see that is to look at the HDD access LED if there is one or listen to the system to see if you can hear the hard drive "working".&nbsp; If there is HDD activity, then XP is probably running the chkdsk with error correction and the last
 thing you see on the screen will be mup.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chkdsk with error correction can take a long time - perhaps several to many hours depending on the speed of your system, the size of your HDD, the amount of data on the HDD and what the chkdsk finds to do so the best thing to do is not interrupt it since
 it will finish one way or the other sooner or later (probably later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why your system finally came to life - the chkdsk finished but you can still check the dirty bit on your volumes to see if it is set or not.&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
To query the dirty bit on drive C, type:<br />
<br />
fsutil dirty query C:<br />
<br />
Sample output: <br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C: is not dirty<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to close the command prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the volume is dirty, the only way to clear it is to run a chkdsk with error correction and if the volume is dirty and you boot again in Safe Mode the last thing you are going to see on the screen is mup.sys until XP finishes trying to clear the dirty
 bit and you will be "stuck" again until the dirty bit is cleared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some other reasons why a system might get hung after mup.sys loads but the most likely scenario is the system is running a chkdsk with error correction - so wait it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone wants to see the "problem" all you have to do is schedule a chkdsk with error correction to run on the next reboot, then when the system reboots go into Safe Mode and the last thing you will see on the screen is mup.sys and then you are stuck until
 the chkdsk finishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that when chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you choose to schedule the chkdsk with error correction on the next reboot, the results are shown in the Event
 Viewer Application log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk log to see what happened and any problems after chkdsk has run.<br />
<br />
To see the results of a chkdsk that runs on reboot, you must look in the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for a recent event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1001<br />
Description:<br />

<p>I've been playing Microsoft solitaire for a few years and religiously I might add. Everything was fine last night until the bloopy commercial ran and every time it did my pc went to desktop immediately after. there were four challenges that I could not play
 as a result. I am not the only person that I know that had this problem, I have five friends that I talked to today and they had the same problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Consequently I think the problem is on your end not all of ours.</p>

 not find any missing or corrupted system files.&nbsp; I have to agree with Richard VanEpps (below).&nbsp; I don't think it's our computers.&nbsp; The problem must be something in that advertisement.

<p>Gerard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be greatly appreciated if you would treat this as a real problem on your end.&nbsp; Most of us are very well aware that the first place to start is with the debugging steps your described.&nbsp; We are all detailing the exact same problem with the screen
 disappearing in the middle of the (nauseating) advertisements.&nbsp; Please escalate this to the next level.&nbsp; If need be, I can drive two miles down the road to MS headquarters and&nbsp;demonstrate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>For Toshiba Satellite C640, I find this driver at the link below, at Toshiba Europe.&nbsp; It's a 64 bit Windows 8.1 NVidia driver.&nbsp; I find no Windows 10 driver, so you can try to install the 8.1 driver in compatibility mode.&nbsp; There should also be what Toshiba
 calls a "short model number."&nbsp; Do you have the short model number besides the C640?</p>

do all the drivers get uninstalled or not?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

</p><p>If you run the upgrade again, it will install one display driver, but, if you are only having problems with the display, I would try to correct the display driver before running the upgrade again.&nbsp; The driver that the computer is using for the display will

<h2>            How can I change the age restrictions for my child&#39;s Xbox Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My son and I&nbsp;like to play games together and it has proven extremely difficult to do so with certain titles that deem him too young to play. I&nbsp;updated his content restrictions on his Xbox as well as via my Microsoft account but there are still games that won't allow him to play online, like DCUO or Skate 3 to name a couple. I&nbsp;understand that these games have an age rating older my sons age, but if I&nbsp;grant him permission to play these games (I manage all of his installs and screen&nbsp;time) then he should be able to play them.</p><p><br /></p><p>The only workaround I&nbsp;could come up with was to create a brand new&nbsp;unrestricted account for him, but this causes a lot of frustration and confusion when managing his friends lists and&nbsp;save files/loss of progression between accounts... it sucks. The family share feature Microsoft offers is great and we make full use of it, and love it... but this aspect is a real pain point for us. There must be a simple solutio
