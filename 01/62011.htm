<p>Hey Ryan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you might have noticed, there are more than one type of security protocols out there, and the Xbox One, is only compatible with a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could essentially attempt to power cycle your console and network hardware, and you can perform this by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unplug the power cable from the back of the router, modem, or gateway for five minutes. If you have a router and a modem, unplug the power cable from both devices.
</li><li>Restart your Xbox One console:
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>in the center of your Xbox One controller to open the Power Center. </li><li>Select <strong>Restart console</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Restart</strong>.
<p><strong>Note</strong> If the console appears to be frozen, press and hold the <strong>
Xbox</strong> button on the console for 10 seconds, until the console turns off. After the console shuts down, touch the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button on the console again to restart.</p>
</li></ol>
</li><li>After five minutes, plug the modem or gateway in first and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.
</li><li>If you are using a router, plug in the router and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, you would could like to test your connection to Xbox Live at that point, and you can do this by following these additional steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>to open the guide and select <strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network</strong> &gt; <strong>Network settings</strong>.
</li><li>Any known outages will appear in the middle of the screen. </li><li>On the right side of the <strong>Network settings</strong> screen, select <strong>
Test network connection</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not able to get online after following these steps, I recommend taking a look at the<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Network Connection Error Solution</a>
 wizard and see if the steps outlined work for you!</p>

<h2>            what happens 180 days after i use default Windows 10 Pro key</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My Laptop runs on Windows 10 Home edition. I want to upgrade it to Windows 10 pro however want to do it free even it is for trial period. Basically I want to explore the Hyper-V feature on my laptop. I understand from below thread that Microsoft provides
 180 days of activation with default Win pro activation code.</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-home-to-pro-error-0x803fa067/c03a7b8b-868c-496c-bb85-4d5e9a96fcde</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that I am successfully able to upgrade my Laptop to Windows Pro OS, My question is:</p>
<p>1&gt; What happens after 180 days. Will my OS activation will start showing as Windows Home again or will it continue to show as "OS version not activated" ? Problem is, I no longer have Windows home activation key with me which was shipped with Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&gt; If I try to reactivate with default Win pro key again after 180 days..Will it allow me to do so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards,</p>
<p />

<br />
<em>-After the trial period expires, you will see a persistent desktop notification indicating that the system is not genuine, and the PC will shut down every hour. Please make a back up of your files before proceeding to the trial period as you won't be able
 to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your previous version of Windows. A clean installation of your former operating system will be required, and you will need to re-install all of your programs and data.<br />
<br />
</em></li><li>If I try to reactivate with default Win pro key again after 180 days..Will it allow me to do so?<br />
<br />
<em>-No. The trial key will simply be embedded to your device's motherboard thus prevents you from using it again.</em></li></ol>

    <title>Xbox Accessories not detecting my Xbox One controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Accessories not detecting my Xbox One controller</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an Xbox one controller to use specifically as a game controller.</p>
<p>I went and downloaded the Xbox accessories app and got ready to use my controller.</p>
<p>After i connected my controller via bluetooth, the xbox accessories app says "connect a controller to get started"</p>
<p>i tried everything i could think of, even starting to mess with the drivers of the device to try and get it to work, but nothing i did worked. the controller is fresh out of the box and i expected it to work fine, but in the windows game controller GUI,
 none of the buttons did anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem and had any solutions. I've been trying for multiple hours on end and talked with Microsoft support through a text chat but even they couldn't help me.</p>

<p>Would you be sat there cringing at your original GT name?&nbsp; I mean, something that probably looked good when are 18 or so usually looks ridiculous as you get into your late 20's or into your 30's.&nbsp; Genuinely can't remember my first GT, but I'm sure it was
 something stupid.&nbsp; Can honestly say I haven't had a gamer tag with X's or with every other word being a capital.</p>

    <title>Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t come out of sleep mode using wireless - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t come out of sleep mode using wireless controller</h2>
                    
<p>My brand new Quantum Break bundled Xbox One won't properly come out of sleep state with a wireless controller. I have to reboot the system to get any controller to reconnect. A few details.<br />
<br />
If I wake the console up within 1 hour of putting it to sleep, it wakes up fine. If it goes overnight, I can't wake it or use a controller over wireless.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. System will wake up by pressing the power on the front, wired USB controller or IR remote control.<br />
2. Even after the system is awake, it won't connect to any wireless controllers until rebooted.<br />
3. I can reboot the system by removing power and then plugging it back in and THEN the wireless controller WILL start up the console.<br />
4. I have tried multiple controllers. All behave the same way.<br />
5. I have a second Xbox One that I've had for 2 years now. It wakes up with all the controllers, including the new white one from the QB bundle.<br />
6. All the controllers are up to date.<br />
7. The console had the problem on the current Xbox dashboard as well as in the Preview Program. It is currently on the latest preview build.<br />
8. I have changed the batteries in the controller...<br />
<br />
Anything I'm missing here? I feel like I've troubleshot this thing to death now. It's got to be an issue with the console itself.<br />
<br />
Oh, I almost forgot. This is the second console to have this EXACT problem The first I returned to the retail in exchange for this one. Both have similar serial numbers and are the Quantum Break bundle (great game btw!). I'm even wondering if there might be
 a batch of these with this issue.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>From what you are describing, I would say that the wireless card in the console is having some issues, whether they are power issues or it's leaking memory or something. In any case, I believe your only real option is to send the console in for a repair.
</p>
<p>You can do this by first registering the device at devicesupport.microsoft.com then placing a service request.
</p>
<p>Sorry that there is no quick fix for the issue. Though at least you have a second console to use while you send this one away. :)</p>

    <title>Trying to get a verification code from an email inbox that I cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amyshears  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to get a verification code from an email inbox that I cannot access without the verification code&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop. During the set up process it asked me to create a new email. I created an email name and password. Now to complete the set up it is asking me for a verification code which was sent to my email inbox, which I cannot access without the
 verificationn code! This is obviously IMPOSSIBLE. I have tried things like "using an existing microsoft account" which it then tells me is a protected domain and cannot be used. I have tried using an alias or clicking "use a different email" which then says
 cannot be done at this time and to try back later, over and over. I cant download apps or access many of the things I bought the laptop for, for me and my daughter for Christmas. This is beyond frustrating and I cannot imagine how a company like Microsoft
 can create an impossible situation for all of its new users! That's crazy! Can someone please help me? It sucks coming to a wall of frustration instead of being able to use my computer. I've tried reading other similar posts with no avail.</p>

    <title>Netflix Audio playback problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin510  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix Audio playback problem</h2>
                    
<p>I"m running windows 7 64bit and use this computer as a home theater PC so I use the Media Center front end on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Netflix used to play back fine, although the video quality is sub-standard compared to the Xbox360 player, so usually I Netflix on my Xbox instead.&nbsp; But for those times I didn't want to switch devices, the media center Netflix player worked fine.</p>
<p>Lately though it doesn't work.&nbsp; The video plays back fine, but the audio is 'chunky'.&nbsp; The only way i can explain it is i'll get a tiny bit of audio, then nothing, then a tiny bit of audio, then nothing so two cycles of that in a 1 second time interval.&nbsp;
 This goes on non-stop and it doesn't matter what i pick out of my Q to watch, it's all the same result.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if a windows update caused this or what but i'd really like to get it fixed.&nbsp; Audio playback in Total Media Theater for MKV and BLuRay is fine, WIndows Media Player also works fine for .avi files both inside the media center front end or launch
 it direct off the desktop.&nbsp; It's just the netflix thing that's messed up.</p>

<p>I figured out the solution on my own.</p>
<p>The problem was an&nbsp;incompatibility between my Xonar sound card and Netflix/Silverlight. &nbsp;You need to pull up the Xonar control panel running in the system tray and click the GX button in the bottom right , if it's green it's on, you want it grey which means
 off.</p>

            If you haven't moved the store folders, Windows Live Mail is stored in the hidden folder C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Account name (and \Storage Folders). You may have to ‘Show hidden files’ in Folder Options to see the files.

<h2>            My Computer Touchscreen used to work, now the driver is missing and I cannot use my touch screen anymore.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Windows 8 computer that I updated to 8.1 roughly about 3-4 months ago and my touchscreen worked fine, and about a week to maybe a few days ago I discovered that my computer was not moving by touching/swiping my screen, the screen is fine,
 no scratches, cleaned off very well. But I cannot activate any hand gestures at all.&nbsp;I know for a fact my computer had touchscreen ability because it came with it and it even showed "Pen and Touch 2 Swipe" (I believe that's what it was). Now when I check my
 PC specs it says "Pen and Touch is not avaliable for display". I want to get my touchscreen back, I've seen quite a few people say I need to reset my PC, but I don't want to lose all of my personal documents, pictures, music, etc. &nbsp;Everything else works fine.
 I checked into my Device Manager and appears that my "HID-compliant touch screen" driver is no where to be seen in the Human Interface Driver tab. As I said I would hate to reset my PC and lose my data, but I need to repair my touchscreen. Appreciate your
 time.<br />

            The only significant changes I have made were minor updates, and installing a few games (virus-free). I installed Windows 10 a month ago, the touchscreen didn't work when I had the Windows 10 update so I reverted back to Windows 8.1 and the touchscreen
 worked again. I don't know what deleted my touchscreen driver, all my programs that I've downloaded are virus free, and safe (according to my Norton Anti-Virus software) Now thinking about it, I'm unsure, maybe my anti-virus deleted my driver while doing a
 routine check up, I'm doubt it.<br />
<br />
After checking my system's model on the manufacturer's website, my PC's model is a&nbsp;C540 All-in-One (Lenovo) 10110 (1 TB of memory and an Intel Pentium CPU G2030 3.00GHz processor)<br />
<br />
I'm still having issues, and my manufacturer's website (Lenovo) doesn't seem to have any touchscreen drivers for Windows 8/8.1

    <title>BSoD error, which is related to ntoskrnl.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabrielthomsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSoD error, which is related to ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have been experiencing some occasional BSoDs, all of them related to ntoskrnl.exe. Two of them were 0x124, while the latest was a 0x101. I already ran Ccleaner in case it was a registry problem, but I doubt it. I also did a BIOS update a couple
 of months ago. My specs are:</p>
<p>Windows 7 x64</p>
<p>CPU: AMD FX-6300</p>
<p>GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7750</p>
<p>Motherboard: Asus M5A78L-M LX3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Bluescreenview, so I'll post the reports here. Thanks for&nbsp; your help.</p>

<div><em><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see

If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though
 it is"possible" that it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
Synopsis:<br />
<em>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</em><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
1)&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong>&nbsp;Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.<br />
2)&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.<br />
3)&nbsp;<strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.<br />
It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.<br />
4)&nbsp;<strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.<br />
5)&nbsp;<strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.<br />
6)&nbsp;<strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong>&nbsp;which can be put through their paces artificially.<br />
The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).<br />
For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)<br />
For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".<br />
Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee that the RAM is
 free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.<br />
7)&nbsp;<strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities,
 updates, or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.<br />
Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.<br />
If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether the machine
 is still free from 0x124 crashes.<br />
Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.<br />
If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.<br />
Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:<br />
8)&nbsp;<strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
Reseat all connectors and memory modules.<br />
Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.<br />
9)&nbsp;<strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.<br />
<br />
 above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

            <p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you are getting BSOD very often, which is related to ntoskrnl.exe error. It could occur due to corrupted drivers or software issue.</p>
<p>Once you receive the blue screen error, are you able to get into the system by restarting it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the below methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1.</p>
<p>Run the fix-it below. It helps to diagnose and fix problems with hardware.<br />
Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows:<br />
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.</p>
<p>If you are still facing the issue, then boot into safe mode and check again.</p>
<p>Start your computer in safe mode: <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></strong></p>
<p>

<p>Unsure why you would come to a Microsoft 'Windows 7" forum for issues with "winrar"...&nbsp; Your symptoms sound like some antivirus software erasing the executable due to possible infestation/infection possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My outside suggestion: get and utilize 7-Zip.&nbsp; Free, does what WinRAR does plus a whole lot more.</p>

    <title>BIOS sees my new HDD, but Windows 7 doesn&#39;t. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BIOS sees my new HDD, but Windows 7 doesn&#39;t.</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I just did a fresh, successful install of Windows 7 Pro. Very happy with it.<br />
<br />
The boot drive is a 80GB SATA drive, residing on SATA port 0.<br />
<br />
I also have a DVD+-RW sitting on SATA1.<br />
<br />
No problems with either of these following Windows 7 installation.<br />
<br />
I decided I wanted to add more storage, so I bought a new Seagate 1.5TB SATA drive. I completed the physical installation of the drive, connected it to the next available SATA port (SATA2).<br />
<br />
I turned the machine on, went into BIOS, turned on SATA2 in BIOS, saved the settings, and booted as normal. I saw a notification window from the task bar indicating the driver for the new HD installed successfully.<br />
<br />
However, The new drive does not show up anywhere in Windows 7 - not in the device manager, not in the control panel, not in drivemanger.msc, nowhere I would expect to see it.<br />
<br />
I powered down, powered back up and went into BIOS. BIOS reports that there's a nice 1.5TB SATA drive installed on SATA2.<br />
<br />
How is it that BIOS can see it, but Windows 7 can't? Any advice on how to get this working so Windows 7 can use it? System is functioning perfectly otherwise.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            Usually a new disk must be initialized and formated to show in Computer.<br />
<br />
Go to disk management. (right cick on Compter and select manage, then disk management.)<br />

<p>
</p><p>Do I need to reinstall photo gallery, or is there something else that I need to do to solve this problem?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've had a similar problem. After installing Windows 10, I thought it was garbage, so I reverted back to Windows 7. I have tried opening photos in Photo Gallery &amp; I get the error code 0x8000000a. I have also found all my emails were triplicated &amp; shredded,
 making them useless. There is nothing useful on the Microsoft website to help with fixing this problem &amp;&nbsp;having arranged a call back from&nbsp;Microsoft I found it a complete waste of time. Microsoft's representative kept telling me that Microsoft no longer supported
 Live applications anymore, even though that was not the problem &amp; eventually hung up on me. The only references I have found elsewhere to error code 0x8000000a are from third party software, trying to sell me their products to fix the problem - why should
 I pay for a fix that is Microsoft's responsibility?</p>

            <p>Have at last got a stable system with Photogallery working. Window10x64.</p>
<p>Upgraded and PG started with error 80070057.</p>
<p>Have re-install a couple of times to no avail. Have at last got it to work. Uninstalled PG, Used the windows10 iso to do an update install (Repair), this worked well but was time consuming. Re-installed and just the same but it did give me the clue PG error
 "no disc in drive", then 80070057. Did it all again and made sure the DVD drive was empty before I installed/ran PG. Seems to work fine now.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, PhotoGallery re-installs&nbsp;OK and Windows10 repair works well too.</p>

            <p>Thank&nbsp; you for taking the trouble to respond. Unfortunately, this won't help my problem as I don't want Windows 10 &amp; this is a different error. The error I am getting is in Windows 7 which appears to have been corrupted in the process of reinstallation.
 I have also found that&nbsp;the link with my data disk has been broken &amp; I am unable to open files from my main hard drive,&nbsp;so&nbsp;it looks as though I will have to do a complete reinstallation of Windows 7. Thanks again anyway.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro pen input commits with new stroke - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teylyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro pen input commits with new stroke</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using OneNote on my Surface Pro from the start and was very happy with it. Today I updated from 8.1 (where things were working just fine) to the 8.1 update and I also installed Office 2013 Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the stylus does not work properly in the pen input panel. &nbsp;I start writing a word, but as soon as I lift the pen and start a new stroke, &nbsp;the strokes I have just written are inserted into the document. For example, I write the vertical stroke of the
 letter t, then lift the pen and touch the glass to write the cross stroke, but as soon as the pen tip touches the glass, the vertical stroke is inserted into the document as an l.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the first stroke has been exercised, the blue "Insert" button appears and it seems that the next stroke will execute the insert command automatically (instead of continuing to write the text and wait for the user to tap the "Insert" button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens in all Desktop and all Metro apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pen input has become unusable. What do I need to check / change / repair to get the normal stylus pen behaviour back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas welcome.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            ip address problem</h2>
                    <p>I recently added a Raspberry Pi II running Kodi to my home network.</p>
<p>It has 192.168.1.93 as&nbsp;IP address and the name OPENELEC</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried the Web interface it couldn't reach it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to ping the address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ping returned a destination host not reachable but on IP address 192.168.1.119.</p>
<p>Turns out this is the IP-address of the machine running the ping command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second machine on the same network running Windows 10 and on that machine everything is OK, so it's not a router or firewall problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can resolve this?</p>
<p>

            You must have a wireless network in order to connect to WiFi. Wireless networks are created with a device called "Access Point", which could be a stand-alone box, or built into a router, switch or modem.

<p>
</p><p>Almost all <strong>laptop </strong>computers have a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; The same is not true for
<strong>desktop</strong> or tower computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type Device Manager in the Search box, and press Enter.&nbsp; Double-click on "Network adapters."&nbsp; List the complete names of
<strong>ALL </strong>of the items in this category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the back of your computer.&nbsp; Is there an antenna there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a wireless network adapter -- which likely is the case -- you'll have to buy one.&nbsp; The simplest solution is to get a USB wireless network adapter like one of these:&nbsp;

<p>You can use a desktop computer wirelessly even if it has not such built-in facility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way is to buy a USB wireless networking device.&nbsp; You can buy on for about $20.&nbsp; TP-link's 300 unit works well for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, as Fredrik said, you first have to have a wireless network that you can connect to.&nbsp; Typically, the modem your internet service provider gives you have wireless facilities built-in, but they must be activated and set up.&nbsp; That setup will allow
 you to set your network name (SSID) and password to protect your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then your desktop PC must be relatively close to that modem/router so that it can pick up a signal.&nbsp; These signals are rather weak and are easily interfered with by other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want further information, just provide more details.</p>

            your system may not have a wireless network card. look up model and make on the net, if brand x, look at the motherboard make and model for built in wireless, if you have it look at device manager in the control panel for a wireless driver and if you do,
 go to network and sharing center....click on Change adapter settings and see if you have a wireless adapter that's unable and enable it by right clicking it menu.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Media Player won&#39;t burn CDs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windows_has_flaws  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t burn CDs</h2>
                    Hi. I have been burning CDs with Windows Media Player for the past year. Suddenly, about two months ago, Windows Media Player started acting funny. When I tried to burn a CD, it only prepared the tracks and then said "burn complete", but did not actually
 burn the files to disc. So now I have been using iTunes and RealPlayer to burn my CDs. However, Windows Media Player has proven to be the fastest and most reliable at this: RealPlayer randomly crashes, and iTunes is just a pain to deal with. I really like
 WMP. Is there anything that can be done to fix this? Any idea of why it's happening in the first place?

            There is no error message at all. All it does is prepare the tracks and say "burn complete" without actually burning the files. Actually, when it's doing this, it says 50% complete by the time it has prepared half of the tracks.
<br />
Also, I have error correction already off and adjusting the burn speed did nothing.<br />

            There should be... it can be hidden - either click <strong>'organize' - 'layout'
</strong>and from the dialogue box select <strong>'show menu bar' </strong>- it will appear top left and includes
<strong>'tools'</strong>, or alternatively if you do not want the menu bar on display right click in space on the very top blue bar (to the right of where it says library... etc.) - Ric.

            I can only respond to what has been asked! I need to know what happens when you try to burn a disc before I can hope to offer more relevant advice. Often disc burning problems occur simply because the lens in the optical drive needs a clean.&nbsp; Does your
 pc load rip and play CD's&nbsp;no problem? If none of these operations are functional then the optical drive may indeed need cleaning or even replacing - or there&nbsp;may be&nbsp;some kind of systemic issue, but more specific info will help. - R.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot pin the favorites to the taskbar. <span>I suggest you to post your valuable suggestions in Windows feedback app. So, that developers will try to implement it in future Windows 10 Builds to enhance user experience&nbsp;</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Start</strong> , enter the phrase <strong>Windows Feedback</strong>, then select Windows Feedback.</span></li><li><span>See if someone else has given similar feedback by entering the topic, such as Microsoft Music.</span></li><li><span>If you find similar feedback, select it, add any details, then select <strong>
Me too.</strong></span></li><li><span>To narrow your search to a specific category, pick the category that most closely matches your feedback (so it gets to the right people quickly). For example, for feedback about the Music app, select Apps &gt; Music.</span></li><li><span>If you don’t find any similar feedback, select <strong>New feedback</strong>, and choose a topic from
<strong>Select a category</strong> and then Select a subcategory. </span></li><li><span>Enter your feedback (the more details the better!), add a screenshot if you can, and you're done.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us for any issues pertaining in the future. We will be happy to help.</span></span></p>
