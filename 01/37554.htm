            Unfortunately, WMP 12 doesn't seem to support release years before 1900.

<h2>            BSOD drives me crazy &#33;   NTFS Filesystem &#47; Memory Management &#47; System Service Exception</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit (home use license) and the bluescreens drive me crazy! It usually happens a) when I am watching TV using Media Center or b) when I wipe data on SD card or connected USB stick or when I even try to rename a file there.
 It mostly happens minimum once a day, but sometimes more often. And there have been some days without any bluescreen after bios update.<br />
<br />
My mainboard is a Asus P6T SE, I got 12 GB RAM, 3x 1 TB hdds, bequiet power supply and a Zotac GTX260 graphics card. A wacom graphics tablet, two DVB-T sticks from Terratec, and a USB/card reader are also connected. Everything got newest drivers from the manufacturers
 support page except the card reader, which was installed by Windows.<br />
<br />
Software in use is Adobe Photoshop CS4 Design Standard, Terratec Home Cinema and Windows Media Center, Firefox, Xampplite. My firewall and antivirus software is Comodo Internet Security. I am using Comodo Backup and Comodo System Cleaner, too. I suspect the
 Media Center / Terratec Home Cinema or Comodo Backup. But I am pretty sure I got bluescreens before installing Comodo Backup.<br />
<br />
I already tried to install Windows 7 again (clean install) but I got bluescreens again. Then I tried to check my hardware, stress tested the CPU and RAM but everything seems ok. One after the other I took RAM out to see if it's the RAM. But I can't figure out
 the problem. Then, finally, I noticed that there is a bios update for my board. I updated the bios and everything seems to work properly first. But after a few days (I don't know if it was just luck) I got bluescreens again. Now I don't know what to do anymore.
 It seems to be the only solution to either downgrade to XP or use any other OS. But - beside the bluescreens - I like Windows 7. And I can't use Ubuntu for example for my work.
<br />
<br />
Right now I think that the problem is the card reader or its driver AND I don't know what else. Notice that I didn't experience any problems with Ubuntu, but I should mention that I didn't use ist exceedingly. The next thing I will do is NOT to use SD card
 or USB stick or use it on a different USB port. But this anyway seems only to be part of the solution - if at all.
<br />
<br />
Here are some minidumps. I used bluescreen view to read it and only copied the drivers found in the crash stack to keep it short. As I am not a professional (just a geek), I feel overwhelmed by this problem. The minidumps are just from today!<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
<strong>edit:</strong> I uploaded the ntbtlog.txt and zipped minidump files to my skydrive: http://cid-d1d7f442a5b447bc.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public?uc=2<br />
<br />
<strong>edit2</strong> : According to the ntbtlog some drivers are not loaded, ndproxy.sys and srv.sys. Since I still have the windows.old folder I looked there and found these two drivers there but not in the actual system at c:\Windows\system32\drivers. Does
 it work when I just copy the drivers? Suprisingly, I found a lot of drivers in windows.old which I don't find in my actual windows. For example the wacom drivers. But the graphics tablet works, although there is an error message in the event log. What if I
 just copy all the drivers from my old windows installation, if needed or not?<br />
<br />

            The problem could still be related to Comodo software, specifically the cmdguard.sys.<br />
<br />
However there are other potential problematic drivers on the system, so at this point you may want to turn on the Driver Verifier against all non-Microsoft drivers to stress test them and try to weed out a problematic driver:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; type<em> verifier</em>&nbsp;in the Search programs and files box and press "Enter" &gt; Create standard settings &gt; Next &gt; Select driver names from a list &gt; then select all non-Microsoft drivers &gt; Finish<br />
<br />
Restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Continue to use the computer normally but if you experience any BSODs make available the&nbsp;minidump files.<br />
<br />
If after enabling the Driver Verifier and restarting the computer you receive a BSOD on startup and cannot start Windows, restart the computer in "Safe Mode" and do the following:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; type<em> verifier</em>&nbsp;in the Search programs and files box and press "Enter"&nbsp;&gt; Delete existing settings &gt; Finish<br />
<br />
Restart the computer, log into Normal Mode, and make available any resulting minidump file.

<h2>            One or more network protocols are missing</h2>
                    <p>Since Window 8, I have been dealing with this problem. Several days ago, I upgraded to window 10 and the problem still exist. I tried to upgrade the driver system and the problem still exist. The old driver is Realtek RTL8723BE.&nbsp;I tried to ping default gateway
 in cmd and the response is lost.</p>
<p>After that I have bought a new driver which is ASUS AC55 which I can use 5 ghz o connect to the internet. This time I tried to ping the default gateway , both driver share the same gateway and can connect to the internet. I can only access to internet if
 I use the ASUS driver. I would like to know what should be done if &nbsp;I want to the Realtek driver to connect to internet. Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Kiran,</p>
<p>i have tried your method but it is not working. Actually I can link to other wifi without problem but when I try to connect wifi at my home (router archer c7), my computer wifi is not working. When I try to diagnose the problem using window help, it said
 I my computer cannot use network protocol. </p>
<p>Sometimes when I successfully connect to the Internet with the help of window diagnose, a few minutes later I cannot use the wifi again. I still have wifi signal showing a I am connected to wifi, however I could not use the Internet and chrome show" dns
 probe finished no internet".</p>
<p>I am not sure why this problem is happening, hope you can help me to solve it thanks.</p>

<h2>            Can I Uninstall Pre installed Programs&#63;</h2>
                    This is what annoys me about IOS. Can I uninstall programs like office or Xbox music that came pre installed on surface? Things like office take up a ton of space. For example, I never use Excel or OneNote. Could i uninstall those, but not PP or Word?
 Could i uninstall Xbox Music? (I don't listen to stored music) Just a question to those who actually have the tablet.

            Hi Nathan,
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, these apps cannot currently be uninstalled, as they are integrated within the tablet's OS. Even so, we're using a version of Office 2013 designed specifically for Surface RT that is not bloated in size.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, Xbox Music does more than just play stored music as it also syncs to the cloud and can play music stored there as well. I believe it also handles different media functions (e.g., music, video, etc.) on the tablet as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One final thought is that if you're worried about storage space, I'd suggest taking advantage of the MicroSDXC slot on your RT tablet. I did and I now have a total of 128 GB (64 GB tablet with a 64 GB MicroSDXC card). There's some excellent sales on the
 cards for the Christmas season.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!<br />
David</div>

<p>Normally such disk should not be defragged but in Windows 8.1 system is it safe and better to leave as is originally on ?</p>

            <p>Hi Ewa, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The automatic disk defragmentation run by periodical system maintenance run automatically by Windows is fine, you should not stop that. However, there is no need to run manual optimization and disk defragmentation on SSD, doing that does not improve the
 performance anyways. Your current drive optimization settings seems to fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do feel free to post on the forum, if you have any more concern related to Windows. We will be happy to assist you again.</p>
<p>

<p>Folloed by this error</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Windows cannot access the file C:\Windows\System32\NlsData0026.dll for one of the following reasons: there is a problem with the network connection, the disk that the file is stored on, or the storage drivers installed on this computer; or the disk is missing.
 Windows closed the program Microsoft Windows Search Indexer because of this error.</p>
<p>Program: Microsoft Windows Search Indexer</p>
<p>File: C:\Windows\System32\NlsData0026.dll</p>
<p>The error value is listed in the Additional Data section.</p>

<p>User Action</p>

<p>1. Open the file again. This situation might be a temporary problem that corrects itself when the program runs again.</p>

<p>2. If the file still cannot be accessed and</p>

<p>- It is on the network, your network administrator should verify that there is not a problem with the network and that the server can be contacted.</p>

<p>- It is on a removable disk, for example, a floppy disk or CD-ROM, verify that the disk is fully inserted into the computer.</p>

<p>3. Check and repair the file system by running CHKDSK. To run CHKDSK, click Start, click Run, type CMD, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type CHKDSK /F, and then press ENTER.</p>

<p>4. If the problem persists, restore the file from a backup copy.</p>

<p>5. Determine whether other files on the same disk can be opened. If not, the disk might be damaged. If it is a hard disk, contact your administrator or computer hardware vendor for further assistance.</p>

<p>Additional Data</p>

<p>Error value: C0000185</p>

            <p>You agree with me that windows update come every now and then, :-), I don't remember adding anything special.</p>
<p>I ra, the CHKDSK /F on the C drive, rebooted, it didn't discover any corruption. I was not aware of the 2nd command to run SFC...</p>
<p>As a start, as far as it was a win 7 dll, I uninstalled Win7 SP1, re-installed hoping it will correct the corrupt file, didn't work</p>
<p>Anyway, what I did, got rid of the file NlsData0026.dll , took owbership, deleted it and replaced it with the same file from one of my other Win 7 machines, and HOOP, Search services started working again, waited for a couple of hours, my index was rebuilt
 and my lap again working correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your recommandation STEP1, I did it also but it didn't discover the issue, I had green signals everywhere, with a link (search for other solutions ) which landed me in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question now : what does this file NlsData0026.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;do ? why Search services needed access to this file where it is not included in the search directories? 3rd, if it is corrupt, why the troubleshooter or reapplying SP1 didn't correct the problem.</p>
<p>I would appreciate responses to those questions and thanks in advance</p>

<p><span>Nlsdata0026.dll originates from software’s you installed on the computer. Since most applications store data in the computer’s registry, it is likely
 that the registry has suffered fragmentation and accumulated invalid entries which may be affecting the computer performance.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are trying to set permissions for C drive?<br />
<div><br />
If you want to lock the hard drives from being accessed through a standard or a guest account, you could do that by logging into the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-an-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">administrator account</a> and perform
 the following.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open the "computer" folder then right-click the drive you want to limit access to.<br />
b. Select Properties<br />
c. On the properties box, go to the Security Tab.<br />
d. You will see a list of users and groups that can access this drive.<br />
e. Edit this list and take out everything except:</div>
<div><br />
» Administrators<br />
» System<br />
» Your username</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might also have to take ownership of this disk - but you will be asked that question automatically if it is necessary.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            How do I run a windows 10 app off an external drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently, I have been moving games to an external drive to conserve space and to take them on the go. One of the games is Forza Horizon 3, a Windows Store app, which was moved by the Move function in Settings. It's been relocated to the external drive,
 but I'm not sure how to run it anymore. Originally, I used the provided shortcut, but it says that it doesn't find the game, because it was moved. I cannot execute the main .exe file because of permission settings (although I'm not sure why). How do I run
 it now, or how do I create a shortcut to the new location? Can someone tell me how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To create a desktop shortcut to any .exe file, right-drag it to the desktop. When you release the mouse button, choose "Create shortcuts here."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't know anything about that game, so I don't know whether that shortcut will work, nor whether the moved exe file will work. Most programs can not be moved, because there are many important references to the exe file and its location, in the registry
 and elsewhere. If you move an exe file, all those references will be wrong.</p>

<p>When I run the .exe file, I get the message "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access this item." I have the appropriate permissions, allowed Read and Read &amp; Execute.<br />
</p>
<p>Edit: All program files were moved, including the AppData, so there should be no incorrect references. Also, the .exe execution didn't work before in the previous location, so I used the provided shortcut.</p>

<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />To resolve issues with camera or sound in Skype, I suggest that you follow the method recommended by Microsoft: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12097/troubleshooting-issues-with-skype-call-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12097/troubl...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! If this still persists, please let me know. 
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

<p>Hi Margarida,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately none of this helps. I'd been fine before updating Skype to 8.45.0.43. Now connection hangs and doesn't fully allow the exchange of video. Our internet is fine, the laptop is plugged in at the mains, nothing else is running, and all system updates
 have been done. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I suspect this relates to the known issue... "Skype isn't launching properly on Mac OS 10.14 Mojave". I would LOVE a fix for this.</p>

<p>I understand that you are having an issue regarding the attachments that you are sending. I will be glad to assist you.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way of isolating this issue is to send the same email to yourself and see if this issue is also apparent on your end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this issue is only happening in one contact, then the issue lies upon his/her email account. It's best that you inform him/her so that this issue can be rectified on his/her end.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if this issue is happening in all of your contacts, <span>
I need you to provide some information for us to investigate. For some security reasons, I created a private message area where you could provide the information needed. Please also reply to this post confirming that you have provided the needed information.</span></p>

Hi Sergs P.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens to all contact. I have tried sending an email to my self and it happens. The only time it doesn't happen is, when I send an email though my internet provider's site.</p>
<p>I had my internet technician look into it and he hasn't seen this before, also contacted Microsoft and they couldn't rectify the problem.</p>
<p>Why does it only happen when I scan a document?</p>
<p>If I attach a document such as a word document it's ok?</p>

<p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Cathryn S</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are having an issue regarding the attachments that you are sending. I will be glad to assist you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way of isolating this issue is to send the same email to yourself and see if this issue is also apparent on your end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this issue is only happening in one contact, then the issue lies upon his/her email account. It's best that you inform him/her so that this issue can be rectified on his/her end.

Hi all who responded to my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After contacting my internet provider again, the issue has been resolved. </p>
<p>Firstly it was no fault through my internet provider. My problem had to do with my windows live mail account settings which my internet provider resolved for me over the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I asked them how could this have happened, they explained that sometimes when there&nbsp;has been updates it can throw some settings, and this is exactly what had happened.
</p>
<p>Everything was working fine up until approx. 2 months back, and I didn't touch any settings on my windows live mail account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A big thank you to my internet provider Do Do, and especially Mel who was patient enough to help with this resolution.</p>

<h2>            C&#43;&#43; Runtime Error&#33; R6034 &#40;READ REPLIES&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have been working with SVP13, trying to install effects. I looked up a brief video on how to get the effects to appear, and I deleted then re-made registry keys for that program. This did not effect my computer's performance or any other programs
 at all. To no avail that this didn't work, so I decided to reinstall Preset Manager 1.0 and SVP13.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Before I reinstalled, I tried changing the VST checking folder directory, which is a feature that allows SVP13 to check for extra VST's to use that didn't originally come with the program. I changed all three available to various folders, which might
 be a problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reinstalled it, the image came up here:</p>
<p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=d5ae8445efeb2264!1224&amp;authkey=!AG3zSV-rNs8AZHI&amp;ithint=folder%2ctxt</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happened, I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Running as administrator</p>
<p>2. Chkdsk /r</p>
<p>3. sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sfc scannow did not fix the issue, though other minor dll files were fixed, even when I had no problem with those fixed dll files before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Look at the image, it says something about C++ Library?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a new Steam game that day that I believe installed two new C++ redistrutables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that might have made it stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted those two new ones and still the same error shown in the image came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But look at the image. It says something about, "Sfvstserver.exe"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and said it was made by Sony, and was located in the system32 folder? I did not find the executable in there. The executable also has to do with opening and running VST plugins for Sony Vegas, in which I also researched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Also included in the shared public folder link is the Event Log I have received shortly after trying to open SVP13.&nbsp;</strong>I see that there are "attached" files. I'm not sure if they are critical for the program that might be missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Where can I redownload sfstvserver.exe?</p>
<p>2. Is there any more stronger ways of finding crash errors other than Event Log? Or is that&nbsp;<strong>all you guys need?</strong></p>
<p>3. Can someone help me fix this problem? I would want to refrain from doing a System Restore.</p>
<p>4. What .NET Framework version does SVP13 need?</p>
<p>5. What C++ Redistribute does SVP13 need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you guys if you are able to help me!</p>

<h2>            Touchscreen isn&#39;t working with Windows 10</h2>
                    I have the HP Pavilion 360 and since I upgraded to Windows 10, the touchscreen doesn't respond at all, even in tablet mode. I really kind of hate Windows 10 and would like to go back to 8, especially if I can't use my touchscreen.

    <title>Windows 7 fails to recognize a 16Gig SDHC card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wee dynes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 fails to recognize a 16Gig SDHC card</h2>
                    Recently formatted and installed Windows 7 - have had trouble with reading my camera's SDHC card either via the usb cable to the PC or using the card reader.<br />
It reads a 1Gig SD card ok.<br />
The card reader and the camera connected via the usb cable was fine under Vista, so it appears to be an operating system hiccup somewhere.
<br />
I've checked out several forums, downloaded several supposed fixes without success.<br />
Any help would be most appreciated

<p>Hi wee Dynes,</p>
<p>If your computer's internal card reader works with 2GB (or lower) SD cards but fails to read a 4GB (or higher) SDHC card, then the computer's internal reader is not SDHC compliant.</p>
<p>This same logic also applies to digital cameras, if the digital camera reads 2GB (or lower) SD cards but fails to read a 4GB (or higher) SDHC card, then the digital camera is not SDHC compliant.</p>
<p>SD and SDHC specifications</p>
<p>• The initial SD card specification defined the interface for cards only up to 2GB capacity. The subsequent SDHC specification was developed to provide increased capacity of 4GB – 32GB cards. Computers and other products purchased before 2008 may not be
 SDHC compatible. Computers and other products purchased before 2007 are not SDHC compatible.</p>
<p>• ImageVerifying the card reader slot<br />
• If the card reader slot on your computer does not have the SDHC logo, it is most likely not SDHC compatible and will only read cards up to 2GB capacity.</p>
<p>Other options you can use to read files on your SDHC card</p>
<p>1) You can connect your camera (or other device) that works with SDHC to your computer using a USB cable that came with the camera. You should be able to transfer files to the computer this way.</p>
<p>2) You can contact you computer manufacturer to see if they have a free firmware update for your model that will make it SDHC compatible.</p>

            Thanks Varun J<br />
So are you saying that even though this worked last week when I was running Vista that because my hardware is possibly outdated, putting Windows 7 on was bound to fail?<br />
I have tried connecting the camera to the PC via the usb cable and this too fails; I have put the latest bios on the machine; I have the latest motherboard drivers.<br />
I still remain at a loss why it worked last week either via the usb cable or card reader, yet fails once I installed Windows 7...<br />
Thanks again anyhow Varun J

            Before I installed SP1 on my&nbsp; one year old 32&nbsp; bit win7 pro computer, it recognized and downloaded images from my Nikon cameras and from my Kodak ESP7 printer when I plugged the sdhc card into it.&nbsp; Now, it does not even see the sdhc card.&nbsp; My older laptop
 running XP Pro has no such problems,&nbsp; I am confident that SP1 has something to do with this.&nbsp; Does Micro$oft have a solution?<br />

It doesn't apear to help anythng. I have had to stop taking downloads/updates from MS... these downloads....absolutely screw up settings, damage existing files/programs that were workng perfectly. The key sales pitch for win-7 and Vista and XP claimed to allow you to open (implied) as many programs or files, but thats not true we get the ghost white pages that you can see through but your input is locked up. If you have 5-6 programs open or pages in the same program you musy either wait a long time for them to stop working on each page and then close one page at a time or a forced shutdowwn that always reopens with a proble it didn't have previously. So I stop taking the updates/downloads and then you  MS does something to basicly force me to accept a down load that MS is forsing me to take and they won'support their product here in USA. 


I am tired a MS not taking 2,3,4,5-yrs to get windows running at 99% eficiency and then verrify it by poles OF ALL OWNERS, not just passing the peeograms ar

            By default, Windows 7 will not display any removable media drive, in the Computer section, if the media is "empty."<br />
<br />
As for your camera, you would probably need to install a driver in order for Windows 7 to see the media card.<br />
<br />
And the following should be noted:<br />
<br />
1) SD cards are 2 GB or less<br />
2) SDHC cards are 4GB to 32GB <br />
3) SDXC cards start at 64GB.<br />

<p><span>Hey I appreciate
<span><span>Maverick81</span><span><span> response.<br />
<br />
I have few thoughts to add to this.</span></span></span></span><span><br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. What version of Operating system are you running (Windows Vista or XP)?<br />
</span><span><br />
2. Try adding iTunes into the DEP’s exception list [Data Execution Prevention].<br />
<br />
Here are the steps below to add program to DEP exception list:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Start, right-click Computer, and choose Properties.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the Window that appears, click on Advanced System Settings (on the left panel).</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the first box that says Performance, click on the Settings button.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the Window that opens, click on the Data Execution Prevention tab at the top.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>5. You will see an ‘exceptions box’ in the middle of that window. Click on the Add button and navigate to C: Drive, then Program
 Files, then the iTunes folder, and then choose the iTunes exe.</span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6. Add the exception and click OK on the DEP window.

<h2>            Windows 10 firewall notification</h2>
                    <p>There doesn't seem to be a way of turning off notifications for Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>The usual place "Change Notification settings" in the Windows Firewall Control panel item takes me to the "Turn Windows Firewall on or off".&nbsp; Is there somewhere else I should be looking?</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>Though I am an adult (well over 40) I still cannot download the "Shadow Fight 2" game on my Windows 10 laptop. Every time I try to install it, I get a weird error that "This product is rated for kids older than you'"!!! How is this possible?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Deepak,<br />
<br />
There are several factors that are causing this issue. For proper isolation, kindly answer the queries below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your Microsoft account added to the <strong>Family Safety features</strong>?</li><li>Have you tried checking your <strong>birth date</strong> on your Microsoft account?</li><li>Any recent changes made to your Microsoft account or on the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done to resolve the issue?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have added my account to the "Family Safety Features".</p>
<p>My DOB is correct.</p>
<p>I haven't done any changes in my account or on this laptop in a while.</p>
<p>I didn't take any troubleshooting steps till now as I don't know what to do!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One key information is, when I bought this laptop, initially I had it set up only for my son (who is 9 years old) and who is part of the "Family". After a few days, I added my account on this laptop. Not sure if that has caused this weird behavior. But I
 just realize that even on XBOX, my account is not accepted as an adult!! I think there is something certainly wrong with my account and don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Deepak.</p>

<p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your quick response to Romel Ram's query. We understand that you wanted to get the issue resolved. It was mentioned in your reply that the laptop was initially set up for your only son who is 9 years old, may we verify if the account you have
 used to sign in to the PC is your son's account? If so, we recommend that you remove your son's account; use your own Microsoft account to log in on the PC; then install the "Shadow Fight 2" game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your response to the solution will be highly appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a bit surprising and weird way of solving this problem. Can't I have two accounts set up on the laptop, one that of a child and another that of an adult? That is what I have done in fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I initially set up only my son's account, later I added my account and I could log-in to my MS account on that laptop. I was attempting to install the game using my account and it is still not allowing me. I have doubts that for some reason, in some
 settings, I am not recognized as an adult!</p>

<p>We understand that you wanted to get the issue resolved. For case isolation, we strongly recommend that you remove your son's account, for it may be set up as the primary account; log in to your account; install the game; then add back your son's account.
 We also suggest that you check if your account has admin privileges. You may refer to the article below for guidance.
