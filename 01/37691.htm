<h2>            Rolling back a file association - .CFG to notepad back to Unknown</h2>
                    
<p>Hi<br />
I was trying to edit a .CFG file and when I opend it, the file was not recognised and I was asked by windows to choose a file to open it with. I forgot to unclick the file associaiton so now all my .CFG files looke like note pad!<br />
How do I alter this back to the original state?<br />
<br />
I tried going back into 'open with' and unchecking it and it didn't seem to change the icon in the document window representing the .CFG file</p>
<p>I've a brand new laptop and I'm really worried that i've done some damage =(</p>

<p>Hi wingnut_62,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>CFG files can be opened with either notepad or wordpad.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to choose the program you would prefer to use. You can change this setting for an individual file, or you change this setting so Windows opens all files of the same type in the software program you choose.</p>
<p>1. Open the folder that contains the file you want to change.</p>
<p>2. Right-click the file you want to change and then, depending on the type of file, either click Open with or point to Open with and then click Choose default program.</p>
<p>3. Click the program you want to use to open the file.</p>
<p>4. Do one of the following:</p>
<p><strong>·</strong>&nbsp; If you want all files of that type to open in the same software program, select the Always use the selected program to open this kind of file check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p><strong>·</strong>&nbsp; If you want only that file to open in the software program this one time, clear the Always use the selected program to open this kind of file check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Access the link below to know more and fix the file association issue and to open the file using a default program:</p>

                    I purchased windows 8.1 in Lenovo G50-70 series laptop two years ago and last year I upgraded it to windows 10 in my laptop. Sound driver was working correctly till before upgrade it to win 10 but now sometimes I am not able to hear any sound in headphones\earphones
 but it works correctly when I don't use headphones. This is irritating for me because I like to use headphones mostly. Please provide me some help. &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and now I'm able to use my earphone\headphone. But I just want to know about one more thing which is - in Windows 8.1 I had "Dolby digital" software but now I'm not able to locate it in the "Control Panel" but after checking the "Programs
 and features", I'm able to find it in the list. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please inform me why I'm not able to locate the software in my system after reinstalling the software in compatibility mode. I'll be waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards,</p>

</p><p>As most of the software’s which are installed will be visible in the program files in C: drive. Hence I would suggest you to check if the file is visible in the C: drive. I would also suggest you to type the software in the Search bar and then check if it
 is visible.</p>

    <title>Satellite C55 Update 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian hepple  say:</h3>
<h2>            Satellite C55 Update 1809</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite C55 C running windows 10 Home</p>
<p>
</p><p>It installs updates up to 1803 but has never been able to update 1809. When I check for updates it reports "all up to date" !!!!. It has tried to upgrade 1890 but always results in an automatic repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually downloaded the .iso using update assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean repair but the issue persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my drivers but cannot update the Trusted Engine Interface driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems this is a intel driver but "customised" by a third party.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toshiba itself has outsourced ? driver uploads and eventually found the recommended one but this did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise this may not be the problem but there seems to be little advice available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope you can help as it has slightly unhinged me over recent moths :]</p>

            Hi Ian 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 1809 through Media creation tool. Execute the below steps to go to 1809 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Disable any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can enable it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Try the Intel driver support utility to see if it’ll update the Intel software:
<br /><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>
<br />The PC may not be compatible with the latest version of Windows 10 (1809) so you’ll have to stay with 1803.

</p><p>I'm an IT admin for a small business and we've deployed Surface Pro tablets w/ docks to most of our employees.&nbsp; We're still using 1st generation Surface Pros for the most part, but we picked up a Surface Pro 3 last year for a new employee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading the Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10, system stability in sleep/connected standby went down the tubes, especially when the machine was connected to the dock.&nbsp; It was always a gamble whether the machine would wake up without a forced restart and
 when docked and in connected standby, the fans would also turn on full blast and the system would heat up until it was too hot to touch.&nbsp; Additionally, when the machine would wake up from this state, there would usually be a low memory warning displayed on
 the desktop.&nbsp; However, the task manager would show normal memory usage when opened.&nbsp; Looking in the event viewer, there would be multiple 'resource-memory-exhaustion' events, followed by many system and application errors.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the processes with
 the 'highest' memory usage noted in the logs were using minuscule amounts of memory.&nbsp; (Possibly due to compressed memory not being reported?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may expect, this would usually place the system in an unstable or just plain broken state after waking, necessitating a reboot.&nbsp; When docked, this would also usually scramble the multiple monitor settings into a random configuration, which would persist
 even after a reboot and had to be reset manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, annoyingly, turning off sleep when on AC power appears to have no effect on connected standby, as it will still enter that state, ignoring the setting in the Power control panel applet.&nbsp; The only other option would be to disable sleep/CS altogether.&nbsp;
 That said, our users are very mobile and need sleep/CS to be available when they're away from AC power, so that is not a viable option for us.&nbsp; I also can't ask the user to unplug the Surface from the dock every time he walks away from his desk, as that's
 ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran multiple sleep study reports on the machine using the powercfg utility.&nbsp; When docked and entering connected standby, the CPU usage climbs up to 100% and stays there until the machine is woken up by the user.&nbsp; The offenders are an unregistered device
 (which may be the Marvell wireless adapter, based on some research) and the USB root hub, both on PCI0.&nbsp; We tried getting a new dock that was the new plug-in type, rather than the old-style device stand dock - no change.&nbsp; We kept it updated with the latest
 driver/firmware updates - no change.&nbsp; We tried the latest Intel beta drivers - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the configuration:&nbsp; It is a Surface Pro 3 (Core i5 w/ 4GB RAM and 128 GB SSD) with Windows 10 (version 1511, with all updates), connected to a Surface Dock, which is connected to a 1080p HP monitor via HDMI and the official Surface-branded DP/HDMI
 adapter, a Microsoft Wireless Desktop keyboard/mouse combo, external speakers and an ethernet cable that's connected to the company's LAN, which is a domain network administered by an old Windows Server 2008 box.&nbsp; Installed programs are the Microsoft Intune
 desktop client, Office 365 Business Premium, Mozilla Firefox, Adobe Flash and Adobe Reader DC, all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That machine, however, is now toast - out of warranty by a month.&nbsp; The repeated thermal abuse that it suffered because of these problems eventually caused the battery to rapidly lose capacity and now the battery cannot hold any charge at all.&nbsp; It is now
 useless to us and we've been quoted a repair price of $450.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, while we decide what to do about that, we got a Surface Pro 4 (with comparable specs to the dead Pro 3) as a replacement and set it up for the user, installed all of the latest firmware/drivers/updates (including the 5/24/2016 driver updates) and...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same exact problems.&nbsp; We've been through multiple docks, multiple (and different) machines and complete resets of the OS.&nbsp; These crippling problems still exist.&nbsp; I did notice that the event viewer keeps throwing out DNS registration errors, so I'm going
 to try turning off DNS registration to see if that's part of the problem.&nbsp; I may also try to tweak network settings and disable various adapters to test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, this shouldn't be happening at all, especially in such a straightforward configuration, and I'm getting increasingly frustrated here, as is the user of the machine.&nbsp; Let me know what additional information or logs I should post as a follow up.&nbsp;
 I'd really appreciate it if someone from Microsoft would contact me and/or help me look into this, as we've already had collateral damage.&nbsp; We would like to continue purchasing and using Microsoft hardware, but we need our hardware to be reliable and our trust
 in those products is quickly being lost here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Good Luck.&nbsp; Many of us have been facing this for many months, although your problem seems much more severe than what I've experienced (which has been bad enough...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find some of the info on this thread helpful - it's really long now - currently at 215 pages, which is where this link will take you to: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfdrivers/surface-pro-4-screen-wont-wake-from-sleep/aed66dc7-289a-4300-a167-ab8394b7df06?page=215</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run an SP4 in a couple of SP3 docks, and have pretty bad results waking, but after the latest 5/24/2016 updates, waking is now fairly reliable when undocked and somewhat unreliable when docke (or docking - undocking seems to be less of a problem...)&nbsp; Before
 that I had an SP3 and after a couple of hardware swaps (bot the SP3 itself, which I think was OK) and a swap of one of the docks, my SP3 became rock solid reliable until its fan failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right that the overheating due to power management issues kills the battery's lifespan - Microsoft seems to be refusing to fix this, and I expect it'll take a class action lawsuit to get them to do the right thing for customers that have suffered
 through their (and Intel's!) inability to make the SP4/SB work as designed and advertised...</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info, John1F and Dub Dublin.&nbsp; I opened a support case today with Business Support and will update the thread with any important information for others that are having the same problems.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, the sleep study reports show that the offending hardware components are the Marvell Wireless-AC adapter, the Surface Ethernet Adapter and a device on the USB xHCI Root Hub, although it sometimes fails to identify the wireless adapter, showing
 'Unregistered Device' in its place, but with the same exact device location.&nbsp; It also shows that LockAppHost.exe uses a lot of juice during most high-usage CS sessions.&nbsp; The real question is whether the root cause is one or more faulty drivers, the OS/software,
 the hardware, or an unholy combination of some sort (which is most likely, unfortunately).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll also keep disabling more Windows features, especially those that debuted in Windows 10, to see if anything helps.&nbsp; That said, I'm not expecting any magic bullet solution.&nbsp; Wish me luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick edit:&nbsp; The offending device on the USB root hub is listed as a 'USB Composite Device' in Device Manager with Vendor ID 045e (which is Microsoft Corporation) and Product ID 0905, Revision 1.&nbsp; Disabling the device caused no immediate ill effects and
 all USB-related peripherals attached to the system and the dock remained in working order, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; So, I'm unsure of exactly what the device is.&nbsp; But, I'll see if disabling that device affects anything else long-term or if it may serve as a
 band-aid temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I talked to support and they'll be sending out a replacement Surface Dock, so we'll see if that helps at all.</p>

            <div>
<p>Here's a follow up, since I've been doing some additional investigating and troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found three serious problems that compound on each other to help create the "Sleep of Death" problem when the following condition is true:&nbsp; The Surface Pro 3 or Pro 4 is connected to a Surface Dock and attempts to enter connected standby.&nbsp; I say "attempts"
 because if you look at the sleep study report of a CS session that resulted in the machine being unable to wake, you'll usually see that 100% of the session was spent in the
<em>No CS Phase</em> state (under <em>PDC Phases</em>), specifically the <em>NoCsPhase.WaitingForSleepTimeout</em> state.&nbsp; The time spent in a low-power state will be 0%.&nbsp; Not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems #1 and #3 may also affect devices when they are not docked, but I haven't tested that scenario yet, as the SP4 in our office tends to enter a low-power state as intended when not docked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem #1:</strong></p>
<p>Hardware/driver problem:&nbsp; Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Adapter</p>
<p>(Compounds when the Surface Ethernet Adapter that resides in the Surface Dock is also connected to a network)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:&nbsp; Constant CPU usage and spurious wakes when in CS session, may also be accompanied by constant DNS registration errors in Event Viewer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identification:&nbsp; Can be identified by running the powercfg utility with the /sleepstudy switch and viewing the report.&nbsp; Under
<em>Fx Devices</em>, it is listed as either&nbsp;<em>Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Adapter \_SB.PCI0.RP09.PXSX</em> or
<em>Unregistered Device \_SB.PCI0.RP09.PXSX</em>, and under <em>Networking</em> as
<em>Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Adapter</em>.&nbsp; It is a problem if it is listed with red text/highlighting and high active time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, under <em>Fx Devices</em>, expand the trees of the <em>USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller (\_SB.PCI0.XHC)
</em>to locate <em>Surface Ethernet Adapter (USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_07C6&amp;REV_3000)</em>, and under
<em>Networking</em>, find <em>Surface Ethernet Adapter</em>.&nbsp; Those entries may also be highlighted in red and show a high active time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround:&nbsp; Go into System -&gt; Power &amp; sleep.&nbsp; Under Wi-Fi, uncheck <em>When plugged in, stay connected to Wi-Fi while asleep</em>.&nbsp; Optionally, if it's a problem when on battery power, also uncheck
<em>On battery power, stay connected to Wi-Fi while asleep</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem #2:</strong></p>
<p>Hardware/driver problem:&nbsp; Surface Dock Audio over USB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:&nbsp; When speakers are connected to the Surface Dock (powered or not) - Very high CPU usage, overheating and thermal-related shutdowns when in CS session</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identification:&nbsp; Can be identified by running the powercfg utility with the /sleepstudy switch and viewing the report.&nbsp; Under
<em>Fx Devices</em>, expand the trees of the <em>USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller (\_SB.PCI0.XHC)
</em>to locate <em>USB Composite Device (USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0905&amp;REV_0001)</em>.&nbsp; It is a problem if it is listed with red text/highlighting and very high active time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround:&nbsp; Disconnect speakers from Surface Dock <em>OR</em> always un-dock the Surface before letting it enter a low-power state
<em>OR</em> connect speakers to the headphone jack on the Surface when it's docked
<em>OR</em> disable the Surface Dock Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable the Surface Dock Audio - With the Surface docked, go to Device Manager, then expand Universal Serial Bus controllers, then use the
<em>Details</em> page of each<em> USB Composite Device</em> to locate the device with a
<em>HardwareID</em> of <em>USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0905&amp;REV_0001</em>.&nbsp; Once you've found it, go to the
<em>Driver</em> page and click on the <em>Disable</em> button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem #3:</strong></p>
<p>OS/software problem:&nbsp; LockAppHost.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:&nbsp; (Usually occurs intermittently) Constant, but moderate CPU usage and moderate to high thermal activity when in CS session, low memory warnings upon wake, system restarts due to BugChecks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identification:&nbsp; Can be identified by running the powercfg utility with the /sleepstudy switch and viewing the report.&nbsp; Look for entries with high
<em>CPU C0 Time</em> and high <em>CPU C0 Time.Non-attributed Time</em>.&nbsp; Then, under that entry's
<em>Srum Data</em> section, expand the <em>Energy Estimation</em> section.&nbsp; If the top entry is
<em>\Device\HarddiskVolume3\Windows\System32\LockAppHost.exe [Username]</em> and the total energy consumed by that process vastly outweighs all other processes, this is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround:&nbsp; To minimize the damage and frustration caused by this problem, go into the Power settings and set the machine to hibernate after 1-2 hours when plugged in and asleep.&nbsp; If it's also a problem when undocked, do the same for battery power.&nbsp; Additionally,
 disabling Windows Hello may alleviate the problem entirely (as it is related to the lock screen), but you'll lose that functionality, of course.<br />
<br />
Also, this may be fixed in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, but I haven't put any Insider builds on this machine, as it's in a production environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Lesser power-suckers:</strong><br />
Cortana<br />
Certain UWP apps:&nbsp; Photos, Messaging, Mail &amp; Calendar</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I hope that helps anyone who is suffering through these problems.&nbsp; Personally, given the other option of overheating and horrible system problems, I prefer having a slightly gimped Surface Pro 4 that will actually reliably wake up when docked.&nbsp; :)</p>

<h2>            High data usage from System</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 Home Edition on a laptop. The System seems to be sucking away tremendous data without my knowledge. I have my Wi-Fi set up as metered (and tried disabling&nbsp;<span>regsvr32.exe which I saw in another forum).
 I can't seem to find any solutions online that solves this. Any ideas on solving this?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Also on a side note it seems my Wi-Fi network is being stolen (notified 3 times that stuff is being torrented, which I never do)... Would there be a possibility that the stolen data is shown as system?</span></p>

            Few things to try here. 
<br />
<br />1: First, Go into start &gt; settings &gt; privacy &gt;background apps and disable them all 
<br />
<br />2: Open start &gt; type problem reports &gt; delete and failed or pending reports 
<br />
<br />3: Do a clean boot:

<br />
<br />4: Open start &gt; type gpedit.msc &gt; enter 
<br />
<br />Located "configure automatic updates" and click it &gt; check enabled option 
<br />
<br />Under options change it to "notify for download and notify for install" apply and ok.

            There is a new Updates sharing feature that works like a torrent in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced Options &gt;  Delivery Optimization.  I'd turn that off to see if it changes anything.

<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.

            Where are these notifications about torrenting coming from?  I've never heard of such a warning.  Is it Defender, your Internet provider, Windows Firewall?  
<br />
<br />What "title" did it say was torrented?  
<br />
<br />Do you have a torrent client installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features?
<br />
<br />Did you check if Windows Updates' Delivery Optimization is turned off?  This is a form of torrenting that your IP could be misinterpreting, but it is also known to cause issues and spiral data usage.

            I would contact your Internet Provider and ask them to check if there is an intruder on your network because you are not torrenting yet got this notice that someone is.  They can find this out. 
<br />
<br />You can also sign into your router settings to see if they provide a page or section to show who exactly is connecting.  I know that Verizon routers do this.

<h3> liareece  say:</h3>
<h2>            Iomegaware Zip 100 drive device not recognized by Windows 8 computer</h2>
                    Please help. I purchased an Iomega 100 zip drive to ONLY retrieve data (pics/files) from a stack of old zip disks. My Lenovo laptop(windows 8) nor my HP Desktop (windows 7) recognize the external usb zip drive.&nbsp; Are there compatible drivers anywhere? I
 spent hours online trying to ascertain/fix the incompatability issues as well as the outdated driver issues&nbsp;without success. The disk provided for installation contains outdated drivers. I'm not a technician. Any assistance would be helpful. I have a working,
 functional external hard drive. I simply want to retrieve the data off the old iomega zip 100 disks. &nbsp;I don't plan to do anything else with the zips or the zip drive. And yes, I should've accomplished this sooner, but as many busy folks know, sometimes time
 can get the better of you.&nbsp;The loss of this data would be at best heart breaking as the disks contain original, irreplaceable data and pictures.

    <title>Multi-Monitor Support in Windows 10 is better in only one way&#59; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew u.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi-Monitor Support in Windows 10 is better in only one way&#59; garbage in several new ways.</h2>
                    <p>A couple years ago, I posted here suggesting that Microsoft allow an option for the entire
<em>information center</em> (on the bottom right of the taskbar) to appear an all taskbars on all displays.&nbsp; Fast forward to today, and the Windows 10 anniversary update gave us the clock on all taskbars.&nbsp; Only the clock.&nbsp; Yay?</p>
<p>
</p><p>An improvement to be sure, but one that still boggles the mind.&nbsp; I know for a fact that coders and developers at Microsoft work with multiple displays, so, where is the disconnect?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>New problems with Windows 10:</strong>&nbsp; When identifying the displays within
<em>Color Management</em>, they don't match the layout inside <em>Display Settings</em>.&nbsp; In my case they're not even in order.&nbsp; This has led to some awkward and frustrating configuration problems when restarting the PC, specifically with the placement of the
 primary taskbar (Yes, we still need a "primary" taskbar because of the<em> Information Center</em> incompetence detailed above).&nbsp; It keeps moving the primary display, even when locked.&nbsp; It does no good there when it's inaccessible by fullscreen applications!&nbsp;
 Display identification may be responsible for some other problems, but I mostly suspect new issue #2:&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Autodetecting Displays.&nbsp; </strong>I run 3 monitors, but I don't always have all 3 on.&nbsp; In windows 10 that is a cardinal sin.&nbsp; If I turn off the two side monitors temporarily because I'm only going to use the center one for a while,
 and then turn them back on, EVERYTHING gets reset.&nbsp; Window locations, icon locations, even the desktop background does a weird little dance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the lowest common denominator approach for the average user.&nbsp; Convenience for the uninitiated is nice.&nbsp; But for those of us that want complete control of what happens in this instance, at least give us the option to turn autodetect off and lock
 everything into existing settings.&nbsp; Even if the means the PC is just "pretending" the peripheral displays are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the love of God, don't be lazy and even suggest checking my GPU drivers.&nbsp; Assume I know how to use a computer.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>This is a compatibility issue. I had the same and I fixed this by installing the driver in compatibility mode.</p>

            <p>Hi Dev, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these question, so that we can diagnose the issue correctly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue? </li></ol>
<p>Computers with a switchable graphics feature have two graphics processing units (GPUs) - a power-saving, integrated GPU and a high-performance, discrete GPU.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computers with an Intel power-saving GPU and an ATI high-performance GPU combine the low power advantages of an integrated GPU with the maximum performance of a discrete GPU.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could have been caused due to graphic card drivers or software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below methods and see if issue gets fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong> <strong>
Update Display driver</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>To update display driver, follow the steps below: </p>
<ol>
<li>Press “<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>”. </li><li>Click on “<strong>Device Manager</strong>” from that list. </li><li>Expand <strong>display adapter</strong>. </li><li>Right click on the <strong>display adapter</strong> installed.</li><li>Click on <strong>update driver software</strong> and select the option to <strong>
automatically search for the updated driver software.</strong> </li><li><strong>Restart</strong> the computer after its updated and verify. </li></ol>
<p>Also try to access the computer manufacturer's website and download the latest display drivers for your computer and install the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If issue still persist proceed with Method 2. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong> <strong>
Uninstall and reinstall ATI catalyst.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling and reinstalling the ATI catalyst can help fix the issue, if the software was not installed properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To <strong>Uninstall</strong> ATI catalyst, follow the below article: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the section “<strong>How to uninstall AMD Catalyst™ Drivers in a Windows® 8 based system</strong>”.

<h2>            skype connect vs individual accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have a sales team of 6.</p>
<p>It looks like I can buy each of them an unlimited&nbsp;calling plan for the US at 2.99/month</p>
<p>
</p><p>But If I want them to use softphones, then I need skype connect and those accounts appear to be at least $36 each/month</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have this right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to stick with the $2.99/month unlimited US and get SIP credentials?<br />
To get that rate, we need to use skype's native application?</p>

</p><p>To be able to use Skype connect, you must have a Skype manager account and SIP-enabled PBX. To create a Skype manager account, please refer to this FAQ article:

What is Skype Manager™ and how does it work?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for the Skype connect, you can set it up for free. However, you will need to purchase channels and allocate subscription or credits to be able to make calls. For more information regarding this, please visit this FAQ:

<p>
</p><p>You mentioned, that using Skype connect will cost at least $36 each/month, can you provide a screenshot where did you see that price?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the $2.99/month unlimited US, you can purchase this subscription as soon as you have the Skype connect and SIP profile, you will be required to purchase a subscription if you purchase a channel to make an outbound calls, however, the price is not
 the same. It will depend on how many channels you have on your SIP profile.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally converted my 1TB external hard drive to a ESD-USB</h2>
                    I built a new custom PC and I needed to download Windows 10 for it so I used my Samsung 1TB external hard drive to install the ISO of Windows 10 Home onto it and then install it onto my PC. It all worked and I now have Windows 10 Home on my new PC but
 my 1TB external hard drive is now a 31.9GB maximum storage external hard drive. How can I revert my hard drive back to having 1TB maximum storage?

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for you to revert your external hard back to its manufacturer size, you must format the hard drive first. Now, for you to do that, type
<strong>Computer Management</strong> on the Search box, then press <strong>Enter</strong>. Once you have it opened, click
<strong>Disk Management</strong> under <strong>Storage</strong> in the left pane of the said tab. Next, locate the drive in the bottom middle panel, then right-click on the disk drive, and select the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've gotten to the disk management and I've right clicked the disk drive but I don't know how to select the volume, the options when I right click the disk drive to do with volume are 'delete volume' and two others that I can't click. I haven't clicked delete
 volume just to clarify.</p>
<p>When I selected the disk drive it says the Primary Partition is '32.0GB FAT32' and it is 'Healthy (Active, Primary Partition)' and '899.51GB' is unallocated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I get as far as typing and entering 'convert D: /fs:ntfs' and it asks for the 'current volume label for drive D:'. IS this the overall volume of 1TB or the 31.9GB it is only letting me use?</p>

            Hi so the conversion to a NTFS file didn't work although it said conversion complete so on the computer manager &gt; storage &gt; disk management I selected my external hard drive on the blue primary partition 31.9GB part and deleted the volume. On the computer
 manager now the disk says it's 1TB of unallocated space but on the file explorer, when I plug my external hard drive in, it doesn't show up on the This PC tab but it does register on the computer manager.

                    Does anyone know why when i get updates,i get a 32 bit and a 64 bit for my system,? i only choose the 64 bit updates because my system isn't a 32 bit device,is this ok or do i need to install the 32 bit updates as well,reason i ask is because i don't want
 to junk up my hard drive with an update that does not serve it's purpose,and secondly when do i get the windows 10 upgrade,as i keep searching for updates but still haven't got the windows 10 icon on my tool bar,how long must i wait.?

            <p>Try this. Press and hold "Windows +&nbsp;R" button on your keyboard, on the Run box type "regedit" and locate Hkey_Local_Machine/software/Microsoft/windows/current Version/windows update/OSupgrade/ create a new DWORD(32bit) rename as "AllowOSUpgrade" right click
 modify the value to 1. In "Windows Update" click check for updates to see if Windows 10 will be offered to us. (Note this method is not advisable we need to make sure that our current windows is fully updated before upgrading to Windows 10.)

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t purchase Xbox 360 backcompat games</h2>
                    
<p>so people have told me if it says I can't buy red dead redemption from the Xbox one, to try it from xbox.com. But that doesn't work, the only solution I have had people tell me is to buy it from a 360, but I don't have a 360. Is there any way for a support
 person to buy the game on my account for me and just take away the funds or something because it's getting really annoying not being able to play red dead redemption when I should be able to get it but can't</p>

<p>There's usually 1 of 2 reasons why you can't make a 360 purchase from the One/website. Either you're on a child account or you need either a credit card or Paypal on file in order to make the purchase. The 360 store is set up differently from the store on
 the One/website. </p>
<p>If you're on a child account, there would be no other way to make the purchase than to make it from the 360. Support can't make purchases for you.</p>

            Spike Dude:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is little hope if you don't have the windows restoration disk or partition.&nbsp; If your computer manufacturer included a
<strong>system restore partition in the hard drive</strong>&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a second part of your hard drive that has all of the data needed to restore windows.&nbsp; You will need to read the manual or talk to the techs of the system manufacturer in order to find out
 how to "trigger" the restoration program.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually it's a function key pressed as you startup, after the bios but before the windows "splash" screen.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If your computer doesn't have this, but didn't come with the disk it's likeley that there was an option to burn the disk when you first got the computer but you probably missed that option (most do).&nbsp; If this is the case even if you were able to get the
 computer started it would likely burn an infected or bad copy of the files so it wouldn't help anyways.&nbsp; Most PC manufacturers will sell copies of the restoration disks for anywhere from 10 to 50 dollars plus shipping.&nbsp; I had one experience with Dell where
 they charged 50$ for a one-time-tech repair option (because it was out of warranty)&nbsp;and sent the disks as part of this.&nbsp; Other times I was able to purchase the disk for around 18$ and avoid the several calls that it took.&nbsp; I think it depends on when your system
 was built.<br />
<br />
The short answer is if you don't have the restoration/os install disks, get them, if you can't, there is little hope to easily resolve the problem.&nbsp;

<h3> maxine1ab  say:</h3>
<h2>            REALLOCATE SPACE BETWEEN EXISTING PARTITIONS ON EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE - WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using a 5 TB external hard drive with 4 partitions. &nbsp;At the time I set this up, I estimated how much space I would need for each one.</p>
<p>Now I realize that I over estimated the space needed on 2 partitions and can foresee the need for more space in at least one, maybe two, of the other partitions. All 4 of the partitions contain data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reallocate the space and not loose any data, or at least not have to save it and put in back in later?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case this makes any difference, I have so much data in two of my partitions that I really don't want to have to save it and put it back in after I get my space reallocated. There is one partition that I could erase entirely. There is one other partition
 that I would be willing to save all the data and also created unallocated space on it as well, if it would make a difference in whether I can reallocate space in each of the partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I wanting to do the impossible?</p>

<p>Hi Maxine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you'd like to utilize the free space and reallocate it to other partitions that requires more space. At the same time, the only alternative that we can advise you as of now, is to make use of the
<strong>Disk&nbsp; Management tool</strong>. This built in tool can help you to allocate unallocated space into the partition in case you encounter low disk space issue. To learn more, you can also check this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/how-to-allocate-free-space/227469a2-0d9d-44bd-960b-d59271e0b684">thread</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need additional help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
