    <title>possible counterfeit Windows version after having to restore computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            possible counterfeit Windows version after having to restore computer to original state - originally Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Lenovo&nbsp;&nbsp;computer is 7 years old and I had been having so many problems with it that I had to totally wipe it back to original and then re-load programs, update Windows, etc.&nbsp; It took me quite a long time after my son did the original restore.&nbsp; After one
 month I have started to get messages that I may have a counterfeit version of Windows (it says it is Windows Ultimate) and there is a product key but I am unable to 'activate' using the key that is now showing on my computer.&nbsp; My son said that he used a disc
 to install Windows 7 back onto the computer but I am wondering if it is the Lenovo disc that came with my husband's 6 year old computer.&nbsp; If so, does anyone have an idea as to how I can fix this situation without having to totally wipe everything off again
 and start over?&nbsp; It's been running great until the messages started about about not having 'genuine' Windows.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <p>Check if the edition of Windows 7 installed, matches with the edition listed on the certificated of authenticity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, right click Computer, click Properties</p>
<p>Look under Windows Edition</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now check the edition listed on the COA sticker attached to your Lenovo:</p>
<span><span>
<p><strong>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, </strong><strong>how do I find the product key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit.&nbsp;It
 looks like the following:</p>

</span></span>
<p>
</p><p>If its not, then you will need to install the edition listed on the sticker. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do this, you will need to download, create a bootable copy, then boot from and perform a clean install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Download Windows 10, 8, 7 ISOs</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 and Windows 8</h2>
                    I have purchased a new desktop with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;My computer will not permit me to use my HP OfficeJet Pro 8600. &nbsp;It says it's offline. &nbsp;When I try to install the set up disk, the new computer tells me it will not run with anything above Vista 7. &nbsp;I have
 another laptop that the printer still is working with. &nbsp;This is very frustrating since this is a work-related computer.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I need to ask you a few questions before we can start troubleshooting. <br />
<br />
Has this worked in the past and recently stopped working?<br />
Which type of video files have you tried?<br />
What is the make and model of video card that you have installed?<br />
How much video RAM does your card have?<br />
<br />
When it tells you to "restart Media Center or Windows", have you tried re-booting and testing again?<br />

<h2>            Tablet wont stop glitching</h2>
                    My windows RT Tablet has been working absolutely perfect for 4 months now when all of a sudden it stopped working. The volume weirdly glitches and just moves up in down, the tablet screen starts shaking, and it doesn't let me click anything with key board
 or with the touch screen. I have tried resetting my tablet and it still wont stop glitching. I would really appreciate if someone could help me fix my tablet, thank you!

    <title>Got suspended and I never got to thoroughly explain my case - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twerkitnex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Got suspended and I never got to thoroughly explain my case</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to find any way to get to contact the xbox enforcement team and this is my current method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; So I received an email in the middle of my work day which I didn't get to check until I got home at 10pm (May 19th).&nbsp; I saw it said I have an account suspension and to check the xbox enforcement site.&nbsp; I go and check and the only thing it tells me is that I got suspended for "Cheating".&nbsp; That's all it said.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it as I have never done something considered cheating while playing multiplayer online games.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I remember I got a message about 2 weeks ago of someone accusing me of cheating in Titanfall 2 after I had a really good game of Last Titan Standing.&nbsp; He said "cheater go back to pc. nobody wants you here. CHEATER! blocked and reported." So I got to thinking there is no way I just got suspended for something as dumb as that.&nbsp; I then submit a review saying
<br />
</p>
<p>"I'm not sure what I would have done to have caused this to <br />
happen as I haven't used any form of cheating myself or other <br />
people I know. I would like a formal review since there isn't <br />
anything I could have done to deserve this ban. If this is because one <br />
person reported me who also messaged me I don't feel this course<br />
of action was appropriate (I'm sure it's not). <br />
I'm willing to cooperate in any way and I would love to get more<br />
info."</p>
<p>&nbsp; As I am limited to 500 characters I couldn't get everything I wanted to say out. I submit my request thinking we can surely solve why I got suspended as just saying cheating is pretty broad. &nbsp;I watch a couple episodes of a show then get on to sleep. Go to work the next day and yet again I get an email in the middle of my work day saying case review is finished.&nbsp; Too busy at work gotta wait till I get home to check.&nbsp; I got home to find my case review said Decision Upheld.&nbsp; I said pretty loudly in the house "What!?" So I look at what my case reviewer has to say. </p>
<p>"This account was issued a temporary suspension for participating in <br />
cheating and modding-related Club activities, while on Xbox Live."</p>
<p>&nbsp; That's when I got thinking as to what I could have done and I eventually remembered a while back (about 2 weeks) I was looking for Borderlands 2 communities to help me level up some of my other characters and help farming some items in the game.&nbsp; I saw I got recommended a bunch of clubs for Borderlands 2 so I just go thru applying for all of them with hopes that one of these not so busy days at work I'll get the opportunity to find other people who still play the game.&nbsp; I did this is as a thing right before I was going to sleep so I didn't look at the details, and was more so excited to find other people.&nbsp; I look at the name of the clubs that I got accepted into and one them says "Borderlands 2 boosting and op leveling and more".</p>
<p>&nbsp; So I say to myself "How would I get banned for just being a part of a group?&nbsp; I haven't had time to do anything with any of these groups yet."&nbsp; So I go back to see if I can say something back to the case reviewer just to find out I can't.&nbsp; I eventually try contacting support, which in the middle of contacting them I see a thing on xbox enforcement that says to not contact support.&nbsp; So I just ask the guy what would he do in my situation? His response was less than helpful.&nbsp; So here I am trying to plead my case or be in some kind of contact with the xbox enforcement team. As I haven't participated in anything with that club or any club for that matter.&nbsp; I only get on and play Metal Gear Solid V, Titanfall 2, or Battlefield 1 with friends that are on.&nbsp; I still do stick by my statement that I do not deserve this ban.</p>
<p>&nbsp; While typing this I went to go leave the group as to hopefully never have this happen again.&nbsp; I also noticed they had a post that said a bunch of people got a suspension for being a part of the group.&nbsp; I think this is kind of ridiculous that I have to go through all this to try and get my xbox account back.&nbsp; I take great joy in my evenings that I spend playing games with friends as they are my only source of relief after working 8-12 hours a day.&nbsp; I am quite frustrated about this whole situation especially so after finding out how I got suspended for just being a part of a group that xbox recommended to me. I haven't taken part in anything in the club.&nbsp; Also why not just disband the club instead of suspending everyone in it. It really makes no sense to just suspend all these people even if they did boost levels using an in-game quest of a 5 year old game that was last updated 2 years ago to fix glitches and bugs they didn't want. &nbsp;I'm willing to talk this through with s
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Sorry for long post. Really wanted to get my side of the situation fully on here.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>TLDR: Got suspended, me shocked, vague reason, suspended for "participating in cheat and modding-related Club activities, while on Xbox Live", never did anything with ANY clubs EVER cause of work, can't contact xbox enforcement team again, this is the one of few places i can think to go to. Someone please help.</p>

            Hi RachelVigness, 
<br />
<br />Have these problems been happening the whole time you've been using the dock, or have they only just started happening? (perhaps a recent Windows update such as 1803)
<br />
<br />When you updated your Surface Docks firmware, did you use the the Surface updater tool found on the following Microsoft article?: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023478/surf...</a>
<br />
<br />Could you also please do the following to see if any events are being logged within Event Viewer during the times of these intermittent disconnections: 
<br />- Press Windows key + r to open Run (or right-click the Windows start button and select Run) 
<br />- Enter: perfmon /rel 
<br />
<br />This will list events found within Event Viewer. You will want to find critical/error events around the time/date of recent disconnections. 
<br />
<br />Please feel free to send through a screenshot of the above window.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<p>No, I have had this docking station for over one year and just recently (within the past month) noticed the issues with the docking station.&nbsp; That said, I used the Surface updater tool to update the docking station.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Reliability Monitor and did not note any events associated with the time the ports are cutting in/out.&nbsp; I've lost connection to my monitors at least 6 times within the past hour.&nbsp;</p>

            I tried using a different MS Surface on the docking station and it worked fine.&nbsp; Just reconnected this one to the MS Surface and the connection with the USB ports immediately started going in and out.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi <strong>Alanfrancisbury</strong>,</p>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you try to activate the product?<br />
2. Do you receive any error message?<br />
3. Which version of Windows is being installed on your computer?<br />
4. From where did you purchase the Acceleration pack?</p>
<p>Try the steps in the below given article and check if that resolves the issue of activation.</p>

    <title>Edge sound routing issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtyeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge sound routing issue</h2>
                    <p>I have an AudioEngine D1 headphone DAC/amp, connected to my Surface Dock.&nbsp; It was properly recognized by the OS and I set it to be the default sound playback device. With Deezer, Foobar 2000, VLC and other apps that produce sound, including games, the sound
 properly plays back through the D1. If I'm using Chrome, sound from websites also plays back properly through the D1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I play back videos on Edge, however, the sound plays back through the speakers of my Surface Pro 2017. In addition, connecting headphones to the headphone jack on the Surface Pro 2017 does NOT route the sound to those headphones, either. The sound continues
 to play back through the onboard speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it only happens with Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a potential solution or can point me to the right setting to route sound properly?</p>

            Sorry, it sounds like a bug in the design of Edge.  Edge is still very much "beta" software, still being tested and developed.

All I can suggest is submitting an error report. Go to the Windows Hub using

    <title>Installing Windows Maps on government owned surface pro 6 with Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vagovemployee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows Maps on government owned surface pro 6 with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was recently issued a surface pro 6 as part of a test group to evaluate upgrade of our desktop machines to improve mobile connectivity.&nbsp; Virginia severely limits the end user from installing software and&nbsp;adjusting some settings in Windows.&nbsp; One intended
 use of the surface pro is to have it function as a GPS navigator for turn-by-turn directions by downloading offline&nbsp;maps&nbsp;and other GPS enabled functions with a GPS receiver dongle.&nbsp; This surface pro is running Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our&nbsp;surface pros did not come with the Windows Maps app&nbsp;installed.&nbsp; In the Settings Menu - Default apps - Maps is populated with a gray square and "choose a default".&nbsp; When clicked you get&nbsp;a box that says "There is no installed app for this type of file
 or protocol", a dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put in offical requests to have Windows Maps approved from installation on my surface pro.&nbsp; After securing permission I tried to create an account on the Microsoft Store with my goverment email or phone and it would not allow this.&nbsp; I then created an account
 with a personal email address, but hit a roadblock when it could not find a microsoft device linked to that account.&nbsp; IT has been very little help and exhausted all resources.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Windows Maps standard software on a new windows 10&nbsp;install and did someone need to manually configure so it wouldn't appear?&nbsp; Why can't a microsoft store account be created with a .gov email address?&nbsp; How do other government agencies work
 around this?&nbsp; Is there some workaround to get Windows Maps installed on this surface pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, the application has to be installed on your device as it's an In-built app. As you say, that your PC has restrictions to install software or to adjust some settings in Windows, you may give it a try by installing it from Microsoft Store from the

            Downloading software from such sites can be very risky because the origin of the files are usually edited and its very possible that they could have injected malicious code in it.
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Gamer Edition is not a Microsoft developed or affiliated product, what it seems to be is a customized Windows 7 image that the authors customized to remove or add components of Windows which can also be very problematic.
<br />
<br />
You are using something that nobody can help you with considering that it has probably been reverse engineered and likely injected with malicious code such as spyware (keyloggers, rootkits, worms, viruses). I suggest you stick to Windows 7 Ultimate, it is the
 most complete edition of Windows 7 anyone can have. <br />

    <title>Issue with system and memory compression and multiple diplays not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gardnerablett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with system and memory compression and multiple diplays not waking</h2>
                    <p>I will attach links to the files created by the diagnostic tool. The first issue is sometimes the system and memory compression will use lots or resources. It will lag my computer down, I have a 4.1 ghz 6th gen i5 and 16 gigs of DDR4 memory so that shouldnt
 happen. So i ran the tool when it was occuring. </p>
<p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=435191D2F2B1F2B3!8236&amp;authkey=!AGqcKqx6RyzTW0I&amp;ithint=file%2cetl</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second issue is when my computer wakes from sleep or just from being locked sometimes 2 of my 3 displays wont display anything. They are on and are receiving a signal, but the screens are black. If something was open on that screen I cant access it. The
 computer thinks its there but nothing is displayed. This wont resolve until I restart and when I restart usually it will have lost it settings and no longer extend my desktop so I have to redo all of that. Its never the main display. The main display is connected
 to a XFX Radeon R9 390 with the most current drivers via display port and the monitor on either side is connected via DVI. I am up to date on windows updates. I have also gotten it to do it while running the diagnostic tool.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>If anyone can look at those and maybe offer some help as to why these things happen that would be awesome.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Did you update the drivers from the
<strong>Manufacturer’s</strong> website?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Were you facing this issue before? Did you make any software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Which diagnostic tool did you run?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with system. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue
 is with your System Maintenance.</span></p>

            <p>Yes once I restart it stops doing it until the next time. And same with the monitors having a black screen. If I restart they work fine. It was using 35-40% of my processor. Enough to make things laggy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also yes I tried to reconfigure the displays to extend when it does it, but it says they are there and already at that setting. It seems to think the monitor is there and on but no signal is sent to it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Conspiracy theory&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>2014 chapter 1 - The Big Fear</strong><br />
Microsoft support for Windows XP ended April 8, 2014<br />
omg omg what we're going to do?<br />
we need to upgrade before April or we will get a virus or worst..!!!<br />
(the fear tactic always works)<br />
well I did it !<br />
and what is the logic option ?<br />
windows 7 because windows 8 and 8.1 sucks</p>
<p>so I upgrade 2 computers with windows 7 for $89 x 2&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft love it and I know they do!!!!</p>
<p>it's ok nothing is for free right?</p>
<p>ohhhhh wait a minute...!!!</p>
<p><strong>2015 Chapter 2 - The Free Killer OS</strong><br />
Now 2015 what is the problem Microsoft still have ?<br />
too many people with 6 years old computers could be one .!! maybe?&gt;<br />
how Microsoft can solve that problem?<br />
well they find the way to overheating your old CPU<br />
when you upgrade to windows 10 ,<br />
that is what happen to me and many others<br />
so what are the options in this case?<br />
1) you buy a new computer and Microsoft love it <strong>$$$$$$</strong><br />
2) you fix your old computer if it was not damage enough by yourself&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that Microsoft is not very happy with the option 2&nbsp;<br />
because in the end it's all about freaking money<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS it's just a theory&nbsp;</p>
<p>so hold yourself before comment to that ok?</p>
<p>but however the overheating part it's a true story</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death with different error codes&#33;</h2>
                    Most of the times when I'm loading a particular project in Unity 3D 2017.3, I get a BSOD. Sometimes I'm able to load the project but I eventually get the BSOD after sometimes. I checked and updated, all the drivers in my system. I even ran Dell Diagnostic
 check from the Boot Menu and it was all clear.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have an Alienware 15 with Windows 10 Home (Build 17134), Intel Core i7-4720HQ, GTX 970M and 8GB RAM.<br />

            Hi geekyJock, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi geekyJock,
<br />
<br />The majority of the mini-dump files indicate your Nvidia graphics card device driver as the root cause of your system crashes . . .
<br />
<br />While that device driver may be up-to-date, an older driver may suite your system better, Unity is known to have issues with graphics cards . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<p>Well, after days of messing around, I solved the problem on my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running a 680i motherboard with a pair of GTS8800s I also had a 7950 dual DVI card in the third PCIe slot.&nbsp; If I disable or remove the 7950 card I can play video in media player and in media center.&nbsp; I took it a bit further.&nbsp; In addition, if I put ANY
 pci video (Even a Quatro NVS 440 PCIe 1x card) in the system, I get the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed the 8800 cards, and put a pair of ATI cards in their place, along with my 7950 card in the third PCIe slot, and everything works perfectly.&nbsp; Then for giggles, I put a pair of FX4500s in, and no problem..&nbsp; then I borrowed my buddys pair of FX4500x2
 cards (8 GPUs) and put a straight FX4500 in the third slot, and again,&nbsp; no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the issue (At least in my case) has to do with the presence of an 8800 card with ANY other card in a PCI, PCIe, or PCIR 1x slot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if this will help any of you out there, but it worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards</p>

            Have done that but it goes right back to Read Only. I have done that on the user folder affected and told it to effect all files and folders. It takes it several minutes to go through it but when I check properties it is all back to Read Only.

<h2>             APB RELOADED keeps crashing. </h2>
                    
<p>Every time i play APB Reloaded it crashes. Its getting to the point where i don't even want it on my console. I barely even get to play a mission or anything because the screen goes black then it takes me back to the Xbox Home. Did i mention it takes about
 20 minutes just to get back in the game??</p>

<p>The game is terribly optimized and I believe it's not even better on the PC Version. This game makes me think the developers of this game might have little to no experience. It's beyond frustrating!</p>

<p>This game just feels shameful. As if it isnt bad enough that its optimization is terrible, the community is absolute garbage as well. You rarely get assistance from teammates, teammates run you over or shoot you for no reason, and no assistance is given
 if you are stuck on the tutorials or other things. Its pathetic.</p>

            Actually, it runs perfectly on PC, No crashes, nothing. IG it just wasn't optimized for console well.

<h2>            Not able to use Xbox controller for GTA - San Andreas&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>.Original title:&nbsp; Exe File Loads, But Does Not Run?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, so I decided to play GTA - San Andreas, and came up with a problem -- my Xbox 360 controller isn't compatible with the game. So, with some research and luck, I found a program claiming to utilize my controller with GTA.&nbsp; [http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=114]<br />
<br />
So I downloaded and extracted the files, and double click the .exe file. My mouse shows a little loading symbol, and... nothing.<br />
<br />
I try running as administrator, and.... nothing.<br />
<br />
I open the, "readme" and see this:<br />
<br />
<br />
" Unzip all contents to any folder you wish.<br />
<br />
If the program fails to run then you might need the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Visual Basic 6 runtimes</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">available from Microsoft.&nbsp; This tool also requires DirectX 7</span> or better."<br />
<br />
I know I have a DirectX over 7, since I play newer games quite often that requires it.
<br />
<br />
So I decided to download Visual Basic 6 Runtimes, here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24417<br />
<br />
I download it, install it, open a file that shows an extraction to "Windows 32" for a split second, and it closes.<br />
<br />
Thinking the installation was all done, I proceeded to trying to re-open the program shown in my first paragraph.<br />
<br />
Still. It shows the loading symbol, but still... nothing.<br />

            <div>My concern and the trouble is on our PC that my husband (Gregg) uses for work. This email account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) is his and he will be continuing the correspondence with more specific answers to your questions................thank
 you. Diann V.</div>
<div>Question #1.....Cut/Paste does not work within BSD SpecLink-E software. I have spent time with their help-desk and have determined the issue somehow originates outside of SpecLink-E. Hence the error message of "not supported by Office Clipboard"?</div>
<div>#2.......Cut/Paste content is simple text (words, sentences).</div>
<div>#3.......Issue is only within the SpecLink-E software. Cut/Paste works within Word and Excel and, I can Cut/Paste from Word or Excel into SpecLink-E, but not within SpecLink-E.
<div>Thanks for your consideration of this issue. I'm a technical writer and Cut/Paste is a very important function for me.</div>
<div>I'll be out of my office the rest of the day, won't be checking email till early evening.</div>
