<h2>            Skype Messages Not Sending</h2>
                    Hey, I use Skype regularly, and was in a conversation this morning, and had messaged numerous times, when suddenly the messages stopped sending.&nbsp; All it says is "Sending Failed", but no reason why.&nbsp; I tried messaging a few other people, and it is the same
 with all my contacts.&nbsp; I am using Windows 10.&nbsp; I have tried closing down and restarting Skype, logging out and then logging back in, but nada.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.

<h2>            logonui.exe runtime error</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I use Windows Vista Business and currently can only log on in safe mode. the reason is that when i start my machine, the following error message occurs instead of the logon screen.<br />
<br />
Runtime Error!<br />
<br />
Program: C:\windows\system32\logonui.exe<br />
<br />
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusal way.<br />
<br />
I then get the option to click 'OK' after which the machine tries to restart the logon screen but unsuccessfully so far. who can help me find a quick solution to the problem???<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Ben&nbsp;

<h2>            Is there a way to change the time Windows 10 does updates&#63;</h2>
                    I love the fact that the updates are done without me having to look after them myself, but currently one of my computers does it while I am actively using it.&nbsp; Having it suddenly shut down without warning to restart and install updates is annoying.&nbsp; I
 can not see how to change this to a time when I am not usually&nbsp; using it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My other computers have never shut down so I don't know if the one is updating for all of them or not.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this a Windows Update error?  See this fix for the specific error:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />Other situations that can have this error are addressed here:  <a href="http://www.eassos.com/how-to/fix-error-code-0x80070005.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eassos.com/how-to/fix-error-code-0x8...</a>
<br />
<br />Concerning Windows Update situation now:  
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now, with problematic Updates being withdrawn and rewritten while a half billion PC's are being rescanned constantly to sort them all out.  So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a>
<br />
<br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall them there.  
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat that has lately caused some disruption, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />As a last resort, you can set a Metered Connection or disable Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

    <title>Chkdsk throws unspecified error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darryllogreen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chkdsk throws unspecified error</h2>
                    I have a client PC running XP which runs chkdsk on every startup. It always fails at Stage 2 at around 60% with an unspecified error.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have run chkdsk /f at bootup - no change. Actually it failed at about the same spot, and then reran chkdsk immediately with the same pattern as bootup</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are no disk events recorded in Event Viewer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran a disk diagnostic which showed the disk was actually in better condition than some of the ones of mine that I am using, and certainly no bad sectors.</div>
<div>The disk was replaced recently - best guess about 12 months ago.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
                </div>

            Run chkdsk /r from the Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
Recovery Console is available<br />
-- from a genuine Windows XP install CD<br />
-- if it was installed on the system (from a genuine Windows XP install CD)<br />
-- from a bootable CD you create per the following instructions from frequent contributor ElderL<br />
<br />
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecomputerparamedic.com/?p=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thecomputerparamedic.com/?p=8</a>
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p><br />
If you make the CD and boot on it, just enter 'help' to see if it is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then use&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long&nbsp;time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is&nbsp;still flashing, it is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount to&nbsp;be sure it is still
 making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>The chkdsk /r needs to complete without any errors, so you may need to run it&nbsp;multiple times until it does.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>

            Lemp,
<div><br />
<div>I have my doubts that this will work for two reasons. Firstly we have already run chkdsk multiple times with zero change in behaviour, although not from the recovery disk. Second, when chkdsk fixes things, there is some sort of a message saying what it
 is doing - e.g. which sector or node it is working on. There is nothing at like this - it just closes straight down with the unspecified error message.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other thoughts?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another complication that I didn't mention, the CD isn't working which will have to be fixed before we can use the recovery CD. I am working on this as well. First port of call was to get it out of the devices list twice.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.&nbsp;</div>

            IF chkdsk runs on a reboot it is either because you scheduled it to run on the next reboot or the volume has been marked 'dirty' and XP is going to want to fix dirty volumes.&nbsp; Then you have to view the chkdsk report in the Event Viewer System log to see
 what happened.&nbsp; It could also be that you have some disk failure that chkdsk just can't resolve.<br />
<br />
Check the 'dirty' bit on the volume and tell us what it says.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
As an example, to query the dirty bit on drive C, enter this command:<br />
<br />
<b>fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</b><br />
<br />
Sample output:<br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C: is not dirty<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to close the command prompt window.<br />
<br />
Is your volume dirty or not dirty?<br />
<br />
If the dirty bit is set, the only thing that can clear it is a successful run of chkdsk with error correction and that may not work the first time.&nbsp; If the volume is very afflicted, it may not work at all.&nbsp; In that case you can tell XP to not check the dirty
 bit on the afflicted volume but that would be risky behavior since something is really wrong with it.<br />
<br />
When XP is running, if there is a power interruption, power failure, brown out, pressing the power button, plug pulling, battery removal, (because the system is hung or won't respond), an aborted restart or improper shutdown the file system could get corrupted.<br />
<br />
Does any of that sound like something that has happened to your system prior to this incident?<br />
<br />
Such things can cause corruption in the file system.<br />
<br />
Volumes that have file system errors are known as dirty volumes. If a volume is dirty, it has experienced file system errors, and you must run chkdsk on the volume to repair the problem.<br />
<br />
When XP starts, it automatically checks the dirty bit on each volume (C, D, E, etc.) and if any volume is dirty, XP will automatically run chkdsk /p on the next reboot on the volume(s) to try to clear the dirty bit.&nbsp; Sometimes you have to run it multiple times.&nbsp;
 Sometimes you just can't clear the dirty bit. <br />
<br />
If a volume's dirty bit is set, this indicates that the file system may be in an inconsistent state. The dirty bit can be set because the volume is online and has outstanding changes, because changes were made to the volume and the computer shutdown before
 the changes were committed to disk, or because corruption was detected on the volume. If the dirty bit is set when the computer restarts, chkdsk runs to verify the consistency of the volume.<br />
<br />
Every time you start a computer running one of the operating systems in Windows XP or the Windows Server 2003 family, autochk.exe is called by the Kernel to scan all volumes to check if the volume dirty bit is set. If the dirty bit is set, autochk performs
 an immediate chkdsk /f on that volume.&nbsp; A chkdsk /f verifies file system integrity and attempts to fix any problems with the volume.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your system of unspecified make and model can boot from a USB thumb drive, you can make a Hiren's Boot CD (except on a thumb drive) and run the chkdsk from there and watch it to see what it says.<br />
<br />
<i>Don't you see it <u>yet </u>MS Answers forum owners...&nbsp; why it would help us if the MS Answers would prompt for fundamental system information like system make and model and do you have a working CD/DVD drive,&nbsp; etc. we would know all these things. &nbsp; Think
 of the wasted message cycles that would be saved....</i><br />
<br />
Anywho, here's how to make a Bootable Hiren's USB thumb drive if you care to pursue that:<br />
<br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB flash/thumb stick/drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music.) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download the latest version on Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I suggest another way and here's how:<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.3.2 or whatever the latest version is from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a><br />
<br />
I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be
 patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.<br />
<br />
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<br />

            Thanks all for your help. Further investigations kept throwing up even more anomolies so I ran AVG Resue as a deep virus check. Found one virus and we now have chkdsk at least responding to keystrokes when it was not doing so before. It is currently running
 overnight to see if there are any other viruses on board.

            The final washup from this episode - There were 7 viruses cleaned out plus some malware that masqueraded as a virus cleaner. When the viruses were cleaned out, chkdsk finally ran normally. It ran once - did what it had to do, and hasn't been seen since.
 I also ran some Windows updates for the client. There were a lot that were overdue and they were all security patches. No wonder it ended up the way it did.
<div><br />
<div>I'm so glad I ran a disk diagnostic to confirm the chkdsk output. If I hadn't done this, I would have replaced the disk only to have the same problem again. It now makes sense as to why it didn't make sense.</div>
<div><br />

            Hi EJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />This can fix explorer problems or at least get it to let go of the operation which might be indicative of deeper OS problems.  So if it then persists go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            Hi,
<br />when copy operation starts it creates a list of future actions including a list of files. If one cancels operation the system needs to clear this queue and this takes some time for each file. The more files were still in queue, the longer it cancelling.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t see my Picture Library in Desktop Backgrounds</h2>
                    I can personalise the screen saver to use ALL of my photos (stored on a secondary HDD) by selecting Windows Live Photo Gallery, but in Desktop Backgrounds I don't see this option. Since my photos are not stored on the main drive in Users, but are found
 in the D drive and referenced by locating them in the Pictures Library, I can only select them for backgrounds by browsing to a specific folder. Since my photos are stores in folders organised in a cascade of years and months, this means I cannot shuffle all
 my photos across my desktop, only the ones in the topmost folder. Is that normal? Is there a tweak I am missing here?

 select "Pictures Library" it only shows the photos on the top folder on the D drive.

            Yes, Pictures Library is selected. And the Library is properly set up, to include the top folder (which automatically includes all the sub-folders in Windows Explorer). But something weird is going on. Today ALL the photos are now visible in Desktop Background,
 whereas yesterday only the pics in the very top folder were visible. It's as if the Desktop Backgrounds dialog loses track of all the photos from time to time. Since it's an intermittent problem, it's a bit hard to narrow down a cause.

<h2>            Office 365 extremely&#40;s slow, unresponsive and crashes constantly</h2>
                    <p>My work laptop has recently been upgraded to Office 365. I now find all the Office apps to be extremely slow, unresponsive and crash near constantly. Even simple things like opening a excel spreadsheet is met with loading ring. I have tried a number of remedies
 listed on the forums. But I do not believe I have to become a software engineer and start going through remedy after remedy, just to create a power point or open Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have similar issues with my personal Outlook.com email account, both the app and the web version are ridiculously slow and unresponsive (tried switching between beta and normal, cleared cache, looked at java). Good luck trying to delete a email on there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think everything from Windows 10, to Office 365, to Outlook.com are sub par and poorly developed programs, which is a shame as I have been using Windows and Windows based apps for over 18 years.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there Nima, could you try this very odd request for me? Its seemed to fix the problem for others (Thanks The Weegee!)
<br />
<br />Check the box to "Disable Hardware Acceleration" under Advanced &gt; Display. 
<br />
<br />Uncheck the box for feedback animation under Advanced &gt; General.
<br />
<br />Apply &gt; Ok &gt; Close and restart program

            Hi Nima,
<br />
<br />When your laptop was upgraded to Office 365, was any previous version of office thoroughly removed first?
<br />
<br />Please follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .

<p>I have the same problems.</p>
<p>The interface is slow, and not really ment for working.</p>
<p>More for beeing cool to look at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think the the dependence on internet connectivity, is a bad choise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the olden days you had a well written help file.</p>
<p>Now you have and online link, to some thing that either not there, or a search that couldn't find a seat if it was seated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the programs chrash, chrash other software, and is generally in a very poor state.</p>
<p>Add to this, that the new "features " that keeps being added, are typically a new layout, or new icons, so that you have to learn to do simple tasks all over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have some legacy vm s, and to be frank.</p>
<p>If i need to use word or excel, i usually open these, were i have an old version&nbsp; that just works</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Automatic installation of printers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helping out a SMB with a new laptop. The user had to use WIndows 10 64 bit, as it came from the hardware vendor. After a great deal of issues we have one remaining problem (been fighting it for more than a week...).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client PC is Windows 10 and the server is WIndows 2012. It has a HP Plotter configured on the network. along with some other printers and devices. To get CAD print to the older HP plotter, we have to install a legacy driver locally. This works but only
 for a print or two, and then Microsoft automation takes over...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what hack, configuration, GPO is used there is just NO WAY to prevent Windows 10 from automatically installing the network printers, which again overwrites / disables the other printer drivers that is working but intended for WIndows 7 64bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This great "feature" has now cost about USD 2000 to troubleshoot. I have personally have experience with Microsoft since Dos 5.0, and there is another consultant with equal experience handling the plotter, driver etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... dear Microsoft, how about a fix for this? How do we actually turn off the "feature" where any network printer and other device installs it self automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't ask the if we have checked UAC settings, permissions for the user, updated printer driver etc. This all works 100% on the old WIndows 7 pc, other computers in the same environment etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>

<h2>            I cannot find my microsoft credentials</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a problem with files lost after windows 10 upgrade. I got a proposal&nbsp;</span>how to solve that issue, which requires entering my Microsoft credentials
 (see P.S. below). I checked in the credentials manager what I have stored there, but I could not find Microsoft or Windows credentials. I have a password to start up my computer, which is possibly what I need to enter when I sign in with a Microsoft account.
 Is this correct?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 about 3 months ago. I had no problems at all. When I started my computer, the second time yesterday,
 all my files including all my favorites in the browsers had disappeared. After a while, I detected them under my PC and my user name. A new directory called "Quick access" had been created. I started move my files into the Quick access folders. Unfortunately,
 my keyboard had also changed from Swiss German to American. I tried to change my keyboard back to Swiss German following the advice I found in the net. Unfortunately, that was not successful. I shut the computer down. When I started again, the old startup
 page appeared, all my favorites in Google Chrome and other browsers had come back. However, all my files HAVE DISAPPERED AGAIN. &nbsp;The Quick access folders were empty and the folders under my PC were empty. I have a short cut to my documents. Using it, I still
 can access my documents. They seem to be stored under C:\Users\Willi\Desktop\Documents. &nbsp;The short cut to my pictures cannot find anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can anybody help me to find my files and stabilize the system?</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check disk did not generate those files. Hiberfil.sys is the Hibernation file created<br />
when the system hibernates. Pagefile.sys is the virtual memory file used by Windows.<br />
<br />
CHKDSK (short for Checkdisk) - &lt;-- see the Vista log here (Windows 7 is same)<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHKDSK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHKDSK</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How to Read the Event Viewer Log for Check Disk (chkdsk) in Windows<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/96938-check-disk-chkdsk-read-event-viewer-log.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/96938-check-disk-chkdsk-read-event-viewer-log.html</a><br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Checkdisk log is in EventViewer which is easy to read with the 2nd utility here.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see the log.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Control Panel - Classic View - Admin Tools - Event Viewer -&nbsp;Left Panel - Windows Logs - under the<br />
above - click Application - in the&nbsp;middle column&nbsp;scroll&nbsp;the list that says Source&nbsp;-&nbsp;click on Wininit&nbsp; -<br />
right panel - Event Wininit - click Event Properties -&nbsp;new window will open with the&nbsp;log you want.&nbsp;<br />
Scroll as needed. Event ID is 1001.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you clear the log before you schedule checkdisk it is easier to find however by Time and Date<br />
should be easy enough.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />

            <p>As SpiritX has said there are no connection between hiberfil.sys and pagefile.sys and the chkdsk utility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you just want a chkdsk report on your C partition select Start, Run, type "cmd" without quotes in the box and press the ENTER key. Type chkdsk and press the ENTER key and a report, detailing amongst other things a summary of how the disk space is
 utilised, is provided. If you want a report on a partition or drive other than C you need to go to that partition. To access F, where F is the required partition you type F: and press the ENTER key.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Copying reports from a command prompt can be tricky. Right click and select Mark. This enables you to highlight selected text and click to copy. You then go to an open Word, Notepad or similar file, right click and paste. The selected text transfers
 from your clipboard to the open file. You can paste directly into a reply message to most forums.</span></p>

<h2>            Fighting Startup Repair</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys!<br />
<br />
So my PC has been down for a while with a problem along the lines of, "Windows has encountered a critical error and will restart shortly" but only when hardwired to the internet. &nbsp;If it was not connected I could use it just fine. &nbsp;I finally decided to do a
 reformat from a repair disc but got stuck in the startup repair loop and cannot use f8 to boot in safe mode. &nbsp;I was going through the command prompt to do a recovery but now I've hit a wall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>X: seems to be my drive with SAM, Security, and Regback. &nbsp;When I do MD mybackup and copy it, 12 files copy, but when I check CD regback DIR I show 0 file(s) 0 bytes 2 dir(s) 24,179,360 bytes free when I read it needs to show SAM, security, regback around
 262,000bytes and SOFTWARE around 9.9million bytes. &nbsp;It says to stop if any are 0 but obviously none of them show up for me. &nbsp;The more I do, the farther down a hole I get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated and I apologize if this is hard to read or make sense of</p>
                </div>

<p>While it is possible to format the System Partition while in Windows Repair mode, this will leave you with a blank disk. You then have these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do a destructive Factory Restore, using the hidden disk partition.</li><li>Restore Windows with a Factory Restore DVD.</li><li>Reload Windows using a Windows installation DVD.</li></ul>
<p>X: is not your system drive. It is a virtual drive that will disappear as soon as you get out of Repair Mode.</p>

            <p>Where should I proceed from here then? The only reason I went off a repair disc is because i'm almost certain I don't have the factory disc for windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I tried using C as my drive but it wasn't showing the files the tutorial showed. It showed kaspersky rescue disc which i tried months ago</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 <br />
Repair Disk when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed <br />
how to make a Windows 7 Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made <br />
on any computer with a CD burner running XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses <br />
no files from the Host computer.
<p><br />
You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot. <br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not <br />
copy protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since <br />
you already own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer. <br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows
<br />
come&nbsp; back and try Startup Repair again.) <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
First try to fix the issues as previously indicated.<br />
<br />
If those efforts fail and Windows 10 came on your computer check with the system maker's support, documentation, and forums about doing a factory restore. If not then consider a Clean Install.<br />
<br />
If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement that was created when you upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. You can run either Windows 7 or Windows 10 as long as you only run one of them on that computer at a time (you
 have only 1 license).<br />
<br />
Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10 <br />

    <title>Freezing Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackangel209  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Today, I was playing and then the game locked up when I attempted to press the Save option on the pause wheel, though it may have been autosaving at the time(pretty sure it wasn't, but is a possibility). So I restart my 360 and start the game but any time
 I try to use 'Load' or 'Resume' it instantly freezes and I have to push the power button to turn it off. My brothers' profiles don't seem to have this issue. I tried moving the save file that may have been corrupted by an interrupted save onto a flash drive,
 but it still won't work. I've also tried deleting my profile and re-recovering it in case that got corrupted somehow. Was wondering if anyone knows what might be wrong or has experienced this before? I would try outright deleting the save, but I'm hoping there's
 a way around that as it's an Insanity run. &gt;.&lt; Sorry if this is technically the wrong place, this is just really frustrating.</p>

<p>Can't edit. So, now the problem has gotten worse and it freezes on the black screen in between the 'Press Start' screen and the main menu. And it still works just fine on other accounts and I've tried both discs so its not an individual disc issue. Any help
 would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Edit: Would uninstalling the game itself possibly help in any way?</p>

<p>It sounds as if the most recent save is corrupt, I've had this happen to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a USB stick or memory unit to hand try moving your Shepard onto that and starting the game without it plugged in. If the game starts normally then you know it is a corrupt save issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately if it is a corrupt save issue then it means you are going to have to start a fresh character.</p>

<h2>            Locked in as Guest account</h2>
                    <p>Lets try this again. I think it might have to do with me setting up an auto login thing on my PC, but I am locked in as a Guest account. I cannot change anything with the account. I log out and it is the only account available. I try to update anything and
 it UAC asks me to type in an Administer password, but will not let me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I could find on here. When I try NETPLWIZ, Windows cannot find it.
</p>
<p>I tried getting into "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon", but when I get to the "CurrentVersion" menu, "Winlogon" is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not allowed to alter anything and not allowed into some areas because I only have a Guests access.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find and fix issues related to Windows Search, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Search and Indexing troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) In the “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong></span>” on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d) Click on “<strong><em><span>Search and Indexing</span></em></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Click on “<span><strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click “<strong><em><span>Next</span></em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>

            That's odd. Usually entry point not found relates to corrupt system files.\
<br />Can you please do a disk check as well?

            Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.

<h2>            digital xbox live membership pending problem</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a 3 month of xbox live digital product membership and when I go to the order history it only says pending like it is not even downloading and I can't do anything to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone knows how to solve this or it is not a problem at all and I should just wait !?</p>
<p>
</p><p>by the way, I bought it from Microsoft store .</p>

<p>If it says pending, it's most likely waiting for the confirm purchase via email.</p>
<p>It also could be pending on Xbox's end.</p>
<p>If the problem proceeds after a few hours I recommend calling Xbox phone support to fix this issue.</p>

    <title>Erro ao processar pagamentos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wagnerwrc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Erro ao processar pagamentos</h2>
                    <p>Olá, depois de fazer 3 compras na Live, as outras tentativas esbarram em erro ao processar pagamento. Já verifiquei com minha operadora de cartão de crédito e nenhuma dessas requisições foram barradas pelo cartão. Além disso, troquei o cartão e o erro persiste. Há alguma trava na Live para permitir apenas 3 compras em um dado período de tempo? Ou alguma configuração que me permita estar livre para comprar? O detalhe é que eu ainda não estou com o console em mãos. Estou esperando a entrega. E as compras foram feitas apenas pela net ou pelo APP.&nbsp;</p>
