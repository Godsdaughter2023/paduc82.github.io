                    <p>I redeemed a 12-month Xbox&nbsp;live gold membership on my Xbox one but after doing so it still tells me that I don't have Xbox&nbsp;live. I've&nbsp;gone through the billing or whatever and it has recorded that I have redeemed the code for an Xbox&nbsp;live gold membership but still continues to tell me I don't have live when I try to play any games.</p>

            <p>Some time the console needs to be refreshed try power cycling the console to refresh the console with the new account information.&nbsp; If this does not work contact support by phone and have them refresh your account and then power cycle your console.&nbsp; Been told by others the second set work when the first step fails but most of the time just power cycling the console will fix this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi cstoltie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. It seems that you have an issue with the DVD drive not being recognized on Windows 8. This can be really frustrating
 for you and I appreciate the efforts that you have put in. Let us work together as a team try to get this issue fixed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us start with a few questions-</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you face a similar issue with other hardware components on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any other changes on the computer?</p>
<p>I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1-</p>
<p><span>I would have you run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Start” and type “troubleshooting” (without the quotations) and then select “Settings”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, Click on “view all”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run the “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2-</p>
<p>I would have you download and install the latest drivers for the hardware (including the firmware updates) from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>You can ask the manufacturer for assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3-</p>
<p>I would have you refer to the steps suggested by “<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b9e7c413-bf5b-4b02-8a63-3fa8d48da482">AtishayMSFT</a>”

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That kind of sounds like the button on the drive is getting a bad connection, unless I misunderstood the problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try going to COMPUTER and right clicking on the drive, and select EJECT and see if that works any better...</p>

    <title>Folder access path change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> root.ping  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder access path change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of recently, i have updated my computer with the new windows 10 creator's update and have experienced a change with my folders.<br />
When i went to access my photos folder through the file explorer i found it to be empty. The file path for it being: This PC &gt; Pictures.</p>
<p>Now i found all my other folders seemed to contain what they had before the update (documents, music. videos, etc.) but the pictures where the only one that was empty. When i went through: This PC &gt; Windows (C:) &gt; Users &gt;&nbsp;<em>myusername</em> &gt; pictures,
 i found that my pictures were located there instead.<br />
<br />
Rather than copy the pictures from my <strong>user picture folder</strong> to the
<strong>main picture folder</strong> (and have duplicates taking up space) could i change the location of the&nbsp;<strong>user picture folder
</strong>to replace the <strong>main picture folder</strong> in order to provide easy access and save time for me?<br />
<br />

<li><span>Press <strong>Windows + I</strong> to open <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>System</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Storage</strong> to see default file locations.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that all <strong>Save locations</strong> are set to <strong>This PC (C:).</strong></span></li></ol>

    <title>8.1, have dial-up, problem connecting. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ko57  say:</h3>
<h2>            8.1, have dial-up, problem connecting.</h2>
                    <p>Have Windows 8.1, and dial up internet using a&nbsp;US Robotics usb modem, worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started getting a 691 error, indicating either name or password incorrect (it's not-no changes), or the security protocol&nbsp;might be different from what the&nbsp;(ISP) servers use to verify.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started changing some of the settings in the Security tab, nothing is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Should have written&nbsp;down my settings before I started this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Dial Up&nbsp;Connection Properties window, can anyone suggest what settings to use for the Security tab?&nbsp; I do believe our ISP accepts unencrypted authentication.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Security tab</span> settings are:</p>
<p>for Data encryption I have selected&nbsp;"No encryption allowed" </p>
<p>for Allow these protocols I have checked the box for&nbsp;"Unencrypted password (PAP)"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Options tab, the button for PPP settings, I have Enable LCP extensions checked and Enable software compression checked.&nbsp; I just have my one laptop, I left unchecked Negotiate multi-link for single-link connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had downloaded the latest Windows updates, I don't know if that might have done something to my settings.&nbsp; If I can't get this going will check with my ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically looking for the default settings in the Dial up Connection Settings/Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you-</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue while connecting through dial up connection and getting error code 691. This issue can occur for any of the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have set up the CompuServe service from the Online Services folder on the Start menu and you have not connected to CompuServe by using the CompuServe software included in Windows 98.
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: <em>The CompuServe setup program does not complete until you connect to CompuServe to set up the default Dial-Up Networking setting.
</em></li></ul>
<em>
</em><p><em>
</em>
</p><ul>
<li>The Telephon.ini file is missing or damaged.</li><li>Your ISP uses a different file than the Rasapi32.dll file to verify the connection.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided in the article mentioned below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            My restore points disappear, particularly after a reboot.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm running Vista Home Premium SP1, 32 bit.The volume copy services are set to start manually (as they are on another machine where restore points work fine).</p>
<p>Windows 'backup' also can't see an earlier backup I did, says 'last successful backup N/A'.</p>
<p>I can create a restore point manually, but they disapear after a reboot - I think one lasted over one reboot but quickly disappeared after that.</p>
<p>I have plenty of space:</p>

<p>The two restore points I created this morning lasted over 2 restarts; then they disappeared, at around the same time I got a Windows message 'Mcafee service host stopped working and was closed'. Windows I think showed data execution prevention message. I
 had asked McAfee about this message, and been told to empty c:\programdata\mcafee\Hackerwatch\data folder - I'd done this and been told this would resolve it, tho' I've no idea why. However, it obviously hasn't worked.</p>
<p>I created another restore point and then tried to restore from it - I got 'host services for windows closed' and the system restarted itself. Is there a connection between the two 'host services closed' messages, one for mcafee, one for windows?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Some third-party tools can cause the deletion of restore points in Windows.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the third-party tool is allowed to run at boot time without running in Windows Pre-installation Environment (PE) or some version of Windows, any
 changes that the tool makes to the disk will cause Windows, once started, to invalidate and thus delete the restore points.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Why are the restore points deleted?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because if a tool makes a change to the volume without going through Volsnap.sys (the volume shadow copy driver), when Windows is started, it detects
 that it doesn’t have an accurate representation of the changes to the volume and thus can’t accurately reconstitute older versions of the file for System Restore (or any other application).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to&nbsp;</span><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">disable
 the antivirus software</a></span> (<span>Mcafee) software and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is fixed, you may have to contact the program manufacturer to know about the settings that can be changed or if there are any other
 updates for this program.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>Antivirus software can help
 protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. Running a computer without any security software can cause a potential threat to your computer. Hence, make sure to enable the Security Software once you are done with the test.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is not fixed, follow Method 2.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: Place the computer in Clean boot state to check which application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you
 may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in
 Windows 7:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure
 to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in </span><strong><span>Step 7</span></strong><span>

<h2>            File History and backup to a NAS</h2>
                    I have been trying to use file history in Windows 10 to back up to my NAS. It works to backup everything but the documents which it refuses to do unless an alteration has been made to the document. I have looked at other advice on the community pages and
 everything suggested doesnt work. so before i go off to third party solutions is there a way to sort this problem out? Thanks

            Hi Benj500
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Have you tried disabling the service fully then re-configuring it again?
<br />If that doesn't work then if you don't want to use say Veeam (which is what i use) then try creating a new local admin account and move your documents to that account and setup file history to see if it works.
<br />See link to create account.

<p>There's your problem. If you want to backup your personal folders, you need a backup program. That's not what File History was designed to do.</p>

            Thanks for your response. So that i am clear, by disabling you mean switch off the backup file history function and then restart and select the files i need to back up? Thanks<br />

            <p>This error occurs when you are trying to copy a corrupted file from the source.
</p>
<p>Windows will copy images till it reaches the corrupted file then it will stop, so it is easy to see which file is corrupted. I deleted the file and windows allowed me to copy all files from the source to the destination.</p>

            In true microsoft tradition there is no help with this problem, the best answer is to get a different media player because along with many other things in windows 10 the default player is buggy, microsoft is so intent on tracking everything you do that
 they really don't care about function as much as gathering sale-able information. I am using a third party media player and i have no problems playing the basic media files that windows 10 can't handle.

            I have also tried another player and its fine. I have three pc's and all have this issue. I have exchanged my lenovo pc from argos 3 times and the issue remains. I reinstalled the OS 3 times, issue remains. Its the default player, before the november update
 I never had this issue. Infact if i revert back to that update or windows 7, 8 or 8.1 everything is fine, So cleary this is proof the default player has a bug after the new update. Microsoft fix this issue please.

<h2>            Clock loops every hour or so</h2>
                    I've recently begun to have a problem where the system clock of my machine will loop after an hour or so. I've also noticed that the Windows clock does not seem to continue running when the machine is switched off. I've tried replacing the CMOS battery
 (and the entire motherboard) but neither has helped. <br />
<br />
After I replaced the motherboard, I did notice that the problem only began again shortly after I re-activated Windows but I'm not sure if that caused the problem or is just coincidence.

            By 'clock loops', I mean that approximately every hour, at the same number of minutes past the hour each time, the clock will jump back by one hour.
<br />
<br />
By 'Windows clock does not continue running', I mean that when I boot into Windows, the same time will be shown as when I shut down.<br />
<br />
I'm not currently at that machine but I will check the BIOS clock when I get home. That said, I suspect that this is a Windows problem rather than a hardware problem because I've already tried replacing the CMOS battery, and replacing the motherboard.<br />

            <p>Windows reads the time from the motherboard during boot so I would make sure the clock in the BIOS is correct.

=====================================<br />
Maybe your Escape key would allow the player to <br />
exit from full screen so you could see the controls.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run the Windows update troubleshooter, it will detect and resolve the most common issues with the Windows updates. To do so, follow the
 link below. You may also follow some other common solutions on the same articles.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-7</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Reset Windows Update components</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue is with the Windows update components, this method will resolve the issue by repairing all the components associated with it. Click
 on the link below and follow the article on the same.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate

<p>Exactly what is going on.</p>
<p>Outside&nbsp; I can see, inside the machine, I do not have a clue!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select to updates to Windows 10 in the fast mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 Insider Preview 17698 comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - getting ready to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 down loading</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Installing (here is where it goes awry) starts and the some where along the line, ofter about 70 some part of the installing process, IT JUST JUMPS BACK TO THE BEGINNING - meaning step 1, and then starts over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if that is not clear enough, I would be glad to phone you.</p>

            Troubleshooting an Insider build issue is not a good idea as the issue might be intermittent.
<br />Try Resetting Windows update-If that doesn't help wait for the next build.
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Patience is not a virtue in this case. The update initializes, then fails with an error code 0x80096004. I can't for the life of me find a solution. I have deleted the softwaredistribution folder and I have ran the troubleshooter, but nothing has fixed
 the issue.&nbsp;

Remove all 3rd part AV-software if you are using any.</p>

If those doesn't help you can run script that reset Windows update components.</p>

            Hi Fran, you can view Windows Defender "Operational" events in Event Viewer
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type event viewer and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Look under: Applications and Services Logs - Microsoft - Windows - Windows Defender.

            In Windows Defender tab, click the History tab
<br />Click View details
<br />There you should see any recently detected items 
<br />
<br />The Windows Defender scan results log files in the folders below are encrypted and cannot be viewed.
<br />
<br />"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Scans\History\Results\Quick"
<br />
<br />"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Scans\History\Results\Resource"
<br />
<br />
<br />However, you can view Windows Defender "Operational" events in Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) under Applications and Services Logs -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Windows Defender.

            In Win 10 you can search for Defender, then click on the History tab. At the bottom of the tab there is a "View Details" button.  It should be similar in WIn 8.

    <title>IDT sound driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjl1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            IDT sound driver</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 1703 installs a generic hd sound driver, this limits functionality of the hardware and software to just a minimal&nbsp;</p>
<p>function.</p>
<p>I have the IDT sound chip as well as amd hd (hdmi) audio, the amd driver was not affected as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>The IDT basic windows 10 driver did work when switching from speakers to external sound when plugged in.</p>
<p>Yes, IDT has been bought out and no longer supplies drivers any longer, but the OEM may still provide a
</p>
<p>full IDT driver.</p>
<p>I got the driver (win8) from hp support page for the g7 laptop.</p>
<p>Running the installer win displayed a message about the code c and possible issues with using it,</p>
<p>ignoring the warning, the driver installed correctly.</p>
<p>All functions of the original driver and software are as they should be and have not had any issues.</p>
<p>I have seen win10 1703 brake more audio drivers than any other os from microsoft or linux in the past&nbsp;</p>
<p>twenty years.</p>
<p>This includes hdmi, analog and digital formats on cpu's, motherboard audio chipset, and physical cards.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 10 will install the latest driver via Windows Update. It will install the latest drivers which are listed on the
<strong>Microsoft Update Catalog</strong>. Since your computer installs a generic driver, then it's possible that the driver developer of your device hasn't yet sent the most updated driver to our Microsoft Update Catalog website.<br />
<br />
To help resolve your concern, you can the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by following the steps provided below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>, and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select and run the <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>Should you have further questions, feel free to get back to us.</p>

<p>Since the latest updated driver for your HD driver is dated November 7, 2013, then it may not be compatible with the latest version of Windows which is Windows 10 Creators build, causing it to install a generic driver for your device. We suggest that you
 consult the manufacturer of your device regarding with the latest driver that is suitable for the latest build of Windows 10.</p>

            There is nothing useful at the XP Forums link. The only thing that pertains to this issue is this very same question thread.

<h2>            PaperMaster98</h2>
                    I am trying to run the SETUP.EXE program for installing PaperMaster98 on my Windows 8 (64 bit) laptop.&nbsp; The SETUP program ran OK on Windows 7 Pro 32 bit in compatibility mode but Windows 8 will not allow it to run in any compatibility mode.&nbsp; The owner

            <p>I have had the same problem with my upgrade and have rolled back to Windows 7 using a third party back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is marked as solved and yet the solution is to keep trying until it works! Hardly a solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading Win 7 to Win 10 with Omnipass installed is not an option. You could try uninstalling Omnipass prior to upgrading, I dont know how to do this from the Win 10 recovery screen I am not an IT expert.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode can be be achieved by cycling the PC off and on 3 times using the power button the only option when you cannot logon.&nbsp; Good luck, I'm sticking with Win 7 for now.</p>

            <p>I also had the same screen problem after installing Win10 with Omnipass.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Somehow, I don’t recall what exactly I did, but I interrupted the screen and got to the Win10:<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Settings</span> &gt; <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>
Recovery</span> &gt; <span>Go back to Windows 7</span> and I was able to restore my previous Windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Win10 provides for restoring the previous Windows for 30 days then it deletes the file (about 42GB on my PC).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Alternatively, if you had a system backup and system repair disk, you could boot to the repair disk from BIOS, and restore your previous operating system using your backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After restoring my previous Windows version, I uninstalled Omnipass, then reinstalled Win10 which resolved the screen problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then, I tried using Windows Hello which is the built-in Win10 system support for biometric authentication – using my fingerprint to logon but Windows Hello did not show up under Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You need a PC on the list of PCs that support Windows Hello in Win10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a 2010 Fujitsu T730 laptop with Omnipass, however the T730 was not tested nor supported by Fujitsu for the Win10 upgrade due to lack of support of
<span>&nbsp;</span>drivers/firmware by key component suppliers.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After upgrading to Win10 for one day, everything seems working except the fingerprint reader so I manually enter my password at the logon screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Even though my PC isn’t supported for the Win10 upgrade, by the manufacturer, Fujitsu, its working so far.</p>

            <p>I just removed OmniPass from my Fujitsu T901. I was able to get the screen interrupted (pressed a lot of keys, ended up at the boot menu screen and could get in there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 10: Control Panel, Programs and Features, (Select OmniPass and click Uninstall). Reboot required and all better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CAUTION: If you have encrypted things with OmniPass and then uninstall OmniPass, you lose access to whatever you encrypted (glad I didn't use it except for the fingerpoint reader).</p>

            <p>It took a while, but I was able to boot into safe mode pressing F5 and holding through the boot process.&nbsp; Windows does not like this and goes into frownie face mode stating that it needs to reboot.&nbsp; Once it actually goes into reboot, press F5 to go into
 safe mode.&nbsp; Access the task manager or the startup section of the new windows area for trouble shooting, then disable omnipass.&nbsp; Restart the system into windows and this should fix the problem.&nbsp; If not,&nbsp;I had to go all the way to reset with this problem, but
 you have to disable Omni pass first!&nbsp; Once disabled and reset, the system boots properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I also had this problem after a Win-7 to Win-10 upgrade.&nbsp; My laptop is a Fujitsu S751 (i5 class) with Omnipass vs. 7.00.61 (x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround is a little different; I was initially able to get into Win10 after installation of the upgrade, but subsequent reboots and log-ons ran into the same rapid screen refresh issue described.&nbsp; I had to force a hard power-down multiple times (and
 endured at least two disk integrity checks).&nbsp; However, I discovered that I had about 2-3 seconds when the log-on screen first appeared, before the rapid cycling began.&nbsp; After several unsuccessful attempts, I was able to type my password in fast enough to beat
 the refresh monster (hint: if you're upgrading, temporarily change your password to something real short and simple - I didn't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in (as Windows Admin), you can use Omnipass and the fingerprint reader within the user environment - the blinking/refresh issue went away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Log-in to Omnipass as Administrator and disable automatic start-up and single sign-on (may not be exactly that,
 but I'm not going back in as Windows Admin to look right now).&nbsp; Now, on the next reboot, Omnipass will run, but won't attempt to interrogate the&nbsp; fingerprint reader - you'll see the little application window at top, but it won't try to present the fingerprint
 scanner.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can then log-on to Windows normally as Admin or a User.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you are already in the initial Win 10 user environment as Admin, you can probably also uncheck the "Automatic" options for fingerprint reader and/or master password under the "Select Authentication Device" options in the little application Window.&nbsp;
 However, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also not sure if setting Omnipass to "Manual" before upgrading to Win10 from Win7 will solve the problem, but it may be worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Omnipass also continues to work as the BIOS authentication on my laptop, as long as I have the option to authenticate onward into Windows automatically disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I can at least use that past of the biometric authentication for my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I don't know if it really helps anything to keep Omnipass installed.&nbsp; I decrypted my Omnipass protected files and folders before upgrade, and don't seem to have a way to use Omnipass to encrypt now (menu pick not available when one right-clicks).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 However, it might help for someone who still has Omnipass-encypted files/folders (not sure how, but hope springs eternal).&nbsp; Other than initial log-on, and a few files on this laptop,&nbsp; I wasn't a big Omnipass user, so I don't know if there's some feature I
 might still use that's available (i.e. Website authentication?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pity that there doesn't seem to be a patch available from Omnipass or Fujitsu for this, but I haven't found one.&nbsp; My guess is there won't be, at least not for the older versions.&nbsp; They've probably fixed it for the current Win10 laptops with fingerprint
 readers (I hope?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, for those of you with SSDs and/or i7s, if the pre-upgrade option doesn't work, I'm not sure you'll ever get enough time to type in your password - there just may not be enough lag.&nbsp; I didn't upgrade my other laptop with SSD, and I probably won't.&nbsp;
 I like Win10 OK, but I Iike being able to use the full functionality of the fingerprint reader while I'm traveling more.</p>

<p>I also had this problem after a Win-7 to Win-10 upgrade.&nbsp; My laptop is a Fujitsu S751 (i5 class) with Omnipass vs. 7.00.61 (x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround is a little different; I was initially able to get into Win10 after installation of the upgrade, but subsequent reboots and log-ons ran into the same rapid screen refresh issue described.&nbsp; I had to force a hard power-down multiple times (and
 endured at least two disk integrity checks).&nbsp; However, I discovered that I had about 2-3 seconds when the log-on screen first appeared, before the rapid cycling began.&nbsp; After several unsuccessful attempts, I was able to type my password in fast enough to beat
 the refresh monster (hint: if you're upgrading, temporarily change your password to something real short and simple - I didn't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in (as Windows Admin), you can use Omnipass and the fingerprint reader within the user environment - the blinking/refresh issue went away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Log-in to Omnipass as Administrator and disable automatic start-up and single sign-on (may not be exactly that,
 but I'm not going back in as Windows Admin to look right now).&nbsp; Now, on the next reboot, Omnipass will run, but won't attempt to interrogate the&nbsp; fingerprint reader - you'll see the little application window at top, but it won't try to present the fingerprint
 scanner.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can then log-on to Windows normally as Admin or a User.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you are already in the initial Win 10 user environment as Admin, you can probably also uncheck the "Automatic" options for fingerprint reader and/or master password under the "Select Authentication Device" options in the little application Window.&nbsp;
 However, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also not sure if setting Omnipass to "Manual" before upgrading to Win10 from Win7 will solve the problem, but it may be worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Omnipass also continues to work as the BIOS authentication on my laptop, as long as I have the option to authenticate onward into Windows automatically disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I can at least use that past of the biometric authentication for my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I don't know if it really helps anything to keep Omnipass installed.&nbsp; I decrypted my Omnipass protected files and folders before upgrade, and don't seem to have a way to use Omnipass to encrypt now (menu pick not available when one right-clicks).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 However, it might help for someone who still has Omnipass-encypted files/folders (not sure how, but hope springs eternal).&nbsp; Other than initial log-on, and a few files on this laptop,&nbsp; I wasn't a big Omnipass user, so I don't know if there's some feature I
 might still use that's available (i.e. Website authentication?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pity that there doesn't seem to be a patch available from Omnipass or Fujitsu for this, but I haven't found one.&nbsp; My guess is there won't be, at least not for the older versions.&nbsp; They've probably fixed it for the current Win10 laptops with fingerprint
 readers (I hope?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, for those of you with SSDs and/or i7s, if the pre-upgrade option doesn't work, I'm not sure you'll ever get enough time to type in your password - there just may not be enough lag.&nbsp; I didn't upgrade my other laptop with SSD, and I probably won't.&nbsp;
 I like Win10 OK, but I Iike being able to use the full functionality of the fingerprint reader while I'm traveling more.</p>

<p>My experience was similar to COGringo's: Fujitsu notebook/tablet T4310. I had not tried the fingerprint reader until 2+ months after upgrade from W7 to W10 (which went too smoothly &amp; so I was suspicious....). Was also planning to replace HDD w/ SSD &amp; glad
 I ran into this before that process. No encrypted files or BIOS protection involved.</p>
<p>Was able to enter admin PW somehow despite quick refreshes of Omnipass. Uninstalled biometric device in Dev Mgr, uninstalled Softex &amp; Authentec pgms using Revo Uninstaller to be sure I killed all traces.</p>
<p>Will post any new results after reboot if necessary - gotta watch some football now.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update service keep getting enabled</h2>
                    I do not want Windows updates except for critical security patches &amp; Defender updates.&nbsp; I have stopped the Windows Update service &amp; disabled it.&nbsp; I have disabled automatic Windows store app updates &amp; made my network a metered connection.&nbsp; However, when
 I check the Update service from time to time, it is started &amp; enabled.&nbsp; How is this happening? &nbsp; Since it appears there are no longer ways to select which updates one gets or turn off hardware updates to stop my drivers from getting whacked, I don't know what
 else to do to stop updates or at least control which ones I get.&nbsp; Can anyone educate me on why the Update service starts itself even though it is in a stopped, disabled state?&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW, I do not want the Windows Creators update installed on my pcs.

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixes to identified bugs with the version that you're using are released via Windows Update therefore users can expect continuous release from Microsoft. The updates that we release are deemed as applicable to all users as it is either aims to resolve issues
 or add features to your device. We usually recommend keeping the default setting of the operating system when it comes to updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've experienced performance issues after installing a Windows Update, you can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/901037/how-to-enable-and-to-disable-microsoft-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to know more about how to temporarily prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Fall Creators Update (version 1709), users have the option to pause updates up to 35 days. This is an added feature based on the feedback that we've received from our users. In
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">metered data connections</span></strong>, downloading of major Windows Update is deferred until the feature is turned off. To make sure that these types of updates doesn't get through, you just need to disable
 it in Advanced options under the Windows Update section.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32ffe053-5619-45f3-9b3e-d975adb97e94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32ffe053-5619-45f3-9b3e-d975adb97e94" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Having an option to choose which update to install is a brilliant idea. We'd recommend sending our team a message via the Feedback Hub application on your device and tell us what you'd like to see in Windows 10. This will help our team to improve the features,
 functionality, and performance of the software. To do this, you can perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Cortana search</strong>, then launch the app.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Feedback</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the left menu, then press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Important:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Begin monitoring</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Stop
 monitoring</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>when you’re done.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Submit</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>My feedback</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).</span></p>
<p><span>8. Open the item you submitted, then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Share</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>9. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Copy link</strong>, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aka.ms/%3cunique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://aka.ms/&lt;unique</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>link&gt;).</span></p>

    <title>How to remove password protection on screen timeout&#47;screen lock - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexandra.l  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove password protection on screen timeout&#47;screen lock but keep it on wake up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just updated Windows 10 to the latest version (1709) and now it requires my PIN every time the screen locks, not just on wake up or after a longer time of inactivity. The previous version didn't and considering I mainly use my laptop at home, in a safe
 place, I believe I don't need that much security. Is there a way to make it only ask for my PIN on wake up and to end the screen timeout with the pressing of any key (like it was before the update)? Or is this permanent with the change?</p>
