<h2>            After restart audio driver not loaded &#47; enabled</h2>
                    <p>When I restart my Windows 10 64 bit laptop I must open my Audio driver and manually disable and enable again in order to get it working.</p>
<p>How could I force that audio device driver to be loaded+enabled+working?</p>
<p>I notice it is not working since the light of the mute button on the keyboard doesn't work and my Bang &amp; Olufsen setting panel doesn't start.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Missing folders using robocopy GUI</h2>
                    I am trying out Robocopy GUI v3.1.2.0 by Derk Benisch. I am trying to copy my entire Documents folder (including all subfolders), but I only get the first subfolder (and in turn, that folder's first subfolder). I have selected the "/E" copy option, and
 I have also tried setting the "/LEV" at 4 levels, but I get the same results. What am I doing wrong? I am trying the GUI because I can't get my syntax to work on the cmd prompt.

            Well, nobody replied, so I ended up trying SyncToy instead and it has worked perfectly for my needs. I've uninstalled the Robocopy GUI.

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean you have trouble in sign into your Skype for Business? Please kindly note that we need to use an Exchange account instead of a outlook.com account to sign into Skype for Business. If you are using an Exchange account, please try the following
 steps to resolve it<span>。</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please update your Skype for Business to the latest version. You can open any of the Office application, for example, Outlook, then update your Office suite by referring to this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5.</a></p>
<p>If the issue still exists, please do the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>To determine if the issue is caused by any other program on your computer, reboot your computer with clean boot. Please refer to this article:<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>.</li><li>Repair your Skype for Business client by&nbsp;<strong>Quick Repair</strong>. Same as above, you can open Outlook to perform it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to the Repair Office from the Control Panel part of this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a>&nbsp;.</li><li>Change another network environment for example, you home network to see if same issue happens.</li><li>Is there any error message when the issue happens. If yes, Please send it to us, a screenshot would be better.</li><li>The version of Skype for Business client. You can check it by opening the Skype for Business client&gt; Settings&gt;Help&gt;About Skype for Business.&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>            Music , video , DVD , CD and audio files fail after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    My desktop computer is a multi SATA drive computer. I have Unbuntu 12.04 on one drive , Windows XP on another drive and did have Windows 7 until the upgrade three days ago. The functionality is fine for all media types on the other two drives so that precludes
 hardware troubles. That makes it driver / .dll troubles. I try to click on and play a WMA file and get an error of 0x00d11d2 0x80070005 and 0xc00d1204. It then jumps out of that file and pulls up Groove music and will play nothing there instead producing the
 error code plus then showing music I don't have on my PC. If I click on one of those albums and a song it says it's playing them but the actual timer progress bar is not moving.&nbsp; Clicking on a .AVI file and&nbsp; the system says it does not support those files.
 Putting in a DVD and you get no video and no audio. Trying to play Itunes or Windows Media player and clicking on any selection and I note that even thought the system says it has selected that file and is playing

            &nbsp;I've rolled back my computer to Windows 7 to get back some of the features. Since then I found out that DVD players will not work like they used to in Wiondows Media player so you need a 3rd party software to make them run in Windows 10. I found out the
 upograde eliminated all my DRM markers for every song I copied on from CD's. I found out that the permissions for Itunes also got trashed out. Messing up the DRM also messes up the player to play any videos that I did with my camera that are all .AVI files.
 All in all it appears that upgrade to windows ten trashed out a bunch of files.

                    <p>This evening I used the build in Windows 10 Camera app on my Surface Pro 4 to record several video clips. However, when I try and open them with Windows Media Player or VLC, I get errors saying "Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might
 not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." or the Windows Movies &amp; TV app says "Can't play. Try playing something else. This item's file format may be unsupported, the file extension may be incorrect, or the

<p>
</p><p>Other videos that I also recorded using the same build in app do work. How can I view these other videos?</p>

<h3> lemongrel  say:</h3>
<h2>            File transfer from Mac in Target Disk Mode to Windows 7 via Firewire</h2>
                    Hi there I do hope you can help...<br />
<br />
I'm trying to transfer my music collection from a Mac running OSX onto my Windows 7 laptop PC.<br />
<br />
Have just forked out for a firewire cable and am trying to get that working.<br />
<br />
Have switched the Mac into "Target Disk Mode" which makes it behave just like an external hard drive and plugged it into my laptop via firewire.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 recognises an "SBP2 Compliant IEEE 1394 device" has been plugged in.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER - I cannot browse the Mac's files. Under Devices and Printers the H: Drive appears but it is not browsable.<br />
<br />
Have tried all three IEEE 1394 drivers, and interestingly "1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy)" driver is the only one where a "Browse" tab appears in the Devices and Printers bit. However when i open the drop down, a H:\ appears, but it is greyed
 out and not clickable.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Apolgies for the long post and thanks in advance.<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business in O365 OWA</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday I had Skype in my Outlook Web Access. I clicked something and now I don't get the option in OWA to be online with Skype. I also went into calendar and I dont see the option for setting up a skype meeting anymore. I then went into People and my
 contacts that have skype are no longer showing as online or offline and the IM shows the email address but no link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can launch Skype for Business desktop app/program and that works fine. It is only not working in my OWA. I did check to make sure I have licenses for it associated to my account. I will guess I disabled something and I cannot find the option to re-enable
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love any suggestions as I use OWA all the time.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>New Skype for Windows Desktop No Option to Synch Address Book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bpet_59  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype for Windows Desktop No Option to Synch Address Book</h2>
                    <p>I am on Windows 7 and my Skype 7 was just upgraded to Skype 8.13.0.3. After the upgrade I lost my Outlook contacts that were available in version 7. When I click on Search Skype I do not get an option "Synch Your Address Book". When I go to Application Settings/Privacy,
 I do not get the option to turn on the address book synchronization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this option available in Skype 8? If not I am going back to Skype 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that is correct. The option to synchronize your local address book with the new Skype version is currently unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as per your messenger contacts, please be informed that Skype will&nbsp;no longer retain messenger contacts that does not have a Skype account. They will be removed on your contact list and only messenger contacts with Skype account will be left along with
 your local Skype contacts. For more information regarding this, you may refer to this FAQ article:

<p>vista and win 7 machines are retaining driver files in system32/driverstore/filerepository. Specifically for mobile broadband usb dongles after software uninstall. as a result different carrier dongles from the same manufacturer will not auto install(PnP)
 and requires an extensive manual install process. if anyone can help i'd be graeful. im confident manually deleting the files from the repositotory will resolve. at the moment any attempt to manually delete these files.is met wih a system permission error
 regardless of administration rights</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi orangedaddy,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 we connect a device, windows would normally load the generic drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact permission error are you getting?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you getting ‘Access is denied’ error message?</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>If yes, you may go through the steps outlined in the below article to get rid of the error message:<br />

<p><span>3. Look for the problem device, right click on it and select<strong>Uninstall.<br />
</strong><br />
4. Place a check mark for "delete driver software for this device" when prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Restart the computer.</span></p>

 have a damn clean machine now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand SP1 is outdated and going away.&nbsp; I understand Vista is ____ in a cup, so we don't have to waste time talking about either issue.&nbsp; I just want a fix for the machine and then I can move on to other updates, so are there any ubergeeks out there
 who can work the problem with me?<br />

===========================================================</p>
<p><strong>Bug Check 0xE4: WORKER_INVALID</strong></p>
<p>The WORKER_INVALID bug check has a value of 0x000000E4. This indicates that memory that should not contain an executive worker item does contain such an item, or that a currently active worker item was queued.</p>
Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact
 Support</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Resolving STOP (Blue Screen)
 Errors in Windows</span></a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors. </li></ol>
WORKER_INVALID Parameters
<p>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. Parameter 1 indicates the code position.<br />
<br />
0x0&nbsp; Address of worker item -&nbsp; Start of pool block -&nbsp; End of pool block - An active worker item was freed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
0x1&nbsp; Address of worker item -&nbsp; Queue number -&nbsp; 0 -&nbsp; An active worker item was queued.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
0x2&nbsp; Address of worker item&nbsp; -&nbsp; Address of I/O worker routine&nbsp; - 0 - A queued I/O worker item was freed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
0x3&nbsp; Address of worker item -&nbsp; Address of invalid object - 0 -&nbsp; An attempt was made to initialize an I/O worker item with an invalid object.</p>
Cause
<p>This is usually caused by a driver freeing memory which still contains an executive worker item.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.</p>
<p>As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>&#124; Windows has encountered a critical problem and will restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark jidon  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#124; Windows has encountered a critical problem and will restart automatically in one minute. Please save your work now. &#124; Windows Explorer has stopped working. &#124;</h2>
                    <div><b>PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME READING THIS BECAUSE I HAVE PUT MY TIME IN TO WRITING ALL INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP YOU SOLVE MY PROBLEM!</b> (When I started the sfc /scannow, I finished the verification phase before I had time finishing writing this .-.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have seen quiet a few of these threads online but none of them helped me. I suddenly began having this problem today in the morning (Currently on Safe-Mode with Networking). I've been trying to fix it since then. If I start on a Normal Start-Up it loads then
 I get the window explorer error which then disappears and eventually I get the critical problem.&nbsp;
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>I have scanned my laptop in Safe Mode with Sophos and Malwarebytes. Sophos only reached around 5% then I stopped it because it was taking forever (3 hours), my Malwarebytes(Pro) was running with it. It detected "47" objects...o_O.</b> Anyways, it
<b>took forever too so I stopped the scan</b> when it was around 3 hours. I deleted all of the objects that was scanned. I ran the Start Up and get the same results.<b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>I then ran a Clean Boot which fixed the Critical Error!&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;-- But, when I go into a folder (Maplestory HackShield folder), the "Windows Explorer has stopped working" pops up. The screen disappears but then comes back as it restarts the explorer.exe. I kept trying to access the folder but ended with same results.
 I tried to access it one last time and after the Windows Explorer popped up my screen turns black, then shows my laptop's wallpaper but none of my programs were on it. I tried to manually restart it by going to Start Task Manager and running explorer.exe but
 I get nothing. Before that I already have tried the&nbsp;kb976586 when I could run it on normal start up without my laptop shutting down T_T.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I go online on my tablet to try to solve this problem and saw that I<b> had to do a CHKDSK /r</b>. After hours of waiting it was finished and when I ran on Normal Start up to my User (with Administrator rights) the<b> whole problem restarted T_T.
</b>As in I get the Critical Error again but this time I was in a Clean Boot. <b>
Not an entirely 100%</b> Clean Boot though. <b>I turned on all the Sophos and Malwarebytes services and Google Update along with Adobe Flash/Acrobat service.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>I've just finished doing a Verifying phase of System Scan</b> (sfc /scannow), I'm now going to reboot.</div>
<div>- The log is very long and Pastebin doesn't allow me to paste it there as it passes the size limit of 500 kilobytes. If you want to see the log just say something in the comments.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>- Extra info on what might be causing it -</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>My laptop's battery is quite old (almost 3 years) so I started taking it out when I'm on AC (I'm always on AC -.-), I started taking my battery about 2 days ago (First time running my laptop without battery on AC). I pulled the battery out WHILE MY LAPTOP
 IS ON and is connected to AC , which I think was a terrible mistake.&nbsp;</li><li>I didn't have this problem yesterday. I've just updated my Razor Gamebooster (yesterday) and enabled it to start on start up. Might be that but that's not the problem because I've uninstalled it.</li><li>My father restarted the internet yesterday. I've seen lots of people saying thay get the Critical Problem when their WiFi was on. Might be because of that too.</li></ul>
<b>Thank you for taking your time in reading this. All help and comment is appreciated.</b></div>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><u><span>PROBLEM TITLE:</span></u><span>&nbsp; The error message I was getting was: "Windows has encountered a critical problem and will restart automatically in one minute.&nbsp; Shutdown …."&nbsp; The message was in a small window which poped up on top of all other windows.&nbsp;
 Then in one minute the computer shut down and restarted.&nbsp; This happened over and over again.&nbsp; Key Words:&nbsp; PC, Windows 7, MSIE 11, Restart, Critical problem, Services, Internet Connection, SmartSwipe Scanner.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>SHORT TERM FIX/ WORK AROUND:</span></u><span>&nbsp; I was able to get around the problem in a limited manner.&nbsp; I found that the computer and my software all operated OK if I disconnected it from the internet (pulled the plug).&nbsp; Of course anything that
 required the internet wouldn't work.&nbsp; I also found that I could operate in the safe mode with the network operating with obvious software limitations (such as the Office products which couldn't find their license info).&nbsp; This allowed me to read my email and
 search for solutions to my problem.&nbsp; I found others who had the same resulting problem, but it appeared for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; One hint that appeared promising was that the problem included a faulty driver, but identifying it was not straight forward.
 Problems went back to 2008.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>IMPORTANT CONDITIONS:</span></u><span>&nbsp; I think the nature of my computer was unimportant except my OS was Windows 7 and the Internet Explorer was Version 11 (as it turns out this was important).&nbsp; The computer was a Dell XPS5700. I use Chrome primarily
 as my Browser, but have the MSIE as the default browser.&nbsp; As it turned out this was important in misleading me while trying to figure out the problem.&nbsp; I did a system restore and used my computer for hours after that with no problems (I thought the problem
 had been resolved).&nbsp; In hind sight I did not use the MSIE during that time, which was why it worked (not the system restore).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM:</span></u><span> (I wanted you to get my introduction before telling you this)?&nbsp; It was resolved and the computer is back to normal.&nbsp; The bottom line was a software conflict between an internal SERVICE and the Internet Explorer
 version 11.&nbsp; It involved a specific device which had been operating on this computer and an earlier computer which used the XP OS &nbsp;(if you have the problem it may be some other device and/or service).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>SPECIFIC ISSUE:</span></u><span>&nbsp; In my case I had a SmartSwipe credit card reader installed on my computer which operated in MS Internet Explorer (IE), but not in Chrome.&nbsp; I had installed it on my computer when the computer was new (July 2013)
 and it worked fine.&nbsp; Because I normally use the Chrome browser I did not use it often (it was connected to a USB port).&nbsp; Between July 2013 and November 2013 my MS IE updated to versions 10, then 11 (this was done somewhat automatically).&nbsp; As it turns out the
 SmartSwipe device and its software SERVICE were not compatible with any MSIE version greater than 9.&nbsp; I learned this after the problem was solved.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>USEFULL SUPPORT:</span></u><span> I have to give DELL Support credit for working me through about 7-8 hours of trying to figure out the problem.&nbsp; First they ran numerous malware packages on my computer.&nbsp; Absolutely NO problems of any kind were defined
 (I routinely run PC Pitstop software on my computer, which identified nothing).&nbsp; The Support Technician was about to set me up to reinstall my Windows 7 OS.&nbsp; Knowing this would then entail weeks of work to get my software running again, I balked at that and
 suggested we do some more research first.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM SOFTWARE:</span></u><span>&nbsp; The search and some thinking lead us to checking out the computer &nbsp;SERVICES through the MSCONFIG command.&nbsp; By turning off all NON- Microsoft SERVICES and finding that the problem went
 away (By rebooting and starting up MSIE).&nbsp; We then turned on about 5 services at a time followed by rebooting and start up of MSIE.&nbsp; This we did until the error reoccurred.&nbsp; Then we narrowed it down to one service which we turned off and on multiple times&nbsp;
 to be assured that it was the culprit.&nbsp; The actual service found was NETSECSvc of NetSource Technologies Ltd.&nbsp; [Do not look for this service unless your problem is directly tied to the SmartSwipe device.]&nbsp; Should your problem continue when you turn off all
 NON-Microsoft services, you may have a different issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>THE REAL REASON:</span></u><span>&nbsp; Why does this error and restarting of the computer occur when there is a conflict with MSIE, I have no idea.&nbsp; From our research it obviously occurs for other reasons.&nbsp; Someone at MicroSoft should know the answer.&nbsp;
<u>Suffice it to say I have my computer back in working order and the problem was not from a virus or from being hacked</u>.&nbsp; That in itself was encouraging.&nbsp; Obviously, it would have been better for me if the card swiper just didn't work.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>PROTOCOL FOR IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM SOFTWARE:</span></u><span> Should you have a related problem in Windows 7. &nbsp;First see if it goes away in Safe Mode.&nbsp; If it does, click on the Start button and in the search box type MSCONFIG, a window will come
 up with tabs.&nbsp; Click on the SERVICES tab.&nbsp; Then check on the&nbsp; "Hide all Microsoft Services".&nbsp; Then uncheck all the remaining services.&nbsp; Click Apply, then OK.&nbsp; Now restart your computer in normal mode, when it has restarted click on MSIE and see what happens.&nbsp;
 If no error occurs, restart MSCONFIG.&nbsp; Select SERVICES, make sure you check "Hide all MS Services", then start turning on the services until the error occurs again when you restart and bring up MSIE. [When the error occurs you may not be able to restart the
 computer manually.&nbsp; Just let the error do the restarting.]&nbsp; Once you think you've found the culprit, try turning it on and off a few times to verify that it is the one, then turn on the other services by checking them.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><u><span>AN ALTERNATIVE SHORT TERM SOLUTION FOR MY SPECIFIC ISSUE:</span></u><span> One alternate solution to the above one is to reinstall MSIE at an earlier version to see if that eliminates the problem.&nbsp; This may be necessary if the service you turn off
 is important to your operation.&nbsp; Having identified the problem service you may see if there is an update for it.&nbsp; [I think my SmartSwipe device is no longer supported, so that was not an option.&nbsp; I still have my older computer which uses the OS Windows XP
 and is limited to MSIE version 8.&nbsp; So I moved the device back to it.]</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I hope these details will be useful to others who can fix their computer in a much shorter time than it took me.</span></p>

<h2>            Two display adapters....can I delete one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since last week I have a problem that when I logon to my Microsoft account on my laptop, my screen sometimes goes black and starts to flicker and I can´t do anything. But then as by magic, sometimes it works fine the login and I can continue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now noticed that I have actually 2 display adapters listed in my device manager.
</p>
<p>* AMD Radeon HD 8730M</p>
<p>* Intel HD Graphics 4000 </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the Intel is the original one which came with the laptop and the other one was installed when I did a driver update back in August...Can this be the cause? Is it safe for me to uninstall the AMD driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated</p>

            <p><strong>A lot of system do have two display devices, one on the processor (integrated grapgics) - the Intel HD Graphics, the other is a separate chip or graphics card - the AMD Radeon.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Modern systems switch between these cards depending on the load being put on the graphics system, Windows and Word would use the Intel HD Graphics, whereas games, video editing . . . etc. would use the AMD Radeon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the website of the manufacturer of your system, enter the exact Model No. to get the specification of your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is the case that you do not have an AMD Radeon Graphics Card, try uninstalling it from Device Manager!</p>

<h2>            Want to install Windows media player 11 32 bit, but comes up reading missing pch.dll</h2>
                    Afternoon anyone. I've been trying to install Media Player 11 (32 bit) on my Windows XP Home edition service pack 3. At first I was getting VALIDATE message, I DL'ed the exe.(Genuinecheck) ran it, to be able to copy &amp; paste the code it gave me to authenticate,&nbsp;
 but I was getting message reading that way off VALIDATION was no longer supported, &amp; that I needed a newer version, so after calling MS I got a link to another form of VALIDATION, (legitcheck) I run that, says don't close that page, then it reads, Welcome,
 your Windows Genuine and directs me to a pop up @ MS site where I looked for Media Player 11, after I DL that and run, error message is, pch.dll is missing. I ran RUN&gt;sfc exe /scannow,it starts up, then halfway through it asks for my CD. Now I purchased this
 XP a while ago. Looked until 3AM for it in every possible place it can be and didn't find it. Now I'm not able to install Windows Media player 11 32 bit because of it. In Local Disk C I can find directory (

            <p><span>Hi</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to install other application, program without any issue?</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for the CD to perform a System File Checker, and as you said you do not have the installation CD so now you have to contact the manufacturer or the
 OEM (<strong><span>original equipment manufacturer</span></strong>).</span></p>
<p><span>However, as a work around you may run the fixit from the following link and check if it makes any difference:</span></p>

            Ty, but I've done all that. Seems like I'll just have to use Klite, or VLC.&nbsp; What really bothers me is, with all the $ Mr. gates has, they won't even assist a person who purchased a valid copy of Windows. Something about being out dated &amp; Upgrading. Once
 again, us lil ppl are obsolete. Thanz anyways.<br />

<h2>            Halo&#58; Spartan Assault purchased on phone, but can&#39;t download on PC</h2>
                    I purchased Halo: Spartan Assault on my Windows Phone back in December 2013, and the latest update allows us to install the game on a Windows 8.1 PC as well for free, but when I go to the store, it prompts me to purchase the game again. I don't want to
 do that since I obviously already own it. Any suggestions?

<p>What is the complete version of Windows 7 you have installed? </p>
<p>Are you connected to a workplace or school network domain?</p>
<p>From what you described, changing the background may have been disabled in Group Policy. If you are the administrator, follow the steps below to allow changing the background, otherwise, you will need to contact the system administrator/IT group of your
 school or company.</p>

<p>Acabo de comprar el Black Ops 2 en el market de Xbox, "A petición", y el juego vino en español. Cuando lo descargué, no me preguntó en que idioma lo quería descargar, pero lo quiero en inglés. Ya intenté cambiar el idioma de la consola y la región y nada.
 Alguien conoce alguna forma de cambiar el idioma de español a inglés?</p>
