                    <p>One of a few questions re: a new HP x360 Spectre convertible laptop that I purchased Dec 8 from BestBuy, I've already reset the machine once and thus far have only tried to set up. Has OEM Win10 home and McAfee trial software preinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are old files lingering around, just curious why a 1997 file "REBOOT.ME" is still lingering, why date modified is newer than date created, and why the access date doesn't change?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’m glad to provide you with these steps which will help you to resolve issue with
</span><span>Windows xp booting to advanced option mode</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Uncheck Safe Boot options in msconfig and check if the issue occurs, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select an option when the
<b>Windows Advanced Options</b> menu appears, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "<b>Safe Mode</b>" appear in blue at the bottom.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After booting to desktop, Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>.</span></p>

            I don't think any of those Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" Methods are going to work since:<br />
<br />
If you can't boot, you will not get past <b>Method 1</b>, right?<br />
If you can't boot, you will not get past <b>Method 2</b>, right?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.
<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are not seeing the most important option which is:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

            This sounds like a permissions issue to me (it doesn't sound like a corrupt profile) - you are trying to use her files under your username and the system wants her username.&nbsp; The solution is to give your username full rights to all folders in her profile
 and then to take ownership of all files in her profile - then you'll have the rights you need.<br />
<br />
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read
 only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp; You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop
 this except protect the folder with a password using a 3rd party product).&nbsp; This should also give you access to open and work with all of the files in these filders as if they were in your folder.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></a><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.<br />
</span></span></span></span><span><br />
You can also create a folder in your profile named the other person's username and move the files to this folder.&nbsp; It should pick up the permissions and attributes of the new folder (YOUR user profile folder) and you won't need to go to her profile every time
 you want to get one of her files.&nbsp; You may still need to change permissions and/or ownership if you do this - it would just make things easier and quicker to access.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></p>

<h2>            HID.dll error on Windows 7 start up</h2>
                    So whenever I start my computer up, I get this error message:<br />
<br />
" <span>C:\Windows\system32\HID.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support."<br />
<br />
I'm able to get past it but then some things on my computer don't work. Right now I'm missing my volume controls and I can't get them back.<br />
<br />
I'm running a 64 bit installation of 7 on a custom built computer.<br />

<p>Esta informação só tem aqui e não na embalagem do jogo físico.</p>

    <title>HOW TO STOP PROGRAMS BEING AUTOMATICALLY SHUT FROM LOW MEMORY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seannewey  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW TO STOP PROGRAMS BEING AUTOMATICALLY SHUT FROM LOW MEMORY</h2>
                    Is there any way to stop programs being shut without any warning? Sometimes there will be "low memory warnings" which often results in memory demanding processes shutting down/crashing but sometimes it happens for seemly no reason. If there is any way
 to make the computer persevere with a program (even lagging for a while?!?!) as opposed to closing it at the slightest sign of reaching RAM capacity?

<p>Hi Tadashra</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really in favour of your reply. The original requestor Sean Newey wants to know how to STOP Windows 10 from automatically terminating a program when memory is low. Regardless of your suggestion of whether we choose to increase the pagefile size or
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that this problem started on my PC after a Windows Update completed. It's a (KB#######) update which causes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me identify the update KB number. I would like to uninstall it from my PC.</p>

    <title>Group Policy Power Profiles Have Issues on Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Group Policy Power Profiles Have Issues on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Setting the "Sleep after -&nbsp; Plugged in"&nbsp;in a GPO to anything will not change the sleep settings in a power plan on the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to change the "Turn off Display after" setting to affect the Sleep settings. This is backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recreate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create a new Power Plan in a group policy and apply it to an OU with a Surface 3 Pro in it</li><li>In Sleep - Sleep After - Plugged in (minutes): Set the time to "0"</li><li>Force a Gpupdate on the Surface Pro 3</li><li>Goto your newly created Power Plan and "Change Plan Settings"</li><li>The "Put the Computer to sleep" for the plugged in profile will not have changed.</li><li>Go back to your GPO</li><li>In Display - Turn off display after - Plugged in (minutes): Set it to "0"</li><li>Force a Gpupdate on the Surface Pro 3</li><li>Goto your newly created Power Plan and "Change Plan Settings"</li><li>The "Put the Computer to sleep" for the plugged in profile will have changed.</li></ol>
<p>I have tried this on 3 Surface Pros and they all act the same.</p>

            Just reported this too. &nbsp;Completely broken. &nbsp;There is no way I can figure out to prevent the unit from putting the monitors to sleep when using a dock and 2 monitors. &nbsp;I set it for 4 hours and the monitors still go to sleep no matter what I do.

            <p>Thanks for the response. Sorry it has been so long since I responded back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using WIndows 8.1 Pro and we are using about 10 of them and they all are acting the same except for one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the surface that "works" in the "Edit Plan Settings" under "Power Options" there are two options to choose before opting to change the Advanced Settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn off the display</p>
<p>2. Adjust Plan brightness</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the surfaces that do not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Put Computer to Sleep</p>
<p>2 Adjust plan brightness</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting the "Turn off display after" in the GPO will change the first entry on the "Edit Plan Settings" in "Power Settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense. I can provide pictures if you need them.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 remote desktop immediately disconnects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 remote desktop immediately disconnects</h2>
                    <p>I have a Win10 HP Micro Proliant box acting as the home server and a Win10 laptop for work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I remote desktop into the server, I can work fine for a short period, then I get a popup saying remote desktop has ended because another user has connected to the box. Of course, that's not true, since I am the only user at home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This short period can last 1 or 2 seconds to a minute or so. When I am in, I can use the remote box normally. Retrying multiple times still give the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is my parents also have a Win10 HP Micro Proliant box as the server with a Win8 desktop. Remoting from Win8 to Win10 shows the same problem. Of course, before I upgraded all the boxes to Win10, there was no issue whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am puzzled as to what the cause can be. Can someone help?</p>

    <title>Problems with Skype update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielkidgell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Skype update</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype daily for the past 3 years and this new one is absolute rubbish. Clearly UX was not part of the thought process here. Also, you really should ask people if they want to upgrade. I had seen it on other users' computers and was not
 interested in "upgrading" at all. 2 days later, it did it, itself. I can't view pdfs easily, some of my contacts don't receive the messages. How do I go back to the version I had?</p>

            Sadly, although that is a "solution", it's not really a solution. Eventually MS will stop supporting it and then will force us to "upgrade" again to the newer version, which will still lack in important functionality. Like disabling the stupid link preview
 stuff. You can't do that in the new version. *sigh*

</p><p>Everything doesn't work .. no contacts/cant sign in on old account data/won't accept Firefox/spent 1 hour + trying to sort it and gave up. Won't use ever again.</p>

<p>new Skype is an absolute failure. after using it for years to talk with my family and friends abroad i decided to say it a big - good bye. i don't understand why on earth we should stand being forced to upgrade to a much much worse new version ? and why
 is Microsoft completely ignoring us their customers who an mass are complaining about the latest version of Skype ? you say the old versions have a security issue. well even if so (which i don't believe is the case), let US decide if we want a software with
 a security issue. since when my computer and my security is something you decide about and FORCE me to accept your help (read: your new lame software) ? if you believe you can force it on us, well, you are mistaken ! we are all keeping Skype till 1 September
 and in the meantime getting used to Google Hangouts, an user friendly, elegant and easy to use software. to all of you who don't like new Skype i suggest you try Google Hangouts. a big 'bravo' for Google and shame on you Microsoft. you ruined a software so
 many loved and turned it (while ignoring our complaints) into something everyone dislikes. you really "fixed' something that was not broken and now nobody wants it. to what end ? the answer to this only you know :(&nbsp;
</p>
<p>P.S. the same applies to Windows 10. i will keep Windows 7 until i can and then switch to MAC and their OS.

            I upgraded and had nothing but had nothing but problems . The snapshot gallery has disappeared . When people call me it does not ring on the computer which has the upgraded version but rings on other devices . Also I don't get any indication that I am
 getting a call thus I do not get to know who is calling . I raised this issue several times without getting a satisfactory answer

            So I ended up fixing my problem. First I went to the destop, and found the system settings. I then went to the "restore" option and found that the OS made a restore for me. I just restored my system to that date, and all was right with the world.&nbsp;

            <p>None the microsoft apps give me anything except a blank screen and the test program only&nbsp;tells mthat&nbsp;Security settings have been changed or that my nvidia drivers are outdated (they are not).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How the f...ck could it be that not even the very few apps that are available for win8 work?&nbsp; So far win8 seems like just a new&nbsp;start folder that occupy the Whole screen and a very hidden tun off button. None of the "brilliant" apps work properly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only working app is the map app which is even more horrible than Apple's New app (hint People like a search app for their pc, not a directions app that only searches for adresses. the latter kind is&nbsp;used in&nbsp;a cars)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want my Money back if bugs was all win8 had to offer...</p>

                    Buenas,<br />
tengo un disco externo WD Passport con archivos guardados y el ordenador (Windows 7) no me deja abrirlo.&nbsp; He probado a abrirlo desde otros ordenadores (Mac y Windows XP), pero el resultado ha sido el mismo: me pide que lo formatee para poder usarlo. El problema
 es que la información que tengo dentro no la tengo en ningun otro lado y no quiero perderla. ¿Que puedo hacer?<br />
Muchas gracias.<br />

    <title>Best way to Go to Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best way to Go to Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have 4 PC's at home. Two are currently running XP Pro 32-bit, one is running Windows 7 Pro 32-bit and the primary machine Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I want to mass upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, but I have MAJOR HESITATION. <br />
<br />
Why? Well I HATED the way MS required me to reinstall Windows 7 a couple times by FIRST going to XP Pro again and THEN re-upgrading to Windows 7. IMHO, it IS and WAS a STUPID thing to offer such an upgrade path to 7 ... makes for a messy install from the get
 go. I certainly don't want to get to Windows 8 the same way.&nbsp; I have the cash to spend, but I pointedly refuse to upgrade if the old Windows XP Pro to Windows 7 Pro upgrade cluster-#@## is the same way that MS has decided to handle upgrading to Windows 8.&nbsp;
 Many enthusiasts/power users like myself feel the same.<br />
<br />
What are my options for going to Windows 8 Pro on all machines?<br />

            <p>Since you have two PC's running 32 bit versions of Windows (Windows XP Pro 32 bit and Windows 7 Pro 32 bit), you could download the 32 bit version of Windows 8 on one and upgrade the other 32 bit installation of Windows using the backup media you create.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/buy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/buy</a></p>
<p>Clicking "Download Pro" installs and runs the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, which lets you know if your PC can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, provides you with a compatibility report, and then walks you through the steps to purchase, download, and install.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant
</u></a>to make sure your PC can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro before purchase—you can run it without purchasing. Upgrade Assistant will collect certain information about your potential upgrade experience.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>Learn more about privacy and the Upgrade Assistant.</u></a></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Step 1: Use the Upgrade Assistant to qualify the PC and pay the $40 (US)</p>
<p>Step 2: When the "Install Windows 8" message appears, select "Install by creating media" to create a bootable USB flash drive or an .iso (a disk image) file.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Wait for the Assistant to download the Windows 8 Pro installation package and create the bootable media or .iso file. The flash drive must be have 3GB or more of free space available.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Burn the .iso file, if that's the path you chose, to a blank DVD. </p>
<p>Step 5: Use that USB drive or DVD to boot the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>After creating your backup media, you can proceed with the install or install later and choose to upgrade the other 32 bit machine.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the 64 bit machine, you will have to go through the steps as you did on the 32 bit machine and download the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you backup your machines before upgrading. </p>

<p>One more question though, man.&nbsp; Say I buy a new Hard Drive and I have to replace the OS partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I pop in the Windows 8 DVD Backup Media, will I be first asked to reinstall Windows Xp Pro&nbsp;and THEN Reinstall Windows 8, too?</p>

<blockquote>How do I resize photo's in MY PICTURES?&nbsp; So that I can then upload them to Zyweb, and put them on my website. I don't have Microsoft Office 2007.</blockquote>
<p>=======================================<br />
Since you are posting in a XP forum...I'll give you an XP solution:</p>
<p>The following free XP PowerToy can resize<br />
the photos and greatly reduce the file size.<br />
<br />
Go to the following link and download and<br />
install:&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageResizer.exe<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx</a><br />
(will not run on Vista)<br />
<br />
Then you can open any folder that contains<br />
images and you will have an option to resize.<br />
Just right click the selected image files and<br />
choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You<br />
can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in<br />
the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and<br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.<br />
<br />
(Tip: even if you resize the Photos to the same<br />
(original) dimensions...the file size will be greatly<br />
reduced.)</p>

    <title>Help setting up DMZ hosting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkon x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help setting up DMZ hosting</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I recently bought another XBOX and it has been nothing but problems since.&nbsp; I used to have my old XBOX with port forwarding configuration, but now that I have 2 XBOX port forwarding simply won't do or so I've read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm trying to set up DMZ hosting but I have no clue what to do.&nbsp; As you can see in the picture above there's drop down menu to choose devices but they're all listed as 'uknown' and I don't know what to type in the IP address (192.168.0.112) is the IP
 of my first XBOX.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I do put in an IP adress does that mean I have to set <strong>
BOTH</strong> XBOXs with the <strong>SAME</strong> IP address?</p>
<p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/59/46014924.jpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg59.imageshack.us%2fimg59%2f1016%2f46014924.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also my setup is as follows:<br />
Modem: Actiontec M1000</p>
<p>Router: <span>Cisco-Linksys EZXS55W EtherFast 10/100 5-Port Workgroup Switch</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Should I invest in an actual router or does having a switch matter not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Hey there Darkon! I understand you are having some connection issues after getting a second Xbox console at home. Can you describe the issue you are experiencing (disconnects, can't connect, lag, etc). Does this happen on both consoles and are they both
 being used at the same time?<br />
<br />
For issues stemming from having multiple consoles, I find that enabling UPnP on your router can help. The one thing to keep in mind is that you should not use UPnP at the same time as port forwarding, so if you are doing that, please discontinue it for the
 time being. Let me know if that helps, thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Issues I've been experiencing is not being able to connect to a particular friend in my friends list even though BOTH our NATs are set to OPEN. &nbsp;Including not being able to hear him in game-chat even though we are playing together, though it seems this problem
 is more prominent with EA servers (IE: Syndicate and Battlefield 3, we can hear each other in Halo Wars). &nbsp;Also we can't join each other if either one of us is hosting a game or a party, we require another friend to host a game (or a party) and then we can
 both join.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>He recently upgraded his internet connection and since then we've been having nothing but 'clashing' issues like the ones stated above. &nbsp;He has a brother who uses the internet on another XBOX as well and it seems like his NAT will close at random times.
 &nbsp;I've tried telling him that port forwarding does not work if you're using multiple devices at the same time, but he does not listen to me.</p>
<p>- </p>
<p>Maybe the problem is on my friend's side but I do find it weird that I am the only one clashing with him, the rest of my friends seem to be fine, although we were playing 3v3 in Halo Wars and we played a match just fine, after the match I got a message saying
 "Warning: Gamertag X (not using his real gamertag) has a restricted NAT" and after that we couldn't find/join any games.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also my modem is an Actiontec M1000 and as far as I'm concerned it does not support port triggering.

            <p>Hey there darkon!<br />A lot of routers will not give a NAT status of OPEN when two xboxes are using the same router. Does your router support two xboxes? Follow this <a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/63-two-xboxes-using-one-router-internet-connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> and scroll down to the section <strong>Can your router support two xboes or more?<br /><br /></strong>Port Forwarding will only let those port to be open to the IP address you set it. Port Forwarding will only be set to one console (the one using the IP address). Thats why Port Forwarding do not work if you have two or more xboxes using the same router. What you have to do is set up Port Triggering, disable Port Forwarding and DMZ. Make sure UPnP is enabled.<br /><br />Keep posting back and let us know how it goes.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>The current promotion is for 15,000; not 15,000 per pre-order also, those points are delivered once all 3 titles are released.&nbsp;So you would not be receiving 45,000 points (see FAQ:&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/faq/#missions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/faq/#missions</a> )</p><p><br /></p><p>It takes 1-2 business days for the staff to review and respond to threads so they should be replying to you today, maybe tomorrow since it has been bumped twice.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;godslayer1975,</p><p><br /></p><p>From our FAQ:
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p><b>When will my MyVIP Rewards Credits be deposited into my Microsoft account?</b>
  </p>
<p>The total Rewards earned will be calculated at the end of each month. Typically you'll receive your MyVIP earnings in your account by the 15th of the following month, though this is subject to the program's current deposit <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/terms-and-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms</a>. Be sure to keep an eye on MyStatement on the <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyRewards</a> page to track your progress and watch your Rewards Credits total grow!
  </p>
<p><br /></p><p>We only recently&nbsp;calculated last month's MyVIP, so it is too early to see the Credits pending. The only way to receive Credits for pre-orders is through the Games on Demand punchcard. Since you only had one eligible pre-order during the last Games on Demand offer (January - March) of Resident Evil 7, you did not complete that offer. That offer requires three eligible purchases to complete. Your purchase of Bulletstorm awarded one Games on Deman punch for the punchcard that started in April. However, since Lego City is not on the eligibility list for that offer, it did not award a punch.&nbsp;Pre-orders, game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for MyVIP, as stated in our FAQ:</p><p><br /></p><p><b>What content on the Xbox Store is eligible for MyVIP?</b>
  </p>
<p>Normally, most purchases for Xbox 360 and Xbox One from the Xbox Store qualify, including full Games on Demand titles (excluding game pre-orders), arcade games, indie games, game add-ons, game Season Passes, movies, TV shows, TV seasons, themes and avatar items. In-game consumables, Xbox Live Gold memberships, Groove Music Passes, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV Season Passes, and the purchase or redemption of Microsoft Points or Xbox Gift Cards, still do not qualify.</p><p><br /></p><p>We do not award Credits for achievements/gamerscore, unless as part of a special offer, like this months Obssessius offer, which awards achievements earned in purchases made towards that offer.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>MyVIP has a recalibration every year. At the end of the year, we place you in your MyVIP rank for the new year based off your eligible spending from the previous year, and set your progress to the default state. This happened in September 2015 and December 2016. Based on your spending from September 2015 - December

    <title>FILE EXPLORER ICON IN WINDOWS 10 DUPLICATED WHEN FILE EXPLORER OPENS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            FILE EXPLORER ICON IN WINDOWS 10  DUPLICATED WHEN FILE EXPLORER OPENS</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 10 for quite some time and recently ran the Windows 10 update. After doing so, I have noticed the File Explorer icon in the taskbar operates differently. It used to operate like the other programs I have pinned, i.e., it would
 lump all opened instances into the same icon and show a line under it indicating the program was in use, but now a duplicate File Explorer icon appears with a line under when the program is in use. All of my other programs continue to operate as before in
 the taskbar, it's only the File Explorer that shows up twice, and it isn't inhibiting my work - but it is highly annoying. Is there a way to make the File Explorer icon in the taskbar operate as it did before and stop duplicating when in use?&nbsp;

            Have you tried right click on it and removing from taskbar all together so there is no more file explorer rebooting and then pinning it back again?
<br />Hoping a simple refresh would work.

<p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>I actually figured this out on my own. I hovered over the duplicated icon and noticed it was labeled Windows Explorer whereas the program I'd pinned was labeled File Explorer. While I still had instances of Windows Explorer open, I unpinned File Explorer.
 Then I closed the opened instances and Windows Explorer and the icon operated normally, as it did before the update to Windows 10.

            <p>Hey there Bowl! Does this only happen with Netflix? I would try deleting and redownloading the app.<br /><br />-Go to System, Settings, Storage, find the app and delete it.</p>
<p>-Clear your system cache 3 times in a row (here's a guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a>).</p>
<p>-Restart your console.</p>
<p>-Redownload the Netflix app from your download history (here's a guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../download-content-history</a>).<br /><br />Let us know how that works for you and we'll go from there! ^_^</p>

<p>No It was also doing it on the dvd I had in the tray.</p>
<p>Well I turned on the Xbox today and I immediately started the dvd and then started Netflix, both worked just fine, where the screen wasn't flashing repeatedly.</p>
<p>What could have been the problem? I even restarted the console multiple times yesterday, when it wasn't working, and it was still doing the same thing.</p>
