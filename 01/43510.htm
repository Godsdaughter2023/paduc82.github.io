<h2>            BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO. Can&#39;t reset, can&#39;t recover, stuck with a dead machine</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I'm stuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgraded my windows 7 Acer Aspire 5750 laptop to Windows 10 a month ago.&nbsp; Been fairly stable since. No changes in apps and I switched the laptop on after it had been shutdown for a few hours and received the error message: BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO
 BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going through troubleshooting options:</p>
<p>1) System restore (this was turned on but when I try to restore to a restore point it says: "No restore points have been created on your computer's system drive" (there was a restore point setup before I upgraded to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) System Image recovery - I don't have an image so I can't use this option</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Startup repair - I go through this but it does not fix the issue. It starts the splash screen that says "Diagnosing your PC..." then switches back to the blue screen stating "Startup repair couldn't repair your PC" (logfile saved in SrtTrail.txt)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Go back to previous build - doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Command prompt:&nbsp; I can see my OS and data files under D: and can access them this way.....but can't get the OS to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Tried resetting my PC with both "Keep my files" and "Remove everything" but when it starts to "Reset this PC"....it stops and says, "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm completely STUCK with a dead laptop and all recovery options just seem to be useless/not working as intended......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice (short of formatting my hdd and re-installing).....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Welcome to my world. I am having same issues and have been trying to find the answers now over a week. With no roll back option even though it was within the period of 30 days and no system recovery option i m feeling frustrated with microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried about data more than WINDOWS 10 which was a worst decision to upgrade. Had i realised it will be such a big mess i would not have done it. But here we are in same boat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if any of the answer provided by technician works for you as i still feel i am hanging in middle of replies from them which are misleading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and good luck my friend.</p>

            I have never heard of explorer.exe having a bad virus -you may <span style="font-style: italic">
think</span> it has a bad virus... and since we know absolutely nothing about your system or problems with it, there is a copy of explorer.exe on my SkyDrive you can download:<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called explorer when the file name really needs to be called explorer.exe (if the downloaded file has no extension you will
 have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
Then Sandeep can pick things up from there.<br />

<h2>            Keyboard wont work. When I plug, it beeps.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings everyone, I really need your help about my keyboard. I can't type in my keyboard and I'm using on-screen keyboard, and when I go to device manager, I didn't see a problem or even yellow exclamation mark. So I tried to uninstall and reboot my PC
 and I also tried to uninstall keyboard and plugged it out and plugged it back but still won't work and keeps on beeping. I also tried deleting upper filter and lower filter in REGEDIT but still not working., and I also disable filter key in control panel but
 it won't work. Is there any option to fix this?</p>
<p>I also tried another keyboard and still won't work. I can't play league of legends without this keyboard.</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Unable to sing in on Skype Client, only Skype Web &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having this issue for quite some time now, I never made an effort to report the issue but now that I need to use the client since the web version does not allow me to voice chat with my clients who are more comfortable in using skype, I need
 to get into my desktop version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I log in with the same information I use in the web for the skype client and I get this message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97791be9-516f-4e21-a36c-06e75dede983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97791be9-516f-4e21-a36c-06e75dede983" height="409" width="570" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But as you can see, I am able to log into the skype web as it shows below: </p>

</p><p>I don't understand how the web can accept my log in but not the client. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using an up to date skype version, and my system is a Win10 that is up to date in its update installers. I have tried everything and nothing seems to be working. :(</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install Windows 7 Professional due to invaild disks and hard drives.</h2>
                    <p>I have a few blank HP Elitebook 2760p's, with nothing on them at all, just a blank. I have been trying for over 3 hours now, nothing is working:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It comes with a Dock to expand the functionality of the device, adds a few extra ports (USB, eSATA, DP, HDMI, etc.) Including a CD-ROM Drive. So I pop in a Windows 7 Install Disc. (Even with all the settings in the BIOS detecting the Disk Drive) Displays
 this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BootDevice not Found</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please install an operating system on your hard disk.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hard Disk - (3F0)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>F2 System Diagnostics</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For more information, please visit: www.hp.com/go/techcenter/startup</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Transferred the install files over to an 8 GB SD Card, tried that, still the same message above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Tried the CD again, still the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Transferred all of the files to a 8 GB Flash Drive, different message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Invaild system disk</strong></p>
<p><strong>Replace the disk, and then press any key</strong></p>
<p>So I did that, goes back to the "<strong>BootDevice not found</strong>" Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any clue what the heck is going on, I have never had this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the BIOS to its defaults</p>
<p>Turning on the UEFI Boot mode</p>
<p>Switching the Boot Orders.</p>
<p>Looking everything up</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anything on this. Any help would be awesome! Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Xbox Rewards - My account is a Mess, I need help &#91;2&#93; - Follow up</h2>
                    <p>My post was locked, so I'm reposting since I cannot reply in the same place&nbsp;(<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/fae883db-9fb4-46e0-96eb-06efcb4ee57f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/fae883db-9fb4-46e0-96eb-06efcb4ee57f</a>). Previously the system still showed up as "US&nbsp;region", but since yesterday it was updated correctly to Brazil. I'd like to know if there's a fix to MyVIP status, I'm waiting to make some purchases before new year's&nbsp;eve based on this reply.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am a Live user since back 2005/2006. At that time we didn't had Xbox Live at my country, Brazil, so I was forced to create my account at the US&nbsp;Store. Time passed and I&nbsp;long forgot about it when I got my Xone, since it automatically logs you&nbsp;in at&nbsp;the store set in your xbox one region. I&nbsp;figured that It automatically changed my data.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year I discovered that my rewards account stopped tracking my purchases made on the XOne&nbsp;in BRL (Different from my time with the 360, that I made transactions using&nbsp;US&nbsp;Dollars)&nbsp;and I was instructed to opt out from the program (<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/93623798-8015-4A2B-9A0C-2A208CC231FC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/93623798-8015-4A2B-9A0C-2A208CC231FC</a>) and ask&nbsp;for pending deposits latter on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'd like to ask my 5.500&nbsp;(if I am not wrong)&nbsp;pending deposits. I&nbsp;took a screenshot as a proof, but It ended up not showing the total points pending the deposit from before I&nbsp;opted out the program, I'm pretty sure you can check in the system the correct total amount. And finally, I would like to know If "my vip" program can be activated, as I fist explained (<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/93623798-8015-4A2B-9A0C-2A208CC231FC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/93623798-8015-4A2B-9A0C-2A208CC231FC</a>), I made spent the total amount required to start receiving the benefits from it.<br />

            <p>Hello Victor Garcia,</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;
  </p>
<p>Your deposit is being prevented due to a mismatch between your US&nbsp;Rewards Account region and your Brazilian Microsoft Account region. Since your Rewards Account is a separate entity from your Microsoft Account, migrating your Microsoft Account region will not also change your Rewards Account region. Therefore, when your Rewards Account attempts a deposit in one regional currency, it cannot complete when your Microsoft Account is of a differing currency. The region displayed at the bottom of the page is your current Microsoft Account region, not your Rewards Account region.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p>However, this issue can be fixed by heading over to the Microsoft Commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) to update your Microsoft account to match your Xbox Live Rewards location. Another option if you wish to continue with Rewards in your current Xbox Live region is to opt out of the program at ( <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/</a> ) , wait 48 hours and then sign back up again, which can also take 48 hours. This is the option you were directed to on your last post. Since your Microsoft Account region at the bottom of your MyRewards page is displaying Brazil, if you opt out and create a new account, it will create a new Rewards Account set to the Brazilian region.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;While you will lose your progress by starting a brand new account, you can start earning Rewards Credits that will successfully reward your newly registered regional currency. To confirm that you have re-registered correctly, you can check your join date from the MyRewards page at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). If your join date shows a specific date and not a date of "???", then your account has successfully been re-registered. If you open a new post after being able to log in to your new Rewards account, you can request&nbsp; any pending deposits from your old account to your new one.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>How to change the default view of the "Open" dialog? I've already tried the "Apply to other folders" button from "Folder options", but it doesn't have any effect on the "Open" dialog.</p>
<p>Please help,<br />

            I've found the solution: set the preferred view, then close the dialog while holding CTRL. The new view will be applied to most folders but not all of them (probably only folders of the same content type).

<h2>            I recently purchased 2 new Dell Optiplex 790 with the same configuration.  I want to set up Windows so that they look exactly the same.</h2>
                    <p>Can I clone to a 2nd new computer?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently purchased 2 new Dell Optiplex 790 with the same configuration.&nbsp; I want to set up Windows so that they look exactly the same.&nbsp; Microsoft Office from Dell was purchased with the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am installing various 3rd party utilities.&nbsp; These are 2
 individual system without any corporate licenses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have Acronis on a 3rd computer and I was thinking after I setup one of the new systems, I could just clone it to the 2nd new system.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>However, I'm concerned that there may be some uniqueness between the computers.&nbsp; Specifically with the operating system (Windows 7 Pro) and with Microsoft Office.&nbsp; When I started Office and input the key for the 1st key, won't cloning cause the 2nd computer
 to have the wrong key?&nbsp; Is there a way to "re-key" the 2nd system after cloning?&nbsp; Is there a key for Windows 7 itself?&nbsp; I didn't have to enter the Windows 7 key which is on a label on the computer case.<br />
</p>
<p>Are there other issues that would prevent me from cloning?</p>
<p>TIA</p>

<h2>            I cannot get Windows update to wrok on Windows 7 professional.</h2>
                    <p>*-Original Title - I cannot get Windows update to wrok on Windows 7 professional. Problem affects SP1, and installing e.g. .NET 4.x</p>
<p>I cannot get Windows update to work on Windows 7 professional.&nbsp; </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I see that I haven't installed Service Pack 1, but given the the fact Windows Update is so flaky, just how stable is Service Pack 1? Given the huge download as well 4Gb, this really needs to work, and not trash the machine even further.
<div>WIndows update cannot be fixed by running the MS tools. Tried this many times, including turning of security software etc. It just says, all repaired each time,&nbsp;</div>
<div>but it has done nothing. Currently WU advises that &nbsp;"Windows update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running. .You may need to restart your computer."
<b>But the service is running</b>. Changing the options from "no update" to Auto update, makes no difference.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I cannot install updates, partly I guess, because some of them rely on security updates included in SP1, I cannot addd .Net 4.* as this just refuses to install, giving as pa final part of the errormessage related to WU, "WU Service was already enabled
 or was running WU Service: EnsureWUServiceIsNotDisabled succeeded Action: Performing Action on Exe at F:\ff2b42b9f7ae2d97c9644f24738ab850\Windows6.1-KB958488-v6001-x86.msu Launching CreateProcess with command line = wusa.exe "F:\ff2b42b9f7ae2d97c9644f24738ab850\Windows6.1-KB958488-v6001-x86.msu"
 /quiet /norestart Exe (F:\ff2b42b9f7ae2d97c9644f24738ab850\Windows6.1-KB958488-v6001-x86.msu) f<b>ailed with 0xc8000222</b> - (null). PerformOperation on exe returned exit code 3355443746 (translates to HRESULT = 0xc8000222) Action complete Error 0xc8000222
 is mapped to Custom Error: &nbsp;OnFailureBehavior for this item is to Rollback. Action: Performing actions on all Items Action complete"
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
It seems really odd to me that such a fundamental part of Windows cannot be easily re-installed, and that when it fails to run, it should give clear reasons for failure ( after all "it" knows at what point it tried something and failed.<br />
<br />
Of course, I see that there are many people affected by this/ or very similar problems, so I guess MS will try and do something about it, sometime. Meanwhile, hitting my head on a wall doesn't work, so does anyone have any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div>

            <div>The Method 1 cure worked. It turns out that the ESENT logs &nbsp;needed rebuilding. So a simple stop WU, move the ESENT files elsewhere, and restart WU, allowed Windows UPdate to run. .Net has also installed, as has SP1.<br />
It may have been related to my 1.5 Tb disk not reporting that it 4096 block and not 512. Not sure on about this as the root cause, although it does seem probable .</div>
<div><br />
<div>So a great on target call bySrimadhw B. Thanks.&nbsp;<br />

To save people the trouble of looking , below is the support link, and the core changes I needed to run on my PC. Word of advice, be careful when at command line, that you type the lines in right - it helps! &nbsp;Also, my "command" runs as Admin, as you need all
 the rights you can get, and then some.</div>
<div><br />
<br />
support.microsoft.com/kb/982018&nbsp;
<div><span>The Extensible Storage Engine API(ESENT) is a high-performance desktop database engine that is used by many applications,
 including Windows Update. Certain storage drivers have different kinds of support for querying the physical sector size of the hard disk in a hard disk drive and, when such a driver is upgraded, the reported physical sector size of the hard disk can change.
 Because of the logging structure of ESENT, applications that are built on ESENT receive an error message and stop responding when the reported physical sector size changes between operating system sessions.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Note</b><span>&nbsp;Applications
 that are built on ESENT include Windows Update, Active Directory, Windows Desktop Search, certification authority (CA), WINS, DHCP, and Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>You receive the following error message when you click the&nbsp;</span><strong>Check
 for Updates</strong><span>&nbsp;button on Windows Update site:</span>
<div>
<div>
<div>Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running. You may have to restart your computer.</div>
<br />
<br />
<span>Additionally, the following error is logged into the Application log:</span>
<p>
Log Name: Application&nbsp;<br />
Source: ESENT&nbsp;<br />
Date: &lt;&gt;&nbsp;<br />
Event ID: 412&nbsp;<br />
Task Category: Logging/Recovery&nbsp;<br />
Level: Error&nbsp;<br />
Keywords: Classic&nbsp;<br />
Description:&nbsp;<br />
wuaueng.dll (936) SUS20ClientDataStore: Unable to read the header of logfile C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\Logs\edb.log. Error -546.</p>
<br />
<span>An updated Esent.sys binary that eases the effects of changes in the reported sector size is included with this hotfix.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Note</b><span>&nbsp;Esent.sys
 does not support physical sector sizes other than 512 bytes and 4 KB.</span>
<span>To repair the database, follow these steps:</span>
<ol>
<li>At a command prompt, type the following commands. Press Enter after you type each command.
<ul>
<li><b>net stop "windows update"</b></li><li><b>cd /d %windir%\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\Logs</b></li><li><b>esentutl /mh ..\DataStore.edb | findstr /i /c:"State:"</b></li></ul>
<b>Note&nbsp;</b>If "State: Clean Shutdown" is displayed in the command-line, go to step 5.</li><li>Create a temporary folder (for example, create a folder that is named "Fixedfiles" by using the&nbsp;<b>mkdir c:\fixedfiles</b>command).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Note&nbsp;</b>During the following steps, replace "c:\fixedfiles" with the folder that you created in this step.</li><li>Obtain a copy of the %windir%\system32\esent.dll file from a computer that has this hotfix installed, and copy the file to&nbsp;<b>c:\fixedfiles</b>.</li><li>At a command prompt, type the following commands. Press Enter after you type each command.
<ul>
<li><b>copy %windir%\system32\esentutl.exe c:\fixedfiles\</b></li><li><b>c:\fixedfiles\esentutl.exe /r edb</b></li><li><b>esentutl /mh ..\datastore.edb | findstr /i /c:"State:"</b></li></ul>
<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>If "State: Clean Shutdown" is displayed in the command-line, go to step 5.</li><li>If this step fails or if "State: Clean Shutdown" is not displayed in the command-line, see the "Destructive recovery method" section of this article.</li></ul>

    <title>Stretched screen horizontally in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esthervdw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stretched screen horizontally in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my computer screen suddenly went black, then came back on a few seconds later with the entire screen stretched out horizontally.&nbsp; I've tried adjusting the display options, but those are set correctly at 100% and recommended resolution.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the driver (ATI Radeon HD 4200) and restarted it, that didn't fix it.</p>
<p>I did a system restore to 21 November 2017 (2 day old) which initially fixed it, yay!&nbsp; But two hours later the exact same thing happened - momentary black screen, and it all stretched out again.&nbsp; It's a real nuisance!&nbsp; Things are out of proportion and slightly
 blurry too...&nbsp; So today I tried again.&nbsp; I looked for solutions online; set my network to "Metered connection" so windows can't automatically update, re-did the system restore after that, and found it still doesn't go back to normal.&nbsp; What the heck is going
 on???&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Esther</p>

            Hi Esther, this is being reported everywhere right now:
<br />
<br />The Fix - your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If there is no roll back available or that does not work, go to the Support page of the manufacturer of your PC/Laptop 
<br />
<br />Download the Device Driver they recommend for your Display Adapter/GPU and install that version, until Microsoft come out with a fix . . .

<p>The can't see the app failing to download as it is now an integral part of dashboard since NXOE. If you try any of the first three suggestions below they will &nbsp;hopefully all launch the Xbox Accessories app.</p>
<p>1. In the apps section of "My games and apps" &nbsp;- The app is on the right hand side of the list and the icon looks like the domed top of a controller joystick</p>
<p>2. Settings/All settings/Kinect &amp; Devices/ Devices/ Button mapping</p>
<p>3. Settings/ All settings/ Ease of access/ Button mapping</p>
<p>If you are not able to find it by trying the suggestions above please try and carry out a hard reset on the console by pressing the power button on the front of the console 5-10 seconds and once it has shut down and light gone orange on the power brick restart
 the console and see what happen.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 won&#39;t re-detect hard drive after disconnect and then - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenolsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t re-detect hard drive after disconnect and then refuses to shut down.</h2>
                    I have an external USB hard drive. Whenever I've freshly booted into Windows 7 it works great. It will detect and re-detect the drive without issue. However after using the computer throughout the day I come back to connect the external drive at night
 (for nightly backup) and the drive refuses to detect on any USB port. Other devices detect and install correctly such as USB keys.<br />
<br />
When I go to restart (or shutdown) the computer, the system does not shut down or restart. It just stays on the shutdown screen indefinitely. These types of errors drive me up the wall. I don't want to have to re-install the operating system because I am away
 from home for the next 3 months. Reinstalling Windows and all of my software is just not an option until I get home. Besides, I was really hoping this installation would get me through until Windows 8 hits the retails shelves.<br />
<br />
This is one of those situations where Windows is acting so wonky that 99% of the population will just reinstall everything. For once I would just like to fix Windows without having to resort to the nuking option. I am using a HP Elitebook 2760p with Windows
 7 Pro.<br />

            It did not. However the hard drive later corrupted because I was using a external chassis that wasn't designed for drives larger than 2 TB and I had a 3 TB in it that was formatted on my desktop PC. I'm going to chalk it up to that because it did not occur
 when I went back to Windows 7 with the new chassis.<br />

            Hey Garry. Boot into safe mode with networking instead by:
<br />
<br />Go to the power button in the start menu &gt; hold shift and click restart then restart your PC 
<br />
<br />In the following prompt go to troubleshoot &gt; advanced options &gt; startup settings &gt; reboot 
<br />
<br />Press 5 or f5 at the next screen to go into networking safe mode.

<p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>i can only boot in safe mode and if I select with network option the system crashes I seem to have quite a few options missing and Iam not sure if it's due to being in safe mode or not!!</p>

<h3> andy red  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot rename one of the partitions of an external hard drive with Windows 7. I can rename it correctly in Admin Tools - Disk Management, where the name is correct - but in windows explorer in all the users profiles it stubbornly remains F&#58;&#92;Local Disk.</h2>
                    I have tried changing ownership and permissions. I can rename the files and folders on the partition. It shows up correctly in Disk Manager and I've tried renaming it through Command Prompt: Label F: Archive, all to no avail! I don;t get an error message
 or anything, it just remains called Local Disk in Explorer. Also the rename box (right click &gt; properties) is blank.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            Hi again. Typical. As soon as I post a question I manage to fix it! I changed the drive letter in Disk Manager and restarted a couple of times and then at last windows seemed happy to accept the name and show it in Windows Explorer. Strange one. Have checked
 both User accounts and given it the original drive letter again and seems to be ok now. Glitch.<br />

            HI Susan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For most WIndows including all browsers, you can hold the Ctrl key while slowly rolling the mouse wheel forward or back to zoom in or out, changing the text size while at the same time framing the page within it's borders.  Once you set this it should remember it for the most part.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can adjust the Screen Resolution at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display until it looks best.
<br />
<br />Also in the same place you can test Scaling to enlarge all objects across Windows by a certain percentage.  Start with the lowest fixed scaling 125%, log out and back in to see it applied.  If it's too big choose Custom Scaling and try around 113-117% to find the sweet spot.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
