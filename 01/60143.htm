    <title>Duplicate child accounts appearing on Family Safety web site - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Duplicate child accounts appearing on Family Safety web site</h2>
                    <p>I just signed in to familysafety.microsoft.com today to review some of my children's recent web and PC activity, and something is wrong with the site. It was working fine just a day or two ago. Now, instead of displaying the 5 child accounts I normally see
 on the left side, it is showing 30 or so, with each child account duplicated for each device they've ever signed into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get this working again?</p>

            <p>UPDATE: Looks like this is more than a website problem. This morning I got 24 (!) Family Safety weekly activity report emails for my 5 child accounts. My son also indicated that web filtering is no longer working when he uses the Chrome browser instead of
 IE. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Web filters not working is a&nbsp;SERIOUS problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like my whole Family Safety account is messed up. Can someone from Microsoft look into this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I already&nbsp;tried contacting the MS Answer Desk. They said they don't support FS because&nbsp;FS isn't part of Windows (huh?), and even if they did, they'd need to charge me $100&nbsp;for "helping", even though it's obvious all they could do is report the issue
 to the product team&nbsp;(they won't be able to fix it by remoting into one of my computers since it's a problem with the web site/online service). Very frustrating...</p>

            <p>I'm using Windows 8.1 on all the affected PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today when I went to the FS web site view my settings, it was still showing 20-30 entries, but this time the layout has changed and there was a warning near the top of the page:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(201, 50, 6, 1)">"If
 you’ve linked your kids’ accounts to manage their settings together, you’ll now need to manage their accounts separately for each device. "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Really? Is this saying that if I want to change any Family Safety settings for a particular child (such as add a web site to their allow list), I need to make the same change
<em>for each device </em>they use?</p>

</p><p>They basically exploded out what used to be your child's account on each device and now you have separate entries for

<p>Block a game, website, app on the tablet? They can go to the PC and use it unless you also went to the PC's entry (good luck finding that) and blocked it there.</p>

            I thought I had finally found a decent solution in MS Family Safety. This change is beyond stupid. Going back to check out solutions from other vendors as of today.

<p>
</p><p>I also don't understand why her accounts show up as "local accounts" on her two devices and then there's a third entry showing her Microsoft account with no devices associated with it (even though that's how she logs into her other devices). Very confusing!!</p>

    <title>Why I do NOT support the Xbox One&#58; Responses to issues supporters - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why I do NOT support the Xbox One&#58; Responses to issues supporters have raised</h2>
                    
<p>I see a lot of threads lately made by people who don't understand how people could possibly not support the Xbox One. I feel that fellow member Galactic Geek proposed a good number of things he seemed to think were non-issues but that I find fault with.
 I hope this clarifies some of the misunderstandings we have been having over this, but the best I can promise is that you will see why I, personally, am upset about this.</p>
<p>Galactic Geek's posts are normal, my responses are in bold.</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p>NOTHING HAS CHANGED!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Always online? So is your PC, your laptop, your tablet, your phone, your TV, &amp; yes - now even your gaming consoles.</p>
<p><strong>-That is not the point and you know it. I can use any of them offline whenever I feel like and they don't require an internet connection to work. I can take any of them to a cabin in the woods or on vacation or even camping with me and I don't REQUIRE
 daily authorization to do so. My PC, laptop, tablet, phone, and TV do not suspend their primary functions because I lose connection due to ISP or because I'm not in an area with a connection. My PC/tablet doesn't block me from playing games when disconnected
 from the internet and my phone doesn't suspend all function when I'm roaming. This is something that has changed and Microsoft is the one who changed it.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can still sell your games.</p>
<p>-<strong>No real complaints here. I don't sell many games, but I'm not going to use my anecdotal evidence as proof that everything is A-OK like you have. Not being able to sell games to friends and loved ones for (family!)discounted prices is, however, something
 I will miss.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still purchase used games.</p>
<p><strong>-No real complaints here either. I'm going to withhold judgement on this one because:&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Microsoft hasn't explained how exactly they're going to work out prices, but I'm sure its going to be a market based on supply and demand.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) I don't buy many used games myself, but once again</strong>, <strong>
I can't trade games with my friends or get games from them after they no longer want to play them without being forced to purchase it "used". That is a major disappointment.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still play your game at your friend's house.</p>
<p><strong>-This is only a half truth. I can play my game at my friend's house but in only one of two ways. I have to either bring my console over in its entirety or I have to recover my account to their XOne and wait for the game to install. Being able to
 play games while they install mitigates this slightly, but the simply truth is that this is something that HAS changed and I'm honestly not sure why you put it under the NOTHING HAS CHANGED header. This is a major departure from the way things have been done
 for the entirety of the history of console gaming. Arguably, this is the way gaming grew so big in the first place. That is a change.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone can still play your games on your console.</p>
<p><strong>-Look at the wording. "Anyone can still play YOUR games on YOUR console." You conveniently leave out "But I can't play my friends' games on my console and they can't play my games on theirs." Again, that is something that HAS changed and you word
 it so that it seems like it hasn't. Even if I were to accept this fact (a ludicrous idea in and of itself) and I allow my friend to use my account for the length of time that they would like to play (because BEFORE XOne, I didn't even have to let them use
 my account, just the game), if I come home and turn on my XOne, I cannot play one of my other games because guess what? My account would be signed in in two places at one time</strong>.
<strong>This is not a problem that exists now. Nothing has changed, right?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can still play your games with your family on the same console.</p>
<p><strong>-The wording. Again. Before, I was able to play any games with my family on any of my (5) consoles. Now, I can only play games with my family on ONE console. No more lending my brothers and sisters games without them having to install the new game
 and use my account. It is not the same as it was before, therefore it has changed.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Backwards compatibility? Don't need it - you can still keep &amp; use your Xbox 360 consoles.</p>
<p><strong>-I can at least agree on this one. I never planned on selling my Xbox 360, so BC isn't a big concern of mine, but this is anecdotal and only applies to me so I can see where people would be upset. They won't be able to trade in their old consoles
 for new ones without losing entire libraries and many won't be able to afford it without that trade in.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No games? Wait until E3.</p>
<p><strong>-No problem here either. I'm waiting, but this is Microsoft's last chance to snag me as a customer. I don't have absolute hate for Kinect "hardcore" titles like Ryse (which I admit does look fun) but I don't want or expect the 8 new IPs to have a
 majority of Kinect games. I can guess that Halo (I own Halos CE through 4) and Gears (I own and enjoy Gears 1 through 3) and Kinectimals and Kinect sports are probably in their 15 exclusive pile, but these 8 new IPs better be damn impressive to make me even
 consider buying the Xbox One based on games alone. For once, games aren't the reason I'm considering not buying a console. It can have all the greatest games but I won't buy it if they keep a lot of these "features".</strong></p>
<p>The ONLY thing that has changed is how all of the above works. With the Xbox One, aptly named because it's an "all-in-one" device, simply ties everything to your profile - that's it.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you take your game to your friend's house, you have to be there to play it. When you leave, you take your game with you, so they can't play it.</p>
<p><strong>-Except I regularly leave games at friends' houses for them to play. You may not, but that does not mean people don't do it period. You're twisting the truth here. Before, I had the option of doing so whenever I felt like it. I could also get friends
 to let me borrow games they didn't play frequently for weeks at a time. Now, I cannot do so. I have been denied the ability to freely borrow and lend games and Microsoft has caused it. THIS HAS CHANGED.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you sell a used game, you can't continue to play it because you no longer have it.</p>
<p><strong>-No complaints here.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone on the same console or under a family account can still access your games free of charge on the same console.</p>
<p><strong>-This would be okay if people only owned one account/Xbox per household but that is just not the case. My brothers do not frequently play Gears of War on their own consoles and I do not frequently play Phantasy Star Universe and their other favorites
 on my console but at any time we can switch and play each others' games without jumping through hoops. Now we'd all have to play musical XBL accounts in order to do so and if one of us feels like playing one of the games we bought and paid for on our own console,
 we'd have to wait until everyone is done and then switch accounts back or else be unable to play our own games because of them being tied to only one account. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS CHANGED. It is NOT the same and its disturbing that you think this is
 in any way, shape, or form the same as the way things used to be. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have more than 2 consoles, you can't put the same disc into both consoles at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>-While this is true, do you know what I do when I can't put the same disc into both consoles at the same time? I put either my game into my friend's console or I put my friend's game into my console. I cannot do this with XOne without having to recover
 accounts to the other console. If I don't, I (or they) will have to pay for the game as a used game. I never had to do that before. I will have to do this with XOne. This is something that has changed.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No console has had "real" backwards compatibility in over a decade.</p>
<p><strong>-True, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms. I take personal insult at Microsoft calling me "backwards" for wanting backwards compatibility. That's not how you treat customers, period. Also, I take insult at how bogus their claim of only "5% of
 people play old games on new consoles</strong>" <strong>is. I don't know, Microsoft, maybe that's because Xbox 360 didn't have that many backwards compatible Xbox games (and still doesn't)?</strong></p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>-I did mention that being able play during installation slightly mitigates the installation times, but otherwise it is something that shouldn't have been mandatory in the first place.</p>
<p>-As for the 4 Gamertags attached to one Gold membership thing, that would be slightly better, but I have more than 5 Xbox 360s in my house and we might have had 3 or more XOnes until this whole reveal. Plus that still doesn't allow me to share games with
 friends and I have a lot more than 15 friends with individual 360s that I'd want to borrow and lend games with.</p>
<p>-This is the major thing that I'm afraid of, that Microsoft will keep releasing little things to sugercoat the whole thing without understanding the reason behind why this offends us. I hope they can turn around but the clock has already been started.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I press one of the affected keys nothing happens, but the whole keyboard freezes until I hit 15 more keys. Then all of these 15 key presses are executed immediately and the keyboard starts working normal again. (The action of the media keys is never
 executed).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>

<li>The equivalent keys on my laptops internal keyboard ARE working</li></ul>

<li>I think it stopped working with the creators update in early 2017</li><li>I now have a clean install of Windows 10, so there should not be any system damage causing this problem</li><li>The keyboard shows up as '<em>Designer Bluetooth Keyboard</em>' under '<em>Keyboards</em>' and also as '<em>Designer Keyboard</em>' under '<em>Bluetooth</em>' in the Device-Manager</li><li>The latest keyboard and Intel Wireless Bluetooth drivers are installed</li><li>The keyboard works with Ubuntu on the same machine</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The affected keys are</strong>: mute, volume (up/down), previous track, play/pause, next track, brightness (up/down).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the exact same behavior. Cannot comment on when it started malfunction since it's new, was not working with Creators Update and (I've just updated in order to test) with Creators Fall Update. It would be great to have information from Microsoft
 on this (I know we're not just 2 with this problem), because I have to take the decision to return it to Amazon quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried te remove the driver / re-add it... usual things to test, but the result it always the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>We are definitely not alone with this issue. You can find some other reports of this issue eg.

<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that the keybord had worked with windows 10 some time ago until an update broke it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possibilities as to why you encountered the error message "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access them". This could be caused by the recent update, location of files
 or folders that got changed or permission settings that need to be reconfigured to name a few. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What update was installed prior to the issue occurring?</li><li>Does the issue only occur when you attempted to open different applications?</li><li>What applications triggered the error to occur?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Stuccotony,</span></strong></p>
<p>How did you disable the monitor adapter?<br />
<span><span><br />
Try the steps below:</span></span> </p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>Enable VGA Mode [Video Graphics Array] and then try to enable display adapter from there and check for the issue.<strong><br />
</strong><br />
This option starts Windows in 640 x 480 mode by using the current video driver (not Vga.sys). This mode is useful if the display is configured for a setting that the monitor cannot display<br />
<br />
a. Once you get into VGA mode, go to Device Manger by clicking Start, then type devmgmt.msc in the Run box.<br />
b. On the Device Manager window, look for ‘Display adapters’ option.<br />
c. Right click on the device and select ‘Enable’.<br />
d. Restart the computer normally and then check for the issue.<br />
<br />
Access the below link and refer the section Description of Safe Boot options<br />
<br />

</span></span></span><span><span><strong><br />
Step 2:<br />
<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists, login to Safe Mode and then get into Device Manger and then try to enable Display adapter.<br />

                    I want to use the mute and volume controls without the use of the FN key. I went to the BIOS and there was no option for enabling Action Keys.<br />
I know there is another way because I enabled them by mistake. I was using F1 as mute without the FN key but then I accidentally disabled it somehow when I was messing around with FN and ALT. I don't know what I did but I want them enabled again. Thanks.<br />

I know there is another way because I enabled them by mistake. I was using F1 as mute without the FN key but then I accidentally disabled it somehow when I was messing around with FN and ALT. I don't know what I did but I want them enabled again. Thanks.<br />

Contact the manufacturer of the product.&nbsp; This is not a native feature of Windows.&nbsp; ;-)

<h2>            Default English Vani Font</h2>
                    Windows 7 has included the new Vani font(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1815</a>). &nbsp;I understand that this is a font not for English but I really like the

<p>Hi</p>
<p>What&nbsp;are you trying&nbsp;to do with the Vani Font?</p>
<p>If you simply wish to make that font available to use in applications, such as Notepad, Wordpad, MS Office applications, etc.</p>
<p>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> and select the <strong>Fonts</strong> component.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scroll down</strong> to the <strong>Vani Font</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Right click</strong> that font and select the <strong>Show</strong> option.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi, From what I can tell, your machine has TWO Nvidia graphics chips\cards... &nbsp; Here is a link to the specs I found... you may have different options...

http://panam.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/2010/acer/Aspire/AspireX3200/AspireX3200sp5.shtml</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try the Win 7 drivers from Acer and run in compatibility mode, or right click on them ane select TroubleShoot Compatibility.... &nbsp; OR, you could look at Nvidia for Win 8 drivers.&nbsp; Try installing them yourself without the wizard you are using which
 ever ones you use... &nbsp; The Co processor it is talking about may be for your cpu and it's supporting chip that controls stuff like SATA, USB and etc... You could check that out at AMD...

            <p>Hi Guys, many thanks for your expertise, very much appreciated. </p>
<p>Between you both, I have managed to sort out this problem, but alas have got a new one.&nbsp;</p>

 put me on the right track</span>&nbsp;and I was able to download the NVIDIA drivers then

<font color="#0072c6">slance310</font></a> mentioned a supporting chip, so I downloaded the chipset from the same place. The unknown device and co-processor driver are no longer on task manager, but when I open up control panel, hardware and devices I&nbsp;appear
 to have 2 NVIDIA control panels. The second of these, NVIDIA control panel application, 6.9.850.0 has stopped working. As the first one actually opens the control panel, I figure the second one shouldn't be there, how do I get rid of it</p>

<p>I'm glad you have some improvement... Unfortunately, I can't be of assistance concerning the two control panels as I don't have Nvidia graphics to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try right clicking on the control panel for the 6.9.850.0 and look for "Open File Location"...</p>
<p>The selection may or may not be there depending on the type of icon...</p>
<p>If there, it will help locate the files if they exist, and give a better idea what you are dealing with...</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t get the Windows 7 color management system to work. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon kane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get the Windows 7 color management system to work.</h2>
                    As I understand it, the Windows 7 UI is supposed to be color-aware, but even though I've produced a color profile using my Spyder2PRO calibrator and set it to be the default profile, the UI (desktop, Windows Explorer, etc) are all massively oversaturated
 on my wide gamut display. I've ploughed through all the help files and as far as I can see I've set up everything as I should have done (though I must admit I'm somewhat confused about whether the OS should be loading the profile into the graphics card or
 whether it should be my Spyder2 software, and precisely how to make that happen!) . Image thumbnails viewed in Windows Explorer are not properly coloured, but when I open them in Windows Photo Viewer they are, so the profile is obviously in there somewhere,
 just not being used for the desktop.<br />
<br />
I did a clean install (dual-booting with XP) and downloaded the lastest drivers for the video card. What else should I be doing? Is it a problem with the graphics card driver, with the profile produced by the Spyder, with the way I'm setting up the Color Management
 system, a bug in Windows 7, or have I misunderstood what Windows 7 is supposed to do?

            I have a different question it says back up and restore the registry file In the Export Registry File dialog box, select the location where you want to save the backup copy to, and then type a name for the backup file in the
<strong>File name</strong> field ok where do I save that at I mean on the c drive too but with a different name? and how would I get back to it if I need to get back to it I want to try this and try to get it fixed before I have to go to bed and work in the
 morning I am not to computer savvy so I am not that to familiar with computers I had to have a Microsoft tech install windows 10&nbsp;to for me by allowing her in my computer to do it for me while on the phone with her for a little bit. That's how dumb I am when
 it comes to doing stuff big like that and this on computers. I will try all this tomorrow only anti-virus I have is Norton 360 I get it from my internet provider &nbsp;could the updates not be going though because might not have to much space left??? I have like
 80.6 gb used out of 465 gb do I still have space to try it when I get home later? &nbsp;&nbsp;the trouble shooter I tried was the windows trouble shooter to try to fix the issue and&nbsp;the one trouble shooter that Microsoft had on their web page I&nbsp;think it was the&nbsp; malicious
 software removel&nbsp;tool that was on the web page and it came back saying nothing was wrong so I don't know. Please get back&nbsp;to me soon as you can so I can try this with out messing it up&nbsp;when I get home from work tomorrow&nbsp;never did nothing like this before and
 I don't want to mess my computer up because I can not afford to get another one right now thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I did not expect such a tedious way to resolve the problem from<br />
Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you ensure installability&nbsp;before you release any update.As</p>

</p><p>As the updates were configured to be inastalled automatically, this<br />
pc suffered. It kept&nbsp;falling and kept undoing and restarting.</p>

<h2>            Flickering &#38; Purple Screen - Lenovo Y50-70 Touch Screen Laptop-NVIDIA GeForceGTX 860M&#47;Intel HD Graphics 4600</h2>
                    <p>How do I fix my laptop that flickers and has a purplish screen color intermittently? I had repeated issues with this laptop that is only two years old. Initially, the laptop ran Windows 8, but I did the upgrade to Windows 10. Then,&nbsp;Microsoft support walked
 me through a fresh install of windows 10. I believe my performance issues started with the Windows 10 update. I also had an issue with the hinge on this laptop which was repaired by a computer repair business. I don't believe that is causing the flickering
 screen/purple screen issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me fix this issue. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Xbox disconnecting from internet when off &#40;with instant on&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>I've got a new XB1 so chances are I could be doing something wrong, but thought it worth checking.</p>
<p>I set up Tittanfall to download last night, it was at 20%. Said "xbox off, yes" and the console turned off. Instant on is turned on.</p>
<p>When I turned it on this morning it was still at 20%, it said the download was interrupted because it lost network connection (I was also signed off of live).</p>

<p>This would assume that it must have lost connection very soon after turning off. Any advice?</p>
<p>Coincidence that my net might have dropped? It doesn't happen very often...</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

<p>I would leave the console on while you install.i turned mine of installing games and when i turned it on again i was still stuck at the same percent.leave it on is my best advice.but others might be able to help to.</p>

<p>Even with instant on turned on, when you turn the xbox off it is going to go into standby mode. This includes power not going to the wireless adapter anymore. If you are wanting to install a game or any other content, you must leave the console on and not
 in standby mode while it is installing.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for the responses guys.</p>
<p>On understanding instant on a bit better:</p>
<p>I was under the impression that one of the benefits of instant on is that the console downloads game updates when turned off. So that you can turn your console on and not have to worry about sitting through game updates.</p>
<p>The above would suggest that this isn't the case?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Sorry ZeroAvix, but that is incorrect.</p>
<p>With instant on the console doesn't actually turn off when in standby, it just goes into a low power state and it keeps a connection to the internet to search for updates.</p>
<p>UnleashedLemon your understanding of instant on is correct, however i'm not sure about game installations being possible when in standby, i shall test this out right now and post my results in a few hours.

<p>So i started a download of the Lego Movie demo, put the machine into standby and the game had fully installed when i turned it back on.</p>
<p>So, yes, you should be able to install/download games when the console is off in instant on mode.</p>
<p>I assume your internet must have dropped out.</p>
<p>Try downloading the lego movie demo, it's only 777MB so its a quick way to test.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description, it appears that you are having issues with Blue Screen error while booting. I will be happy to help you in this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to upload the <strong><span>mini dump files</span></strong> from "C:\Windows\Minidump" on the sky drive for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://explore.live.com/office-web-apps-upload-documents-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/office-web-apps-upload-documents-using</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>Unplug all the external devices (except the keyboard and mouse) connected to the system.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Mean while, I would suggest you to perform hardware clean boot to isolate the issue and check which driver is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform <strong><span>Hardware clean boot and check:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>a. Go to start and type device manager in the start search field.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type device manager and select device manager from the programs list.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right Click on Sound Card, Video Adapter, and Network Adapter one by one and click disable.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Reboot the computer.<br />
<br />
If this fixes your problem, enable to hardware devices one at time to find the exact device causing this problem. After you found the device that causing the problem you can resolve by installing latest driver or replacing the device.</span></p>
<p><span>For more reference on Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error message refer to the link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Disclaimer: System Image Backup</span></b></p>
<p><span>When you restore your computer from a system image, the contents of your hard disk are replaced with the contents of the system image. This means that any changes you've made, programs you've installed, or files you've saved after the system image
 was created will likely be lost unless you have a recent backup of your data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have two drive related reports in your Event Viewer System log. The first is occasional but the second repeats at regular intervals. The last report
 is timed at 18.25 on 24 January 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not open the Application log. It said it was corrupted. If you send another copy I will try again.</p>

<p>This warning most likely refers to an Apple Mobile Device. I doubt it is causing the computer not to boot.

The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Harddisk2\DR7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many internal drives does the computer have? You do not have access to Disk Management but drives there are listed as Disk 0, Disk 1, Disk 2 etc.
 Sata connection points on the motherboard are also numbered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your computer make and model? If not a branded computer what is your motherboard make and model?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you put the drive back into the problem computer does the BIOS recognise the drive. Make sure the cabling&nbsp; connecting the drive to the power supply
 and to the motherboard have good connections. Replacing cabling is inexpensive and can resolve Event ID: 11 errors.</p>

<p>Looking backing at your initial post what you say there suggests the BIOS must see the drive.</p>

<h3> charlesnslo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype blocks every eight seconds for two seconds</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype community,</p>
<p>I have been facing a big issue for several weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am using Skype 12.1803.279.0 on an HP Notebook Computer, Windows 10, 64 bit;</p>
<p>- The problem started around two months ago, though I cannot recall the exact date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing happens as follows: when talking to anyone on Skype (including the Skype Echo / Sound Test Service), the sound and image of the other user stop / get blocked every 6-8 seconds during around 2 seconds and then starts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens at any time of the day, whoever I am calling, whatever the country or the location.</p>
<p>When calling someone from the phone, the problem does not seem to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea? I tried to find other users with the same issue, someone had faced something similar but did not have the problem when making a Skype Echo / Sound Test Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any kind of help!</p>
<p>Best regards, Charles</p>
                </div>

<p>Dear Sergei_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the reply and apologies for the late feedback.</p>
<p>Indeed: there is no problem with Skype on my smartphone. I am currently using Skype 12.1807.264.0 (probably an update since then), and the issue is similar. I have tried to reinstall Skype on the laptop, same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, on top of that I experienced a clear time shift between me and the person I was talking to.</p>
<p>Does it remind you of any well-known issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Charles</p>

<p>Dear Sergei_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed: the video freezes and the audio cuts off every eight to ten seconds. It starts again after one or two seconds. It then freezes again a couple of seconds later, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has worsened: each time the video and audio freeze, there is now a shift with the person I am talking to: we need to wait several seconds to hear what the other said.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any kind of input.</p>

            Hi 5m4llP0X 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your maximum number of shareable printers.
<br />
<br />The number of printers that can be installed is only limited by your hardware such as ram and hard drive space
<br />
<br />However, you can have a maximum 20 simulteaneuous users accessing the workstation at the same time.  Here is a link that will explain a little more on this.
<br />

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,

            I don't think there is one... i have been in IT for over 25 years and never seen a number associated with how many printers you can have... it has to do with the resources of the print server that limits the amount of printers.

<h2>            Is there a way to sync tiles to get the exact same tile layout on all my Windows 8 machines&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Is it possible to sync the Windows 8 tiles?</p>
<p>I'm currently setting up Windows 8 on my computers at home. I've got them all set up so they're bound to the same Microsoft Account and all synchronization options are enabled. I do see settings, backgrounds, apps and more being synced between them, but
 one thing I really do miss is having the Windows 8 tiles being synced among them. I don't want to spent precious amounts of time placing all the Windows 8 tiles on their right places on each and every machine again. Is there a way to sync this so I will get
 the exact same tile layout on all my Windows 8 machines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 10 November 2014: this functionality is now available in Windows 8.1. Yay! :)</p>

            While this seems like a great idea, it wouldn't be great for the majority of the users. First of all, Windows 8 is designed for use across multiple different form factors and a wide variety of hardware. So apps you have installed on your Windows 8 Pro
 gaming desktop simply won't match all of the apps installed on your Surface for Windows 8 RT tablet or your work laptop running Surface for Windows 8 Enterprise.

            I understand it won't work in ALL situations, though there are situations where it will work and I will benefit from it, like with my 4 household x64 Windows 8 Pro machines. Therefore I understand it doesn't work out of the box, but I was hoping there
 is a manual alternative so I myself can decide when to sync the tiles.

            Or just not show or gray out the tiles that will not function on that particular device (i.e. because of different processor architecture, app not being available, etc). Lots of options to think of to get this to work as oppossed to just saying "no it
 will not work".

            I also find this disappointing. If it is by design, it is an inferior design to the possibilities inherent in the software design. I understand why this kind of syncing would be undesirable in certain situations, but it is clearly a coveted feature for
 other users, and a big drawback that I will be mentioning to my friends. I am the first person trying Windows 8 in a large group of computer-savvy folks, as well as a PhD student at a large, major research university, and this will be one of the prominent
 characteristics/limitations mentioned when people ask me about how I like the software and if it's worth upgrading to. It's a shame because I really like the software more than I expected overall, but this is a major drawback.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I stole the following from this website:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://armarn.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/roaming-layout-for-applications-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://armarn.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/roaming-layout-for-applications-in-windows-8/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turns out that your layout is stored here: <br />
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\appsFolder.itemdata-ms</p>
<p>Basically, here’s the steps that are required:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Install all your apps</em> </li><li><em>Overwrite the file “appsFolder.itemdata-ms”</em> </li><li><em>Logout / log back in</em> </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried it and it works!&nbsp; Seems this would be easy for Microsoft to automate.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with you that this is pretty disappointing given how so many other things sync&nbsp;and that it seems like something that clearly many folks (like us!) want ( for instance, I'd rather sync my Tile Groups before my background color/theme if I had
 to make a choice). That said, I can't follow where you say it is a "prominent limitation" and a "major drawback" that folks should consider when thinking of upgrading.&nbsp;Correct me if I'm wrong, but this capability has never been in any previous versions of
 Windows, has it? So in what way would that prevent someone from upgrading?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not an Apple or Droid user so someone can chime in here but I don't think those platforms have ever offered or currently offer (natively) that ability, either. So why suggest it's a "limitation" that would keep you from adopting/upgrading to&nbsp;Windows
 8 (I'm reading between the lines in your post)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any rate, I'm hoping that this is a feature that will be added soon!</p>

<p>I recently purchased a computer and it is running windows 8.1 .&nbsp;&nbsp; I am having issues uploading pictures to my facebook account.&nbsp; When ever I press upload a picture it takes me to a screen(what is this screen called anyway?) &nbsp;that at the top says "This PC"&nbsp;
 When I click on the scroll down button for this option it has other links "sky drive, This PC, Network"&nbsp; Then below that are some other options "box, hp scan and capture, and sound recorder"&nbsp; can I edit these fields?&nbsp; If so where would I do it?</p>

    <title>How to pass network folder through internet connection sharing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to pass network folder through internet connection sharing&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to give a desktop that is connected through internet connection sharing , access to a Network folder that is on my netgear router. I went to the settings for the internet sharing and attempted to add the network folder to it , the network folder
 is //fileshare on my network , and the desktop on the internet connection sharing will still not access the folder. It seems that the internet connection sharing is put on a separate network?

            That would not be possible, you need to use peer to peer network in order to share files and folders. 
<br />
<br />Internet connection is for sharing your Internet connection. See instructions how to share files and folders:

<p>I was told since the file share is on the same router, the computer that has internet connection sharing on to allow the desktop to have internet, should be away for the desktop to get access to the file share.&nbsp;</p>

            Probably if you setup a virtual private network over the Internet, which is kind of over the top to access a shared file or folder. Peer to Peer networking is the best way to go about doing this.
