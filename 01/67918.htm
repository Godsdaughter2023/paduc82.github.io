<h2>            gray screen after signing on, hard drive running its now 30 minutes</h2>
                    <p>I went to take my Lenovo V460 out of sleep and pushed the start button. &nbsp;First it ran, than I got a runtime error message and a flashing screen. &nbsp;It then went to the normal sign in screen. &nbsp;After signing in I got a gray screen, the hard drive runs (continuously
 and off and on) but it has now stayed in gray screen for 30 minutes. &nbsp;Thankfully, I did not upgrade this laptop to W10. &nbsp;Seems like it happens like this periodically (every couple of months) this time its worse. &nbsp;Help please!</p>

    <title>Dual boot with two hard drives one with Windows 7 the other Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rallen399  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual boot with two hard drives one with Windows 7 the other Windows Vista.</h2>
                    Hi,I have installed a 2nd hard drive from my old computer in my new one and would like to access both.The older hard drive is running Win. Vista home premium and the new one has Win. 7.When I first turned on my computer the auto run asked me if I wanted
 to open files on the new hard drive or use it as storage.What should I choose?What I want to do is to be able to use both hard drives as my old HD has a lot of data I want to either add to the new hard drive(much larger 975GB as opposed to 300GB with 240 full).Will
 I be able to do that?Do I need to set up a dual boot or do any further configurations.I have just installed the 2nd HD and Win 7 recognized both drives.I went to computer and both are there.What next?Thanks.

<p>If you simply want to recover data you cancel any auto run, you dont want any dual boot, which in any case you might not be able to configure unless your Vista installation is a retail version.</p>
<p>In Explorer simply view the data on the old drive and copy it to the Documents location on your win7 drive. You may have to take ownership - see win help -</p>
<p>You wont be able to run any programs that are installed on the old drive. Once you have recovered all data - double check - In Disk Management delete the Partition(s) on the old drive, then create a new Partition. You can then use the old drive as additional
 storage, or preferably as a location for your backups</p>

<p>Your title says dual boot, so I guess that assumes you want to dual boot the old drive running Vista with the new drive running Windows 7:</p>
<p>You will need to install the old drive then do the following:</p>
<p><br />
1. Put the Windows Windows Vista installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.<br />
<br />
2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.<br />
<br />
3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
4. Click Repair your computer.<br />
<br />
5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt.<br />
<br />
7. Type BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. <br />
<br />
8. Type BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
9. Type Drive:\boot\Bootsect.exe /NT60 All, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: In this command, Drive is the drive where the Windows 7 installation media is located.</p>
<p>Repeat this step with the Windows 7 disc.</p>
<p>Please note, if its a Windows Vista installation that came preloaded on a OEM branded computer such as a DELL or HP, you will not be able to boot or use it. Might as well just attach it as a data drive and take ownership of the files and folders:</p>

            Hi,Thanks a lot for your post.I am able to view everything on the Vista drive which is great I can recover the data (mostly music and movies).There are a few programs I can't run in Win. 7 that I was able to in Vista that I really want so my question is
 after I tranfer the data I want can I run vista on a partitionsomewhere maybe format/partition &nbsp;the current Vista HD or maybe on the new Win 7 HD it has almost a 1,000GBs.The copy of Vista I have was included as a OEM from e-machines as is the Win 7.I have
 the install disc for the Vista I had Microsoft send it to me when I was have problems with Vista and needed to reinstall the OS to fix a bug(it didn't work).I'm not really a fan of Vista and if running two OS is a pain I would try very hard to do it.The only
 thing I really want of Vista is the ability to run Music Match Jukebox. It was discuntinued but you can still get the old download files online and I did in XP and Vista but so far unable to in 7.I'm sorry I'm kinda rambling on here.T

<p><br />
Since your Vista version is an oem version it cannot be transfered / used on a different system (hardware) it lives and dies on the old PC</p>
<p>It would be generally unusual for a program that runs under Vista, not to be able to run under win7</p>
<p>Music Match, do you mean this? <a href="http://www.musicmatch-10.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.musicmatch-10.com/</a>&nbsp;allthough wether it runs under Win7 is a different matter</p>

            The MusicMatch Jukebox 10 I'm talking about is the older version Music Match Jukebox Plus 10.0.4 or earlier ver. 9 or 8.It is the absolute best mp3 organizer and burner I've ever used and I've been looking for something to replace it so far no go.Media
 Monkey is great for organizing and playing music but the burner sucks,Windows media player in 7 sucks completely the closest to Music Match is Real Player Plus but the burner isn't quite as easy to use as MMJB's.In Win.7 Media Player 12 doesn't even offer
 a tag editor anymore why I can't understand also if you burn a cd it doesn't support cd text which to me is essential.If you know of a Media player that is pretty good I'd love to here about it.Mostly for music Video players are pretty good.Thanks.

<p>Hello Jason,</p>

</p><p>For your question, please let me know if you are using local Skype for Business server. I need the client side log to have a further check. I will send you a private message to collect the log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, please have a check on your sender and recipient to see if the ip belongs to the external recipient.</p>

<p>Apologies, I got an email notice about the reply, then it disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We previously had an on-prem lync server, over a year ago. &nbsp;We're completely on skype for business 365 now with no on-prem servers remaining. &nbsp;All previous configuration has been removed. &nbsp;We've never had (to my knowledge) the 10.236.x.x address block defined
 in our network. &nbsp;Please let me know how to collect the client side logs, and I will do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing we have noticed, is that this seems to happen primarily when connecting to a skype meeting created through exchange/outlook. &nbsp;We are still using on-prem exchange 2010. &nbsp;When doing a peer-to-peer session directly through skype, with sharing/etc,
 I don't see this same behavior, though I can't say for sure it isn't happening.</p>

<p><span>Hello Jason,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For these users, ensure that logging is enabled on their Skype/Lync client.</p>
<p>This is done in Options-&gt;General-&gt;Logging in Skype for Business: Full</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lync 2010/Earlier clients:</p>
<p>Select the drop down next to the "Gear" icon in the top right corner of the Lync client, then select "Tools," and select "Options." On the "General" tab select the check box for "Turn on logging in Lync".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business 2015/Lync 2013 clients:</p>
<p>Select the drop down next to the "Gear" icon in the top right corner of the Lync client, then select "Tools," and select "Options." On the "General" tab select the drop down for "Logging in Skype for Business" and select the full option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get the client .uccapilog file from the tracing directory of the user (location varies by client version). The file will be named Lync-UccApi-X.UccApilog and there are usually three of them that we rotate through so you will want to grab the one from the
 timeframe that the issue was reproduced.&nbsp; It is recommended to simply grab the entire tracing folder generally as the client and media stack .etl files are sometimes also useful, so please zip the entire Tracing directory and then upload them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tracing directory locations are:</p>
<p>Lync 2010/Earlier clients - %userprofile%\tracing</p>
<p>Lync 2013/Upgraded Skype for Business 2015 clients - %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync\Tracing</p>
<p>Skype for Business 2016 clients (non-upgraded from Lync 2013) - %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\Tracing</p>

<h2>            New Xbox One X &#42;Static Sounds&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Evening all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed with my Xbox One X that when going through the menus I often pick up an interference with the sound that's similar to a static pop or crackle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought nothing of it until I picked up the same noise by passing the TV using my Bose Speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Faulty console?</p>

<p>Hi Nova,</p>

</p><p>This also could be your speakers connection causing this. Make sure everything is connected firmly.</p>

<p>Tried that - screen stayed blank a few times. I noticed I always get the sound without fail by&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Home screen &gt; Side bar &gt; scroll and select 'settings'. Its makes the pop noise without fail when doing this just between selecting and taking you to the menu settings.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Nova!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the process of elimination by not using your Bose Speaker and connect your console directly to the tv using the HDMI cable since it carries sound and video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the noise is still there, then try switching out the HDMI cable. If noise still persists, then we can figure out more options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results you get!</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker 2</h2>
                    Is there any way to get a version of Movie Maker 2 that will run on Windows 7? Or if that fails is there a hard copy instruction manual on the current version of Movie Maker?

            <p>If you want the classic version of Movie Maker, I would suggest <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WMM 6.0 for Windows 7</a>. In addition to that, don't forget the <a href="http://goo.gl/jLyuG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
custom transitions, titles and effects</a> you can have with that classic version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for a guide to the latest version, there's a user-contributed <a href="https://www.box.com/shared/bedsnr2001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Guide for Windows Live Movie Maker 2011</a>.&nbsp; That will cover most of what you would need for Movie Maker 2012.</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers. We've noticed that you updated your original post and confirmed that the driver was installed successfully. Since you're still experiencing issues with it, there's a possibility
 that the initial installation that succeeded corrupted the driver.<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, we suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the driver again. If you find that the issue persists, this may already be pointing to a hardware issue and as such, you'll need to get in touch with your laptop's manufacturer for further assistance
 and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have further questions.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Lov,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I'm not sure if you're understanding what I wrote (on updated), but attached is the screenshot to proof that only Camera App can detect the camera, while both Intel App (Welcome to Intel Realsense 3D Camera) and Windows Hello Configuration
 failed to detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you help me to identify this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case the Infared on the Intel Realsense SR300 on my Acer Aspire V Nitro is failed to work, it there's any chance that I need to pay for replacement (My laptop is still under warranty)</p>

<p>We understand that you've successfully installed the drivers for your camera, and it can only be detected by the Camera app. Since Windows Hello requires an infrared camera, your laptop's manufacturer can further assist you with your concern. They will be
 able to check your device's camera and the warranty coverage of your laptop.</p>

                    <p>Homebrew system, not overclocked, used to be stable. Now crashes several times per week; sometimes multiple times per day. Only found a few dmp files, but event viewer lists 13 different Critical Kernal-Power EventID 41 events in March alone.

<p>
</p><p>Tried running things down on my own, but haven't hit on a solution that works.</p>
<p>Checkdisk was fine; tried re-installing MSE.<br />

            <p>Possibly there was a complication with the installation media that you created. Stop this process, double back, and use the method provided in the link below to create a new installation media and upgrade your system to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to follow the instructions exactly in order to retain your activated status.</p>

            Had the same issue with two different PCs, both are less that 6 months old, and starting with Windows 8.1. First thing,
<strong>be real patient</strong>, and start this process earlier in the day. Using a DSL connection, it took two hours to download. Once the download was completed, process seemed to hang up at "Preparing to install". Make sure that it is really hung up. At
 about the 25% status it seemed to stop. It had not stopped, but was working really slow. I found this out by placing a Sticky note on the status bar on my screen at the end of the status bar.&nbsp;After 15 minutes I checked the status, and it appeared to have slightly
 moved. After checking again 30 minutes later, it was definitely moving. After about the 50% mark it seemed to start moving at a&nbsp;faster rate. It took 2 hours for "Prepare for Install" to complete.&nbsp;Once the "Preparing for Install" step was completed, it took
 another two hours for&nbsp;Windows 10 install. It took a little over 6 hours.&nbsp;The only issue&nbsp;I seem to have now is there is an issue with my touch pad driver. Otherwise, no other issues with Windows 10.

            <p>It has taken my computer 12 hours to download the Windows 10 update. &nbsp;And now it seems to be stuck in the 'preparing to install" mode. &nbsp;I will try this option and just wait longer and see if it is moving. &nbsp;I do hope it works, because the alternative of going
 back and starting over is unthinkable yet. Wouldn't it be great if Microsoft could actually help with making this transition easy ?</p>

<p>It is your choice whether you&nbsp;buy Windows 7.</p>
<p>Vista can be a good Operating System when properly maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this to get Vista up and running:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Restore Point:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>If Restore does not work and you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, make a Bootable Repair Disk to do a Startup
 Repair:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Startup Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Above link shows what the process looks like, and a how-to, as it loads to the Repair Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />
<br />
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span></p>

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps to improve Vista, once it is running:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>

<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

            <p>Hello beny_boy, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Brother has developed a RT driver for your printer it will be somewhere in the list of drivers that come up when you install the printer. You may have to try more than one driver to find the correct one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Brother has not developed a RT driver for that printer, one of the other Brother drivers might work. RT drivers are usually for a range of printers, but there is no guarantee Brother has developed one that will work with Windows RT.

    <title>Vista Laptop Cannot Connect Wirelessly to New Router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Laptop Cannot Connect Wirelessly to New Router</h2>
                    I've had the laptop for about a year and a half, and it has a history of being pretty finicky about connecting wirelessly.&nbsp; Often it just refuses to do so.&nbsp; During vacation last year, for instance, the other three laptops in the family connected easily
 to the hotel's wi-fi, but mine just refused to.&nbsp; There are plenty of other times when the laptop has been unable to get connected, but I've been able to connect at the two most important places--home and work--without much trouble, and so I haven't looked
 too hard at solving the connection problems up until now.<br />
<br />
This week I replaced the router in my home setup.&nbsp; The old Netgear router kept dropping the connection between it and my ISP.&nbsp; The new Linksys router seems rock solid in that regard.&nbsp; I have a desktop running XP that is wired to the new Linksys router, and
 it sees the internet just fine.&nbsp; My Vista laptop can't connect (wirelessly), though.&nbsp; It sees the network with plenty of signal strength, and it tries to connect.&nbsp; I get a message saying that connecting is taking longer than usual, and then another message
 saying "Successfully connected."&nbsp; However, I have no access to the internet, nor can I see the other devices (just the XP desktop, really) on the network.&nbsp; The Network and Sharing Center shows my laptop connected to "Unidentified network," and then there is
 a red X between that network and the Internet (shown as a grayed-out globe).&nbsp; The laptop reports its "access" as "local only."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
From the desktop, I can access the internet, so the router is connected to points upstream.&nbsp; From the desktop, I can also access the router's setup pages, and I see that it does not list the laptop as a dhcp client, even though the laptop thinks it is connected.<br />
<br />
ipconfig on the laptop shows a wacky IPv4 address:&nbsp; 169.254.2.91, and I guess the laptop is not getting an address passed to it from the router.&nbsp; I think it should have a 192.168.*.* address if it were working properly.<br />
<br />
Now, I was pretty sure that my laptop's wireless adapter was working properly.&nbsp; It still connects to the old router, and it still connects at work.&nbsp; But to be sure, and really to test the new router, I went out and bought a separate USB wireless adapter.&nbsp; When
 I plug it into the XP desktop, the desktop connects to the router and can see the internet (even with the wired connection unplugged).&nbsp; So both the new router and the new USB wireless adapater are working properly.&nbsp; When I plug the new USB wireless adapter
 into the laptop, the laptop still can't connect and still does not get assigned a good ip address by the router.<br />
<br />
I've been at this for a couple of days now, and I could really use some help.&nbsp; I've read a couple articles in Microsoft's forums that purported to address the problem.&nbsp; One of them told me to try running a program called DHCP in the administrative tools folder.&nbsp;
 I do not have that program on my computer.&nbsp; Another told me to manually edit my registry (yikes!) and add a new DWORD and set its value to 1.&nbsp; I did that, but it did not fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I'd be very grateful for any help.<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Alright.&nbsp; I'm home from work and back at it again.&nbsp; I've read several more posts with people reporting problems similar to mine, so I guess I'm not alone in this.&nbsp; In one thread, the experts suggested booting into Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp; So I gave
 that a shot.&nbsp; I still couldn't really connect--just that "local only" without an IP address assigned.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noted is that my brand of laptop and its wireless adapter seem to get special mention in many of the posts.&nbsp; I have an HP&nbsp; Compaq Presario CQ50 Notebook PC running Vista Home Premium SP2, 32-bit version (even though the processor is 64-bit).&nbsp;
 The wireless adapter is an Atheros AR5007.&nbsp; Several other people with that adapter have reported problems.&nbsp; Maybe that's the cause?<br />
<br />
I look into updating the driver for that adapter, even though yesterday's test with the separate USB wireless adapter showed that the problem couldn't just be limited to the Atheros adapter.&nbsp; To look for a driver update, I connect my laptop to the router via
 an ethernet cable.&nbsp; It's nice to see the web on the laptop again.&nbsp; No driver update is found.<br />
<br />
For fun, I attempt to establish a wireless connection with the router while the wired connection is still in place.&nbsp; It looks like maybe it worked???&nbsp; I say a little prayer and disconnect the ethernet cable...<br />
<br />
It's a miracle!&nbsp; I have a wireless connection to the router and beyond, to the internet.&nbsp; Huzzah!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The network now has a real name, too, instead of just "unidentified network."&nbsp; I take this opportunity to change the network type from public to private, which I was unable to do while it was still "unidentified."<br />
<br />
Then I terminate the connection so that I can see what happens when I try to reconnect.<br />
<br />
Another miracle!&nbsp; It connects back in and can still see the internet.&nbsp; Callooh!&nbsp; Callay!<br />
<br />
Next test:&nbsp; See what happens after a reboot...(please, please, please)...<br />
<br />
Ch-ching!&nbsp; It works again!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Final(?) test:&nbsp; Reinstall the McAffee internet security suite and reboot.<br />
<br />
And it still works.<br />
<br />
Here's a re-cap of what I've found:<br />
1. laptop couldn't connect wirelessly to new router, despite dozens of attempts in which i grasped at every straw available<br />
2. laptop could see the internet when wired to the router<br />
3. laptop could connect wirelessly to the router while the wired connection was in place<br />
4. once that first wireless connection was made, laptop remained able to connect to the router even when the wired connection was removed and the laptop rebooted<br />
<br />
I'd classify my discovery above as a work-around rather than as a solution, though.&nbsp; It's still not going to help me get connected the next time I'm on vacation, for instance.&nbsp; But maybe the information I've provided can help the experts diagnose the real problem
 a bit.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to hearing something back.<br />

            <p>Hi Hazel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloading and installation is possibly being blocked.&nbsp; Please see the following for how to download and install the program:
<a href="http://www.gamblock.com/product/installation/computer-installation.html#more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gamblock.com/product/installation/computer-installation.html#more</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you downloaded it but cannot find it and/or got no screen to start the installation, then please try contacting technical support for assistance:
<a href="http://www.gamblock.com/contact-us/technical-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gamblock.com/contact-us/technical-support.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to try Telephone&nbsp;contact&nbsp;(I don't know their hours or to what extent they offer help, but suspect they'll help you with this) see:
<a href="http://www.gamblock.com/contact-us/telephone.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gamblock.com/contact-us/telephone.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is already installed, here's how to access it being logged in as the user&nbsp;who did the installation:
<a href="http://www.gamblock.com/product/features/access.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gamblock.com/product/features/access.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option if you think it downloaded but can't find it to install (it didn't run or you saved it and now can't find it), is to go to Windows Explorer to the user profile for the user who did the installation and check for all Download folders (there
 may be several each containing different items).&nbsp; It may be difficult to recognize if the filename really is install.exe with no reference to anything else, but if you click on the date column title to sort that way and have an idea when it was installed,
 this may help you find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                    <p>I have a 500GB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe SSD (boot drive) that I want to replace with a higher capacity M.2 card.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I put the new SSD during the NVMe to NVMe cloning process?&nbsp; My mobo only has one M.2 slot for NVMe SSD's so do I want to use an external adapter for one of the M.2 cards?&nbsp; If so, do you have a recommendation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have solved this issue for your desktop or laptop I would like your advice on if and what extra hardware you needed during the cloning.&nbsp;

</p><p><span>please <span>r</span></span>emember that I am dealing with PCIe NVMe drives ONLY.&nbsp; NO Sata is involved except possibly for a connecting cable from the desktop to an adapter.&nbsp; I am experienced with cloning SATA III drives but cloning NVMe is a little

<h2>            Game Pass Game doesn&#39;t start anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hey Support-Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a active Game Pass and Live Gold membership. During this I downloaded and played The Division as a Game Pass game. When my Live Gold membership expired and I tried to start the game it gave me a failure message that I need Live Gold. So I renewed my
 Live Gold membership but in the meantime my Game Pass expired. I didn't notice and tried to start the game which game a obviously a failure message again. So I renewed the Game Pass and now with both memberships (Live Gold and Game Pass) active it gave me
 the same failure message again and I can not start and play the game.</p>
<p>After this is thought I try to reinstall it, deleted the game and tried to download it again. Now it seems the game is no longer available with Game Pass. To be honest, this is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how I can reinstall and play the game again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            I wanted to add that Division 1 has been on sale a lot recently. With Division 2 coming up, there should be more discounts in the near future if you wanted to buy it. Physical copies will most likely the cheapest for right now but there will be more digital
 sales if you can wait a couple months.

<p>Hey Creama,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I hope I can clear some things up for you. First of all, the game is "always-online" which requires a Gold Subscription, hence why you were prompted to purchase the Gold. Unfortunately, those issues you had afterwards were caused
 by the game being removed from the Game Pass catalog. Games are constantly being added and removed from the Game Pass library and we understand it can be quite frustrating when you get hooked on a title like The Division.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is described in the terms of game pass that games will not stay forever. When a game is leaving game pass it is announced the sane way it is announced which games are being added.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Pro WMC problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weddo49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro WMC problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have searched and searched for a solution to my problem but can't seem to see the same problem, although some are very close.</p>
<p>My Acer Aspire 8920 laptop is quite old but I purchased it for the 18" wide screen, in-built TV tuner and Windows Media Center, as it doubles as a small TV (with it's own remote) in our small campervan.</p>
<p>It came with Vista Home Premium installed and every time it hung I blamed the computer. ie Acer.</p>
<p>When W8 came out I purchased Windows 8 Pro so I could continue watching TV (with a full tv guide) in the van, and the laptop became much faster generally, especially loading up, &amp; very reliable (Sorry Acer, the operating system was the problem not your hardware!)
</p>
<p>I then upgraded (free upgrade) to W8.1 Pro and the laptop continued to be reliable - until the H/D failed earlier this year. I purchased a new H/D and dutifully installed W8 Pro from the disk I had only to get "Incorrect key" when I entered the key that
 came with the disk. I know realise it is an upgrade disk only but I didn't know there was a difference till recently.</p>
<p>So back in&nbsp;Feb I&nbsp;jumped onto this forum and asked for help and amongst other answers someone suggested a link to which I could install W8.1 Pro&nbsp;with the key I had, which&nbsp;I did only to find out later after contacting the "MS Answer Desk" that even though
 I have W8.1 Pro on the laptop apparently my key is for W8.1&nbsp;only. I am very confused!</p>
<p>I am thinking about re-installing Vista Home Premium as I did make a system backup (a set of six or seven dvd's), actually not sure if it is system backup or a system restore set of disks,&nbsp;and then upgrading up to W8 Pro with my purchased disk then to W8.1
 Pro so I can again get WMC.</p>
<p>So a few questions: Is this a practical thing to do? I can't fully read the key for W Home Premium on the base of the computer as some of the letters and digits have rubbed off, will I need it? Are there other software&nbsp;options for being able to watch TV
 on it from the in-built tuner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not very computer literate (read an older person!) but in hindsight maybe I shouldn't have installed W8.1 Pro from the link on this community page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for any advice,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you had to reinstall your Windows 8.1 with out knowing you had a upgrade key and you are planning to use the system back up key and revert the computer back to vista&nbsp; and then upgrade it back to Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would highly recommend you to contact Microsoft phone support so that they can validate your key and guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to use media center you need a separate key or you should have a Windows 8 pro with WMC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below link for the phone support:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you will not be asked for the key to reinstall the preinstalled Vista... at least not if you use the disks you made with Acers Tool...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently did this to a Dell that had a HDD failure and was not asked for a key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Center doesn't normally come with Win 8 Pro... it is now a optional feature that needs to be purchased separately... With it's own key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to Win 8.1 I automatically ended up with the Win 8 key, and not the Media Center key that was in use... Media Center then had to be added to Win 8.1 with it's own key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you remember how you obtained Media Center previously ?</p>
<p />

    <title>Keyboard on ASUS Laptop with Windows 10 OS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m.t. bucket  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard on ASUS Laptop with Windows 10 OS</h2>
                    <p>There is a key on my keyboard marked, "tab" beneath which are two arrows, pointing in opposite directions, at short vertical lines intended, I surmise, to represent a stopping point.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the old mechanical typewriters, this key would be two separate keys
 and were easily set to stop the carriage at a point chosen by the operator.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to be able to use this feature but have found it more difficult than the old mechanical kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is someone who can explain how to do so at ANY time, in ANY
 application with a step-by-step explanation that doesn't require so many steps that I need to be able to read them as I go, please reply.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise just say that it's too complicated for that and leave it at that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe me, I'll understand!&nbsp;&nbsp; I already
 wish I had chosen one with a different OS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; The boxes labeled "Topic *", and "Subtopic *" that appear below, indicate that I should "--Select One--"; however, none of the options provided seem to apply.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps "None Of The Above" should be one of the possible options.</p>

<h2>            Did the Update Fix Work for the Surface Pro 3 Simplo Battery&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The fix for my battery was installed and updates says it was successful.&nbsp; It is still acting odd though.&nbsp; 5 minutes after a full charge it show 93% and 1hr 15min remaining.&nbsp; After another 1/2hr it says 3hrs + remaining.&nbsp; Gives me inconsistent readings all
 the time.&nbsp; I took the device to the MS store and they said there is nothing they could do that i should just take my power cord with me.&nbsp; Nice....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is out of warranty so the cost is prohibitive to fix it unless i do it myself.&nbsp; Has anyone had success with the update and the battery issue?</p>

            <p>You didn't mention which CPU you had but mine is an i5 and it gets 5 hours and 47 minutes which was timed with a stopwatch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Creative Update comes across in April for everybody, the text display should be gone since it is bogus and just look at the percentage number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power management has been a key factor in the Creative Update and you "may" see some improvement.</p>

<p>You need to post there, the XBLPETs will tell you why you were banned (possible reasons include cheating, modding, "infections", selling items on XBL for Microsoft points or money, bad language on voice, text, or your bio, receiving 34 forced name changes...
 yeah, it's quite a list. Post there and you'll know in 24 hours.</p>
