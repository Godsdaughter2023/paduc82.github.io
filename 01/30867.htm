<h2>            Bad Company &#38;quot&#59;Dream Team&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I am planning on forming a "Dream Team" for bad company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know that the only way to be good at Battlefield is to use teamwork. My goal is to form a team of four (myself and three other people) to mainly play squad deathmatch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I am looking for experienced players who know the ins and outs of BFBC2. AND are good team players.</p>
<p>If you want to join, just say so, and ill play a game of battlefield with you to see how well you work as a teammate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once a full team is made, we will meet on xbox in a party and decide things like roles, rules, tactics and such.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<h2>            Was this a scam call&#63; urgentechelp.com - urgent tech help</h2>
                    I just received a phone call from urgentechelp.com who "showed" me apparent errors in Windows Computer Management Event Viewer.<br />
Then they wanted me, ultimately, to back up my files to the "Live Support" on their webpage.<br />
When I refused they got quite irate and threatened to disconnect my PC from the Windows Server so I cldn't get updates for a year!<br />
They eventually hung up (rang off) on me.<br />
<br />
I cldn't find ANYTHING abt urgentechelp.com on the Microsoft website and a mate who works in IT tells me I did the right thing.<br />
<br />
The worrying thing was they were able to quote the correct&nbsp; .zfsendtotarget CLSID to me over the phone.<br />
But this might be a standard number in Win7 for the .zfsendtotarget key.<br />
<br />
Any official response from Microsoft?<br />
A disclaimer on their website?<br />
<br />
thanx<br />

            <p>This is a scam. You are right that the. zfsendtotarget CLSID key is identical on all Windows computers. CLSID is nothing to do with your Windows licence. It&nbsp;stands for Class Identifier which&nbsp;are unique numbers used internally by Windows to identify components,
 in this case a program associated with a file extension.</p>

<p>Microsoft will not call you unless you call them and open a Support case on an issue. The is one of many SCAMs taking place around the globe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they had remote access to your machine. You may want to take precautions and change all passwords for banking, credit card accounts, email accounts etc.... that you access via the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is you did the right thing and did not put your data on their server for them to access at their leisure.</p>

                    <p>When will this issue be fixed?</p>
<p>These are my system start issues which I noticed when a game would not update.</p>
<p>I had Norton until one suggestion was to remove it.</p>
<p>I ran a virus scan suggested on your site which found nothing.</p>
<p>I have attempted all diagcabs on your site and few actually initiate. Those that do state they cannot resolve&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>I cannot&nbsp;perform a restore as it fails as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to a solution.&nbsp;</p>

User Action<br />
1. Open the file again. This situation might be a temporary problem that corrects itself when the program runs again.<br />
2. If the file still cannot be accessed and<br />
&nbsp;- It is on the network, your network administrator should verify that there is not a problem with the network and that the server can be contacted.<br />
&nbsp;- It is on a removable disk, for example, a floppy disk or CD-ROM, verify that the disk is fully inserted into the computer.<br />
3. Check and repair the file system by running CHKDSK. To run CHKDSK, click Start, click Run, type CMD, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type CHKDSK /F, and then press ENTER.<br />
4. If the problem persists, restore the file from a backup copy.<br />
5. Determine whether other files on the same disk can be opened. If not, the disk might be damaged. If it is a hard disk, contact your administrator or computer hardware vendor for further assistance.<br />

<div>The error value is listed in the Additional Data section.<br />
User Action<br />
1. Open the file again. This situation might be a temporary problem that corrects itself when the program runs again.<br />
2. If the file still cannot be accessed and<br />
&nbsp;- It is on the network, your network administrator should verify that there is not a problem with the network and that the server can be contacted.<br />
&nbsp;- It is on a removable disk, for example, a floppy disk or CD-ROM, verify that the disk is fully inserted into the computer.<br />
3. Check and repair the file system by running CHKDSK. To run CHKDSK, click Start, click Run, type CMD, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type CHKDSK /F, and then press ENTER.<br />
4. If the problem persists, restore the file from a backup copy.<br />
5. Determine whether other files on the same disk can be opened. If not, the disk might be damaged. If it is a hard disk, contact your administrator or computer hardware vendor for further assistance.</div>

                    <p>So I might have clicked something or did something wrong when I was switching windows, and then my Taskbar stretched. It didn't really stretch, but more gray was added to the bottom.</p>

    <title>BBC Watchdog Feature&#58; Xbox Console Bans - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BBC Watchdog Feature&#58; Xbox Console Bans</h2>
                    
Gamers who have lost out with Xbox
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Microsoft's Xbox was the biggest selling console in the UK last year, and millions of users have signed up to the Xbox Live service. It allows you to download new games and play online against friends.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>But a growing number of people have discovered that Microsoft has banned them. Permanently. They won't tell you why, and they won't let you appeal.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><br />
Over the past few years, scores of Xbox users have told us that their consoles have been banned from connecting online. Microsoft claims that these users violated their terms of use with no further explanation given and no appeal possible.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bans have been issued by Microsoft's mysterious "enforcement team" whose job is to stop Xbox users from breaking the rules, like tampering with the console and committing online fraud. But the Watchdog viewers that contacted us insisted that they've
 done nothing wrong.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what exactly has Microsoft been saying to customers? Posing as the parent of an Xbox Live user whose console had been disconnected, we called customer services three times. Each time they were very quick to blame us for the ban.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>They told us there has to be a reason for the ban and suggested we speak to our son. They also said that there is no way to appeal the ban, and the only way we could connect online again would be to buy a new console. It was even suggested that we could
 buy a new console for Christmas.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we suggested that Microsoft themselves could have got it wrong we were told: "I can assure you sir, we have lots and lots of calls about bans but in 100% of cases the ban team is really thorough and meticulous and they're always right."<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, according to Microsoft they are infallible and it's certainly the impression they've been giving to consumers. We, of course, were less sure so we called them again, this time as Watchdog.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turned out, they were wrong. Just three hours after our call, Microsoft put up a statement on their website admitting that their infallible team had made a mistake and there had been a software glitch.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of this they reversed some of the bans and gave affected users 3 months' free Xbox Live subscription, plus 1600 Microsoft points. This is around £20 in compensation.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, this came too late for those users that went out and bought a replacement Xbox to get around the ban. And parents like Jo Stuart-Matthews whose 10-year old son Ben was disconnected last month; she didn't want to pay Microsoft any more money and so
 decided to buy her son a Playstation 3 to get him back online, spending just under £170.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When her ban was reversed following Microsoft's announcement, she was furious and feels the compensation offered does not make up for the money she has lost by purchasing a new console.</p>
<p>So, what are Microsoft going to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>A Microsoft Spokesperson said:</strong></p>
<p>"As part of Microsoft's commitment to combat piracy and support safer and more secure gameplay, the LIVE Policy and Enforcement team regularly bans consoles from Xbox LIVE that have been modified in order to play pirated disks, violating the Xbox LIVE Terms
 of Use and Code of Conduct. Recently it was brought to our attention by a number of customers that the ban for their individual consoles may not be valid. After an initial investigation we have identified a handful of banned consoles that were in-fact unmodified
 or tampered with. We deeply regret the inconvenience this may have caused for our loyal members of Xbox LIVE and while the investigation into this error is ongoing, we are working directly with these customers to provide an immediate resolution to the error.</p>
<p>Customers who believe they have been affected by this error are encouraged to contact us at www.xbox.com/support/contact."</p>
<p><br />
<em>1. Why does Xbox think it is appropriate to ban consoles from Xbox LIVE owned by paying customers without giving these customers full and detailed information about why this has happened, therefore refusing customers the opportunity to investigate?</em></p>
<p>We apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused for our loyal members of Xbox LIVE. Microsoft bans modified consoles from Xbox LIVE as part of our ongoing policy to combat piracy and support safer and more secure gameplay. We do not share specific
 details of why a modified console has been banned due to the security issues involved and our responsibility to protect from further breaches. Recent cases of incorrect bans being administered has highlighted a need to reassess this process in some cases and
 provide a more transparent way for our valued customers to talk to us about suspensions of their console where relevant.</p>
<p><br />
<em>2. Why are no reasons given for consoles being banned when customers contact Xbox and Microsoft, and why are customers not given the right to appeal?</em></p>
<p>We take vigorous action against illegal activity related to our products and services. Information about specific modifications can be used by a minority of people who are determined to violate terms of use and for this reason we cannot give specific details.</p>
<p><br />
<em>3. How many complaints has Microsoft received about this issue in the past three months?</em></p>
<p>While we don't comment on exact numbers of complaints, this issue has only affected a small handful of our UK customers.</p>
<p><br />
<em>4. Following the message posted by Microsoft on Friday evening (23 September), how many console bans have now been reversed by Microsoft? Why has this reversal been issued, and why was the announcement made at that time?</em></p>
<p>We can confirm that all UK customers issued with an invalid console ban between August 29th and September 9th have been reinstated to the Xbox LIVE service. These reversals were made when it became apparent that a small number of consoles banned from Xbox
 LIVE had not been modified and out of an abundance of caution we reversed the full ban. A scheduled announcement was made on Friday September 23rd to reflect this.</p>
<p><br />
<em>5. How does Microsoft plan to deal with those customers who have followed the advice of customer services and purchased a new console when they may now have the bans reversed?</em></p>
<p>Customers who received an invalid console ban between August 29th and September 9th and who subsequently purchased a new Xbox360 following conversations with Customer Support on or before September 23rd will be reimbursed for the price of the new console.
 This will be dependent upon: (i) Proof of purchase (made during the period August 29th - September 23rd); and (ii) testing of their old console to verify the validity of the ban. UK Customers affected by this issue should call Xbox UK Customer Support on 0800
 587 1102 for more information and assistance.</p>
<p><br />
<em>6. Will customers not affected by this ban reversal be given the opportunity to appeal or discuss their cases further with Microsoft or Xbox?</em></p>
<p>Microsoft commits to pursuing a more transparent process for customers to talk to us about suspension of their console in some cases, however at present there are no plans to allow customers with modified consoles to discuss valid bans.</p>

No investigation into the fact that the unbanned console's still make it so a person's profile can not be used on any other console than the unbanned machine. Meaning if they want to game on a friend's house they have to use the recovery process instead of
 just putting it on a USB stick.</p>

The corruption issue has been a part of bans since at least the USB update, so it's not a new thing. Surely checking on this should have been the first thing Microsoft did and I'm shocked that such a thing wasn't looked into.</p>

<p>There is an appeal process its just so few people know about it seemingly know about it, you have to request it and you put your account on the line, so if they still find you guilty you lose your gamertag and account too.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../disc-error</a></p>
<p>However, the only one that I think might directly apply to your problem is solution 4 regarding the region. I know this is a long shot, but do the DVDs have a different regional code that where you purchased your Xbox.</p>

<p>I'll run through it again, for sure. The region should not be an issue and I have tried several different DVDs. I think it is a driver issue. Thanks for the reply and advice!!</p>

<p>I have this same problem, it IS a problem.</p>
<p>I have just been through Xbox customer service. &nbsp;I have done all the steps including resetting my Xbox One. &nbsp;I have hard shut-down and unplugged, I have turned off instant-on, I have done everything possible short of buying a PS4 and performing a ritual
 sacrifice in my living room to appease the Gods of the Media Formats.</p>
<p>The problem: my Xbox One disk drive WILL read Blu-ray disks (games and movies), but WILL NOT read DVD disks (games or movies). &nbsp;Things that will play: Zootopia Blu-ray, Far Cry Primal. &nbsp;Things that will not play: Pan's Labyrinth, Star Wars Battlefront. &nbsp;Yes,
 my Xbone used to play these DVD's, no it will not now. &nbsp;I only get a message popping up "Please eject the disk and try again". &nbsp;It doesn't even sound like it spins the DVD to read it.</p>
<p>Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This is a total shot in the dark. It is not based on any official Microsoft posting, it is just a guess on my part. Go into your setting, system, language &amp; location. Is your location set correctly? &nbsp;If not, fix it. If it is set correctly, perhaps change
 it to something else, restart, change it back again, restart, and try again. &nbsp;My thought is that if this is a region issue/bug, toggling it might kick it into working again.</p>

<p>No, my regions are correct and haven't been changed. And that wouldn't explain why blu Ray disks work and dvd's don't.
</p>
<p>I'm really kind of embittered about it, especially Microsoft's cluelessness and shrugging and saying "well, go try these forums over here". It's a defective product.
</p>
<p>"Here's your new car, you can use it to drive anywhere! Oh, and by the way, in two years when your shifter stops doing any gears other than reverse, um, go check this forum". At this point it ISNT a all-in-one living room solution- my old DVD player was
 till going for over ten years until it was outpaced by formats. </p>

<p>I am having the exact same problem. All disc including my DVDs and BackWards compatible Disc worked before, but after opting into the new experience through the preview program. None of my DVDs or or Xbox 360 game disc work anymore. &nbsp;Due to the fact that
 this I believe is due to the update to the new experience. I feel this falls on Microsoft fault to fix it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no problems before and played all my disc, DVD format and BluRay no problems. Now I can only play Blurays and Xbox One disc. &nbsp;Did all the trouble shooting. &nbsp;Microsoft please figure something out with this issue. I believe your new preview update caused
 a problem with my Xbox One reading disc. &nbsp;All disc work perfectly fine on my Xbox 360. So I know its not the disc. &nbsp;And the Xbox One it's self works with Bluray format disc, there for I know it's not the hardware. &nbsp;It's your update.......so please fix it.

<p>I read in another forum that the Laser that reads the DVDs can go bad while the BluRay Laser still can work. Is this possible? &nbsp;If so then I guess I will just wait and use my 360 to play my old games and DVDs. &nbsp;Rather wait until next year and upgrade to
 the Scorpio. &nbsp;A shame though I really wanted to be able to continue to play my 360 games on my Xbox One. Hope its not hardware failure.</p>

            <p>You cannot play Xbox One but DVD is okay which means the disk drive is not broken. I think the DVD playback issue might be caused by CSS or DRM code. You need rip the DVD first and then stream it to USB and pluge it on your Xbox One. But before you do this, you should refer to the copyright protection laws in your country.

<h2>            DVD Drive Not Showing Up In Device Manager&#47;Windows Explorer&#47;Registry&#47;BIOS</h2>
                    I &nbsp;recently noticed a problem on my computer where I am unable to access my DVD drive. &nbsp;It is no longer listed in windows explorer. &nbsp;I did some research and some posts say to check the registry keys however I am unable to find the registry key for DVD
 drives in&nbsp;<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class</b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><font><span>In addition, there is no field for DVD/CD-ROM drives in the device management screen so I am unable to uninstall the firmware and see if that helps. &nbsp;I also checked disk management and
 it was not listed there either. &nbsp;I've attempted to remove the DVD drive and re-install it hoping it would recognize the new hardware but no luck there either. &nbsp;I have also check BIOS and don't see anything listed in BIOS (although I don't even see in the section
 for this bios where it gives me the option). &nbsp;The BIOS version is AMI R1100Y8. &nbsp;I've tried to check sony to see if there are any revisions but I can't find anything for it. &nbsp;The BIOS screen only lists a few options so I'm not sure if some of them are locked
 or not.</span></font></div>
<div><font><span><br />
</span></font></div>

    <title>Can&#39;t turn off autopilot after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karliej  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off autopilot after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10, I can't access the internet because the autopilot toggle is on. I've tried changing it back to wi-fi, but it stays stuck on autopilot. I have other devices in my household which use wi-fi, so I know that this
 isn't an issue with the wireless connection, but for some reason I can't get my laptop to connect. This is a huge issue, as I'm a student and beginning classes. I need the internet to connect into my school's course database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has an idea how to resolve this problem, let me know! I'm not the most technology-abled person, so please make it simple instructions, if possible.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> deadly_bagel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fable The Journey - Calibration Loop</h2>
                    
<p>I've punched every combination of keywords I can think of into Google and all that come up are reviews.</p>
<p>Basically I got to the part where it forces you to go through calibration. I did it twice because the first time was a bit screwy. When satisfied, I hit Save And Continue, it then restarted back to "Where am I...?" and put me through the calibration again.
 And again. And again.</p>
<p>Regardless of what options I try I end up back in calibration, have tried reloading and all that. Any ideas? I can't be bothered sitting through forty minutes of prologue again.</p>

<p>Hey there Bagel! I understand you're having some trouble in-game here. I haven't played it myself, so I'm not too familiar with the intro, how long it is, or how far in the calibration is. You've said that you have done this calibration to completion multiple
 times since this loop started, correct? Can you try starting a new save and see if you are thrown into this loop again? Let us know, thanks!

<p>The Kinect is not in an ideal place at the moment and as a result riding the carriage is choppy and unpredictable. Magic doesn't seem to be too bad once calibrated correctly. We will be moving hopefully mid this year at which point I'll give it another go.</p>
<p>Until that point, like I said, I just can't be stuffed wrestling with the intro again. Was just seeing if anyone else had the same problem and if there was a fix. If the issue persists then I'll revive the topic or make a new one.</p>

            Hi Kayleigh
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Some users reported similar issues and resolved them by doing the following:
<br />- use CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to launch the Task Manager
<br />- Kill any instance of Skype.exe 
<br />
<br />(1) If you are using Skype app from Windows from Microsoft Store
<br />- click Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall 
<br />&gt; then install Skype again from Microsoft Store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>)
<br />
<br />(2) If you are using Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Copy the line 
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Click Windows Key+R 
<br />- Paste into Run window by CTRL+V and then click Enter 
<br />- Rename this folder to something difference for instance Skype for Desktop_Skype_Old 
<br />- Reinstall Skype (<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> ) 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<p><span>In step (2) you say to paste this into the run command: %appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This location does not exist. Searching the windows explorer, there is nothing even mentioning Skype in this location.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you get the recorded messages and need to press a number to continue, Skype does not send the tone to the phone. I have killed, uninstalled, reinstalled, uninstalled, searched for everything that said skype in
 the name, deleted it, shut down, restarted, ran disk clean up, ran defrag, reinstalled, still have the same issue, this is a Microsoft issue that should be fixed. When I press the button, it has a short sound, but the answering phone does not receive a thing.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi </span>Shmuel-chai Kalujny<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Desktop icons serve as shortcuts to run programs on a computer. It can be arranged automatically or stay where they are in your desktop environment by changing its settings. To determine what’s causing your icons to auto-arrange, we’d like to ask a
 few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em>winver </em>
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What were the recent changes made on your computer before you experience this issue?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any programs that can change icon settings?</span></li><li><span>Did you install a theme from other websites besides from <strong>Microsoft</strong>?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, you can visit this link: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/289587/how-to-arrange-or-move-icons-on-the-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to Arrange or Move Icons on the Desktop</span></a></strong>
 for more information about options on how you can customize your icon arrangements.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, you can resolve this by performing these steps: Right-click your <strong>
Desktop </strong>&gt; <strong>View </strong>&gt; <strong>Auto arrange icons. </strong>Uncheck it so the icons will not move anymore.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

                    Hey everyone and MS,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've just upgraded from Win 7 to Win 8 -64Bit. &nbsp;Initially there were some issues with the installation but I eventually made it through. (Uninstalled AVG, Disabled ATI Mobility Radeon HD - bam!!!) &nbsp;Now I'm beginning to notice problems with locating my
 hard drive in the Explorer Window. &nbsp;You know, underneath Computer and all that in the Left Pane. &nbsp;Yep, does not even appear! &nbsp;I have 2 external Seagate Hard drives and neither show in the Window. &nbsp;When I go to my Hardware and Devices, they are present. &nbsp;But
 I'm only able to access properties and so forth. &nbsp;If anyone has a clue on this please let me know a solution. &nbsp;</div>
<div>My computer: &nbsp;<b>DELL</b> Precision | <b>M6500</b> |<b> i7 Quad Core</b> | <b>
8Gb Ram </b>| <b>Windows 8 </b>| <b>ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5800 Series </b>Graphics Card<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh and can somebody tell me the quickest way to restart my computer on Windows 8?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your immediate attention!</div>

            <p>Hi Erin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you better I would like to ask you few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any Operating System or Boot files in this drive?</li></ul>
<p>Because, we can't change a drive letter if the drive is either a system partition or a boot partition.</p>
<p>I would suggest you Rescan the disks and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Right-click Computer, then in the box that appears click “Manage”.</li><li>If you are prompted for permission to open, allow it to.</li><li>Under Computer Management (Local) double-click Storage, and then double-click Disk Management</li><li>Once in Disk Management go to the menu bar at the top, click Action, and then in the box that appears click Rescan Disk.</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to send a screen shot of your disk management so that we can assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post back with result so that we can assist you further.</p>

<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

 but is now an empty folder. I can still find the files but it takes longer because I have to work through the folders of my document directory to find and open a recently used file again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox 360 Icon on the Home Screen is Now Static</h2>
                    
<p>This is just an observation, but not too long ago when logged in to Xbox Live on the home screen at the bottom right hand corner there is an Xbox icon, and underneath it was a kind of water effect or something. The icon also used to alternate between the
 icon and "Live", but now it is just a static icon with no animation. </p>
<p>Well I like how it doesn't alternate back and forth from the icon to Live anymore, but I don't like how they removed the animation underneath it. I thought the animation was a pretty cool effect.</p>

<h2>            cannot access files and folders on windows 10 over network</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Asus EeeBooks - X205TA machines. They had pre-loaded Win 8.1. I have wireless network in my office and network sharing was working fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 upgrade was downloaded on both my machines via windows update. So I upgraded both my machines to Win 10. I had to setup the network again. I have two printers attached to both my machines. I can print from both machines on both printers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I login machine A using hotmail credentials and machine B with local user. I am using Public folder under users directory for sharing. I can access all files and folders from machine A but the problem is I am not able to access the public folder from machine
 B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what is wrong in my setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
