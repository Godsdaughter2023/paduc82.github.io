<h2>            Stuck at restarting screen after driver update</h2>
                    I bought a new laptop and updated it to the latest version of windows 10 i.e 1803 and later i observed that the network speed i am reciereceis very low compared to my friend who is connected to the same wifi network, So using intel driver support i updated
 the wireless ac9650 to the latest version then it asked for a&nbsp; restart and got stuck at restarting. What do i do now?

            Hi saikarthikk,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and uninstall that driver you installed
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us for this issue. When it comes to paying a past due balance on a subscription in your account, you'll need to pay the full balance due using a credit or debit card. Gift cards and pre-paid codes will not settle the balance. I
 recommend using the support article entitled <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/pay-past-due-balance-on-xbox-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to pay a past due balance on an Xbox subscription</a>. This contains information on how to get the balance paid so that you're up to date with your subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>

<p>Hi hato san,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this past due balance issue being experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the best way to go through the support portal to be able to request a callback from a representative in your region that can assist you with this billing issue. You can skip the virtual agent.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Contact us here</span></a></li><li>Select <strong>Billing</strong></li><li>Say <strong>No thanks </strong>to the virtual agent</li><li>Select <strong>Error Messages and codes</strong></li><li>Skip step 3 and go to step 4</li><li>Select <strong>request a callback from support</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>There is also chat support with a live agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope customer support can correct this issue.</p>

            <p>Kiran,&nbsp;Bill195 never&nbsp;mentioned the "Get Windows 10 App". For goodness' sake, READ THE QUESTION! I swear,&nbsp;I've been an Insider since the program was started, and by far the vast majority of questions asked here&nbsp;in the Microsoft Community are met with&nbsp;similar
 incompetent responses like yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've said it many times before, and it seems to need repeating all too often: I wonder sometimes if you Microsoft "helpers" are even real people,&nbsp;and not&nbsp;just a computer program that scans the questions for certain "key words", and then spits out "canned"
 responses that most times have nothing to do with the actual questions asked or problems stated. Either that or ... well, let's not even think about the alternatives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, this "Community" is a joke. The only real answers I've ever seen here are almost always from other members, MVPs or Insiders who seem to be the only ones on here that can read, much less give people with real problems coherent answers and advice
 relevant to their needs. I hope Microsoft isn't paying you "helpers" real money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, either get us some real "Engineers" on these forums who are capable of reading our questions and problems, and then offering up relevant solutions, suggestions, advice, etc., or just quit pretending you have such people and let us members
 help each other as best we can. The bottom line is that this is what's happening already, anyhow, and this&nbsp;situation is&nbsp;not only an embarrassment to MS as a company, but most aggravating to the folks needing help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and I also have&nbsp;a "jerry rigged" suggestion for Bill195: You can try&nbsp;executing the app&nbsp;by entering:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ms-get-started:///</p>
<p>
</p><p>in your Web Browser's URL&nbsp;field and hitting the "enter" key on your keyboard. It works on my computer, but you might get the same "This functionality has been designed to work with Windows 10 devices" message on your computer. Who knows. But if it does work
 for you, it could be a workaround until the next big&nbsp;"Creators Update" in April of next year.&nbsp;It's worth a shot, I suppose.</p>
<p>

<p>I am running windows 10, the new "Getting Started" app downloaded but won't open. It displays the following message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This functionality has been designed to work with Windows 10 devices.. Is this another MS fiasco, or what?"

<p>Bill195: You can try&nbsp;executing the app&nbsp;by entering: </p>
<p>
</p><p>ms-get-started:///</p>
<p>
</p><p>in your Web Browser's URL&nbsp;field and hitting the "enter" key on your keyboard. It works on my computer, but you might get the same "This functionality has been designed to work with Windows 10 devices" message on your computer. Who knows? But if it does work
 for you, it could be a workaround until the next big&nbsp;"Creators Update" in April.&nbsp;It's worth a shot, I suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of other, far more complicated workarounds that might work. Let me know how it goes and if you need to pursue other avenues. There are no guarantees with fixing ANYTHING that gets broken by the new "Windows As A Service" and forced Cumulative
 Updates, you know. Breaking things is it's specialty.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hummm ... Probably because the ms-get-started:/// command opens the app on the local computer, and since your app won't load normally, it doesn't work for you. Sorry, I just thought it was worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming you've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app a dozen times already? :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, unless you've found another app you're satisfied with, the next, less dangerous, step is to go here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/some-of-my-installed-programs-dont-appear-on-the/65d958f4-c427-4cf3-9e35-19df67222b38?auth=1/"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/some-of-my-installed-programs-dont-appear-on-the/65d958f4-c427-4cf3-9e35-19df67222b38?auth=1/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>for more suggestions. Although a different issue, they work for your issue for some people, especially Method 1.</p>
<p>Just be sure to read the entire thread before you do anything so you'll know what to expect and maybe avoid some serious pitfalls. Some of the posts&nbsp;could&nbsp;point you to other places for other possible fixes, also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no still no cigar, get back to me. I have some other, but more dangerous, possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<div>Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't install Windows 7. In fact, the computer shows a blue screen right after it says "windows is loading files", right when the windows logo starts to appear. In other words, it crashes like 1 minute in. I have been successful in
 installing 64 bit windows xp pro, so I don't think anything is wrong with the hardware.I have:<br />
<br />
<br />
Corsair 650 w power supply<br />
Asus Sabertooth z77 Motherboard<br />
Intel i7-3770k processor<br />
2 x 4g Corsair Vengeance 1866 mhz memory<br />
EVGA 560 ti 2gb video card<br />
Corsair 64 g ssd<br />
Asus 24x dvd-rw <br />
<br />
I have tried using different sets of memory, different hard drive, no video card, no optical drive, so I really dont think it's a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
The error codes are<br />
<br />
STOP: 0X0000007E (0XFFFFFFFFC0000420, 0FFFFF880010357BE, 0FFFFF880043777D8, 0xFFFFF88004376F00)<br />

            <p>I would try updating the BIOS and see if it makes a difference. </p>
<p>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</p>

<p>The disc might be scratched or the digital download might be corrupt. If its a digital download, try downloading another copy and burn again at the lowest speed. If its a store bought physical disc, try obtaining a replacement disc. You can download another

            Do you sometimes receive notifications when you are on this forum page or looking at a opened Internet link sent by youy contact ? Some friends experiment that too.

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've had the Surface Book for a few months now and up until yesterday I've been super happy with it. Yeah there were a few glitches and issues at first, nothing that couldn't be worked around and resolved. However yesterday something really really concerning
 happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to hibernate the Book when not in use and yesterday I sit down to turn it on and I essentially get a BSOD (memory error). Upon restart, concern starts to flood in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- First, I get to the login screen and upon entering my credentials the welcome message sits on the screen for a good 2-3 minutes (normally login in sub 2 seconds). I assume the system is hung, so I hard reset. When I try again, it's the same thing, so I
 let it sit there this time. Maybe 4 mins later the screen goes black but, I see the cursor and can move it. I let it sit for a while longer. Another minute or so and windows starts to appear slowly, completely unresponsive at this time. Minutes and minutes
 pass, finally windows appears to be loaded, but even the simplest task (i.e. opening windows explorer) takes like 2-4 minutes to perform, like the CPU is running on a single core, at 100Mhz, with all caching disabled lol. Yes, it feels like what would happen
 if a CPU blew up and overheated!</p>
<p>

            <p>My Department just recently purchased a Surface book for testing/evaluation and deployed it out to our first user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today is the first day of real use and we had the same thing happen as well. The user reported the mouse "freaking out", which was correct. It was like the touchscreen was being pushed randomly and the mouse would reset to the top of the window. The machine
 was closed and attached to the dock. The only thing extra is a Logitech unify adapter for wireless keyboard/mouse. The odd messages about the CPU being limited by firmware. And several devices failing to restart... I'm not sure if the device thought it was
 supposed to be waking back up from sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a minute of the above behavior the machine actually rebooted and showed a bug-check in the event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other forums posts suggested a possible Intel Speedstep issue in the bios(having to disable it to remove errors in the event log). But that was for a surface Pro, so I don't know if that would even be the same kind of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other information anyone runs into about this issue would be super helpful. I saved the minidump file and cleared the event logs to see if it happens again after another day of running. Hopefully this will reveal some more information or the source if
 we get any more errors.</p>

            <p>Different issues, two fairly random BSODs today, PDC_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT and WDF_VIOLATION. I've had occasional BSODs with this machine (6 weeks old), always a different error, but two in one day (so far) is a concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also become reluctant to use hibernate or sleep, for reasons such as the above as well as the power drain from connected standby. I'm really hoping that the next firmware update, the one that is supposed to address power and sleep problems, cleans up
 these driver issues.</p>

            <p>OK, it's been 3 days with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of all things I think the problem was Panda Free AV!! One of my event viewer msg's led me back to the program as a possible root cause, so I tried uninstalling it. Yeah, it wouldn't uninstall, so I found a way to remove it myself, and since that (3 days
 ago), I don't seem to be having any issues. I've used it for everything in those 3 days, sleeping it, hibernating, attaching/detaching the screen and so far so good. Yes I've since put a paid a more 'trust worthy' AV on the system as well ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if this changes I'll update here, however it's looking promising for now.</p>

</p><p>The only AV I'm trusting is Microsoft's own Windows Defender. &nbsp;It's all I've ever used on my Microsoft Surface computers and I've never had a problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got my first Microsoft computer, a Surface Pro 3, I set it up while still at the Microsoft Store in case I ran in to any problems. &nbsp;I asked one of the techs what AV program I should buy and he recommended what came with Windows. &nbsp;I told him that I
 doubted that it was any good. &nbsp;He then told me that Windows Defender was the only AV they used at the store and it was the only AV used throughout all of corporate Microsoft. &nbsp;That was good enough for me and I've never looked back.</p>

            <p>it certainly feels that way. I get:</p>
<p>* Doesn't come back from sleep (keyboard lights up but nothing happens) then it reboots.</p>
<p>* Plugging into dock causes BSOD randomly</p>
<p>* Waking causes BSOD randomly</p>
<p>* Detaching from dock causes screen to go black and not wake up, then it reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have had to setup autosave on all of my applications.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've had the Surface Book for a few months now and up until yesterday I've been super happy with it. Yeah there were a few glitches and issues at first, nothing that couldn't be worked around and resolved. However yesterday something really really concerning
 happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to hibernate the Book when not in use and yesterday I sit down to turn it on and I essentially get a BSOD (memory error). Upon restart, concern starts to flood in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- First, I get to the login screen and upon entering my credentials the welcome message sits on the screen for a good 2-3 minutes (normally login in sub 2 seconds). I assume the system is hung, so I hard reset. When I try again, it's the same thing, so I
 let it sit there this time. Maybe 4 mins later the screen goes black but, I see the cursor and can move it. I let it sit for a while longer. Another minute or so and windows starts to appear slowly, completely unresponsive at this time. Minutes and minutes
 pass, finally windows appears to be loaded, but even the simplest task (i.e. opening windows explorer) takes like 2-4 minutes to perform, like the CPU is running on a single core, at 100Mhz, with all caching disabled lol. Yes, it feels like what would happen
 if a CPU blew up and overheated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- So I start freaking of course. Painfully I wade through what I can checking things such as device manager and event manager. I see tons of messages basically saying that Core 0 of CPU 1 is limited by firmware for x seconds and first think that's the problem,
 but then I realize it's just a 'safety' message, it's happens all the time. There was a single hibernate error as well, as expected because of the BSOD. No other issues I can see however, device manager is clean. Now one thing odd, I do notice that the battery
 reading is way off, 1.5 hours remaining instead of the expected 10 hours (as if the screen was off the base). I detach the screen and reattach, just to see if anything changes, it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- OK, next step, I'm gonna safe mode this sucker and try a restore. Maybe (I pray) it's a bunked update and not a hardware failure (post and getting to the login screen is still speedy enough)? So I reboot, go into 'safe mode' and try a restore point. No
 restore points available, DOH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reboot and bam, everything is back to normal. Login was the expected sub 2 seconds, everything is as it should be. I check all the hardware again, run a memory diagnostics, run a error check on the SSD an nothing, no errors. I have CPU/GPU temps being
 recorded, nothing odd in the last 24 hrs. Checked again this morning, and it's as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be worried of an upcoming hardware failure? (i.e. if the fans didn't spin up, the CPU could have been easily overheated and if they spun up over time the issue would have disappeared just like I saw). However, maybe
 there is some known firmware/software + hibernate glitch I bumped into and through my troubleshooting managed to skirt around it? Something flaky about the screen connection, my detach/reattach actually did solve the issue and it only fully resolved on reboot?</p>

<p>There is something very different going on between our computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book is an i7/16GB/512GB. &nbsp;My most used applications are Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation, Microsoft Office 365 Subscription, Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, and Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop CC Subscription. My AV is Microsoft Defender. &nbsp;My browser
 is Chrome. &nbsp;I keep all of my data and photos on Microsoft OneDrive. &nbsp;I have a good 90 Mbps Comcast Internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've timed my boot-up many times and from the time I press the ON button to Windows Hello Face Recognition I average 10 seconds. &nbsp;Then I look at the Welcome screen for an average of 30 seconds. &nbsp;Then I have my Home screen and I'm ready to work. &nbsp;From the
 time I turn my SB on to the time I'm working averages 40 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the Dec 2nd update that fixed the video problem I had crashes like everybody else. &nbsp;I've not had a single crash since the update. &nbsp;I use my Surface Book as my main computer every day and I'm on it more than 12 hours every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't completely shut down before I close the lid, my SB will overheat and use excessive battery just like everyone else. &nbsp;If I make sure I am totally shut-down before closing, I have no problem. &nbsp;I definitely have the "sleep" problem and I'm very ready
 for the update that fixes it. &nbsp;My Power settings are all default settings. &nbsp;I turn OFF auto brightness on my display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had an anomaly like you experienced. &nbsp;There's no question that I would be as upset as you are if my Surface Book behaved like yours.</p>

<p>Perfect!&nbsp; Couldn't have said it better myself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual hardware is fantastic.&nbsp; Better than a Mac (and I came from Mac), better than most other PC's.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, and it's a killer.&nbsp; What good does my $2500 piece of good looking hardware do for me if I spend 25% of the time trying to fix everything that is going wrong with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even have to bring my older iPad to do PPT with for my clients because it's crashed 3 times in the middle of the PPT!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such a joke. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was willing to give MS 2-3 weeks to iron out some of the software bugs, even a month.&nbsp; But we are now 3.5 months!!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Unreal MS.&nbsp; I cannot believe this is still an issue for you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Massive battery drain in connected standby, battery drain on FULL SHUT DOWN, constant freezes and crashes, battery life of 6-8 hours doing almost nothing taxing at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER..You'll NEVER get another dime from me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And Marvin Sorensen pointed out, they deployed this machine recently.&nbsp; I am responsible for doing it company wide.&nbsp; I really WANTED this to work for our field salespeople.&nbsp; I have deployed an iPad Pro with Pencil and so far, that user has experienced no
 issues whereas me, being the tester for this, cannot get work done without an issue popping up.

<div>
<p>I would love to know how you pull off the magic trick of 12 hours with that software that you use.&nbsp; Do you have it at 10% brightness and battery saver mode?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time I can get close to that is if I watch movies cross country and wifi is turned off, brightness at 75%, in airplane mode.&nbsp; And it's more like 10 hours.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote, OneDrive, Chrome (which I think is a battery hog but I use Cirrus Insight plugin and I need Chrome for that), Office 365, and when I am not flying, I am answering 50-75 emails a day, light web browsing, office tasks, listening to Groove in
 the background in occasion.&nbsp; I also use Evernote occasionally, desktop version, but close out when I am done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under those conditions, I am lucky if I get 7-8 hours, max.&nbsp; 75% brightness most of the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Oh..and for good measure, when I fully power off, overnight, I will go from 100% to 92%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In Hibernate, I only drop 2-3%</p>
<p>In Connected Standby (sleep) I lose 15-18% like everyone else. </p>
<p>

                    There is something wrong with my Win8 OS.&nbsp;
<div>When I sign in it only gives me 5 seconds to pick and app and it gets stuck on that app.</div>
<div>I usually pick the desktop because it is the most useful but when I'm on it I can't go back to the start screen or use the sidebar, I can't even see the volume bar thingy when I change the volume.</div>
<div>I have everything backed up but I don't know how to 'Factory Reset' windows 8 from the Desktop app.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried everything else like restarting Windows Explorer - didn't work</div>
<div>I have tried restoring to a previous point - It doesn't roll back</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All I want to do now is reset Windows 8 but I have to do it from the desktop.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Please help</div>

            Actually, go to charms, settings, power and hold shift and click restart as fast as you can. That will bring a menu up. go to advanced and do restore. That will format the drive but leave a fresh windows 8 copy in! Doing that should fix your issues. hold
 windows key+c as soon as you hit the desktop to get to charms from the beginning. if luck is on your side, you should be able to get to settings fast enough. Keep trying and let me know if it works.

            ok, in that case, hold shift when you shut down and see if that takes you to the menu I described earlier. otherwise, you can hold shift and tap f8 like **** when the pc is booting and that will sometimes take you to the menu I described.

<p>I was on the page that comes up when you are about to login to your computer. At the bottom right you have the shutdown, sleep, restart option - if you click restart while holding either shift or Ctrl it should take you to the Windows 8 reset page.</p>
<p>I just held down shift and ctrl while pressing restart just to be safe.</p>

                    Why does the surface pro hibernate when i close the lid or press the power botton, even with sleep selected as the option in the settings? This happens rather frequently with windows 8. With 8.1, it hibernates every single time. I need some answers quickly
 because its becoming a nuisance.

<p>Have you attempted to disable the hibernate settings on your Surface?</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p>Control panel&gt; power options&gt; change plan settings&gt; change&nbsp; advanced settings&gt;
</p>
<p>Sleep&gt; hibernate settings</p>

<p>I have done that.. </p>
<p>Anyways, somehow my surface pro decided to function properly and not hibernate when I put it to sleep. I do not know how or why, but it is now working as it should.<br />

            <p>You may use or have used iDisplay iPad Monitor Software (http://www.getidisplay.com/) and installed the Win8 (beta) Desktop Software. Even after reinstall I still have exactly the same problem. I wrote to iDisplay support but got no answer yet...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all of you should go to http://www.getidisplay.com/, scroll down the page, click "support" (or click here: http://www.shape.ag/en/support/support.php?form=idisplay&nbsp;:) and tell them that they have to act.</p>

            <p>I had the iDisplay problem as well. After deleting the program, the Windows 10 Updater app still showed my PC was incompatible due to iDisplay. I had to search out the remaining iDisplay files left in the registry. I'm not recommending that you due this,
 just stating that I did. Even after removing iDisplay completely and showing my computer was now compatible, the WIndows 10 Updater app was stuck under the previous results for being incompatible. Frustrating. Then I found the link to download the Windows
 10 file to USB to install it myself. This is the link:</p>

<p>Sorry, but your reply was not helpful.&nbsp; But thanks for trying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a very simple answer:&nbsp; What can I do to get around the apparent incompatibility of iDisplay?&nbsp; Will Microsoft try a fix, do I have to somehow replace iDisplay, or what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem with (my only one year) old HP Pavilion 23 All-in-One PC 23-b330la.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Giridhar, hope you can help me and those other people with the same problem.</p>

</p><p><span>Hello Jannine_P,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I had the problem yesterday at 22:00 - 23:00, my local time and today is a day after at 15:23 local time, so better later than never, I guess.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, I have some problems:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. I cannot set-up the caller ID, since it is always answering with Fail, please try later. Then it will freeze and not answering to any button
 (using mobile devices, iPhone and iPad)</span></p>
<p><span>2. I have registered a Skype-To-Go number, but I realize it was a mistake and I and I want to delete it, but there is no button for that. Not change
 or something but delete.</span></p>
<p><span>3. I bought a pre-paid telephone card in New Zealand and wanted to register the number, no way it was possible.</span></p>
<p><span>4. So, If I'm calling anybody with my new Skype number I just purchased for over 20 Euro, no number is showed on receiver’s phone</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kind regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Laszlo</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is it a mobile number or your Skype Number that you're setting up as a Caller ID on the account? What's the Skype and&nbsp;iOS&nbsp;version installed on your devices, iPhone and iPad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you're referring to removing the Skype to Go feature, you may simply log on at
<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skype.com</a>, under Manage Feature, click on Skype to Go &gt; click on Disable.&nbsp;Also, there's no option to&nbsp;delete a number&nbsp;registered under Skype to Go, however, you have the option to update/replace
 the number that you have mistakenly entered. </p>
<p>

            <p>Try the keys "Alt+0176" or "Alt+0186". For Desktops, hold down the "Alt" key and type in the numbers from the numeric keypad. On laptop keyboards the “numeric keypad” is found by pressing the "fn" and "num lk" keys and then looking for the keys on your keyboard
 that double as numeric keypad keys when in NumLock mode. That is, for "Alt+0176", hold down the "Alt" key then press the keys M, J, 7, and O, which corresponds to numbers 0, 1, 7 and 6 for the symbol "°" and for "Alt+0186" press the keys M, J, 8 and O for
 the symbol "º". Note, the last key is letter "O" not number zero (0). When you're done deactivate the "num lk" by pressing the "fn" and "num lk" keys again or your "num lk" keys will always type numbers instead of letters.</p>
<p>Or if you are typing on MS Word, you can type the small letter "O", then select it, click on the Format menu, font..., on the "Font" properties, "Font" tab, under "Effects" click on the box before "Superscript" to check it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You can use the copy and paste facility on the symbol created on both process.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased Zoo Tycoon Ultimate Animal Collection from the MS store. I have my digital product key and ready to use... but I can't seem to download it. I do not have an Xbox -- I want to use it on my kids' Windows 10 computer. Can you please tell me
 how to download? When I run Xbox from the computer, the only option I have is to buy it again, not to use the product key I already just got...</p>

            Hi Natasha,
<br />
<br />You'll be pleased to know that the license to the game entitles you to access on both Windows 10 and Xbox platforms. Hopefully you'll be able to try something out different here (and with success), go into the Microsoft Store, and click the three-dot button on the upper right corner of the window. Navigate into My Library, and you should see your purchased game in there with a download icon waiting for you.
<br />
<br />If you do not see it, make sure to check and see if you're logged into the Microsoft account that is the same one you used to make that purchase. You can check that by clicking on the button with your profile picture on the top right.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you experience any more issues and I'll do my best to assist. Good luck.       
        </p>

<p>OK. That didn't work. I managed to get it to work doing this: In the XBox app click on the XBox One tab (I think), then try to buy it, then pops to "You own this" and "install."</p>
<p>But now a different problem. I installed on my user account, and no matter what I try I can't get it going on the kids user. Even made them admin, age setting is at 11.</p>
<p>Urgh. any ideas?</p>

            Hey again Natasha,
<br />
<br />Do you have a separate Microsoft account for your kids? If so, the purchase is limited to your Microsoft account and you will have to go into your profile in the XBOX app. Or in other words, once you open the XBOX app, go into your profile by clicking on the hamburger (or three-line stacked button) menu on the upper left, then click on the menu option with your name (first option), then click the link that says + More, then log into the app with your Microsoft account, since it has the purchase. Try to download it again.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

<h2>            Changing a named person in Windows Photos face recogition</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding the Windows face recognition feature to be very helpful as I have thousands of photos. However sometimes it is misidentifying a person, e.g. it has tagged some of the pictures of my brother as a young boy as my nephew (his son) as they are alike,
 and also my dad as a little boy as my brother, etc. I understand how to remove a tag completely from a photo, but is there a way I can change a tag to that of another person already in my contacts?</p>

                    <div>Windows 7 SP1</div>
<div>Ducky Wired Mechanical keyboard DK-1008</div>
<div><br />
</div>
My keyboard has malfunctioned. I was using the keyboard successfully, unplugged the keyboard temporarily and when plugged in again I received the notice that the driver was not installed successfully, the device has malfunctioned, and the device is not recognized.
 I initiated the standard procedures including running microsoft's troubleshooting software and following instructions from the help pages including this one. Steps taken include:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>uninstalling the device driver, searching for driver updates, rolling back the driver(this option was not available), searching for the driver online, restarting the computer with the driver uninstalled, and powering off and unplugging the computer. The
 result was all the same and the issue was unresolved. I then tried to use the keyboard on 2 other computers but the problem persisted. Does this mean the problem is the keyboard itself? I see no reason why the keyboard would suddenly malfunction, and the driver
 problem seems to be common but I have not been able to find any information on this problem occurring for a device regardless of the computer it is plugged into. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!&nbsp;</div>

            Yes. You need to replace the keyboard, since the device failed to work in all the computers you checked.

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your keyboard is not working in more than one computer, which&nbsp;suggests that there is a hardware problem in the keyboard. Moreover, you already have performed the steps that ensured that the software part associated to this issue is not causing&nbsp;the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, hardware failure of a keyboard is not something that we encounter too often; but it happens to computer keyboards. And unfortunately, if we go by the issue symptoms,&nbsp;your keyboard is also facing a hardware failure. So, at this point,&nbsp;getting the keyboard
 checked&nbsp;by someone who knows hardware diagnosis would be the best thing to do. May be its&nbsp;a small repair that the keyboard needs or may be you will have to replace the&nbsp;keyboard - only a certified hardware technician will be able to confirm this for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this explains the issue better. Do reply if you have any concerns with Windows, we will be glad to be of assistance.</p>

<p>AVD Files are DOS 7 files.&nbsp; I spent nearly 45 minutes searching for any program that would read this file type and could come up with none (well see below - it may as well have been none).&nbsp; I am sure the reason you can't watch AVD files from a DVD disk is
 because there is no software installed that can read that file type.&nbsp; None of the major viewing software programs support this file type and I couldn't even find a single 3rd party program (freeware, demoware, shareware, or commercialware) that claimed to
 be able to read this file type (and I spent over&nbsp;45 minutes looking in all the obvious places: Bing, Google,<a href="http://www.tucows.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.tucows.com</a>, and
<a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.download.com</a>). I could also find no program that can convert AVD files into a format readable by standard viewers.</p>
<p>Well, that's not entirely correct.&nbsp; I found the folllowing: <a href="http://media-geek.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_details&amp;Itemid=142&amp;gid=160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://media-geek.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_details&amp;Itemid=142&amp;gid=160</a>&nbsp;but I do not qualify to become a member (and doubt you do either) and the program isn't listed on the listed homepage of the manufacturer (which possibly means it is no
 longer available or supported) and it doesn't say what operating systems it is compatiblle with (so I don't know if it works with Vista even if we could somehow get to the point of downloading it which I doubt).&nbsp; I'm not even sure it's applicable to the DVD
 you have.</p>
<p>In effect, if it was ever possible with prior versions of Windows or Windows software, I don't believe it is possible any more.</p>
<p>You can search for yourself and I wish you success.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>There are many converters available on the net...<br />
the following links are just examples.<br />
<br />
***Proceed At Your Own Risk***<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
1) Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
2) 3) Koyotesoft Free Video Converter<br />
<a href="http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html</a><br />
(2000/XP/2003/Vista/Seven)<br />
<br />
3) Format Factory (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup260.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screen)<br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag FFSetup260.exe out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi knight_12,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Movie Maker is not compatible with .mov files. However, if you have a video or audio file that is not supported, you may be able to
<b>use a non-Microsoft video editing program to convert the file</b> into a format that Windows Movie Maker supports.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You need to perform an online search for video conversion software to find one that fits your needs (check the file formats which are supported by Window Movie Maker.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>File formats supported by Windows Movie Maker in Windows XP</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Import the resulting audio or video file into Windows Movie Maker. Some files also require you to install a codec before you can use the files in Windows Movie Maker.
</span></span></p>
