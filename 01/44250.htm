                    <p>Original title : unsolicited phone call </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call from inextsupport.com saying my computer is sending signals to them that may indicated a problem. They took me thru to my computer, right click then event viewer, windows logs, applications and there were over 1600 error/warning signs. I didn't change
 anything because I was suspicious. Is this legitimate? Either way should I be concerned about the error/warning signs?</p>

            <p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are facing in Windows regarding the Bluescreen issue. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I suggest you to answer the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Which driver are you trying to update or install?</li></ol>
<p>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly or due to incorrect installation of the drivers. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start
 menu or the taskbar on the screen when your PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the below link and <strong>check if it helps resolving the issue regarding the Blue screen error.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong> <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Troubleshoot blue screen errors in Windows 10</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post to us with more information and results. We are glad to help you further.</p>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

    <title>Windows licence when copying a drive image to new hardware&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulkraemer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows licence when copying a drive image to new hardware&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I work for a company that builds machinery&nbsp;with which we include a Windows 7 PC that also&nbsp;runs MS Office 2010 Professional.&nbsp; I build this PC and install / configure Windows, Office,&nbsp;and some&nbsp;3rd party software.&nbsp; This is a very time consuming process.</p>
<p>As this PC is absolutely crucial to the operation of our machinery, I'd like to supply an identically configured spare PC (PC2)&nbsp;that can serve as a backup in case the original PC (PC1)&nbsp;should fail.&nbsp; The easiest way for me to do this is to copy a drive image
 from PC1 to PC2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&nbsp;gave this a try&nbsp;and it seems to have worked, but when I started PC2, both Windows 7 and Office 2010 showed up as unactivated.&nbsp; Windows 7 gives me the opportunity to change my product key and activate.&nbsp; I can do this because I did purchase a second copy
 of Windows 7.&nbsp; It wasn't as easy to find, but it seems that Office 2010 also gives me the opportunity to enter a new product key (by going to Control Panel | Programs | Programs and Features, selecting "Microsoft Office 2010 Professional 2010" and clicking
 "Change", and finally selecting "Enter a Product Key").&nbsp; I can&nbsp;do this&nbsp;as well, because I did purchase a second copy of Office.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The problem I have is that I will almost definitely&nbsp;want to attempt this procedure several times.&nbsp; I purchased two Windows licenses and two Office licenses, but I am afraid of "using up" all of the allowed activations on these licenses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For example, today I&nbsp;did the drive imaging&nbsp;procedure from PC1 to PC2 for the first time.&nbsp; I want to&nbsp;activate Windows and Office on PC2 and fully test PC2&nbsp;with&nbsp;our machine before putting it into storage as a backup.</p>
<p>After doing this, I will continue to make configuration changes on PC1 as I fine tune all my software / settings before we ship the machine.&nbsp; Prior to shipment, I will want to do the drive imaging procedure from PC1 to PC2 again.&nbsp; At this time, I will&nbsp;be
 attempting to activate&nbsp;the same Windows / Office licenses for the second time.&nbsp; Will I be able to do it again?</p>
<p>After we ship our machine and it is installed at our customer, I continue to fine-tune my software to meet my customers needs as they evolve or as we realize things that we can make better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time&nbsp;I make a significant change, I'd really like to do the
 drive imaging procedure again and to authorize and test all software.</p>
<p>It seems to me that I will soon reach a limit where Microsoft will no longer allow me to activate Windows 7 and Office.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions that might make this task&nbsp;easier for me, without requiring me to keep purchasing new licenses over and over again for the same two PC's.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Paul</p>

            <p>You can activate each license on the same hardware as many times as necessary&nbsp; - although if too many time, or too often, you may be require to use telephone activation.</p>

            <p>There is one important aspect to bear in mind. If the license(s)&nbsp;you refer to have been supplied with either or both of these PCs then under the terms of the license agreement they are not transferable to another PC.</p>
<p>If however they are full boxed product licenses purchased separately from the PC in question (and not an OEM pack)&nbsp;then provided they are removed from the original hardware then the license can be re-applied to a new PC.
</p>
<p>The activiation process will be reinitialised if the image has been transferred to another hardware platform and will happen every time. Even automatic reactivation will work at least once&nbsp; but if it happens too often then you will be instructed to phone
 the activation centre. The fact is that you can only have it licensed on as may PCs as you own the licenses for.</p>
<p>The EULA makes no specific allowance for the same license to be installed on a "live" system and a mothballed one not in use.</p>

<span>
<span>
<li>Acrobat Reader 7 </li></span></ul></li></ul>

<p>I uninstalled the software in the manner directed by the message (i.e. opened control panel, clicked on uninstall programs, clicked on Acrobat 7.0 and clicked on uninstall. The process said "Uninstall Successful". I then rebooted the&nbsp;computer Ran the Windows
 7 Upgrade Advisor&nbsp; and everything was "good to go". I tried to install Windows 7 again running the compatibility check this time&nbsp;and got the same message (See Above).<br />
<br />
I went through a full c-drive search (including hidden files) and found all of the files the matched with the search criteria "Acrobat*7*.*"&nbsp;Found some files and file folders this way some of which i could delete without a problem, some requried changing the
 file permission. Eventually I erased anything matching the search criteria. <br />
<br />
Reboot, Retry to Install Windows 7 --- Result: Same compatibility message. Allowed the intall to continue. Almost three hours later with most of the install complete, got a message "cannot install removing installation files and reloading original operating
 system" or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
Had Sony Tech support actually on my computer through their internet access&nbsp;trying to fix&nbsp;the problem and they found and erased a few more Acrobat files and tried to install Windows 7 with similar results. When the install screen hit the same&nbsp;Acrobat 7.0 compatibility
 flag, the chat I was on with the technician suddenly went dead.<br />
<br />
I don't particularly want to play the "just uninstall programs untill you get it to go" approach, nor do i want to do a clean install with all the legacy settings and software that is currently installed soooooo....<br />
<br />
Has Microsoft addressed this with an option to install over the incompatible software (that is not there anyway)? Or are we all stuck wandering in the dark with expensive versions of Windows 7 that cannot be used and equally troublesome Vista OS software.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there have any answers or advise???<br />

    <title>New Motherboard Cannot Activate Windows 10 RETAIL Full Version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sol_12769  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Motherboard Cannot Activate Windows 10 RETAIL Full Version</h2>
                    <p>I just installed a new Motherboard and CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows keeps telling me that the key is already in use. It's the same HDD I had in my other computer, the motherboard is sitting in a box.</p>
<p>I've read through all the things about using the troubleshooter, but that gives me an error about servers being down, repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course trying to call any company in this day and age is a ridiculous feat. Nobody wants to have good customer service anymore. Too expensive to do so I guess.</p>

            Doing a motherboard change is considered a new PC for Windows operating system.  Also it will depend on the license you originally had if you can reactivate.
<br />Click the link below to follow the steps to see if you can activate.

<br />
<br />If that doesn't work try the Microsoft Chat support.
<br />Unfortunately we don't have access to the activation servers to directly support you.

            Hello,
<br />Contact Microsoft representative if it were a full retail license.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends) 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a> through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

<p>So essentially I'm going to have to re-setup my old mobo uninstall or add this account thing and then go back to my new motherboard and activate. Or contact customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah...&nbsp; I'm going to try customer service first. I took a painful amount of time running the wires in that thing so they would be out of the way (Crystal Series Case). I took no consideration for removing a mobo.</p>

            I care. :)&nbsp; In this instance, our friend here is using a theme which specifies to use a black font.&nbsp; While maybe&nbsp;they could override that if it was a Windows theme, in a custom theme like this I don't feel like&nbsp;they should be overriding the font color.&nbsp;
 Do you?&nbsp; It's certainly an odd design choice, but I don't know if they should be overriding something when the theme explicitly says to use a black font. :\

 badly -- as seen here.</p>

</p><p>Actually, I've enabled the old dark mode from the previews using the registry. I actually customized the theme myself, changing the aero.theme parameters...long process renaming folder/files, then changing reference to aero to my own...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've achieved a pretty decent dark theme, but the only thing really missing is the white text in the title bars. This was a problem in 7 as well. (I skipped 8/8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually switch back and forth between a customized High Contrast theme and my customized theme that uses the registry hack aforementioned...Thank you Microsoft for the alt+LeftShift+PrintScreen shortcut!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some issues with High Contrast though, that makes switching out of it necessary, such as working inside applications like Office where formatting is required. You can't see any of the formatting, and this can be problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm "low vision" and the dark colors are quite beneficial to me, as is the new custom scaling feature. The new accessibility features are to be applauded. But I digress.</p>

</p><p>While everyone wants the colored title bars back, that does come with the issues of font colors inside those title bars. All we need is a simple dialog where we can choose font colors for various system items, even fonts and sizes...something a little more
 complex than the area in Ease of Access where individual types of text can be scaled...Just add functionality to that, and all would be right with the world.</p>
<p>

I've noticed something in multiple OS environments...there is a trend toward accessibility for those with no usable vision, but no thought to those of us with
<em>some</em> usable vision. I don't generally need the screen read aloud to me. I used to use a screen reader, but find my "nose-to-screen" method more effective and less cumbersome. My specific eye problems make large magnification more of a hindrance than
 a help. I just need to be able to enlarge the things I want, change colors...or impose a
<strong>GOOD</strong> dark theme that is customizable. You can customize screen readers in just about any way under the sun...but not the general look of the OS. This isn't just a Windows thing, though it's quite evident now in Windows since they've taken more
 and more custom theming options out of the system. For some of us...those with color blindness and other visual difficulties, they're not a convenience or a fun toy...they're a vital part of the experience that allows us to get our work done.

<p>
</p><p>That is true, however there are many issues with High Contrast themes. First, they get rid of many other colors. If you're in, let's say an Office document, you don't see
<strong><em>any</em></strong> formatting other than bold/italic/underline. If there is highlighting, colored text, backgrounds, shading, etc., you won't see it. On webpages, sometimes things "disappear."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compare the two screenshots. At the top-right, there are outlines of boxes in high-contrast that are actual icons that you can see in normal mode.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is why I have to switch back and forth. I use a dark themer in Firefox, and that takes care of the dark background on webpages and doesn't have the ill effects of High Contrast. That's why a *good* Windows Dark Mode...not just High Contrast, would be
 so greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I went through the long security process because i couldn't remember my password and kept trying. So they supposedly locked me out from trying again at that time and put me through the identity questions. I'm writing to you so that you can cancel that. I
 was able to get a reset password finally. I also set up the authenticator for future log ins. Have a great day.</p>

    <title>Windows update still only searching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobo2u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update still only searching</h2>
                    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I have a question. My wife has a x1 carbon lenovo laptop. &nbsp;I recently (today) restored her computer to the "factor" settings, hoping to solve a couple issues. &nbsp;That worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I wanted to do was to update windows. &nbsp;I started the update, and it told me my update program was old, and it downloaded and installed the newest version (I believe). Since this point, it has been nothing but ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update, Windows update standalone and Windows Fixit all do not work. &nbsp;I couldn't even have update START in safe mode. They keep "checking for updates" or whatever. &nbsp;Interestingly, I tried to upgrade to win 10, and that failed too. &nbsp;I can only connect
 via wifi, and it doesn't seem to be that fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on why ALL windows programs don't work? &nbsp;Solutions? &nbsp;I have tried various things that I have seen, which weren't super technical. &nbsp;</p>

What exactly is this "Win security life time update"?<br />
<br />
I would perform a System Restore to set Windows back by three days.<br />

We still do not know what "Win security life time update" is.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you need to perform a "Factory Restore". Check the PC manufacturer's home page for instructions.<br />

            I've spent three hours with norton technician and they finally went into registry edit and deleted a bunch of stuff from each and every "command"&nbsp;folder and&nbsp;the problem is now fixed...I hope. I swear when I installed the upgrade for the "security" thing,
 my Norton was running normal and I remember&nbsp;seeing the "microsoft" logo somewhere... Oh well, it did not leave any trace in my computer right now and hopefully it doesn't come back. And I'll be extra carefull not to upgrade anything even with firewall and
 other virus software running!!!!!!

<h2>            I can view other computers through Net View IP, but not explorer</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p><b>From: </b>Larry</p>


My home network has several XP Pro SP3 computers that are networked with a common workgroup.&nbsp; My Vista computer is a member of WORKGROUP but isn't networking with WORKGROUP properly, although it connects properly over Wi-Fi to the internet.

<p>First, in Explorer, there is an entry named Network (not My Network Places, etc.) that shows only this computer and no entry for WORKGROUP or for the other computers.&nbsp; Also, WORKGROUP is present but is empty
 (except for this computer) in View Computers and Devices. </p>
<p>However, Full Map View shows the other computers and they can be opened with
</p>
<p>\\computername and seen on Net View IP.&nbsp; So, how do I make those computers show up in explorer or View Computers or in some other accessible place?</p>
<p>Also, the Vista computer is not visible from the other computers.&nbsp; If searched for with \\computername, an error message says "computername" is not accessible.&nbsp; You might not have permission ..."&nbsp; Net View
 IP reports "System Error 5.&nbsp; Access is denied."</p>
<p>All computers are using the WORKGROUP name.&nbsp; Same results with all firewalls disabled.&nbsp; Files are being shared. Private Network, Network discovery On, File sharing On Public Folder sharing On, Password protected
 sharing off, Media Sharing On, WINS NetBIOS setting Default.&nbsp; The XP computers are running
</p>
<p>Link-Layer and NW Link NetBIOS.</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>

<p>So I've had the exact same problem with my laptop running vista and my roommate's xp desktop. I may not be able to give the most technical of all answers but we were able to overcome it when we both changed
 our workgroup to a new one. I was pretty surprised this fixed it.</p>

<h2>            &#34;the person you have called has chosen not to receive certain calls&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I call my parents on my skype account o my mobile it says "the person you have called has chosen not to receive certain calls" but when I phone the same number from my wife's account on her mobile it works fine. Why is this? I pay a monthly subscription
 to Skype and my wife nothing. I am continually annoyed by Skype and I am actively looking for a better alternative.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> lattelatte4me  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - System audio works sometimes and sometimes does not.  Sound card Question.  Audio recording question.  Speaker sound quality poor.</h2>
                    
<p>I log on--the system sounds work fine.&nbsp; Media player works fine.&nbsp; Next time I log on--no system sounds.&nbsp; Everything is plugged in just fine, troubleshooter finds no problems, Media player goes through all the steps and looks like it's working, still no sound.&nbsp;
 Dell recommended I download a fix for the VIA Driver.&nbsp; I did that, and it still has the same problem.&nbsp; I can shut down, log on again, and then the sound will work.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to shut down and log on twice in a row to get it to kick in.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this?&nbsp; I am working on a Dell Inspiron 546 with AMD Athlon II X2 215 2.70 GHz and 64 bit with 400 GB of RAM.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 installed but when I dug deeper into the service code for this machine found
 that at one point in time it had Vista installed.&nbsp; Could this be the same Vista to Windows 7 audio problem everyone else seems to be having?&nbsp; I bought this from Staples new with Windows 7 as the advertised operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been researching all of the forums and answers and am having trouble figuring out if I have a "sound card" or not.&nbsp; I am not well versed with the terminology so, even though I can follow Microsoft instructions to find the correct place to check and
 see, I do not understand what I see when I get there.&nbsp; It says: ATI High Definition Audio Device and VIA High Definition Audio.&nbsp; Does this mean I have a sound card or do I need to purchase one?&nbsp; If I buy a sound card will this fix my audio problem?</p>
<p>Even if I get my audio problem fixed, I have been disappointed in the sound quality of the speakers on this new, up-to-date system.&nbsp; My speakers on my old computer (which ran Windows 98) were by far superior in sound quality.&nbsp; I don't understand why they
 sound so crappy and barely get loud and when you do turn them up they have a rattle to them.&nbsp; I tried to plug my old speakers into my new computer but nothing happens.&nbsp; My new speakers have a plug and a USB.&nbsp; I don't know what the purpose is.....why can't
 I use my old ones?</p>
<p>Eventually I want to record my old LP's onto discs and need a great sound system.&nbsp; Any advice?</p>

            I removed all of the ATI Audio as suggested.&nbsp; The short term result is that the audio quality has improved.&nbsp; I no longer hear the "crackle" when the sound is turned up.&nbsp; I will reply further if the audio (off and on) issue continues to be a problem since
 the fix.&nbsp; If you do not hear from me, then please consider the issue resolved, and my thanks to you.
