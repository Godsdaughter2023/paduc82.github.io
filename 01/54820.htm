<p>Pessoal, bom dia. Sou Elias.</p>
<p>Desculpe-me por reativar esta discução, mas estou com o mesmo problema, só que um pouco diferente.</p>
<p>Vejam, ao jogar o Kinect Adventures o sensor fica para cima e para baixo, me procurando, e acha! Consigo jogar direitinho, muito legal.</p>
<p>Mas aí eu comprei um outro jogo, o Disney/Pixar RUSH e foi aí que começou o meu problema.</p>
<p>Ao iniciar o jogo ele fica somente para cima, ele não sobe e nem vai para baixo me procurando.</p>
<p>Faço o teste de calibragem e nada, coloco a foto do rostinho e nada, somente para cima.</p>
<p>Eu não achei esta parte que vocês estão falando para ajustar a posição do censor.</p>
<p>Tenho uma distância boa, pois consigo jogar o Kinect Adventures.</p>
<p>Por favor, peço a ajuda de vocês.</p>
<p>Obrigado.</p>

<p>Bom dia Elias, já tentou remover o kinect e plugar de novo? Mesmo após o jogo da Disney, no Adventures ele funciona normal? No local aonde o kinect está apontando está muito claro?</p>
<p>Abraço</p>

            <p>Simply, I can't get the OEM key to work, as many pointed out already, on this forums, it is not possible to use OEM key for computers for it was not fesignet to go in first instance,</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>provided i have as asus netbook xxx last model with my old os key stamped down below.</p>
<p>i had formatted the hd, i don't have the recovery</p>
<p>(if you ask me why, it wasn't me, it was a technician i brought the pc in for repair that didi this)</p>
<p>(the technician is not here any more and i can't bring it back a second time)</p>
<p>(the technician install an OS but afterwards the genuine key went wrong for some reason i have yet to know)</p>
<p>Now my system with windows 7 starts but it says it's not genuine.</p>
<p>Use my below deck key doesn't work.</p>
<p>The new OEM key with (useless) repair dvd is not working.</p>
<p>calling online verification gives me invalid key.</p>
<p>the seller of this key say i can has a replacement key.</p>
<p>I don't understand how can i fix this, what kind of licence should i get?</p>
<p>What is the best method to do that in ANY circumstances that don't causes me to buy repeatedly new keys for a computer for which an OEM key was already there when this pc was bought?</p>
<p>Should i get a key online from microsoft?</p>
<p>And if so, which is the method and steps recquired?</p>
<p>Will it work ANYWAY even if my old OS boot repair was ERASED and the OS might be different from what</p>
<p>was initially? ( it was 7 starter, now it is 7 pro ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just i don't want to pay four times a key for a computer i rarely use and actually not have a working FULL OS that is GENUINE and i can run upgrades when it is time.</p>

    <title>Win 10 Pro x64-bit upgrade to version 1511 build 10586 from Version - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 10 Pro x64-bit upgrade to version 1511 build 10586 from Version 10.0 Build 10240</h2>
                    I have tried to upgrade my PC twice. The first time was through "MS Updates"; and with my attempt today I used the&nbsp;"media creation tool" from the MS site. The download and all activities seemed to go well, but when the system re-booted following a search
 for updates it had not reinstalled any of my files, folders, settings, etc. (even though it said it had completed all these functions).&nbsp; I reverted to previous 10.0 version 10240, so I am back where I started in mid-November. Frustrating to say the least.
 Any solutions to my dilemma?

            <p>Thank you for your reply. That is what is so strange about what happened. Nothing outward appeared to go wrong with the download or installation other that it took about an hour and a half to complete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When re-booting MS even said all your files and settings are where you left them. Problem is that was not true.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a silly question, but I am at a total loss here.&nbsp; I use this computer as home for my private network (have two other computers connected wireless). Could network settings be causing a "read" problem for the MCT? I ask because when I allowed two cumulative
 upgrades to install last week the same thing happened. No folders/files were available under "This PC", but I could see them under "Homegroup". I uninstalled the upgrades and my PC reverted back to the previous save point. I know I am grasping at straws, but
 I do not see other warning signs.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Update Windows - Insider Preview 10.0.18362.1 &#40;19H1_RELEASE&#41; amd64 2019-03</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently checked for Windows Updates and the most recent one is the captioned. Sad to say, I have taken over a thousand attempts to run this update, but in vain. Please see below for the error shown while updating Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e208a00-136a-438b-9977-b65dc7ad2cd0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e208a00-136a-438b-9977-b65dc7ad2cd0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to know if anyone encountered the above issue too. I also would like to know what kinds of action I can take to get the above issue fixed. This is because I cannot proceed with other upcoming updates without getting this one done. I wholeheartedly
 hope that you all will offer genuine and kind help. Many thanks&nbsp;in advance.</p>

<br />Via Windows:registered: 10 October 2018 Update update may be blocked due to issues seen with Intel:registered: Display Audio Driver versions 10.25.0.3 through 10.25.0.8. This may result in excessive processor demand and reduced battery life. A fix for these issues is already included in Intel:registered: Display Audio Driver version 10.25.0.10, which is bundled with Intel:registered: Graphics Driver version 24.20.100.6286 and newer. Intel strongly recommends that all users with 6th Generation (codenamed Skylake) or newer processors confirm that Intel:registered: Graphics Driver version 24.20.100.6286 or newer is installed on their computers before attempting to update to Windows:registered: 10 October 2018 Update.

            Hi Eddie,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />I believe you would have to start over by reinstalling 1809 first and then upgrade. I do not recommend updating as without display driver many functions would be disabled in Windows.
<br />
<br />Also log a feedback item in feedback hub and share the feedback link with me so that I can escalate:

<h2>            Wakes up from hibernate automatically</h2>
                    About the only time my PC is down is when I'm asleep, and at that time i like to have it hibernate.<br />
<br />
However I have found that Windows 8 likes to Wake Up on it's own. I don't know if it's at the same time this happens, given that i find the system awake whether i wake with my alarm, or earlier.<br />
<br />
This annoyance doesn't happen every day, though it has happened several days in a row.<br />

            Okay... I FOUND IT... well, my room mate found the solution, and i did the leg work to figure it out.<br />
<br />
You can find the configuration setting for tasks in the "task scheduler." some of the preloaded windows instances have the ability to wake up the system. it's just a matter of disabling them.<br />
<br />
(for future reference)<br />
<br />
From the Start menu type "Task" from the available applications choose "Task Scheduler"<br />
<br />
At the middle bottom is a list of tasks that have already been designed<br />
<br />
the best way i can think of is to just look for the ones scheduled to be activated in the AM hours, If your not comfortable with removing a task, (which is not always for the best) then you can reschedule it, or simply disable it's ability to wake up your system.<br />
<br />
WOOT!!!<br />

<h2>            Hyper-V causing boot loop in Windows 10 Pro x64</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>After upgrading to Windows 10 x64 Pro from Windows 10 Home to x64 Professional and activating Hyper-V in Windows 10 x64 Pro my computer reboots.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple of tries it goes in automatic repair and attempts to repair
 the startup.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cycle just repeats itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried many combinations of things in the bios, shutting down,&nbsp; nothing has worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I found to bring out of the loop is re-install windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I re installed&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro and activated Hyper-V and same reboot loop occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So re-installed a second time then I found the cure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cure is to enable Hyper V from Power Shell , once I did this the pc restarted a couple of times, and everything back to normal hyper v working .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>CLI command to enable</p>
<pre>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V –All</pre>
&nbsp;CLI command to disable</div>

    <title>Programs often load their frame beneath all other open frames. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryoga303  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs often load their frame beneath all other open frames.</h2>
                    
<p>So that I ensure we are communicating with the same understanding, I will define some terms before I pose my question:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame</strong>:&nbsp; The bounded window within which a program displays its interactive user interface.&nbsp; For example, when you run Windows Explorer, it opens a new frame onto your desktop which constitutes the user interface via which users interact
 with the Windows Explorer session. </li><li><strong>Program Session</strong>:&nbsp; A running instance of a program.&nbsp; Some programs permit multiple sessions to run simultaneously (like Windows Explorer) while other programs do not under normal circumstances (like Windows Media Center).</li><li><strong>Z-Order</strong>:&nbsp; The visible stacking order of frames on the Windows desktop.&nbsp; The stacking of frames can be altered by interactively selecting them (like clicking into some visible portion of the frame, selecting a frame from the Windows Task
 Bar, or using Alt+Tab to select a frame). </li><li><strong>Background Frame</strong>:&nbsp; Any frame which is either wholly or partially obscured by other frames that are above it in the z-order.</li><li><strong>Foreground Frame</strong>:&nbsp; Any frame which is not obscured by any other frames (except top-most frames).</li><li><strong>Top-Most Frame</strong>:&nbsp; Any frame for which its placement on the z-order is enforced, ensuring that the frame can never be obscured by any other frames that are not also top-most frames.</li></ul>
<p>Now that we can communicate clearly, here is some background to expalin my scenario:</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on a brand new Alienware Aurora R2&nbsp;desktop PC with dual monitors.&nbsp; Every time I launch a new program session (for example, by double-clicking an icon on the Windows Desktop),&nbsp;I reasonably expect the new program session's
 frame to appear immediately in the foreground (not to be confused with top-most frames, which I am not seeking) and be ready to receive user input.&nbsp; However, this is not presently the case.&nbsp; In fact, certain programs that I launch&nbsp;initially draw their frames
 in the background -- beneath all other frames, sometimes even beneath Desktop Gadget frames.&nbsp; The very worst offending programs are Windows Explorer and Windows Photo Viewer which seem to nearly always open beneath all other open frames.&nbsp; I am constantly required
 to select the desired program session using the Windows Task Bar in order to bring the desired frame to the foreground so that I can work with the desired program.&nbsp; This is beyond irritating.</p>
<p>And here is my question:</p>
<p>How do we configure Windows 7 Professional such that all newly launched&nbsp;program session frames appear in the foreground and are immediately ready for user input?</p>
<p>I am happy to provide any additional information you may need to troubleshoot this odd behavior.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p><br />
By default most of the programs open on foreground. I would suggest you to try the below steps to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Check if the issue persists in clean boot state.<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>Try the steps provided under <strong>Step 1</strong> in the below article to put your computer in clean boot mode.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This might be because of corrupt user profile also. So let’s try creating a new user account and check if the issue persists there.</p>

<p>If it works in a new user account then you need to fix the corrupt user profile. You may visit this link for the steps:<br />

As I stated in my original post when I first reported this issue, the desktop PC was new to me.&nbsp; So, I have been "facing this issue" as long as I have owned this PC.</p>
<p>I started by destroying my user account on the PC and recreating it.&nbsp; This did not resolve the issue (though it did create several other very severe issues that I had to work through before I was able to use my account again --&nbsp;which is a conversation for
 a different topic).&nbsp; Suffice it to say that I was able to successfully return Windows to a fully usable state.</p>
<p>I then very closely followed the "clean boot state" instructions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSConfig set to "Selective Startup", disabling "Load startup items" </li><li>Used MSConfig to disabled ALL Services except (because my PC is on a domain):<br />
DHCP Client<br />
DNS Client<br />
Group Policy Client<br />
Netlogon<br />
Network Store Interface Service<br />
Remote Access Auto Connection Manager<br />
Remote Access Connection Manager<br />
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator<br />
RPC Endpoint Mapper<br />
Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service<br />
Security Accounts Manager<br />
Server<br />
Task Scheduler<br />
TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper<br />
Telephony<br />
Workstation </li></ul>
<p>The issue is still present even in this severely diminished state.&nbsp; I will report next after I attempt to create a strictly local (bypassing the domain controller), non-privileged&nbsp;(a non-Administrator) user account (which won't occur until after I've had
 some sleep and spent some time with my family -- I'm exhausted and it's Christmas Day).</p>

<p>Hi Suegitt,</p>
<p>Try performing clean boot if you have not tried. This might be because of third party conflicts.<br />
Refer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To return your computer to a Normal startup mode, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. Click Start in the Start Search box. <br />
b. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>c. On the General tab, click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
d. When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>

    <title>win 10 to Xp upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicbiswell  say:</h3>
<h2>            win 10 to Xp upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    recently have had to resort to using a windows 10 laptop as old faithful xp version finally had hardware failure, I bought this Win10 laptop 107 weeks ago, took the time to learn how to get around 10, I didn't appreciate the huge 'backward step' and went
 back to the user friendly XP, now I've revisited Win10, turned off all that new wifi stuff so as to have a decent pc speed (I'm not into touchscreens, I have finger nails), now I'm still disgusted as to the huge backward step this Win10 is from XP, just trying
 to view my own pictures is 3 times the effort, how do I upgrade win10 to work like XP?

<p>Well, in XP once you'd selected a folder and viewed a photo, by positioning your pointer on the "+", you could zoom in, then simply press an arrow key to move to the next photo, zoom in and move on etc, in !0 to move to the next photo, you must first move
 the pointer to the '-' and zoom out, however many times is needed to get back to original size before you are able to use an arrow key, you simply cannot move to the next picture whilst zoomed in, thus it takes so much more time . .</p>
<p>To 'pin' something to the 'start' is different to XP, now it takes way more than 3 keystrokes to access something you've placed there, XP was brilliant to use, press start, press/hold 'up' arrow then press enter, nice and simple.</p>
<p>With Win10&nbsp; also you need a mouse, rather than the touchpad, I've yet to use anyone's laptop where the touchpad is a 'friendly' device to use, because of the inability to adjust the settings so as to stop the unwanted actions of things opening or closing
 that you did NOT intend to occur, this is so much a time waster it's ridiculous. Not everyone is injury free and mice are not wrist friendly, touchpads are better ergonomically but are now frustrating to use thanks to Win10.</p>
<p>The fact is that the keypad was the most efficient way to navigate a computer, I've personally proven that a number of times, but evidently&nbsp; Microsoft have determined a need to reduce one's productivity . .</p>
<p>Win10 also keeps trying to download additional language files, that I neither want nor need, yet there are NO options to stop or prevent this from occurring, it's stupid.</p>
<p>There are other issues as well, but I'm sick of typing with these touchpad issues making it a longer process, if you add a word to the dictionary, it does not even correct the other words that are the same as what you've just added.</p>

    <title>AMD&#58;CCC AEM CAPTURING background program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bo1976  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD&#58;CCC AEM CAPTURING background program</h2>
                    Recently my new gateway with windows 7 has started acting sluggish. The cpu usage is staying between 50-100%, and is using the majority of ram with no applications running. I am running virus, malware, and spyware protection and they all come up clean.
 When trying to shut down, a background program appears to be running ( AMD:CCC AEM capturing program ) and is waiting to close. The only thing I can come up with is that something was not compatible with Windows Media Center Extender I setup to stream media
 to my entertainment center from my network through my XBOX 360. I went back and unistalled everything and eventually did a restore but problem still exists. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

            Restore the machine to factory condition. If this fails to resolve the problem, have the machine fixed under warranty. Note also that it is better for you to create your own post instead of attaching your question to a thread that is five months old and
 quite unrelated to your problem.

    <title>After-sale Complaint to Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 姚懿陶  say:</h3>
<h2>            After-sale Complaint to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I love my surface laptop but what happened to me today makes me really disappointed at Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidently spilt some milk on the keyboard, and I cleaned it right away and everything is working just fine. However, I want it to get assessed to make sure no residual underneath.&nbsp; One of the technician I chatted with online suggested me to go to store
 where I got this laptop to check its motherboard. Staff there suggested me to contact Microsoft directly for this issue because they will charge me for the assessment and they cannot make any guarantee. So I called Microsoft about this issue. After a few calls
 and waiting, I finally reached one of supervisor in hardware department but he told me since it is physical damage it is not cover in warranty (the laptop was bought in January 2018 and it is definitely under warranty). I understand and respect that then asking
 for a repair to check everything, although Apple and Alienware do cover such issue. The supervisor said we
<strong>don't do repair</strong> we only do replacement and your situation is not covered. And then I asked him what do I should do with this now because I don't see a way out. He suggested to go for a third party for repair (I will lose my warranty if I do
 this) or buy a new one myself. What kind of response was that? I bought it for 1600 dollars with full warranty only three months ago and now I can't do anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What makes me more unhappy is I <strong>can't get a replacement/repair</strong> for anything issues happened after this because they will think it is caused by this liquid spill. It is just so wrong, unfair. Very disappointed. I got a friend with similar
 issue and Apple took care of it right away without any payment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does Microsoft even care about what happened to your customer after you made the sale? No repair service? Unacceptable.
</strong>I wasn't aware of that Microsoft don't provide repair service before this because a reasonable person would expect a big global technic company like Microsoft will do that.</p>

            You spillied liquid on expensive piece of hardware. And it is not covered by warranty (of course??). Unless you have insurance then there´s not much you can do, and blaming Microsoft is pretty ridiculous since YOU spilled water which definately is not
 covered by warranty (Warranty covers hardware defects from manufacturing etc and how does slipped liquid fit in here?)

<p>Have you read my post carefully? I said I understand and respect that it is not covered because it was physical damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Microsoft don’t provide repair service. Have you heard any other computer brand don’t repair?
</p>
<p>I lose my warranty if I get it repaired somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also refuse to make any replacement if anything happened after this, within my warranty period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have read through it. What I complaint about is that Microsoft don’t do repair service (I am not asking for a free service) , which is unreasonable and I was not notified with that when I purchased it. Also, I have been told I could not get any Microsoft
 replacement consider this issue after this, in other words, I have lost my warranty competely.</p>

            Faced the problem too with my debit card in the past, and to this day I still can't use it, so I created a Paypal account and linked it to the card. I asked my bank about that and they say they didn't support payments in the Microsoft Store so I wouldn't
 be able, so I can actually use it in some websites, not all of them. It was a Visa card. I would recommend to link an Paypal account to your payment methods on Xbox.

            <p>contact manufacturer and ask for updated driver. that's the easiest way to determine what type of driver family you need to install since manufacturer can check it using your service tag.</p>

<h2>            olympus digital voice recorder vn-960pc</h2>
                    <p>I have the device shown above, and cannot get it to download files to my computer. I am currently running Windows 7 pro, 32 bit system (recently upgraded from Windows XP pro). The recorder worked very well with XP. I have been to the Olympus website and
 done their downloads to upgrade the software to their 2.1.4 level, and it did not work for me. Their customer support did not respond to two of my emails regarding the problem (obviously AWOL). I updated the drivers I found through the internet - still 'No
 go.'</p>
<p>At this point I am at a loss. Are there any ideas out there?</p>
<p>I am a first time user of this, so am uncertain where to find responses, if any.</p>

<h3> timothy blake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype message history</h2>
                    I use Skype for a Mac.&nbsp; I mostly use it for text messages.&nbsp; The history is set for unlimited and that's what happens most of the time.&nbsp; But a handful of contacts don't keep the full history - just a few pages.&nbsp; If I want to check back on what we talked
 about last time, for example, I can't.&nbsp; This can be a major pain, and it's all the more aggravating because most of my contacts retain the full history so I don't think it can be my settings.&nbsp; What can I do about this?&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thanks for your reply but I'm afraid I only ever use my Mac computer for Skype, so the conversations can't be stored elsewhere.&nbsp; How can I access the cloud record?&nbsp; Sometimes the missing conversation is fairly recent so I suppose should be available in the
 cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp; </blockquote>
<p>Oops! The cloud record is stored in the Microsoft servers and <em>can't be accessed&nbsp;</em>but you can retrieve its information with your Mac. Maybe logging off and on again will send a nudge to the servers? Are you on a stable connection? Please try a wired
 connection if possible :-)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried the following which I found in another thread started by someone else in the Community, and it seemed to work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press the windows key and "x" simultaneously. This should bring up a window with a list of options.</p>
<p>2. Scroll down to Command Prompt (Admin) and click. This should bring up the Administrator Command Prompt Window</p>
<p>3. Type sfc /Scannow (note there is a space between the "c" and "/") than hit "Enter" on your PC</p>
<p>4. Your PC will check the system files on your PC and try to fix any errors. This may take some time.</p>
<p>5. You may need to reboot your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above doesn't work, you might want to try it a second time. After that, I am not sure I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p><span>Hi Debbie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the below mentioned steps and check if that helps you to accomplish what you want.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Start Windows Live Mail. A wizard may run the first time it's opened. If the wizard doesn't run when you first open the program, do the following:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Accounts</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Accounts</strong> page, click <strong>Add</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Add an account</strong> page, click <strong>E-mail Account</strong>, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Add an E-mail Account</strong> page, do the following:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>E-mail address</strong> box, enter your e-mail address.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Password</strong> box, enter your password. If you want Windows Mail to remember your password, select the check box next to
<strong>Remember password</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Display Name</strong> box, enter your full name.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select
<strong>Manually configure server settings for e-mail account</strong>, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the next page of the wizard, under
<strong>Incoming Server Information</strong>, do the following:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the drop-down menu under
<strong>Incoming mail server is a &lt;type&gt; server</strong>, select <strong>IMAP</strong> or
<strong>POP3</strong>. You might want to use IMAP because it supports more features.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under
<strong>Incoming server</strong>, enter the POP3 or IMAP4 server name. If you access your e-mail account online using the outlook.com Web site, enter
<strong>outlook.com</strong> for the POP or IMAP server name.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select
<strong>This server requires a secure connection (SSL)</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under
<strong>Log on using</strong>, make sure that <strong>Clear text authentication is selected</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under
<strong>Login ID (if different from e-mail address)</strong>, type your full e-mail address.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under
<strong><span>Outgoing Server Information</span></strong>, do the following:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under
<strong><span>Outgoing server</span></strong>, enter the SMTP server name. If you access your e-mail account online using the outlook.com Web site, you can find the SMTP server name by signing in to your e-mail account
 at the following address: </span><a href="http://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://outlook.com</span></a><span>. After you sign in successfully, click the drop-down arrow next to the Help question mark, and

    <title>Good ways to make MUT coins&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pinkpainter2368  say:</h3>
<h2>            Good ways to make MUT coins&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an 87 OVR, was 82 OVR and then I completed the NFL Playoffs objectives. I really want a couple beast DT's and that 91 OVR Warren Moon, but those put together will be about 130k. MUT seasons won't work because everyone's team is so much better than mine, I can put up a fight but they always win in the end. MUT champions yeah, but I don't really understand it, like it shows that it's locked but I can still play, and I need 3 wins to qualify for something, etc. I can't find any solo challenges to do that give me more than 500 coins, because I already did MUT Heroes for the Offensive side. I'm not sure what to do.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I see that you are trying to block Minecraft without affecting Java. Java is an in-built feature and is integral to the intranet applications and other e-business solutions that are the foundation of corporate computing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minecraft requires Java to function. You cannot block Minecraft, but you can delete it from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to delete Minecraft without affecting Java, then follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press "Win-R" to open the “Run” application. Type “%<strong>appdata</strong>%” into the text box, and then click “OK.”</li><li>Right-click the “.<strong>minecraft</strong>” folder, and select “Delete” from the list of options.</li><li>Press “OK” in the dialog box to confirm your decision to delete the folder.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For additional information on Java, please refer the link <a href="http://java.com/en/download/faq/minecraft.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Please do reply to the post for any further queries and we will be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>My specialty my Friend, hehehe... FOLLOW CAREFULLY</p>
<p>From your guest account&gt;Start&gt;Run Type in "cmd"</p>
<p>Once Command prompt opens up type in</p>
<p>net user guest /add administrator</p>
<p>Hit enter</p>
<p>This works on just about any and all computers I have tried it on, it elevates the guest account to administrator status, where you are free to edit and change things you need to change.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>From your guest account&gt;Start&gt;Run Type in "cmd"</p>
<p>Once Command prompt opens up type in</p>
<p>Net user administrator(Or the name of your administrator account)&nbsp;*</p>
<p>Hit enter</p>
<p>You'll now be able to enter a password for that account. Confirm the password and Voila! You should now be able to log onto your administrator account with the new password that you set.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Start system and when you see Windows Welcome screen, press ctrl+alt+del keys twice and it'll show a&nbsp;Login box. Now type Administrator in Username and leave Pword blank. Now press Enter and you should be able to logon.</p>
<p>Now you can reset your account password from the Control Panel&nbsp;and User Accounts.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Enter safe mode by restarting the computer and pressing f8 repeatedly until a screen somes up that gives you some options, use your arrow keys to highligh "Boot windows in safe mode" When you boot windows in safe mode you will see a new account on the login
 screen and that is titled Administrator, click it, there is no password (Unless you changed it.)</p>

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).<br />
