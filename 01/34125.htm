    <title>Intermitten blank screen in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kywildcat4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermitten blank screen in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba L355D-S7815 laptop that is randomly showing a blank screen. No pattern, just goes blank after about 15 to 20 minutes of operation. Fan seems to be working fine, so pretty much eliminated overheating. Sometimes it happens when a key is
 depressed, or going from one application to another. Running Windows 7 Ultimate 32. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance. &nbsp;P.S. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried disc check and system repair but shows no problems.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>2. Does the black screen occurs when you run your laptop in battery mode?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There could be various causes resulting in black screen on running Windows 7 systems. Prominent reasons could be an issue with the video driver, issues with the Desktop Window Manager or may be some registry issues. So, I would suggest you the following
 methods to diagnose the issue and help you get started in the correct direction:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><u>Steps 1</u>: Try booting your computer in the safe mode and check if the issue persists:</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Step 2</u>: If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</div>
<div><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>Refer "<em>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</em>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>If your screen gets black a couple of minutes after you unlock the system, you may refer to the following link:</div>
<div><strong>Windows Vista and Windows 7 Black Screen on Computer Unlock</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2431700/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2431700/en-us</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>If the above methods do not help, please refer to the steps in the following link:</div>
<div><strong>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Registry disclaimer</strong><br />
<u>Important</u>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,

            I may have misspoke on the screen it is actually &nbsp;more of a blue tinted screen. Computer starts up normally, but after about 15-20 minutes the screen goes blank and I have to restart. It restarts with the options for restart on the screen. Everything seems
 to be working fine but the system always shuts down before I can load anti-virus or install needed updates like SP1. Any thoughts? Thanks.

    <title>Windows 10 download progress - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 download progress</h2>
                    Windows 10 download on my computer is at 62% from almost 2 hours of downloading. It's almost night time here and I can't keep the computer running overnight, I need to shut it down. Will my windows 10 download resume when i restart again my computer the
 next day? I know you can't pause Windows Updates, let's say I will forcefully shut it down, will Windows recognize it's a shut down problem and continue the download next time? I don't want to wait for 2 hours again, that would take a lot of time!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows 10 download seems sluggish, try disconnecting any USB devices and extended display cables that may be connected to speed up the download!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some PCs may need up to 24 hours to download Windows 10, depending on the quality of the internet connection.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do not shut down, as this might hamper the download.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Although Windows 10 is downloaded in the background using Windows Update automatically, so even if your Internet connection is not reliable or you are intermittently disconnected at times, it will automatically resume once an active Internet connection
 is available&nbsp;and picks up from where it left off but do not shut down.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

 sure my password is correct but have no idea abou my email! Help!!

<p>Hey there UrticateAutumn5!</p>
<p>You didn't specify whether the account you are currently on is the one you are trying to get into, so I'm going to presume that UrticateAutumn5 is the account you've forgotten the email address of.</p>
<p>In this case, take these steps :</p>
<p>- Click on "<strong>My Account</strong>" at the top of the screen under your name (<strong>UrticateAutumn5</strong>)</p>
<p>- Click on "<strong>Contact Preferences</strong>" under the sub-title "<strong>Settings and Preferences</strong>"</p>
<p>- Your email address should be listed under "<strong>Email Address</strong>".</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
If you don't know the e-mail address that you used to setup your profile then you'd need to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Chat Support</a>&nbsp;</strong>(Click Billing &amp; Memberships &gt; Under Microsoft Account,
 click&nbsp;<span>Forgot</span>&nbsp;Microsoft Account Username then finally click Chat with Microsoft Support).<br />
<br />
As long as you have the gamertag&nbsp;and the information that's associated with the gamertag (name, address, phone number, card number etc.) they should be able to assist you with giving you the e-mail associated with that account.<br />
<br />
Once you have that e-mail you can&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">visit this page here</a></strong>&nbsp;to reset the password.</p>

I just bought my PC and they said it came with one, how can I make sure I have one?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I have one because when I go to Hardware settings it shows I have an "Intel(R) Wireless-AC 9560"

            An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. If you recently upgraded to Windows 10, it's possible that the current driver was designed for a previous version of Windows. It can also happen if you recently updated Windows 10. In either case, check to see if an updated driver is available.
<br />
<br />In the search box on the taskbar, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the list of results.
<br />In Device Manager, select Network adapters &gt; the network adapter name.
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) the network adapter, and then select Update driver &gt; Search automatically for updated driver software. Follow the steps, then select Close.
<br />After installing the updated driver, select the Start  button &gt; Power  &gt; Restart if you're asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.
<br />If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save it to a USB flash drive, so you can manually install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.
<br />
<br />To manually install the network adapter driver
<br />Do one of the following, depending on what kind of file you downloaded from the PC manufacturer’s website:
<br />
<br />If you downloaded an executable (.exe) file, just double-click the file to run it and install the drivers. That should be all you need to do.
<br />If you downloaded individual files, and at least one file has an .inf file name extension and another has a .sys extension, do the following:
<br /> 
<br />In the search box on the taskbar, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the list of results.
<br />In Device Manager, select Network adapters &gt; the network adapter name. (If it’s not listed there, check in Other devices.)
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) the network adapter, and then select Update driver &gt; Browse my computer for driver software.
<br />Select Browse &gt; select the location where the driver files are stored &gt; OK.
<br />Select Next &gt; follow the steps to install the driver &gt; Close.
<br />After you've updated the driver, select the Start  button &gt; Power  &gt; Restart if you're asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.

<p>Well, my PC was not built already, we picked the parts and someone built it. I tried the Update Driver but it says I have the newest. However, I don't know which manufacturer it's from..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try and see if the Wifi Adapter is on, where is it? I don't know where it is, but I know what it looks like.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you encounter issues signing in to the Xbox app on Windows 10, it may be due to an authentication failure with your Xbox login credentials. To determine if there's an issue with your Xbox account, kindly sign in to Xbox.com. If you can sign in, that means
 your profile is all good. Otherwise, follow the on-screen instructions to update your security details.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are additional troubleshooting solutions that you may perform:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Run the Windows apps troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>This can help resolve issues with built-in Windows 10 apps. Click this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Check for updates </strong></p>
<p>Refer to the following links for the steps on how to check if there are updates available for the app and the Windows 10 PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026259/store-check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check for updates for apps and games from Windows Store</a></li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/system-requirements/latest-driver-software-updates-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to get software and driver updates for Windows 10</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Reset the app from the Settings menu</strong></p>
<p>This can help resolve corrupted app data. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, then <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Choose <strong>Apps &amp; features.</strong></li><li>Find the app, then click <strong>Advanced options.</strong> </li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Reset </strong>again to confirm. </li><li>Restart your device so that the changes will take effect. Sign in to the app and check if the same issue occurs.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>olution 4: Make sure that the Xbox app is connected to the Internet</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On your PC, launch the Xbox app. </li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Network status</strong>, make sure <strong>Internet connection</strong> says
<strong>Connected</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message when you try to play the video files?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does this issue occur when you play a particular format of the video files or happens with all the video files you play?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 the MSN Game&nbsp; Manager.&nbsp; I can get to the point where the download asks me if I want to install any updates.&nbsp; When stating Yes, I get a Kaspersky error message "UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generec".&nbsp; Kaspersky the asks me to disinfect and restart.&nbsp; What is going

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

</span>equalizer for windows 7? <br />
<br />
Yes I understand that you can change the settings in media player to change the equalizer, but this is useless for example when listening to online material, this is a step backwards !. I cannot find any compatible programmes that can allow me this, which has
 always been available on previous windows.

<p>So? That means nothing. All other versions prior to now had to deal with less diversity, less advanced features and less bundled drivers to start working just after installation. How many cd's of drivers did you had to install in XP for everything just working?
 One for the sound card, another for the graphic card, another for the motherboard, for the bluetooth dongle, for the printer... and so on, and of course, a lot of restarting after each hw install. In W7 you just had to install the OS and everything was already
 working, but sure, if you're looking for some fancy stuff you should then install the drivers from the hw manufacturer, and if they don't have then complain to them, who are the responsible for that, not MS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And btw, I'm not related to MS in any way, just in case, I just wanted to point out that you're complaining to the wrong guys.</p>

<p>What kind of audio chip do you have? <br />
The AC97 (most common) comes with a nice utility to do all this. It's only 10-band but hey ...<br />
The utility (called Sound Effect Manager)&nbsp;is installed into the control panel by default.<br />
<br />
Failing that, try&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel&gt;Sound </strong>then select your speakers and click<strong> Properties&gt;Enhancements<br />
</strong>One of those options is an EQ of sorts with some presets down below.</p>

    <title>&#34;Import pictures and videos using Windows&#34; option has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruce holden  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Import pictures and videos using Windows&#34; option has disappeared from Win 7 Autoplay dialog</h2>
                    
<p>When I plug my Olympus C-5060 camera into my Win 7 Pro 64-bit computer via USB to transfer pictures, I no longer get the "Import pictures and videos using Windows" option in the Autoplay dialog box that pops up.</p>
<p>It had worked just fine when my Win 7 installation was still new, but a couple of months ago I added a Lexmark 4900 series printer in the Devices and Printers control panel which installed Lexmark Productivity Studio software as well as other Lexmark printer
 utilities.&nbsp; After that, the only Autoplay options that came up when I plugged in my camera was "Transfer photos to your computer using Productivity Studio" as well as "Open folder to view files" and "Use this drive for backup".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Productivity Studio didn't allow me to easily specify a base file name for the picture files like the default Windows transfer utility did, so I wanted to go back to the default Autoplay options for importing pictures but was unable to find
 a way to do that.&nbsp; So I proceeded to uninstall the Lexmark printer and utilities.&nbsp; Now, however, when I plug in my camera I only get the Autoplay options "Open folder to view files" and "Use this drive for backup".</p>
<p>How do I restore the "Import pictures and videos using Windows" option in the Autoplay dialog for picture file transfers?</p>

<p>FYI, I did try selecting the "Reset all defaults" button in the AutoPlay control panel, but all that did was to change all of the selections to "Choose a default".&nbsp; It did not change any of the AutoPlay options that were able to be selected in the first
 place.&nbsp; So, not what I was looking for, but thanks much for the suggestion.</p>

<p>Hmmm.&nbsp; I was pretty sure I'd tried that already, but I went ahead and did it again just now.&nbsp; I selected "Ask me every time" for the action under Pictures in the AutoPlay control panel and then plugged my camera into a USB port.&nbsp; I still do
<em>not</em> get an "Import pictures and videos using Windows" option in the resulting AutoPlay dialog box that pops up.&nbsp; The only options that show up (under General options) are "Open folder to view files" and " Use this drive for backup".&nbsp; Thanks for the
 additional suggestion, though.</p>

<p>Amrita M -</p>
<p>I appreciate the suggestions, but neither one turns out to be the issue in my case.&nbsp; The first article just tells you how to change the settings of the "Import pictures and videos using Windows" dialog, but my problem is that the "Import pictures and videos
 using Windows" option never even comes up in the AutoPlay dialog box that pops up when I plug my camera into a USB port.&nbsp; And the second article (Ana Otero's) tells you how to add Windows Live Photo Gallery as an import option, not the basic "Import pictures
 and videos using Windows" option that I'm looking for.</p>
<p>I did go ahead and import the registry keys for WLPG that were given in Ana Otero's article, but that had no effect on the options that are present in the AutoPlay dialog box when I plug in my camera.&nbsp; As I told Dissed, the only options that show up (under
 General options) are "Open folder to view files" and "Use this drive for backup".</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, though.&nbsp; Do you have any other suggestions to offer that might get the "Import pictures and videos using Windows" selection to show up in the pictures AutoPlay dialog box in my Win 7 Pro installation?</p>

<p>The pictures will load on your screen, if your change the view of the page, by clicking the down arrow next to the question mark at the top right to medium or large icons the photos will start to be visible,</p>
<p>If you make a folder, slide the wall of the screen over so you can see your desktop, and drag and drop that new folder to your desktop,</p>
<p>You can select all of those photos by using ctrl+A key and drag and drop all of those photos into the new folder on your desktop,</p>
<p>A notice will show copy to folder you named and show the amount of photos in that drag,</p>
<p>Then just select close session, wait for the card to be closed&nbsp;so another computer can read it later and select eject,</p>
<p>Or if you want the photo erased from the card, right click the drive it's in and select format,</p>
<p>Drag the new folder back&nbsp;to your my pictures folders location, listed on the file folders list, done.</p>

            I am having the same problem, I installed some printer software for lexmark and it wiped out all my import option, so I uninstalled the software and I only have the explore folder option. &nbsp;This is so frustrating&nbsp;because&nbsp;lexmark couldn't fix it either.
 &nbsp;I attempted a system restore but it took several hours and did not work. &nbsp;I also tried a back up registry I had from a couple of weeks ago and it didn't work
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Please help, are there any more suggestions to get my old import options back?&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            &#34;Windows Explorer has stopped working&#34; message after opening &#34;Pictures&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.<br />
I have Windows Vista 32-bit home basic Operation System with SP2.<br />
When I open "Pictures", I am getting a message that says "Windows Explorer has stopped working" with an option to restart the program, which just closes it. The details of the message are:</p>
<p>Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;InPageError<br />
&nbsp; Error Status Code:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;c0000185<br />
&nbsp; Faulting Media Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;00000003<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.0.6002.2.2.0.768.3<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1033<br />
&nbsp; Additional Information 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;40d4<br />
&nbsp; Additional Information 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4062ad41ec8067256aa4c5e2b56d3c79<br />
&nbsp; Additional Information 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;40d4<br />
&nbsp; Additional Information 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4062ad41ec8067256aa4c5e2b56d3c7</p>
<p>This error message just came out of nowhere. I did not install anything or do any updates when this issue came up. I have tried restarting the computer, but it did not help.</p>
<p>I checked for viruses, but none came up.</p>
<p>Then, I tried to do System Restore, but it could not fix the problem.</p>
<p>Further, I used the Command Prompt to find the problem, and it found some corrupt files, but was unable to fix them.</p>
<p>The SFC details are:</p>
<p>"2010-11-17 11:38:44, Info CSI 00000160 [SR] Cannot Repair member file [1:24{12}] "settings.ini" of Microsoft Windows Sidebar, Version 6.0.6002.18005, pA = Process_Architecture_Intel &lt;0&gt;..."<br />
and there are more like this, but I don't know how to copy and paste these messages.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do from here.</p>
<p>I don't want to re-install all of Vista. Plus, Vista is PRE-INSTALLED on my computer.</p>
<p>Oh, and I am not an expert at using command prompt - I found how to do this in other forums.</p>
<p>Please help on how to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
See the next message for methods to clear the Sidebar.ini files however that has nothing to do with<br />
the issue you are having.<br />
<br />
This is a fairly complete troubleshooter however start with the last link and then come back and work<br />
done.<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong><br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Refer to these threads for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Norton does check for spyware however your issue could be caused by or at least aggravated<br />
by Norton. <br />
</p>
<p>Norton/Symantec is known for causing strange issues and aggravating others. Best to uninstall it<br />
to test as merely disabling it will still&nbsp;allow pieces of it to install. Uninstall it and run the Norton<br />
Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants from being left behind. Below are recommendations<br />
to use while testing, even better permanently.<br />

<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Continuous mouse clicks or enter key presses after unlock - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Continuous mouse clicks or enter key presses after unlock</h2>
                    Frequently, when I unlock my screen in Windows 10, I end up with a bug that appears to be either a continuous mouse click or enter key press. I have noticed this trying to click the address bar in Chrome (it selects then immediately deselects the address)
 and in Steam (it will continuously launch whatever game I tried to start, even after I close it again and again and again).&nbsp; The only recourse I've found is rebooting from the Windows menu, which is thankfully unaffected.&nbsp; I have a Razer mouse and use the
 software, which appears to be related to other bugs, but I could not find anything like this bug I am experiencing thus far.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What is the make and
 the model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer into BIOS and check if the correct date and time is set, refer
 this link to boot into BIOS:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also check with the computer manual to set date and time in BIOS.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you set the time and date correctly in BIOS boot the computer normally and follow the steps from the
 below link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>Set the clock:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Set-the-clock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Set-the-clock</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Change the display of dates, times, currency, and measurements:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-display-of-dates-times-currency-and-measurements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-display-of-dates-times-currency-and-measurements</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, then try creating an new user account and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you still face the same issue even after creating new user account, then it might be possible that your BIOS battery is dead, so I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer.</span></p>

<div>Please repost in a NEW thread - you should never need to go into the BIOS just to change the Date and Time!</div>
<div>Why does the Date need changing? - does it reset back to something like 2000 every time you switch off? If so, the you need a new battery, and that's best done by a technician.</div>

            <p>This seems to be happening due to the KB3035583 Windows 10 update. Even if you don't have Windows 10 Microsoft has decided to make this update a part of Windows 7 &amp; Windows 8.1 updates. I am an IT tech and have experience several issues with PC's do to this
 update either trying to install and failing or actually installing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My processes for removing the update and making sure this update does not install again.
</p>
<p>-I checked through the history of installed updates searching for KB3035583, &nbsp;I uninstalled KB3035583 update, restarted the PC, reran 'check for Windows updates,' I was able to see the KB3035583 update again in updates to be installed, I had to click on
 the update and hide it so it would not try to install again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping this information will help others. My issues was that this occurred with a Point of Sale Device and that is a big no no in the business.</p>

<p>Did you buy this phone new ???</p>
<p>Was there a software disk in the box with it ???</p>
<p>If there was install the software as the Device Driver would be on it.</p>
<p>Then reconnect your phone to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don`t have a disk try looking up the Model of your Smart Phone from the Manufacturers Site and down load the Device Driver for your Operating System from there.</p>

 to create a system image of my boot drives for both of my PCs, the backup failed and I got the following message: "The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted

 are encrypted, compressed, or sparse, and so there is no reason why a system image should fail. I also know that many other people have faced this issue too, and instead of you guys finding them a solution, or fixing the bug, you continuously respond with
 your textbook, **** answers, and nothing ever gets done about it. This is not too much for me, or anyone else to ask. It is YOUR responsibility&nbsp;to release a logical, functional, and easy to use backup program that EVERYONE can use. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!</span></span></span>

<h2>            Banned after someone messages me insulting me&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have been suspended for 2 weeks after beating someone on for honor and they got angry and sent me a message calling me a noob &nbsp;call. I then replied with calling him a dead f***. Now yes i used a "bad word" but I'm not the one who started the insults!!!! Where I come from an insult is an insult. How is it you can get suspended after an exchange that you didn't even start! What happened to the trash talk?!?! I don't think you should be able to get someone banned once it becomes a back and forth. At that point he knew what he was doing and we agreed to exchange insults. I could understand if I sent him a message 1st insulting him but he messaged me 1st! He then sent a follow up message saying "enjoy the ban" he knew he was baiting me. That's not right AT ALL. And now customer service in the "infinite wisdom" can't help me. Says "submit a ticket" as if that does anything at all. This is crazy what happened to gaming? Trash talk used to be part of the fun! I think it's time to make a

            <p>and now they won't let me edit my post. I think when you message someone there should not be a report button at all. You agreed to talk to them when you sent them a message. If you don't like what they have to say after that.... BLOCK THEM. It's like not liking what is on tv so you call the cable company and tell them to change it. Instead of changing it yourself!</p>

It doesn't matter what you think of the system, you just have to behave within it's constraints. If you can't or won't, there are consequences. </p>
