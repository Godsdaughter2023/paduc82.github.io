                    It is unclear to me that Microsoft, offers a WIN64 version; it appears that only a WIN32 version is available; yes/no.&nbsp; If answer is no,&nbsp;if WIN32 software installed&nbsp;under compatible mode on a Windows 8.1 system, will Age of Empires II Complete Collection
 run or will it be plagued by errors?

<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete &#34;Phantom&#34; iCloud Account From Windows 10 Mail App</h2>
                    When I set up&nbsp;my Windows 10&nbsp;mail app, I added my Road Runner account to it and that's it.&nbsp; However, the app&nbsp;lists
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">two</span> accounts - my Road Runner account and my iCloud account.&nbsp; The iCloud account will not sync, and when I access the Account Settings tab,&nbsp;iCloud&nbsp;is not listed as an account in those settings, so I can't just

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sync my Road Runner account with iCloud in Outlook, but not in the Mail app.&nbsp; The iCloud account in the Mail app won't sync at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Store Apps troubleshooter but it did not identify any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me where I may find the Mail app data file and how to delete and/or modify it to eliminate the ghost iCloud account in the Mail app?</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same issue !</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling the mail app using powershell and then downloading and reinstalling from the store but the iCloud account is still showing.</p>
<p>I even restored back to a previous system image from before I even setup mail but the&nbsp;phantom account just reappeared !</p>
<p>This is extremely annoying.</p>
<p>My fear is that even if I reinstall 10 from scratch the account is still going to reappear.</p>

<h2>            Runtime error with Visual C&#43;&#43;, started when using Quickbooks</h2>
                    I am encountering a runtime error with Visual C++. It started when I tried emailing an invoice from Quickbooks 2010 Pro. the problem also is apparently causing quickbooks now not to open at all. I am on an HP Pavillion computer, running Vista.
<br />
<br />
I have performed the following to no avail: <br />
1) I have run a system scan (sfc scannow) and it found corrupt files that cannot be solved with the scan.
<br />
2) I have already downloaded and installed Msoft SP2.It did not make a difference.<br />
3) I completed the following check that I saw on another post w/ reboot. No change:
<br />
at top of list find COMMAND - RIGHT CLICK on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Type the following commands (or copy and paste one at a time), each followed by pressing enter.<br />
<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
<br />
nbtstat -R<br />
<br />
nbtstat -RR<br />
<br />
netsh int reset all<br />
<br />
netsh int ip reset<br />
<br />
netsh winsock reset<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
That resets your TCP/IP stack<br />

<br />
oh, yes. i should also say i'm browsing in firefox (if that matters) and am running Norton 360. This computer also was purchased less than a year ago.<br />

</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently? The changes I remember making occurred after the problem

 it did any between last week and this. I do believe there was a down load for Firefox in that time, however.
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you receive the runtime error when using any other program? i do not have any problems with any other program (although
 i had thought a couple times that outlook hadnt saved certain contacts, but that could've been user error)</span>

</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>As QuickBooks is a third party software we are unaware of its features and services.</span>
</span></p>
I am aware of this. I will try posting the problem to the quickbooks forums, but i have already spoken to their help desk at length, and they determined it was a vista issue.<br />
<br />
BTW, when i try to open qbooks, the first thing that comes up now (ever since it won't open) is that "qnooks has a problem accessing the registration file. if it is read only, ask the administrator to make the file write accessible."<br />
<br />
Problem is, i <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">am</span> logged on as the administrator, which should mean i have all read and write priviledges.<br />
<br />
If i access it using "run as administrator," and i try to email an invoice, then i get the runtime error.

I will try posting the problem to the quickbooks forums, but i have already spoken to their help desk at length, and they determined it was a vista issue.<br />
<br />
BTW, when i try to open qbooks, the first thing that comes up now (ever since it won't open) is that "qnooks has a problem accessing the registration file. if it is read only, ask the administrator to make the file write accessible."<br />
<br />
Problem is, i <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">am</span> logged on as the administrator, which should mean i have all read and write priviledges.<br />
<br />
If i access it using "run as administrator," and i try to email an invoice, then i get the runtime error.<br />
<br />
oh, yes. i should also say i'm browsing in firefox (if that matters) and am running Norton 360. This computer also was purchased less than a year ago.

<p><span>Hi thevine,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This error message might occur if there are some corrupt system files on the computer. Would suggest that you run a SFC
 scan which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<br />
Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening.
 You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find
 any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information
 from the installation CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></p>

<br />
If the above step does not fix the issue would suggest uninstalling and reinstalling QuickBooks and check if it works.</span></p>

<h3> dadib  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;D&#58;&#92;WindowsApps&#92;Deleted&#34; empty folder and lost apps installed on the D&#58; drive</h2>
                    <p>Expected:</p>
<p>Getting back ms store apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happening:</p>
<p>Under "D:\WindowsApps\" there's an empty "deleted" folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce it:</p>
<p>Have Windows 10 1803</p>
<p>Have in storage settings the "store apps in" set to the D: drive</p>
<p>Have a ms store app installed on the D: drive(In my case Rise Of The Tomb Raider)</p>
<p>Upgrade to Windows 10 1809</p>
<p>It should miss the app in the start menu</p>
<p>In ms store-&gt; download the app</p>
<p>Downloads a few KB and shows the app again in the start menu, and you can use it normally</p>
<p>Refresh windows but without removing personal file(because I had troubles with internet access that I wasn't able to fix)</p>
<p>Wait it to reinstall windows</p>
<p>Look with administrator cmd dir command inside "D:\WindowsApps\" and you should see "appname_xyz" folder with inside all its data.</p>
<p>Change again the storage option to the D: drive (It was resetted by the refresh)</p>
<p>Reinstall the app from ms store to show it in start</p>
<p>You should now see that it will start downloading the app again (33 GB)</p>
<p>Stop the download</p>
<p>Check again with administrator cmd with dir inside "D:\WindowsApps\" and you should see a "deleted" folder of 0 bytes and the "appname_xyz" missing</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>Is there a way to get back the "appname_xyz" folder with its data or it's too late? Also in case I should reinstall the app, which is paid and has a max of 10 pcs to be installed on, does it count as a new pc?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that it’s not possible to get back the deleted folder (appname_xyz), since you have performed the reset operation with “<strong>Keep my files</strong>” option on your device.
 Reset operation will remove apps and also it removes the changes you made to settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to refer the section
<strong>Reset your PC</strong> from the article <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Recovery options in Windows 10</span></a>
</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for more information about the reset operation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the query about the installation, I wish to inform you that installing the app on a same device will not count as a second pc. It will be considered as a first installation.</span></p>

<p>Ok thank you very much. I thought that I could still fix them because I had the "appname_xyz" folder after the refresh in the D: drive.</p>

    <title>Unable to reconnect to all network drives - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to reconnect to all network drives</h2>
                    Dear,<br />
<br />
I've had this problem since I installed windows 8, currently I have a synology ds212j NAS on the network. I mapped a network drive using the default way (map network drive), entered the ip/share and username/password. At this point the drive works perfectly.<br />
<br />
However, when I restart or reboot windows gives me the message, could not reconnect to all network drives and there is a red cross on the icon. Following this, xbmc doesn't find files on the drive. Here's the tricky part though, when I double click on the network
 drive, it gets loaded and afterwards xbmc can also see the files again.<br />
<br />
What I tried doing:<br />
Startup script with the command net use ....<br />
Disable fast boot<br />
<br />
It almost seems like windows 8 boots too quickly, tried adding the network drive before the ehternet adapter is loaded and failes. Strange thing is, I can't fin any problems that suggest this in the eventviewer. Is this a bug?<br />
<br />
P.S.: Also on a semi unrelated note, when I try to enable NFS client support (install nfs client as a windows component) I get constant blue screens when trying to load the network drive.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

            This is definitely a bug, when I use a startup script with a 5 second timeout and set the gpo 'custom user interface' to this script it works like a charm.<br />
<br />
logon.bat<br />
timeout 5<br />
net use Z: \\192.168.2.154\media /user:lan_users xxxxxxx<br />
start "" "explorer.exe"<br />
exit<br />
<br />
This makes me believe that windows tries to map the drive before loading the network driver.<br />

<h2>            Hdmi aspect ratio pioneer pdp4214HD one setting xbox one</h2>
                    Hey there, so I have the aforementioned pioneer 42" plasma and the left and right side of the screen are cut off. This TV was sold at Costco, I think with a direct TV bundle because of the "DTV" buttons on the remote, anyway, it's impossible to change
 the display setting with the xbox one plugged in, any fixes out there for this? Maybe an hdmi based aspect ration converter that I cant find?&nbsp;

<p>Likely a setting on your TV that adjusts screen size is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your TV, bring up the settings menu with the TV remote, and find the setting that adjusts aspect ratio or screen size. You are probably set to “zoom”.</p>

            Also, it is silly, but some tv's prefer you plug your gaming console into a specific HDMI port. Check to see if your tv has a specific input for gaming.

    <title>How do I activate Jump Lists by laptop keyboard without Application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mbgower  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I activate Jump Lists by laptop keyboard without Application Key.</h2>
                    I support users with disabilities who cannot use a mouse. One several laptops, there is no Application key to the right of the spacebar, which is what a user normally uses to launch the Jump List after putting focus onto an item on the Task Bar with Windows
 Key+T. Documentation suggests that SHIFT+F10 is a subsitute for the Application key, but it fails to launch the Jump List. Is there another keyboard option?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that SHIFT+F10 will bring up the jump list.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The taskbar item HAS to be on focus, however.</p>

<h2>            Xbox can detect wireless network but cannot connect.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there. I have a Xbox 360 (250GB S) console and a Belkin 714D router/modem. Yesterday I jumped on MW3 as per usual and noticed my NAT type was strict (it has always been open). I have the ports forwarded so I went ahead and restarted my router in hope
 of sorting it out. Unfortunately&nbsp;when i turned on my console after restarting it could'nt connect at all. I went into Network settings and it can detect my connection (full bars) but when I "Test Xbox LIVE Connection" it fails on the first section (in between
 xbox and local network). Before someone says that my router is broken it's not as all my wired and wireless connections work fine as they always have, it's only the xbox that's a problem. Also when I go onto configure network on my xbox everything is blank
 so that might mean something to someone. I have opened up all the ports that xbox needs to connect to LIVE with so its not that. I have plugged in a wired cable as well but still no luck with that.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated :)</p>

<p>down to system settings press A</p>
<p>then down to network settings press A</p>
<p>select your wireless or wired network press A</p>
<p>configure network press A</p>
<p>go to the right....Additional Settings</p>
<p>down to Restore to Factory Defaults and reset to factory defaults</p>
<p>Try your connection again, you will need the WEP key or whatever security key you use.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one crashing to home screen</h2>
                    Yeah super glad to see I'm not the only person experiencing this problem. Since I've gotten my xbox one(1/5/14) I've had the same problem where I will be playing a game and all of a sudden the xbox kicks me right out into the home screen and any unsaved
 data is lost. Once I started noticing the crashes I have noticed it has happened almost always when I'm playing a multiplayer game in either Madden 25(digital download) or ac4(disc). It has happened way too often on ac4 when I'm having an unusually good game.
 This problem is very annoying considering it's as if I have lost time I'll never get back. Microsoft, you have three pages now of people with the same issue. Don't you think it's time to start working on a patch or at least looking into one of the countless
 problems with your new console?

<p>Same issue here. Only started happening since the Feb Update. </p>
<p>Issues: </p>
<p>1: On pressing (X) Back I occasionally get a Black Screen (still get sounds). Fix = Reboot (but this is dead annoying)</p>
<p>2: Random crashes to home screen, generally from COD Ghosts (which also always boots and loads a campaign level which is equally annoying).
</p>
<p>I am not thinking this is a hardware error, more software and thus wouldn't want to send it back. Hopefully the March update will iron out these issues. If it persists after that, I'll send it back.</p>

 but it doesnt sound like that will work anyway. If anyone has any ideas id love to hear them. If i have to take the unit in, do i lose everything downloaded and saved?</p>

 (Win7 Home).</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

            Yes, this PC is one of two check out registers, so uninstalling that program isn't an option. Do you think that program is the cause, though? Right now we are just trying to figure out if the blame lies within the computer or with this POS software. If
 the latter, then at least I can tell my client its nothing I did and to have the POS tech support figure it out.<br />

    <title>NVIDIA Driver Failed to Install in Windows Update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnptd  say:</h3>
<h2>            NVIDIA Driver Failed to Install in Windows Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Early Monday Morning Windows Update attempted to install a new driver for my NVIDIA Quadro FX 880M on my Lenovo ThinkPad laptop. It failed with the error code 0x800706BE (at least I thought it failed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In the Events tab of the video card's properties, it shows:</p>
<p>&nbsp; (1) Device service added (nvlddmkm)</p>
<p>&nbsp; (2) Device installed (nvltwu.inf)</p>
<p>&nbsp; (3) No errors are shown.</p>
&nbsp; (4) The previous entries in the Events tab were from a week ago when I installed the November Update.
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what this error is telling me. Since the version is different from what was installed over week ago, I assume something was installed, but I don't know why I received the error. When the update ran, all of a sudden the Windows Update window
 became blank. Eventually, a Notification pop-up occurred indicating a should reboot, which I did. Nothing had showed up in the Windows Update window which is where the instruction to reboot normally appears. I attempted to go through the WindowsUpdate.log
 but it is like trying to read War and Peace in Russian. The computer seems to be functioning ok and additional updates (including a driver for the touchpad) were installed shortly thereafter, but I am concerned about this error. What does it mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; JohnD</p>

            <p>You will find your Nvidia update version in your Nvidia Control Panel (which comes with any driver download). &nbsp;Is this version number larger numerically than your previous number? &nbsp; If so, and you are not having any problems with the graphics, I would leave
 it alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it is best to download any driver updates via Nvidia's website. &nbsp; Put in your graphic card details and it will spit out the newest driver available for your card. &nbsp; So if you do install it from there, then do a customised install (i.e. selecting
 the options you want to install) and select 'perform a clean install' (i.e. all remnants of the old driver will be removed before the new one is installed). &nbsp; And yes, you can get a black screen or two while the installation process goes through.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for your reply. The Windows 10 upgrade updated my NVIDIA driver initially. I have received two updates since the initial upgrade. The first was about a month after installing Win10. The second was yesterday. I am keeping track of driver version numbers
 and yes the number was higher after yesterday's update. Normally I would either get updates from the Lenovo site (which is no longer viable since my laptop is over 5 years old and they are no longer posting updates to it) or from NVIDIA, but it seems that
 Windows 10 is now constantly updating the drivers.<br />
&nbsp; I did not get a black screen. Just the Windows Update window turned white with nothing showing in it so I did not know what was happening with the update. I never noticed that happen before. Had I not gotten the Notification pop-up to reboot, I would have
 thought something went wrong. Everything is working ok, but it bothers me that Microsoft is constantly upgrading drivers in Windows 10. If they give you a bad one, chaos could ensue. I guess they don't believe in the old adage, "if it aint broke, don't fix
 it".</p>

            <p>It's strange, but I have never had Windows update my Nvidia drivers. &nbsp;It's possible that I am quick to update them via the Nvidia website, so when the time comes to Windows scanning and downloading drivers, it probably shows that I have an updated driver
 already installed. &nbsp;So maybe, you could try that, since apart from subscribing to the Nvidia driver news on their blog, there doesn't seem to be any automatic notification system available. &nbsp; I just checked on their site for your driver, and the latest one
 is 341.92, which you probably have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or else, go ahead and download the driver from Nvidia and keep it in case you experience some graphic-type glitches. Then you can open up that download and select what features you want to install (do a clean install so as to remove all evidence of the previous
 driver). &nbsp; Hopefully, the Windows update checker will overlook your efficiency!!</p>

            <p>341.92 is what was installed Monday. The previous one I had was 341.81 which was installed by Win10 two months ago. The only thing that concerns me is why Windows Update says the install failed when it apparently did not fail. I just got a new Cumulative
 update a few minutes ago. I will try to determine what might have changed with it.</p>

            <p>The only thing I can think of as a failed install notice from Win Update, is that not all the features of that driver update were successfully installed or it carried out only a driver install and not the other features. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think your best bet is to do a separate download of that driver from Nvidia, and proceed with the installation, selecting the features you want to install via a clean install. &nbsp; In that way, you know whether&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">your</span>
 download/installation was successful and you can keep that driver download in a folder for future reference.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Using Belarc is no use for finding a useable Product Key with OEM Licenses such a eMachines, Dell, etc.</p>
<p>All that will find is the Factory Installation Key which is used on Multiple machines and is no use for reinstallation purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p><span><strong><em>The above reinstallation method does not&nbsp;normally require you to supply a Product Key during the Installation Process as the Recovery Process uses the Factory Installation Product Key to automatically Activate during the reinstallation
 process.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><em>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>But you have gone further and have probably voided your Vista OEM License by changing Computer Case, etc.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Read this about preinstalled OEM (eMachines, Acer, Dell, HP, etc) Licenses:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://oem.microsoft.com/script/contentpage.aspx?pageid=552846#faq1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oem.microsoft.com/script/contentpage.aspx?pageid=552846#faq1</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Q. </span></b><span>Can a PC with an OEM Windows operating system have its motherboard upgraded and keep the same license? What if it was replaced because it was defective?</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>A. </b>Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer—<strong><span>except the motherboard</span></strong>—and still retain the license for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software.
<span>If the motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then
<strong>a</strong></span> <span>new computer has been created</span>. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the license of new operating system software is required. If the motherboard is replaced because it
 is defective, you do not need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
</span>
<p>p.s. An OEM License is tied to the FIRST machine that&nbsp;it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>

    <title>Black Screen and Flickering Taskbar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen and Flickering Taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! When I booted up my desktop this morning it went through an update. After this update though, my screen went black and the taskbar kept flickering. I can't open the windows start menu at all, nor are there any shortcut icons. Task manager works fine
 though, which makes me think it's not my display driver. The only way I can really navigate that I've found so far is through the task manager. I've also tried doing a clean boot, disabling everything except Microsoft services (also disabled startup programs)
 but it still didn't work. I thought about trying reroll to a previous update but can't seem to get to the Update and &amp; Security settings, even when I manage to find a shortcut that should open, it just won't. I've read that it's an application that's causing
 this, usually iCloud or Norton but I don't have any of these installed and have no idea what app could cause this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be very appreciated! I also have a video of the problem in action&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5wP9_7eKGw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/K5wP9_7eKGw?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/K5wP9_7eKGw?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>.</p>

<p>Hi Malcom McFarlane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your question to the answers.microsoft.com communities forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to be sure the steps below were followed and that the exact steps were setup in the order it is stated below.&nbsp; Sometimes getting one step out of order will cause the printer to print to the local
 for the remote instead of the system you are working from.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a Remote Desktop session, you can use your printer to print documents that are stored on the remote computer. You need to<span style="font-weight: bold"> set this up just before you connect.</span>
 The setting will be saved so that you won't need to change it the next time you connect.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<ul>
<p>Open Remote Desktop Connection by clicking the

Make sure that you select your printer in the Print dialog box each time you print.</p>

<h2>            How do I reinstall an app that the computer says is not there but the store says is installed</h2>
                    I installed a game (Dragon Mania Legend) on my daughter's account and it worked just fine for about a week. &nbsp;Then it would not open from the live tile or the start menu. &nbsp;The app does not appear on the list of apps on the computer, but there is still a
 live tile (it does not change at all). &nbsp;I can't reinstall the app because the store says it is installed. &nbsp;I can see her game from my son's account but she can not open the game at all. &nbsp;How do I either uninstall this app that the computer says is not there...
 or... how do I reinstall an app that the store says is already installed? &nbsp;

            <p>Alright, in that case I think my recommendation at this point is to remote it with a PowerShell command. PowerShell is the next-gen advanced shell (command entry) for Windows, and the successor to the old command prompt.&nbsp; PowerShell provides advanced access
 to the system primarily in ways that are used by administrators and IT professionals, but it can help us here as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tutorial explains how to use it to forcibly remove an app.&nbsp; Afterwards, rebooting should then let the store determine that the app is now available to re-install.</p>

            it might sound weird but try pluggin your printer with a dual headed USB cable. I.e two ports in computer and the backend in printer.. it solved a problem of mine once..

</div>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Choose one of the following options:</div>
</li><li>
<p><span>Homegroup (Read)</span>. This options shares the item with your entire homegroup—but people in your homegroup can only open the item. Homegroup members can't modify or delete it.</p>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Homegroup (Read/Write)</span>. This option shares the item with your entire homegroup and lets them open, modify, or delete it.</p>
</li><li>
<div><span>Specific people</span>. This option opens the File Sharing wizard, which allows you to select individual people to share items with.<br />
<br />
<br />
By following these instructions to hopefully cure my sharing problem, I can try to choose to share with the Homegroup (read/write) but it won't change from the Nobody item with the lock on it.
<br />
<br />
So my questions are: <br />
How do I get it to release the lock shown on Nobody and allow me to choose another sharing option?<br />
By changing that selection to Homegroup (Read/Write), will that allow me to transfer a file to my other computer in my homegroup?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help on this.</div>

<p>Hi jayjoyce,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p><br />
You cannot get to release the lock shown on Nobody as this is by design which means you can stop sharing files and folders by choosing this option.</p>
<p>By changing the selection to Homegroup(Read/Write), you can transfer the files from one computer to another.</p>
<p>However, I suggest you to “Turn on the Public folder sharing on” in all the computers in “Homegroup”.</p>
<p>Follow this method to do the same:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>The Public folders<br />
You can also share files and folders by copying or moving them into one of the Windows 7 Public folders, such as Public Music or Public Pictures. You can find them by clicking the Start button , clicking your user account name, and then clicking the arrow beside
 Libraries to expand the folders.</p>
<p>Public folder sharing is turned off by default (except on a homegroup).</p>
<p>To turn Public folder sharing on or off<br />
</p>
<p>When Public folder sharing is turned on, anyone on your computer or network can access these folders. When it's off, only people with a user account and password on your computer have access.</p>
<p>1.Open Advanced sharing settings by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, click Network and Sharing Center, and then, in the left pane, click Change advanced sharing settings.</p>
<p>2.Click the chevron to expand your current network profile.</p>
<p>3.Under Public folder sharing, select one of the following options:</p>
<p>·Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the Public folders</p>
<p>·Turn off Public folder sharing (people logged on to this computer can still access these folders)</p>
<p>4.Click Save changes. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Notes<br />
· When you share the Public folder on your computer with other people, they can open and view the files stored there just as if they were stored on their own computers. If you give them permission to change files, any changes they make will change the files
 on your computer.</p>
<p>· If you click a Public folder or its contents, you'll see Advanced sharing settings in the Share with menu. This option takes you to Control Panel, where you can turn Public folder sharing on or off.</p>
<p>By turning on password-protect sharing in Control Panel, you can limit Public folder access to people with a user account and password on your computer. This option isn't available on a domain.</p>
<p>To turn password-protected sharing on or off<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>To access shared files, folders, or libraries on other homegroup computers<br />
</p>
<p>1. Click the Start button , and then click your user name.</p>
<p>2. In the navigation pane (the left pane), under Homegroup, click the user account of the person whose files you want to access.</p>
<p>3. In the file list, double-click the library you want to access, and then double-click the item you want.<br />

<p>I have the same problem as the original post, and I don't understand the answer given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You cannot get to release the lock shown on Nobody as this is by design which means you can stop sharing files and folders by choosing this option.</p>
<p>By changing the selection to Homegroup(Read/Write), you can transfer the files from one computer to another." The first sentence is just vague, and the second sentence doesn't address the problem.. I've selected Share (read/write), but I do not get write
 access from my other computer in the Workgroup. If the lock on "nobody" doesn't mean that sharing permissions are locked to 'nobody' than that is extremely confusing.</p>
<p>I do not want to use the public folder option. I want to access my documents from my other computer on my homegroup. I don't want to move files to the public location every time I want to share them, and I don't want to work from that location permanently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>I have two machines connected to a router. I have a Win7 64 bit machine that I created a Workgroup on and elected to only share Printers and the Documents library. Inside the Documents library I created a share
 folder. The "Share With" is locked to "Nobody" and I can't change this even though the security permissions for the folder show me as having full control. I have a second machine running Win7 32 bit that I connected to the Workgroup. The second machine "finds"
 the printer connected to machine one but does nothing when I click "Install". The second machine displays the Documents library located on machine one but I can't open it.<br />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I have "successfully" set up a workgroup, - I do not want a homegroup.&nbsp;which should have allowed both of my computers to see each other and allow access to my libraries. I have set permissions to read/write on both computers. I will designate them as laptop
 and desktop for this forum. My laptop can see the libraries of my desktop but when I select the Documents icon it does nothing. By nothing (as if this needs clarification) I mean, NOTHING! No warning pops up, etc. So to see if I could by-pass this issue, I
 went directly to the folder within my documents that I wanted to share, right clicked, and selected share with homegroup read/write, from my desktop. My laptop showed the folder under the homegroup desktop but when I selected the folder a balloon with "Network
 error" popped up and stated that "Windows cannot access \\name of-PC\Homegroup name of you do not have permission to access (name of computer). Contact your network administrator to request access." I am the flippin network administrator as well as the administrator
 of both computers (yes I verified this under user accounts). I have also used the Shared Folders Troubleshooter as well as the Homegroup Troubleshooter. Neither troubleshooter was successful. I think the troubleshooter needs a troubleshooter.

<p>The file sharing is not totally incomprehensive for windows 7....After coming from vista...its pretty much the same. Not quite easy, but I figured it out in vista, so it applied to win7. I'll try to list the steps that i went through to get it to work.</p>
<p>1:) Make sure that all your computers are on the same workgroup in your system settings. (start menu&gt;my computer&gt;properties&gt;"set your workgroup"</p>
<p>2:) Make sure your file sharing is on and password setting is off. (start menu&gt;control panel&gt;network and internet&gt;network and sharing center&gt;change advance sharing settings&gt;"now set your settings to turn on network discovery-turn on file and printer-sharing-turn
 on sharing with anyone with network etc.-use 128 bit encrytion etc.-turn off password protected sharing-allow windows to manage homegroup.- save changes</p>
<p>if you want to keep password settings on then you need to go through the difficulites of providing passwords and usernames - good luck. I turned mine off so i didnt have to deal with it.</p>
<p>3:) Now to share folders. On the win7 computer. select your folder&gt;properties&gt;share&gt;use the pulldown to select everybody and make sure you click add. You will now see that everyone is given the permission level - and you can change it to read or read/write.
 Do not do the right click share with command on the folder itself. It doesnt allow you to share it from there.</p>
<p>4:) at this point going to the network tab on another computer you should see the window 7 computer your trying to share shown as . "user on XXX" inside you should see your shared folders and stuff.</p>

<p>Hopefully that gets what you need to share your folders. If you still have difficulty. Post what problems your having and either i could or someone with more technical background can chime it. I'm a trial and error regular user with NO technical background
 just learning stuff on the fly.</p>
<p>good luck</p>

<div>I was having issues with that as well and all I had to change was to stop letting windows 7 manage the homegroup connection.<br />
So, I have the same user account and password on both machines.<br />
My Control Panel Settings (Control Panel -&gt; Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Advanced Sharing Settings) are:<br />
Network discovery ON<br />
File and printer sharking ON<br />
Public folder sharing ON<br />
Media streaming ON<br />
128-bit encryption<br />
Password protection OFF<br />
***Use user accounts to connect to other computers (as opposed to allowing Windows to do it)<br />

            <p>I have a Windows 7 32 bit Sony VAIO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was looking at a few items on my computer - I noticed that there are several ways of sharing - I noticed this by going into the righ click and to the sharing tab and the security tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have one file that is locked and comes up with errors that it is open in another location and changing the properties will loose any data that may be open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I change the folder properties so that the file on my 1TB Seagate External Hard Drive can be used everywhere?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also noticed that the file is on the Network - I do not have a Homegroup set up and I think that I have a Workgroup as we are visable to each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a bit of a background on the set up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#333333">Have you set a password for the user account? We need to make sure that it is safe while accessing a network.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>I think that one has been set up as I have a collection of numbers and letters that may be the Homegroup password.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>As per the Homegroup pics in the Skydrive pics - HomeGroup is turned off - but it looks like Network is on. I am not too sure.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have three computers – I would have to say that – the one with Vista is just not that active.</span><span><br />
</span><span>One – Windows Vista 64 HP Compaq (Sir Grant)</span><span><br />
</span><span>Two – Windows 7 64 Home Premium User Viao</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>Three – Myself – Windows 7 32 bit Home Premium</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
How many people have access to these computers?<br />
<br />
</span><span>Two – Myself and Grant</span><span><br />
<br />
Post a screenshot of the Control Panel/User Accounts and Family Safety/User Accounts showing all the Users for all the machines.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>I have done the Control Panel/User Accounts – I can not locate the Family Safety/User Accounts in the Control Panel.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>The Windows Vista has a password – the others do not.</span><span><br />
<br />
I am confused that you have a folder named Melissa &amp; Grant. Have you both got access to this account and if so do you both use the same Password?<br />
<br />
</span><span>I think that may be a folder that is set up on my computer – I thought it was Mel Uni. It has been to Sony for a BSOD so that may have been when the change was made</span><span><br />
</span><span>I have noted that it is not available on Grant – User Viao computer</span><span><br />
<br />
You don't seem too sure whether you set up the Network or not. Could anyone else have done it?<br />
<br />
</span><span>Grant is not that computer minded. I set up the internet etc – so it would be all my doing. I have a password which looks like it is created by Windows when I was having issues with the WiFi and my Windows Mobile Phone</span><span><br />
<br />
You said earlier "The other old one – Windows Vista HP 64 bit- I just set up to gain Internet access."</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
Can you explain this, have you not got internet access on the Windows 7 machine?<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Both the Windows 7 machines have internet access via WiFi and SSID passwords. The other machine does not have access as I disconnected it.</span><span><br />
I just wish no folders to be shared - I will keep it simple stupid</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
I am very ill. I am so sorry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the control panel from both computers</p>

            <p>I believe your problem is two parts,</p>
<p>One, all these users are administrator accounts,</p>
<p>Two, none of them are password protected.</p>
<p>Melissa needs a password protected Admin account on both machines, then you can share or not.</p>
<p>Grant needs a standard user account on one machine or both. Melissa can access Grants files if she wants to but Grant can not even if He wanted to.</p>
<p>Most people here believe a Administrator user account should not be used all of the time and you should also have a Standard user account to surf the web....</p>
<p>Now I do believe a user on both machines should be the same administrator but should also have a Backup Administrator account (Both Password Protected) and Never Used unless the first gets Corrupted/ locked out of either machine for any given reason, Virus..........</p>
<p>But the second user/ person should only have one account/ Standard user password or not/ it's better if it does have a password though.</p>
<p>Result/ for Melissa it's a win/win,</p>
<p>Grant not so much :)</p>

            <p>I do not know what you mean about duplicate threads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have included threads from another question that had a collection of answers - it has the graphics that I am finding difficult to understand - so I should have just left my question for the Community to address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologise that I may have caused confusion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wish to have my issue resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to decribe what problems I am having and tried to give as much information - hence the questions and answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could assist me in what threads I duplicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also included quite a number of screen shots - something that is also new to me and Skydrive.</p>

            <p>Thank you for looking at my documents -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attached a skydrive screen shot library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the error on the User (Grant) where it says that he can not enter into a HomeGroup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have that he has access to my files and somehow my drives are shared with the other computer (User)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not too sure about the parental controls section - but included the screen shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You havee been most helpful and I appreciate all assistance as it is confusing to most standard users - only beginner learners like myself</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would I (Melissa) be asked for a password for access via Network to Grant (User-VIAO) computer?</p>
