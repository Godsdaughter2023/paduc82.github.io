<h2>            &#34;Incorrect permissions on Windows Search directories&#34;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm not able to index my program files folder to be able to search for my applications on Windows 8. As it no longer has a strat menu, search becomes more important.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I started the Troubleshooting tool and got the above message.</div>
<div>Details are:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"When permissions on the Windows Search data directories are set incorrectly, the search service might not be able to access or update the computer's search index. This can result in slow searches or incomplete search results."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What do I need to do to give the indexer access rights? The system currently has special permissions (what ever that means, not very descriptive).</div>
                </div>

What are permissions? </p>
<p><br />
Permissions are rules associated with objects on a computer or network, such as files and folders. Permissions determine whether you can access an object and what you can do with it. For example, you might have access to a document on a shared folder on a network.
 And even though you can read the document, you might not have permissions to make changes to it. System administrators and people with administrator accounts on computers can assign permissions to individual users or groups.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeevan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>As you can see in my original question, I actually used the troubleshooter. I did not mention explicitly that it was the search and indexing troubleshooter, but it was.</p>
<p>The message I got was from that tool.</p>
<p>So, something is wrong with the permissions on the "Program Files" folder. I have the suspicion that the indexing engine CANNOT access this folder&nbsp;and is not suppose to do so.</p>
<p>I'm also not able to change the permissions of that folder and subfolders using properties-&gt;security -&gt;Edit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It would be helpful if someone can test and&nbsp;either confirm that&nbsp;Windows 8 is normally able of indexing the "Program Files"&nbsp;folder or confirm that something is not correct on my computer.</strong></p>
<p>Just try to search for a file in the&nbsp;"Program Files" and if&nbsp;you cannot find it, add "Program Files" to your indexing locations and wait until the engine has indexed it, then try to search for that file again.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 System Low On Memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samueltrott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 System Low On Memory</h2>
                    <p>Okay so this has never been a problem since I updated to Windows 10 months ago. But recently my system keeps saying Low on Memory. Yet when I check in task manager the RAM is running at 50-60%. I have 8GB of RAM and a 111GB SSD that my operating system is
 on and a 1TB internal for other applications (like games).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around on the web and have been unable to find a solution, I used the 'Run Maintenance Task' test and it didn't find a problem. Some people have suggested it may be a problem with the pagefile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something curious I found was in the task manager it says I'm using 21.3/21.8GB of Committed memory so is that where the problem is? What is committed memory and why suddenly is it a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: So I found what was causing the problem, now it was tricky to find since it didn't appear to be using much actual RAM but was instead using most of the pagefile. It was a service called RunSW.exe. I have no idea what it does only that apparently it's
 realtek. Either way it had some kind of pagefile memory leak, the moment I ended the service in task manager the committed memory dropped to 5.0/16GB.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 loops on UEFI Screen</h2>
                    <p>My surface pro 4 was locked in an Automatic Repair loop for a LONG TIME (a year and a half). I tried all kinds of ideas to get out of it but no luck...Until I decided to schedule and appointment at a Microsoft Store. I charged up my neglected device and
 it came up in the UEFI screen. I canceled my appointment. Rather that being scared I was delighted since I had not been able to get there before. I used a USB stick to redo Windows and I have it working now. The only problem that remains is this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I power off and power on the device it comes up in the UEFI screen. If I choose Exit from this screen I don't get Windows and am instead returned to the UEFI screen. The only way I can get Windows to start is to shut down holding both the volume UP AND
 the volume down buttons while pressing the power button. I leave these buttons depressed and then press the Power button to restart. As soon as it wakes up I release both volume buttons and Windows restarts and runs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas????</p>

<p>Thanks for all your helpful replies. My Windows version is up to May 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One fly in the ointment, my volume up button is dead. I cannot turn the volume up with it. I have to go to a system dialog to turn the volume up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that if I hold the volume down button alone when starting windows and release it as soon as it starts, it will boot correctly. The problem with the volume up button may be a hardware defect. I bought the machine in Jan of 17 and it worked until
 Jan of 18 when an Early Experience update locked it in an Automatic Repair loop and no button pushing would exit. When it recently came up in the UEFI screen I immediately switched to USB boot and used a thumb drive to wipe the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than having to use a two button restart procedure and having no volume up button, the machine seems to work. My type cover is not working. If I connect it to the machine it starts opening up tabs at random but I can work with a usb keyboard. The pen
 won't write but I have always found the pen problematical. I ordered a cheap third party replacement so I'll see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now it appears that I might as well just use the two button startup and hope it keeps working.&nbsp; I had forgotten what a nice machine it is. Great screen and reasonable weight. I greatly prefer the 12 in screen to the 10 in on my Samsung Android tablet.
 I have been using a Chromebook some times to get used to them and you get a lot of machine for the buck but with my Windows legacy, going back to the Windows 95 beta with downloads on a modem, I just have a lot of stuff that works best with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks for all your helpful replies. My Windows version is up to May 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One fly in the ointment, my volume up button is dead. I cannot turn the volume up with it. I have to go to a system dialog to turn the volume up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that if I hold the volume down button alone when starting windows and release it as soon as it starts, it will boot correctly. The problem with the volume up button may be a hardware defect. I bought the machine in Jan of 17 and it worked until
 Jan of 18 when an Early Experience update locked it in an Automatic Repair loop and no button pushing would exit. When it recently came up in the UEFI screen I immediately switched to USB boot and used a thumb drive to wipe the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than having to use a two button restart procedure and having no volume up button, the machine seems to work. My type cover is not working. If I connect it to the machine it starts opening up tabs at random but I can work with a usb keyboard. The pen
 won't write but I have always found the pen problematical. I ordered a cheap third party replacement so I'll see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now it appears that I might as well just use the two button startup and hope it keeps working.&nbsp; I had forgotten what a nice machine it is. Great screen and reasonable weight. I greatly prefer the 12 in screen to the 10 in on my Samsung Android tablet.
 I have been using a Chromebook some times to get used to them and you get a lot of machine for the buck but with my Windows legacy, going back to the Windows 95 beta with downloads on a modem, I just have a lot of stuff that works best with Windows.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply. That’s cool to know. I’m sorry if this takes some time to reply. Thanks for trying some steps here.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you don’t mind me asking, we do have a few questions just to clarify you concern.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What I’m understanding here is that the volume button is defective, you mean it’s was being pushed?</li><li>So far, it boot to windows but just the type cover is not working, even the pen. Correct?</li><li>When you says, “Pen” is that a Surface pen?</li></ul>

<p>I was getting Windows to boot to Windows, rather than the UEFI screen, by pressing both the volume rocker up and down buttons. Then, with Windows running, I found that the volume up rocker button does not work to change volume. I then tried booting Windows
 holding down only the volume down button, and releasing it as soon as the system wakes up and it boots. Makes me a little worried about what may happen next but I can use the machine. I wish I could get the machine so that I could just power it up and not
 have to hold down the volume down button until the word SURFACE appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all the updates I have done I decided to try the type cover again and I think it is working. I will be happy if that is true because I like the type cover.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4d870947-6740-4c34-9d7e-1aef32710a8a" title="RSipson">RSipson</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on this thread. My apology for the late reply. That could be concerning even though it boot to Windows. We’ll it’s good to hear that its already booting to windows and not to Surface UEFI.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your Surface pen, we respect your decision on that and its good to know that you works fine also.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to the volume up button of your Surface, perhaps this is a hardware issue. Just to make sure that the volume is still working. I do have some following questions though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the volume can still be adjusted using taskbar settings? (Taskbar &gt; Very Left look for the “Speaker” Icon&gt; Adjust the volume.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that works, try to compare it using the button on the screen if not working, you can visit the nearest Microsoft store to have it check&nbsp; fully if it’s a hardware issue.
</p>

<p>It accepts the login - says welcome to windows then the error message waits a while then reboots. It has a fingerprint reader, but gives the same error when using a password. It will not start go any further then this in "safe mode" or "last know good configuration

<p>Yes, I can format other discs and play re-writable discs, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect, as you suggest, that the particular disk might be corrupted. If that is so, I wonder if the set of discs, from where the disc came from, can only be re-written to a certain number of times before they become unusable.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade checker does not check PAE, NX, and SSE2</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Microsoft has done A LOT of work for Windows 10.&nbsp; And&nbsp;they have gone to a lot of trouble to&nbsp;let everyone possible upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is great.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have more than one Windows 7 machine in my house telling me I can upgrade to Windows 10, and suggesting I
 reserve an upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually would like to.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I went through the pain of&nbsp;realizing during an attempted upgrade to Windows 8 on these machines&nbsp;that I could not due to lack of support for PAE, NX, and&nbsp;SSE2.&nbsp; I therefore know since I am slightly technical,
 that I in fact cannot upgrade and likely would not find out until I was in the middle of an upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>I am not upset about&nbsp;being unable to upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; The processors are old (though useable) and technology moves on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am hoping some Microsoft monitor will read this and suggest to the Windows 10 team that they are misleading many thousands (at least).&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be that hard to put in a check for the availability of an instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try it and fail, and recover.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 No biggy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in it's absence many people will get part way through an upgrade and have it fail and be floundering around trying to figure out why.&nbsp;&nbsp; Message boards will fill with messages.&nbsp;&nbsp; People will say look at hardware requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; The non-technical
 will have no idea what PAE, NX, and&nbsp;SSE2 means or how to check if they have it.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that could be avoided if the upgrade checker said your CPU is missing these features and they are required.</p>

            <p>Actually, setup checks for those CPU instructions before it even copies files to your drive. Besides, its a free upgrade, so even if its not compatible, its not a lost.</p>

            You're still getting achievement notifications while playing offline? Interesting. Sometimes they can be delayed because of a cloud sync error. I've seen people get them weeks after the fact.

<p><strong><span>Hi pawpawrock,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. When exactly do you get the error messages?<br />
2. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
3. What error message do you get when you switch webpages?<br />
4. Which version of Internet explorer is installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to use check disk command with the /f switch and check if this resolves the check disk errors and helps you run it properly.<br />
<br />
<strong>Warning:</strong></span><span> Microsoft does not recommend&nbsp;<strong>interrupting</strong> the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.<strong>For
 safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command if you can.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the check disk commands as follows:<br />
a. Click Start. <br />
b. In search window type 'cmd' and ENTER. Right click and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
c. Type at the command prompt &nbsp;“<strong>CHKDSK /P”</strong> and press ENTER to scan the disk.<br />
d. </span><span>Type at the command prompt&nbsp; “<strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R”</strong> and press ENTER to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then&nbsp;press Y to schedule a task and restart
 the computer to perform chkdsk. Once chkdsk completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may refer to the below link for information on the same -</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to perform a SFC scan and check.<br />
<strong>To</strong> </span><strong><span>Perform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
 click&nbsp; <strong>All Programs</strong>, click&nbsp; <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click&nbsp;
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
</span><span><strong>sfc /scannow&nbsp; <br />
</strong>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 any files require a replace SFC will replace them. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />

<p>I called tech support and after holding for 45 minutes they say they can't help me because its no longer supported.</p>
<p>upon starting the game I get a message that it can't be activated - "We're sorry, an unexpected error occurred which is preventing product activation from being completed" Error Code: 1-80004005</p>
<p>

            <p>You have joined the long queue of FSXers with activation problems. &nbsp; Some have been able to fix it, others having to find other solutions. &nbsp; The general fix for FSX not activating is given below. &nbsp; However, when it comes to activating the Acceleration Pack,
 then this fix has sometimes not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first uninstall Acceleration and reboot computer. &nbsp; Then follow the following directions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.&nbsp;Run Registry Editor (press Windows Key + R and type&nbsp; regedit&nbsp; and Ok)</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<span>2. Expand the following registry key:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e967-e325-11ce-</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">bfc1-08002be10318} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3. After you find the folder, double-click Upperfilters on the right side.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span>4. Change the value from 0 to PartMgr &nbsp;and delete any other word that may be next to it and click&nbsp;</span></span><span>OK. &nbsp; If it is already PartMgr, then you could try changing it to &nbsp;partmgr.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>5.&nbsp;Close Registry Editor. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. Try installing Acceleration pack and hopefully you should get the registration wizard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Remember to be careful when moving about the System Registry - you may want to back it up if you're unsure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Start button does not respond after wake up from Hibernate</h2>
                    <p>Hi Windows Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a 2012 ASUS which my wife bought me for Father's Day that year. It has 4 dual core processors and 8 GB RAM.</p>
<p>It originally came with Windows 7, which then upgraded itself to Windows 8.1. Now I have been running Windows 10 for over 2 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that after it wakes up from Hibernate, the Start button is no longer responsive. I can hover over it with the mouse, but on clicking it, the Start Menu does not popup. Same with the notification tray, as nothing is responsive there as well.
 I can cycle through my open programs in the Taskbar, but that's all. The only resolution I have now is to reboot, which fixes the issue (I have a strong suspicion it is Cortana which is causing the unresponsiveness).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea of a long term solution? I am thinking of just giving up on Hibernate, and just doing complete shutdown everytime :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jose</p>

                    I am trying to obtain the System ID of my computer that has Windows 7 on it.<br />

It would be ideal if I could find it within Windows itself without installing a 3rd party software to obtain it.<br />

Thanks so much in advance.<br />

<h2>            Skype automatically creating group conversations by itself&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In my Skype Recent activity, it says I joined a new conversation and renamed it "My Family" and then (some of) my family members also joined. &nbsp;I did not do this. &nbsp;This happened when I was definitely not on Skype, and all of these events happened within seconds
 of each other. &nbsp;Here's the transcript:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">[11:45:21 AM] *** <em>[my account]</em> joined. ***<br />
[11:45:22 AM] *** <em>[my account]</em> has renamed this conversation to "My Family" ***<br />
[11:45:23 AM] *** <em>[my family member 1]</em> joined. ***<br />
[11:45:23 AM] *** <em>[my family member 2]</em> joined. ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain <em>none </em>of the three of us were active on Skype at the time (though I may have briefly brought the app in focus in my phone around that time stamp, running the iOS Skype 8.5.1). &nbsp;My first suspicion was hacking, but I checked endpoints with
 "/showplaces" on my desktop and I was not signed in anywhere I didn't expect to be. &nbsp;(Just my desktop and my phone, both of which were in line of sight to me, and the phone was on a private Wifi.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this would be a really odd thing for a hacker to do, no? &nbsp;Plus, would it not require all three accounts to be compromised for them to all join at the same time under user control?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given how close together the events were (likely too fast for a human to do in sequence) and that it's unlikely all three accounts were hacked at the same time, I'm wondering if this is some new, "helpful" (but misguided) attempt at intelligent automation
 by Skype itself? &nbsp;(If it is a feature, I call it misguided because in the age of masquerading for the purposes of phishing, who would trust undocumented alterations to a person's connections?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to search Google for any other experiences with this behaviour (either as a feature announcement or hacking report) but couldn't find anything.</p>

    <title>xbox 360 controller not recognized windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            xbox 360 controller not recognized windows 8.1</h2>
                    When I plug in the controller a pop up appears saying USB device not recognized, I have installed the supplied software and attempted to install the drivers. When I go to the device manager the device appears as Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request
 Failed) and in the properties I get a generic code 43 and again the device descriptor failed. According to Microsoft compatibility for the controller it should be plug and play in windows 8.1 yet I can't even manually install drivers. When I try to do so manually
 (Update Driver Software-&gt;Browse my computer for driver software-&gt; Let me pick from a list) I seem to skip the vital screen that everyone else can fix it from.

            Hi  Saif
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />You might need to update your BIOS and Chipset drivers. 
<br />
<br />Are you connecting to AC power when the battery is installed?
<br />
<br />If so, disconnect it and use only the battery power and let it drain. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn't fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It's possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don't have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack's Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.

            Hi Saif
<br />
<br />Did you purchase that new battery from the manufacturers of your laptop, or form some other retailer on the web?
<br />
<br />Did you calibrate that battery when you first used it?
<br />
<br />If not:
<br />
<br />Charge the battery up to 100% in one session
<br />
<br />Then unplug your laptop and run it until the laptop shuts down from lack of power
<br />
<br />Then charge your battery back up to 100% in one session

<h2>            Unable to move the mouse cursor using the trackpad on the Sony Laptop and some of its functions does not work.</h2>

<p>Old Title: <font color="#000000">Sony trackpad not working - Windows 8</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi guys, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a sony vaio s series that I just bought last january. it came preinstalled with windows 8 and i only use it about 2-3 times a week. 2 weeks ago, my trackpad stopped working in that i cannot move my cursor. i can zoom in and out and other stuff but
 there's something wrong with some trackpad functions. i checked the synaptic driver and it says that it's up to date.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>now i suspected that it might be a hardware problem so i sent it to the sony repair center as it is still under warranty. unfortunately it is not the case and i was informed that it's a software problem. they advise me to reinstall windows 8 because it
 is the only solution to the problem, they believe. (I want to clarify that it's most probably not Fn+F1 as when i start the laptop, the trackpad works perfectly fine for about 30 secods and suddenly goofs around after that.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i am reluctant to do this as it is an arduous task and that i am not really savvy with this kind of stuff. i am wondering whether you guys have any suggestions or if anyone has experienced the same problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my gut feel is that a windows update is responsible for this but i am entirely unsure. in fact, 3 weeks after i bought my laptop this has already occurred to my once but after restarting it, the trackpad functioned well. now even restarting the computer
 doesn't help. i'm basically forced to use a mouse which is not convenient when i am on the go...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks a lot! appreciate any help i can get, really. i am on the verge of wanting to sell my new laptop T_T</div>
                </div>

            I've finally solved the problem. I reinstalled the driver in SAFE MODE. Hope this might be of use to someone else

<h2>            windows 8 won&#39;t duplicate display</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8 and have two monitors attached.&nbsp; I'm able to extend my desktop to the two monitors but am unable to duplicate the display on both monitors.&nbsp; When I access the Display settings via the control panel, I'm given the options of 1) extending
 my display, 2) using monitor 2 only, or 3) using monitor 1 only.&nbsp; I'm not given the option to duplicate my display.</p>
<p>When I attempt to use the new Windows 8 feature of right-clicking in the lower right-hand part of the screen, selecting devices, selecting Second-Screen, and then selecting Duplicate, nothing happens.</p>
