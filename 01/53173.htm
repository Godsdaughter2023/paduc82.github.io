<h2>            Windows 10 1803 &#40;RS4 Build&#41; Keeps Freezing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have found another issue with Windows 10 Pro 1803 (RS4) Build and I have only had this issue on another pc in my home which keeps freezing on the Windows 10 Pro 1803 (RS4) Build after Communitive Update KB4284848. This is affecting
 me by using this new version of Windows 10.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I think Microsoft might need to release a Update for this issue.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Also Microsoft needs to ask some customers what they rate their build of Windows 10 1803 (RS4) Build.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

            Hi Luke.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I gave you over a dozen steps to perform including an entire performance checklist that MUST be completed before troubleshooting can even begin, and you reply within a few minutes that it did not resolve your issue?
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do the work yourself then you'll need to take it to a shop which will charge a minimum $150 and will probably reinstall Windows and not do even half as good of a job as the Clean install I linked to you which is better than any amount of money can buy. 
<br />
<br />Let me know when you get started.

<p>Using Windows 7 \Home Premium 32 bit on toshiba laptop, &nbsp;was having trouble with Comodo time machine doing corrupt snapshots, uninstalled CTM and various errors flashed on screen too quick to note. Rebooted laptop and failed to boot, used windows cd and
 can get to Windows Recovery / install</p>
<p>Repair does not work, no backups found, have used Article ID: 927392 and gone through all suggested options, then installed multiboot manager osl2000, when rebooted tha showed the c\; drive and its correct size, but still can not install, upgrade windows
 or even start in safe mode.</p>
<p>Have had no osinstalled as well.</p>
<p>I need to removed some data and I will then format drive, not able to use windows transfer as it says files missing etc. Hope someone has an answer, many thanks in anticipation.</p>

            Here are some options to gain access to your data:<br />
<ol>
<li>Use your external backup medium. </li><li>Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD, then open a Command Prompt and copy your files to some external storage medium. You need to be familiar with Console commands to do this.</li><li>Boot the machine with an Ubuntu boot CD, then save your files. The size of the Ubuntu ISO file is about 750 MBytes.<br />
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/</li></ol>
If Option 1 is not available then this is a good time to review your backup policy. 2.5" disks cost very little these days.

 After restart I can log on but after a&nbsp;about 20&nbsp;seconds windows does not work properly (becoming frozen and not allowing me to run software or log on to internet).</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description I understand that you are unable to install two updates (KB954430) and (KB973688). Error 643 are usually caused by an inconsistency on the MSI database state. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, b<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">efore we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Are you able to install other updates successfully?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Which security software are you using on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. <span>
Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You receive error code 0x80070643 or error code 0x643 when you use the Windows Update or
</span><span>Microsoft Update Web sites to install updates. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Try to run the Fixit </strong>from this Microsoft article and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>.NET Framework update installation error: "0x80070643" or "0x643"</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still not able to install updates, then I would suggest you to reset Windows Update components,
</p>
<p>then try performing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit the link below to know how to reset Windows Update components:</p>

</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Run the fix it both in default mode and aggressive mode.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your antivirus software may be conflicting with Windows Updates. You can test this by temporarily disabling your antivirus:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Disable Anti-virus software<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</em><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to manually download and install the updates from the following links:</p>

    <title>Connect to 2 MS wireless display adapters at the same time - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Connect to 2 MS wireless display adapters at the same time</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 external monitors&nbsp; each connected with a MS wireless display adapter v2. My goal was to extend my display across these 2 external monitors and my laptop (surface pro 2017). I got this setup because in the following post it was stated that this was
 possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/run-two-monitors-on-wireless-display-adapters-from/a60a7f6c-1f61-4540-9a44-7a3b8bebc5a0</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot connect to both wireless adapters at the same time. When trying to connect to the second one, the connection to the first one is automatically broken.&nbsp; Is there a way to fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />

Seahawks65, thanks for the reply.<br />

I read the page you refered to, but I don't get how it could solve the problem I have. My two wireless display adapters work fine by themselves, but I can't connect to them at the same time.

<p>2 wireless display adapters ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mean one and connecting to wireless displays to one PC/Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then, How many total are connected wired or wireless ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah ha, I see you stated laptop and 2 additional wireless displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that most all Video cards only support 2 at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your card, for instance, has 3 ports on it, you can connect 3, but only use 2 at a time. you have to disable one and enable the other.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can purchase a Card for PC that supports 3 at a time or use technology like ATI/AMD CrossfireX that allows you to run 2 video cards and then maybe 4 displays or more if cards support more than 2 at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But a laptop, I seriously doubt you will get more than 2 connected at a time. In display settings when your connect the 2 wireless along with laptop display, does it show 3 display icons such as this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fa36089-d832-4c28-b364-7f825d627173?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fa36089-d832-4c28-b364-7f825d627173?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure after each settings for each display you select APPLY below the icons on each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can almost guarantee that little laptop will not use 3 at one time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Maybe but I doubt, "Never did this on a Laptop for 3", you can disable Laptop Display and use 2 wireless displays, and obviously one will be your main with your taskbar etc, or you can select to show taskbar on both displays in the same display settings
 area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all 3 show, (or even just 2),&nbsp;then select a wireless as main display, extend display to desktop, APPLY, then disable the laptop display, then try connecting the other wireless display and select extend display to desktop and APPLY, restart pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Seahawks65, thank you for your time.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some tests with another laptop. If I connect one monitor with the MS wireless display adapter and the other one with an VGA-cable I can get my three (2 external and a laptop) displays to work. So I think my video card can handle it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can't get to work is connecting two wireless display adapters at the same time. I can connect to each seperate. But when I already connected to one of them and try to connect to the second one. Windows automatically breaks the connecting with the
 first one while connecting to the other one. (I hope this explenation makes sense).</p>

<p>It makes sense, if you can 3 wired with that laptop, but not 3 with 2 wireless, then I suggest to plug in one and wireless one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it probably is thinking that using the same encryption key to connect one, that the next one is using the obvious same key for the 2nd one, therefore it assumes it is only one display. Kind of like using a splitter for example off a VGA port from 1 to
 2 displays, all you will get is a mirrored image of the 2 because there is one port and 2 displays connected via splitter, therefore it can only produce mirror and not extend as separate displays on&nbsp;same port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I think about it, makes sense you can only connect 1 wireless at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck and Take Care!</p>

            It would be like connecting your X-Box or phone twice with the same encryption key, only&nbsp;one can connect as they are both of the same with the same E-Key.

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I hope somebody can help. My PC (which is 6 months old and&nbsp;uses Windows 10) suddenly crashed with a BSOD (error message: kmode exception not handled) and when it restarted, it was installing a Windows update (this was a few days
 ago so I assume it was KB3172985). After that, it kept&nbsp;crashing and restarting every time Windows started - at random any time between the first Windows logo showing up, and about a minute after login. I'll list the error codes below.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">None of the Repair Options worked: the command line crashed the system again, System Restore crashed with a "whea uncorrectable error", Startup Repair failed. After managing to save the minidump files (by repeatedly restarting until
 I had enough time to do it before the inevitable crash) but failing to fix the problem, I formatted the hard drive (through a Windows install DVD) and reinstalled Windows. Unfortunately, even this didn't fix the problem!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Running Ubuntu from a Live CD works fine, so it doesn't seem to be a hardware problem. I spoke to a Microsoft Answer Tech on chat who suggested buying Windows 7, which is obviously less than ideal. Could anybody help to get Windows
 working again? I'm currently left with a very expensive operating system that refuses to be used!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Below is a list of error messages that I have seen. I'm happy to post the minidump files if that would help.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">kmode exception not handled (sometimes said "intelppm.sys")</p>
<p class="contentStandard">kernel security check failure</p>

            <p>Hi Deepika, thanks for offering your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions,</p>
<p>1. I built the computer. The parts are: Intel i3-6100 processor; Asus B150M-A D3 motherboard; Kingston hyperX DDR3 RAM; Sandisk ultra II solid-state drive; Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I wifi card; BenQ VW2245z screen; and some other peripheral stuff.</p>
<p>2. No, I cannot boot to the desktop. I tried again a few times, and it always crashes with either a bluescreen or just restarting itself. This happens within the first few seconds, so I haven't got past logging in.</p>
<p>3. Only Windows 10 is currently installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Startup Repair like you explained, and it goes through diagnosis and attempting to repair, then gives the message: "Startup Repair couldn't repair your computer". It says "log file:" underneath but there's no more text after that. I've tried it a few
 times for good measure, same result each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know where to go from here to get Windows working?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any ideas at all (I mean, I'd prefer it if microsoft didn't release updates that totally broke things, but I'll take any advice too :-) )</p>

    <title>My computer got stuck a few minutes after reboot, windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loufrancois  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer got stuck a few minutes after reboot, windows 7.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
My computer got stuck a few minutes after starting for the last hours (operating system: Windows 7 service pack 1).<br />
In fact a problem similar has happened for a few months ; I had realized that if I left my computer idle (without touching the keyboard for around 10 minutes) it would jam and I would be compelled to turn it off with the button switch on-off, to turn it on
 again (when rebooted it used to ask me which reboot mode I prefer, I choosed normal mode and it always rebooted without any problem).<br />
But now the computer always jams after a few minutes (even if I'm active on the computer) and, when rebooted, it often goes through a new screen that stipulates that the computer is checking the file system on c: that the type of file system is ntfs and so
 on. Then it starts normally but very soon afterwards (whether I am in the explorer, I do nothing or communicate on Skype for about one minute ...) the computer jams.<br />
What could be the problem and what can I do ?<br />
Thanks for your help. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This could suggest either a hardware driver issue or corrupt system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first check to make sure all drivers are updated for your chipset, video and other components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any non-essential hardware attached to your system, try disconnecting them to see if makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned Windows prompting you select an option when booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try performing a startup repair to see if it corrects the problem.</p>

<p>I don't have any&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">non-essential hardware attached to my system.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I tried the last 'with network' and it works without getting stuck ! But the screen is different (different resolution etc.) which sounds me logical as it is not the normal mode,</span></p>

<p>This will not resolve your system hang problem (not enough information) but just so you know what is going on with the restart and file system checking...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the power button, reset button, pulling the plug/battery to get a hung up system going again are of course and should be the last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result sometimes the NTFS (NT File System) will get some slight corruption as a result and the Windows volume becomes "dirty".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows starts it automatically checks the dirty bit on all volumes and if any volume is marked dirty Windows will run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) to see about fixing the problem.&nbsp; It usually works to clear the dirty bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why you saw chkdsk running and that could take a long time to complete depending on the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the chkdsk finds to do.&nbsp; It can take a long time but always let it finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean run of chkdsk with error correction is the only thing that can clear the dirty bit on a volume so if you see chkdsk running on every reboot the dirty bit is not being cleared which could be a sign of a hard drive failure.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the dirty bit will never clear and you can tell Windows to stop checking the afflicted volume (to save your boot time) but if the dirty bit won't clear I would be suspicious of the volume and replace the drive or reassign it to other duties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the command prompt window with Administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter the following:<br />
<br />
cmd.exe<br />
<br />
Right click cmd.exe and choose to Run as Administrator:</p>

</p><p>To query the dirty bit on drive C, in the Command Prompt window enter the following command:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sample output should be one or the other of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C is NOT dirty<br />

You should check each of your volumes or each of your hard drives (C, D, E, etc.).</p>

<p>Thanks you for your answer. I didn't answer it previously as I have been a little bit accidented and was blocked in a bed. I am still out of home and I don't have access to my computer for the moment. So still can't test your solution to answer you. Nevertheless
 I hope to be able to test it within less than one month as I should be able to come back home in the next weeks. Be sure that as soon as I will be at home I will test your answer. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            WIndows Explorer keeps crashing with  a link WER9B8F.tmp.hdmp but when i look in the temp folder i do not see the file&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    WIndows Explorer keeps crashing with&nbsp; a link to&nbsp; WER9B8F.tmp.hdmp but when i look in the temp folder i do not see the file???<br />
My files are not hidden so not sure i have been having issues with Explorer for a long time even tried a&nbsp; new install but no good.<br />
<br />
Main issue is it stops allowing me to drag in desktop but this affects other programmes like Photoshop when dragging images around. I have to stop Explorere and run it again this 90% times works.<br />
<br />
In relation to it crashing this is when i right click and copy paste to other folders. This time it restarts itself.<br />
<br />
Would love to find out what is causing this issue.<br />
<br />

    <title>Task Scheduler &#58; repeat &#47; duration not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task Scheduler &#58; repeat &#47; duration not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On Windows Vista Business SP1.</p>
<p>Creating a task in task Scheduler, to run daily, repeat every 1 hour, for a duration of 12 hours. It runs *every* hour (i.e. throughout the entire day).</p>
<p>Googling (or should I be Binging?) the issue seems several people have reported a similar thing, but I can't find a solution or a Hotfix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there is a Hotfix or whether there's something in SP2 about this.</p>
<p>I'd heard Vista was a crock of you-know-what, but I find it hard to believe that something as basic as this isn't working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have/heard of a fix or workaround (that isn't "amend the task you are running to check the time and exit... if I wanted to write my own scheduler ...! )</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 settings will not open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emmabeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 settings will not open</h2>
                    <p>Since a recent update I can no longer access the Settings; not through the Action Centre and not through the Start menu.<br />
I've searched for solutions and tried them all: startmenu.diagcab, appsdiagnostics10.diagcab; I've also created a new administrator account through Command Prompt and it doesn't open in that account either.<br />
The Settings window does open briefly and only shows a giant gear icon, but I can't interact with it and in a few seconds it closes itself.<br />
I've found a way to access the Control Panel so I can do most tasks that would have required me to access Settings, but one giant problem remains: I can no longer access Windows Update and that causes security problems. I have checked and it seems Windows Update
 does not work if the Settings app is broken.<br />
So my question is twofold:<br />
1- is there a fix for me to access Settings?<br />
2- if not, is there another way to access Windows Update?</p>

                    <p>Original Title: "Set device as default communication device" -- Not working, wtf?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me and my friend both have Logitech G90 headsets. We both have the EXACT same configuration and are both running the exact operating system; however, the sounds aren't playing for both of us the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want ALL of my sound to come out of my built-in monitor speaker; however, I want to be able to communicate with him via Google Hangout using my headset. Therefore, within my sound configuration, I have my monitor set as my Default device, and I have my
 headset set as "Default Communication Device".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works for him, but ALL of my sound goes out of my speaker, including communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what else I can check to figure out why it's working for him and not me? This is very annoying. It's like "Set as default communication device" doesn't even work or something.</p>
<p>

<p>Ideally it's not possible to play the sounds at the same time from speakers and headphone because on Windows you can only&nbsp; set one device as default to play sound.</p>
<p>As far as the sound playing from both Monitor built-in speaker and headset on your friend computer, there could possibilities that he has installed any third party software or&nbsp;amplifier which can help to get the sound from both the devices at the same time.&nbsp;
 I would request you to check&nbsp;regarding the same with your friend and let us know&nbsp;about it.</p>
<p>Using third party software, can be&nbsp;possible to get the sound from both the devices at the same time. Windows doesn't have this feature.</p>

    <title>Taskbar acting weird after waking W10 up from sleep mode several - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sungkp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar acting weird after waking W10 up from sleep mode several times.</h2>
                    <p>Using W10 way back in November 2015, didn't have this problem until this year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The title explains my problem. If i put W10 in sleep mode then wake it up, the problem doesnt appear, but when i repeat that several times the taskbar starts to act weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does the taskbar do when I encounter the problem? Read below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: If i hover over something in quick launch, it will always stay highlighted making it annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: Same as second problem, except with apps that has a window preview. If i hover over an app that has window preview like Discord, the preview will stay up until i hover over another app or click on it and minimizing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3: The taskbar seems to override everything on my screen. I can't play fullscreen games like Cities Skylines, TF2, CS:GO without the taskbar getting in the way of important things (money and stats in Cities, ammo and health in TF2 and CSGO). I can't even
 show you proof for the last 2 problems above, because the taskbar even overrides my screenshotting app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: The problem auto-fixes if I restart the computer, but after some time of W10 getting put into sleep and waking up, it returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any of you have the same problem? And if you need my computer specs, here you go:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home (Korea, fully up to-date) x64</p>
<p>Intel Core i3-7100 Dual-core (It has 4 threads for some reason) 3.90GHz</p>
<p>4GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>Intel Graphics 630</p>
<p>PLEXTOR 1TB SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: This also happens in my other laptop. It is fully updated too afaik, but suffers from Windows Rot. I don't think the rot could have caused this problem, as the origin PC where it happened is almost fully clean, only some games and apps installed.</p>

<p>It says that the installation has failed, and mentions something about the resources. The error codes might be helpful to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1 takes me to the home page of Microsoft. It doesn't help me do anything.</p>
<p>Step 3 and 4 I have tried on the laptop, but no results. I think it might happen in this PC too, so can you come up with another solution? Thank you very much for trying to help.</p>

    <title>Error 0X8007000e from Windows Update failing to install Creators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron hewett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0X8007000e from Windows Update failing to install Creators Update version 1703</h2>
                    <p>I have a mini PC running Windows 10 Home 32bit. It has 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SSD. I do little on the PC by way of apps, it primarily acts as a print server on my home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 13 April Windows Update installed 'Windows 10 Creators Update Privacy Settings KB4013214". On the first reboot after that, the bootup stopped with error "The Group Policy Client failed the signin. Not enough storage is available to process the command".
 However when I retried the error did not occur and I logged in successfully. Subsequent shutdowns and reboots did not have this error.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>On 17 April (today) Windows Update has failed 8 times to install "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703". Error code 0x8007000e (which I understand is supposed to indicate insufficient memory) is associated with these failures. A shut down, reboot,
 then Retry the update failed with same error code.<br />
</p>
<p>I have just run Speccy with no other apps running, just Windows, and it shows what to me seems adequate Physical Memory, although maybe Virtual is a bit minimal. It shows Total Physical Memory of 1.94GB, with Available Physical of 925MB ; Total Virtual of
 3.39GB and Available Virtual of 784MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to increase Virtual Memory with Win 10, so if that might help, a response telling me how to do it would be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings-Storage shows 16.4GB used out of 28.9GB, so disk storage also seems to me to be adequate. There is also a microSD card with 9.96MB used out of 14.8GB. Doesn't look to me as if disk space is causing any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas of how to fix whatever is causing the 0x8007000e error would be welcomed. It looks to me like the Update on 13 April managed to zap something in the Registry but hey, I'm just paranoid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ron</p>

            <p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow and got&nbsp;“Windows Resource Protection found corrupted files and successfully repaired them” . Hit Retry for the update, error 0x8007000e.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I rebooted, and ran sfc /scannow again. This time, "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations'. Shutdown and rebooted. Then hit Retry for the update. which was still showing error 0x8007000e. This time it went into 'checking for
 updates'. It then said 'There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this, and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80080005)". &nbsp;I hit Retry again. It again went into 'checking
 for updates'. Same result ... 0x80080005</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not looking good to me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ron</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 0x80080005 appears to point to Registry errors so again I suspect the Update applied on 13 April.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2 Tried running DISM.EXE and "The restore operation completed successfully". Shutdown and rebooted. Hit Retry again. Again 'Checking for updates'. Then same '0x80080005' error</p>

</p><p>No 3rd party security software, no 3rd party firewall. Windows updates are definitely getting installed up to and including the 'privacy settings for Creators Update' update. As a curiosity, I cannot get anything to happen when I now (that is, since I started
 getting errors) try to display update history.</p>

<h2>            My Windows 7 &#40;32&#41; PC Does not post after reboot, must unplug to work &#40;not a hardware issue&#41;</h2>
                    My desktop PC does not post after a reboot.<br />
<div>When I shut down or reboot the PC, it goes through the normal shutdown procedure and then makes a weird&nbsp;whining&nbsp;sound and then appears to shut down.</div>
<div>If I am rebooting the PC, it does not restart.like it should.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I try to turn on the PC after this, it will not POST. &nbsp;Everything seems to be on inside of the PC, but nothing happens. &nbsp;Just a blank screen</div>
<div>The computer POSTS and boots normally only after I unplug the machine for a short time, and then&nbsp;re-plug&nbsp;it back in.</div>
<div>I ran into the same issues when I shut down in the Safe mode or after a&nbsp;Diagnostic&nbsp;start up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen posts on various sites with a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;complaint. &nbsp;The experts on those sites tend to conclude that it is a hardware issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know it is not a hardware issue because:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;Windows 7 from scratch. &nbsp;It shut down and booted normally after that until after I installed one of the updates (I can't tell you which one, it was around the 5-6 time I rebooted during the series of updates)<br />
I then ran into the same problem as before where I need to unplug the PC in order to POST and boot.</li><li>If I was to turn off the computer, or when it crashes/freeze to the point where I need to turn it off, it will POST and boot without me having to unplug the PC</li></ul>
I think there is something going on with the shutdown where it is not shutting down all the way.</div>
<div>I also think it is the result of one of the updates</div>
<div>I am out of ideas to fix this. &nbsp;As a stop gap measure, I ran an extension cord with an on/off switch from the PC so I don't have to climb behind it to reboot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            <p>Sorry, but a computer which will not post on a reboot definitely has a hardware issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post/boot process is completely independant of ANY operating system and, at that point, the computer is just looking for anything to boot, whether it is on a&nbsp;local hard drive, a network location or a CD/DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to run memory&nbsp;and hard drive tests from bootable media.. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both tests run ok, you have motherboard issues. First, try replacing the battery. It probably won't make any difference but batteries are cheap..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go into BIOS and disable some of the peripheral devices like network adapters, printer ports etc. Disable one at a time.to pinpoint what is going wrong. If you find nothing, the problem on the motherboard is beyond anything that you could replace with a
 3rd party device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I did all the tests above, or&nbsp;equivalent, before submitting the question.</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>I replaced the boot drive and &nbsp;unplugged all extra hard drives and USB devices without help.</p>
<p>I re installed&nbsp;the BIOS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The reason I believe it is not a hardware issue is because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The PC POSTED and booted just fine when during the clean install of Windows 7and each of the first 6-7 reboots when I was installing the updates.<br />
These were the only times ever the PC POSTED and rebooted without an issue over the past few months.<br />
This makes me believe that an update is preventing the PC from shutting down correctly.</li><li>If I press the off/off or reboot button to turn off the computer instead of shutting it down. &nbsp;The computer will POST and boot without me unplugging the PC. &nbsp;<br />
The same goes if the PC crashes, I can POST and reboot without unplugging the PC<br />
Turning off, or rebooting, the PC off via the Start Menu and the PC will not POST and boot without me first unplugging and re-plugging the PC.<br />
Again it makes me think something is wrong with the shutdown.</li><li>The computer POSTS and &nbsp;reboots just fine after I run a stand-alone CD ROM such as a Norton Ghost Recovery Disk, Windows 7 Recovery Disk or a Memory test off a CD ROM.<br />
Again it makes me think that something is wrong with the shutdown process in Windows 7 on my PC.</li></ol>

            <p>But the initial boot process is totally independant of what Windows has done or will do. Only the hardware and BIOS chip are doing anything at that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes me wonder about the power supply in your computer. Is it up to the job?</p>
<p>Use this to determine if you have enough power for all of your components.. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.coolermaster.outervision.com/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.coolermaster.outervision.com/index.jsp</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should have between 50 and 100w of spare power. The wattage on the label can only be maintained for very short periods and should not be seen as the target wattage..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that the calculator assumes that the power supply is in good working order and delivering the voltages while dissipating the heat generated as set by the PS manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ensure that it is not full of dust and that the fans are working properly. Overheating within the power supply is a distinct possibility, and it may have partially damaged some of the interior components..

That was what I thought until I ran into this mess.
<div>Why would a PC not POST only after an (attempted) Windows Shutdown, yet posts in every other condition?</div>
<div>And why did it Post after a Windows shutdown all the times during the Window install and the first 6-7 reboots while installing the updates?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could it be that the computer isn't really shut down and it is in some sort of&nbsp;weird&nbsp;sleep/hibernate mode?</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the power supply:</div>
<div>The calculator shows that I need a 730W Power Supply to run my system.
<div>I have a Topower PowerBird 1100W Power Supply.</div>
<div>I think I am reminded of that each month when I see the electric bill.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I&nbsp;regularly&nbsp;air-blast and dust the PC..</div>
<div>The PC has heat sensors inside that do not show overheating....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next suggestion??</div>
<div>Thanks for your help BTW...</div>

<div>I am out of ideas to fix this. &nbsp;As a stop gap measure, I ran an extension cord with an on/off switch from the PC so I don't have to climb behind it to reboot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any ideas?</div>

<p>But the initial boot process is totally independant of what Windows has done or will do. Only the hardware and BIOS chip are doing anything at that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

That was what I thought until I ran into this mess.
<div>Why would a PC not POST only after an (attempted) Windows Shutdown, yet posts in every other condition?</div>
<div>And why did it Post after a Windows shutdown all the times during the Window install and the first 6-7 reboots while installing the updates?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could it be that the computer isn't really shut down and it is in some sort of&nbsp;weird&nbsp;sleep/hibernate mode?</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the power supply:</div>
<div>The calculator shows that I need a 730W Power Supply to run my system.
<div>I have a Topower PowerBird 1100W Power Supply.</div>
<div>I think I am reminded of that each month when I see the electric bill.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I&nbsp;regularly&nbsp;air-blast and dust the PC..</div>
<div>The PC has heat sensors inside that do not show overheating....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next suggestion??</div>
<div>Thanks for your help BTW...</div>

            <p>I have recently come across a computer which would not boot properly and would freeze for no apprent reason once it was up and running and bluescreen occasionally. BIOS did appear but required 'F1 to' continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reseated everything including the processor,&nbsp;changed out all of the drive cable connections, replaced the CMOS battery and updated BIOS. Then tested RAM and hard drive and still it baulked at BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event viewer showed a mass of errors all related to being initially brought about by faulty hardware. In particular, there was a constant DHCP error which co-incided with the client accessing mail. Disabling the integrated NIC saw the&nbsp;error disappear.
 I fitted a 3rd party NIC and now the client computer doesn't freeze when accessing mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The faulty integrated NIC signifies issues with the motherboard, and the fact that none of the other errors have gone suggests the same. It still occasionally baulks at BIOS boot but at least the freezing issue has gone. The other motherboard errors relate
 to the drive controllers, I think. Windows says they are working. Well of course they are otherwise Windows wouldn't be. The drive controller issue is intermittent and not driver induced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The client, who is 84 yrs old by the way, has decided that she can live with the 'F1 to continue' until such time as F1 no longer continues.. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While your issues are not quite the same, you should be looking in this kind of area</p>

Won't agree with that!<br />
<br />
I am still using Windows XP and Windows 8.<br />
After changing the mobo it tooks a longer time to get XP working well. <br />
It does but with the same result like described at start of the thread.<br />
With XP after shutdown I have to unplug the PSU to get into the POST process.<br />
<br />
When I'm using Windows 8 (same HW, same HDD) the PC is working well =&gt; shutdown works well, power on also.<br />
<br />
So there is "something" at the operating system (Windows XP in my case) which do "something" at the Motherboard!!?? I have no glue what...<br />
