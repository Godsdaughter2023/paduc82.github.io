    <title>Why do windows minimize randomly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why do windows minimize randomly&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 7 has been doing this right out of the box 16 months ago.&nbsp; I place the cursor where I want to type and take my hand off the mouse.&nbsp; Just as I move my hand to the keyboard, the window disappears.&nbsp; When I move my hand back to the mouse the window
 reappears.&nbsp; This happens in Word, Outlook, Internet Explorer and Firefox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact it just happened when I tried to fill out this form. It has nothing to do with the touchpad since I keep that disabled.&nbsp; At one point, someone sent me an applet to disable
 Aero Shake.&nbsp; That seemed to work for a while, but the problem returned.&nbsp; Reinstalling the applet didn't help.&nbsp; Dell claims not to know anything about this problem, but&nbsp; I have heard of others, so it can't be unknown to Microsoft.&nbsp; I'm using no other peripherals,
 and Dell just sent a tech to replace my keyboard and touch pad.&nbsp; That fixed a lot of things but not this problem.&nbsp; The problem does seem to be worse now

<p>Not enjoying it as much as the first one, wall running isn't as fluid, jump pack doesn't feel right, too many times came face to face with enemy Titan and here no where to run. So far the first Titanfall is the better game, and this has put me on the fence
 on buying it.</p>

<p>^ That's what I'm reading Mark</p>
<p>A lot of people saying it has server issues ( ok just a beta but why for the Xbox version they not use cloud servers? )</p>
<p>People said the last COD felt like Titanfall, now the new Titanfall feels like COD.</p>
<p>Had no interest in it anyway. After these comments even less</p>
<p>I'm hoping my MP fix this year will come from the new Battlefield, fighting on horses, come on what's not to like :-)</p>

            Hi, TerriCastillo
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you check these methods to repair any Windows problem.
<br />
<br />1.- Run System File Checker (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>) or SFC to fix any system file corruption from the resident component store.
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD (<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-command-prompt-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-comma...</a>)  execute the following command:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />This does not require Internet access.
<br />If this not help, you may need to repair the Windows Component Store itself.
<br />2.-  To do this, you need to Run DISM. (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-command-line-utility-repair-windows-10-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-com...</a>)
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD execute the following command:
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />This will fix any system image corruption from a Windows Update source. This may require internet access.
<br />This should resolve all issues.
<br />3.-  Additionally if you feel, you may run SFC again.
<br />This will fix potential system file corruption from the new repaired component store and verify that DISM was successful in repairing the errors.

            Hi Terri.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What was connected in the living room?  A TV?  By Bluetooth?  Go into Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth and find it, highlight to Remove.  
<br />
<br />If not then take a screenshot of the message in Action Center reached by choosing the box at the right end of task bar.  Here's how:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>

<h2>            Choose Your Keyboard Layout Problem</h2>
                    Today I went up to start up my PC, and I was given a screen that said, "Your PC has run into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and we'll restart for you." Right below that, it states that the error is "CRITICAL SERVICE
 FAILED." When the PC restarts, I'm given a screen that says "Choose your keyboard layout", and it shows various keyboard layouts. Now, I don't have any cursor, so I can't select any layouts. Please help!

            <p>One successful fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem after upgrading to Windows 10. &nbsp;You may wish to try the below procedure--it worked for me and I believe it should work for others regardless of prior Windows version (7, 8 or 8.1) or hardware configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an unaffected computer, go to the following web site and, following the instructions under "Option One," to "create installation media for another machine" (i.e., a bootable Windows 10 Installation USB Flash Drive). &nbsp;A 4 GB Flash Drive was in fact
 sufficient for my 64 bit requirement (3 GB was required).</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-usb-flash-drive-create-install-windows-10-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Flash Drive will be a bootable drive capable of either installing Windows 10 (bad) or rolling back to your prior operating system (good). &nbsp;Don't be dismayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the affected computer: &nbsp;If you are stuck on the "Select your keyboard language" screen, turn off your machine by hitting and holding the power key until the machine shuts down or briefly disconnect if from the power source to shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a cold start, enter your BIOS setup page and check your boot sequence priorities to ensure that USB has a higher precedence than your hard drive. &nbsp;On my computer, you enter BIOS by pressing the power on button while simultaneously holding down the Delete
 key until the BIOS page appears. &nbsp;Find the "Boot Sequence" option, highlight it and click enter. &nbsp;Follow your intellect or the instructions to ensure that USB has a higher boot precedence than your hard drive (I recommend 1) USB, 2) CD ROM, 3) hard drive).
 &nbsp;Escape back to your BIOS home page, save your BIOS settings and exit BIOS then power off the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert the USB Flash Drive into a USB socket and power on your machine. &nbsp;You should now boot from the USB and not from your hard drive. &nbsp;Select the repair option, not the install. &nbsp;Under Advance Options is a tab to restore your previous operating system.
 &nbsp;When I selected that, the computer went to a turquoise screen with a little dot thingy that went in circles and the words "Restarting." &nbsp;Of course, this being a Microsoft product, it did not in fact restart my machine but sat in an endless state of "restarting."
 &nbsp;After a couple of hours I decided that the machine was not going to restart without user intervention so I &nbsp;hit the restart button on the front of my machine and simultaneously pulled out the USB drive. &nbsp;This forced the computer to boot from the hard drive
 upon which it largely successfully reinstalled my Windows 7 operating system (CCleaner, Quicken, Internet Explorer all work but my Game Golf application requires reinstallation and troubleshooting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now back on line and testing my various applications to which software went awry in the process. &nbsp;My files are intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps--I'm only half a geek and an older guy and some of the above was by memory (I didn't want to go back through the process again to verify precisely what the screen shots read). &nbsp;My golf buddy's daughter is highly placed with Microsoft and
 I intend to share with her my opinion of what has become a routine experience with newly launched software from Microsoft. &nbsp;At least I didn't have to pay for this version...</p>

<p>So I just recently got the game and this is the first time I've bought a GTA game and for some reason I can't access GTA Online. My access is on adult, I'm on energy save mode, and I have decent internet. What do I need to access GTA Online?</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by "everything." If you literally mean "everything," you probably can't; it would be much too difficult to do things like delete all the registry entries that have been added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to mention that that trying to delete "everything" could be a very dangerous thing to do. You well might end up with an unbootable computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you want to do this? Are you planning on selling or giving away the computer? If so, two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It would be much easier, not to delete everything, but&nbsp; just to do a clean installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>2. If I acquired a used computer, no matter how I got it or who previously owned it, the</div>
<span>
<div>first thing I would do with it would be to reinstall the operating</div>
</span><span>
<div>system cleanly. You have no idea how the computer has been maintained,</div>
</span><span>
<div>what has been installed incorrectly, what is missing, what viruses and</div>
</span><span>
<div>spyware there may be, etc. I wouldn't want to live with somebody</div>
</span><span>
<div>else's mistakes and problems, possibility of kiddy p00rn, etc., and I</div>
</span><span>
<div>wouldn't recommend that anyone else do so either.</div>

</p><p>If preinstalled, you can also&nbsp;contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available (Most don't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive and you can Boot into Windows, you should be able to make and have&nbsp;your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System in case of Hard Drive failure.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>

<h2>            Surface pro international warranty</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the Surface pro have international warranty?</p>
<p>The unit will be bought in the USA and the warranty might be used in Sweden. The device is sold in Sweden.</p>

            You MIGHT be able to get a Swedish replacement if needed if it is sold there officially by MSFT. But you won't be able to get a US Surface. And you would have to escalate a couple of levels to do that.

<p>No. If the device is sold in U.S, that's where the warranty is valid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions and I'm sure you would be able to get it serviced outside the country too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>We would like to get a little more information from you to help troubleshoot your issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please answer the following questions as best you can.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>When was the last time it was working?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span>
</li><li><span>What is the type of Keyboard and mouse you are using?</span>
</li><li><span>What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might have to check the mouse settings if the right click option is been disabled.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Unplug Power and Wi-Fi Stops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judahb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Unplug Power and Wi-Fi Stops</h2>
                    <p>I updated my aunt's HP Pavilion dv6&nbsp;laptop from windows 7 to 10 a couple weeks ago, and she started having the problem that when she unplugs the charger it cannot connect to the&nbsp;Wi-Fi. Over the phone, the only way we could find to fix it was to restart the
 computer with the charger in, and then the internet would continue working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested it out in person and it does not stop working immediately when unplugged. To jump start this, I turned on and off airplane mode, and the wireless would not connect. When I go to Settings&gt;&gt;Network &amp; Internet&gt;&gt;Wi-Fi, the switch is turned off, but
 when I click it to turn the Wi-Fi back on, it shows a loading icon and shuts back off within a second. The physical button for Wi-Fi corresponds to Airplane mode, and is on when I've tried connecting the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this issue would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried all the trouble shooters and have tried updating the network driver, as suggested by this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/wifi-wont-turn-on-windows-10/2f8a311b-baf0-4842-b0c3-5b0f295528a2?tab=question&amp;status=AllReplies#tabs</p>

 than my computer and I cannot find a proper way to remove the network, otherwise I would have tried that. If someone knows a safe way to attempt that and has a better explanation than in the page I mentioned, that would also be great.</p>

</p><p>I have never done this method before, so I am unsure of the validity. There must be a better option. My theory is that the device is turning off the Wi-Fi driver whenever it unplugs and does not turn it back on. This seems a ragged response to this problem,
 so I am hoping there is a better option.</p>

            My fix actually does not help. The computer still looses WiFi when unplugged. I will probably revert it back to windows 7, but do you have an other ideas?

            <p>Hello Judah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted and we really appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I suggest you to reconfigure/reinstall the drivers for the network adapter with the latest versions available.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer to the manufacturer's website to look for updated drivers for your&nbsp;network adapter&nbsp;device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it still does not help, install the drivers for the network adapter in compatibility mode for Windows 7 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to your
<strong>manufacturer’s website </strong>and download the <strong>Driver’s setup </strong>
file for your computer. <strong><br />
2.</strong> Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>on your desktop screen to go to run box.
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and hit Enter. <br />
<strong>4.</strong> Under Driver, expand, then right click Display adapter and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. <br />
<strong>5. </strong>If you are prompted to Confirm then <strong>Confirm</strong>.
<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Go to the location where you had saved your downloaded setup files of the drivers and right click, then select
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Properties</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.
<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong>. <br />
<strong>8.</strong> Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode
</strong>and select the operating system </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accordingly from the drop down list. <br />
<strong>9.</strong> Let the driver to <strong>install</strong> and then check the functionality.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Once you uninstall the drivers the network adapter device will be disabled and you wont be able to connect to internet. So it is advisable to keep all the installer files as a back up in your hard drive.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hope it helps this time.</p>

            I have seen this on several laptops of varying makes and models.&nbsp; It is not a driver problem nor does the power management feature mentioned above.&nbsp; I thought the latest creator's update (1709) would address this, but it clearly does not.&nbsp; Also, this does
 not only happen when you disconnect from a power supply, but happens randomly.&nbsp; It would be nice if Microsoft could remedy this problem...

            Hi I see you are having the same problem as I was. Sorry for posting 2 years later but the solve for this problem is to right click on your battery icon then go to "Power Options" under selected plan click on "Change plan settings" then click on "Change
 advanced power settings" After press the little plus sign on the left of "Wireless Adapter Settings" and the little plus sign on the left of "Power Saving Settings" under "Wireless Adapter Settings" then right click "On battery" and change it to "Maximum Performance"
 it should be the first option that drops down when you right click "On battery". Once you change it to "Maximum Performance" you should have no problems with your connection while on battery. I really hope this helps again sorry for 2 years later reply and
 I also hope that anyone else having the same problem sees this.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for your effort...</p>
<p>But. When I get to "After press the little plus sign on the left of "Wireless Adapter Settings"" I am stuck, for there is no such thing. No Wireless Adapter Settings.</p>
<p>Mine is evidently an adapter issue, and I am keeping it at bay by stopping any update. This way my Surface runs fine. It is not a definitive solution, but so far I haven't got a better one.

            <p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Browsers keep all websites that you have accessed unless you delete the browsing history. Edge and Internet Explorer can keep the history of the accessed websites up to 999 days. To configure the settings, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Internet Options</strong> then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Browsing history</strong>, click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>History </strong>tab.</li><li>Adjust the number of days if necessary.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To import Windows Live Mail emails to Mozilla Thunderbird, please refer to these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Export emails from Windows Live Mail in .eml format.</li><li>In Mozilla Thunderbird, create a folder on "Local Folders" and select it.</li><li>Right-click the folder and select <strong>ImportExportTools</strong> &gt;<strong> Import all messages.</strong></li><li>Go to the .eml files folder. The default location for Windows Live mail is C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail. You may also need to change the folder option to "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" to be able to see the "App
 Data" folder.</li><li>Click <strong>Open</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, to import Windows Live Mail contacts to Mozilla Thunderbird, we suggest performing the following:</p>

    <title>Trying to add a shared printer on a network - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to add a shared printer on a network</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed Windows 7 64 bit and I'm trying to add an hp deskjet 970Cse printer that's been shared on my corporate network.&nbsp; I went to HP's web site and looked for the appropriate Windows 7 64-bit driver to download and found there isn't one, that
 it is supposed to be built into Windows 7 and that Windows 7 should find the driver automatically when I add the printer, which it doesn't seem to be able to do, at least for this shared printer.&nbsp; I moved the printer and physically connected it to my Windows
 7 system and W7 was able to install the correct driver.&nbsp; I then put the printer back on the system on which it belongs and was still unable to connect to it through the network.&nbsp; I went through HP support to try to get them to send me the driver so I could
 point to it manually to get the printer installed that way but after much back and forth, they refused to do so.</p>
<p>The system on my corporate network on which the printer is physically connected and installed is a system running Windows XP 32-bit with service pack 3.&nbsp; On my own W7 64-bit system, I go to Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Devices and Printers and select
 "Add a Printer".&nbsp; I then select "Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth pinter".&nbsp; It searches and says "No printers were found" so I click "The printer that I want isn't listed".&nbsp; In the next dialog, I choose "Select a shared printer by name", select the Browse
 button, navigate to the system with the printer installed and select the printer.&nbsp; The correct printer share name is then displayed in the edit control and I click "Next".&nbsp; I get a message box with the caption "Windows Printer Installation".&nbsp; The message says
 "Connecting to hpdeskjet on NADPAYNE" on the first line and "Looking for a driver" briefly on the second line before the message changes to "Checking Windows Update.&nbsp; This might take a while...".&nbsp; It continues for a little bit then displays a second message
 box with the caption "Connect to Printer" and the message "No driver found.&nbsp; Windows can't find a driver for hp deskjet 970c series on the network.&nbsp; To locate one manually, click OK.&nbsp; Otherwise, click Cancel and consult your network administrator or the printer
 manufacturer's website."</p>
<p>Is it possible to add this printer to my W7 64-bit system when it's shared out by&nbsp;a WinXP 32-bit system?&nbsp; If yes, how?<br />
<br />
Thx.</p>

            I knew I should have waited just a few more minutes before submitting this question!!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I answered this question myself by using different words when searching for a solution.&nbsp; I had used "network printer" not "shared printer".&nbsp; When I searched using "shared printer", I found the following link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/20dd9436-f336-499a-80cb-c194e68dacf1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/20dd9436-f336-499a-80cb-c194e68dacf1/</a><br />
<br />
for Windows Vista printing to shared Windows XP printer.<br />
<br />
This solved my issue which in a nutshell is that you need to set up shared printers (as opposed to network printers) by telling the system that you are adding a local printer, create a new port for it and use the full shared name of the printer to which you
 want to connect, then tell the system which printer it is.&nbsp; The link above shows the steps.<br />

<h2>            Unable to open documents from the USB Flash Drive since upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have been through the Q&amp;A posted on the forum and I can't find the actual issue I&nbsp;have when trying to work through the resolution to regain&nbsp;access to documents on the USB Flash Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 today from Windows 7 and am unable to access the documents on my USB flash drive.&nbsp; I have logged in as the administrator and still not luck.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error msg is as follows:&nbsp; <em>Word cannot open document; user does not have access privileges.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I have searched for answers and most point to Properties and&nbsp;Click on Security tab.&nbsp; The problem is the
<strong>Security tab DOES NOT exist.</strong>&nbsp; The following Tabs are displayed: General, Tools, Hardware, Sharing, ReadyBoost, Customise.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help as otherwise I will probably need to revert back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

            Hi  Antonino
<br />
<br />Is it the second hard drive or the bootable media that BIOS does not see?
<br />
<br />Did you swap that hard drive over onto the same SATA Port as the other drive was previously connected to?

<p>Is the second hard drive&nbsp; does not see, because I have disconnect the boot disk. Both hard drive are connected on the same SATA port, but as I said the boot drive is disconnected.</p>
<p>I have just plugged the cd/rom with the operating system and the hard drive where I'm trying to install windows 10 64 bit.</p>

<h3> chasw98  say:</h3>
<h2>            NBC online video does not play</h2>
                    I cannot get NBC online video to play.&nbsp; The pages load and the video only show the progress circle. Sometimes the video progress starts by itself and sometimes I have to press the play icon before it starts . The icon goes and goes and there is no activity
 shown on the modem after the initial page load.<br />
I have tried to view videos using a link from my Hotmail account which is accessed from the tile screen. This gives me a split screen. The video does not play with the split screen or when I widen the screen.&nbsp; My laptop has a 14" screen.<br />
I also cannot get the video to play when I use IE 11 from my desktop. I am using Win 8.1 with all the latest updates. I even loaded Silverlight but did not get a different result. I also have the Media center loaded on the laptop (just FYI).<br />
To view the NBC online video I have to use older Windows operating systems.<br />
I will appreciate all suggestions.

    <title>Changing default log in account to microsoft store - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changing default log in account to microsoft store</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem hopefully I can explain. When I click on the app store from my HP laptop the default account is not one that works (I created it in error by mistake!!!) and it pops up with a screen saying please re-enter password for the Store giving
 the e-mail address which is not&nbsp;a valid address and therefore has no password to enter. There is no obvious way to change or delete this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have to shut this window and click on the icon next to the search bar to bring up my account details (which are still incorrect) I cant see how you delete this and replace with my actual Microsoft account. If I click on settings, account, manage your
 devices it takes me straight into my real working Microsoft account... </p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, it automatically logs me into a false account every time I click on the app store and prompts me for a password which doesn't exist and I need to work my way through to get to my actual account... but I cant find how to delete the incorrect
 account and make the working account my default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as this is highly frustrating!!!</p>
<p>

            <p>Are you using a local account for Windows 10 login? If yes, go to Users in Settings and click on Use Microsoft Account Instead. Then enter you correct account details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are already using a Microsoft account for login to computer, you might still go to Settings -&gt; Users and from there, click on Use Local Account. After creating the local account, open the Store app. It will ask you to login. You'll have two options:
 Change entire user profile to Microsoft account which I recommend and the other option would be to use Microsoft credentials only for the store. It's your call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should fix the issue. Please let me know if it doesn't. </p>

<h2>            Bait and Switch on the Windows Store Site.</h2>
                    I have been checking the &nbsp;Microsoft store (and other stores)&nbsp;a few times each day checking on the availability and price of the Surface 2 -32.&nbsp; Microsoft has been sold out for over a week. This morning I checked&nbsp; Microsoft and found the price of the Surface
 2 -32 lowered $40.00. But it was sold out again. So I chatted with a rep who said the item was sold out and no rain checks are available. I asked why would they lower a price on the Surface 2 if it was sold out ,&nbsp;unless they were using&nbsp;&nbsp;bait and switch tactics.

            JD, This morning they escalated their campaign to alienate customers. On Saturday morning, I bit on the Surface Pro Bundle offer. (If you want to skip to the punchline, go ahead and read the last few lines; meanwhile, I will relate events in the order
 that they happened.) I ordered the 256GB pro model along with the screen cover, Office 365, warranty, and discounted touch cover. I had been watching the online MS store for days, and the inventory kept showing "out of stock," so I was surprised (and happy)
 to see on Saturday morning that so long as I bundled, I could order a Surface. I remember saying to myself, "Aha! They held a few back a few tables to fill this holiday deal." Then I finalized my order and noted within a few hours and over the next few days
 that the tablet itself was on back order. (Note, however, that they were going to go ahead and charge me for and send all of the useless accessories and allow me to download software.) I thought, "Okay, what the ****. I should have ordered e

            <p>I decided to purchase the NOKIA 2520 from Verizon (att has them too) for $499. off contract ($399. on contract). The show on TWIT.tv, Before You Buy, gave this a buy and said it was , in the reviewers opinion, better than the Surface 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I was buying the Suface Pro, which really is a different breed of animal than Surface or that very nice Nokia you purchased.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will function like an excellent tablet.&nbsp; I am going to need the active stylus and legacy application support of the Surface Pro.&nbsp;
 Like you, I have now gone elsewhere.&nbsp; Unless Best Buy is playing the same sorts of games that MS is playing, I can expect a Surface Pro 128GB (not the one I REALLY wanted) to arrive at my house by Christmas or very soon after.&nbsp; Now my only question for the
 MS rep. will be, "Does that extended warranty you sold me apply to this Best Buy purchase, or should I get a refund on it?"&nbsp; Or, on the off chance that they decide to complete the deal that they authorized and gave me an order number for (instead of sticking
 to their cancellation), I can return the Best Buy purchase and take the 256GB version from MS.</p>

            I ended up buying both. &nbsp;Several reviewers have commented that they don't like the feel of the type cover when folded back. &nbsp;Furthermore, some have reviewed the new touch cover favorably because they find that it performs beautifully for them because of
 the new sensory array. &nbsp;I think it must depend largely upon how one types. &nbsp;I should know which one I favor within a few weeks.

            True. I only tried first gen type cover. Felt like I was typing 70% speed with crazy typos. Tried for about 6 months then never went back. Minimal extra thickness.

            You would have to reinstall the operating system onto E drive to change hard drive locations. Did you happen to run a disk cleanup at all?

<br />Try using the disk cleanup to clear up any space;

            <pre>Making your E drive the the primary boot drive will not help. What you need to do is free up space on the C drive.
Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.

Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<br />Make sure you have checked System files option after the first scan.
<br />Also, 
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
