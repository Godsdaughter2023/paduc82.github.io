<h2>            Intel &#40;HD&#41; R Family Graphics doesn&#39;t want to work after windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to windows 10, I tried connecting to a TV using the HDMI cable, but realized that it says cannot connect to projector, try using another device or something close to that sorry I can't remember. So anyway, I went to the Device Manage and
 saw that my Intel R (HD) Family Graphics has a code 43 and doesn't want to work. (Has a yellow triangle with exclamation mark in it). I've tried the following:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstall it and try scanning for new hardware change&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Downloaded the Intel auto scanner for new updates and searched but got nothing</p>
<p>- Downloaded the Intel R (HD) Family Graphics latest update for windows 10 from their website and installed it, but still have the problem</p>
<p>- Searched for anything for windows 10 from the Lenovo Yoga 2 website&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Service Request taking too long for XBox One accessory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yo punisher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Service Request taking too long for XBox One accessory replacement&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>Why is it taking too long for Microsoft Service Center to mail me a replacement power brick supply?</strong></span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;I got my Xbox One on launch day. <strong>The PSU (power supply unit) lighten orange and then it died on me without me even turning on the console!</strong> I was so disappointed because I wanted to use it just in time for Thanksgiving.
<strong>I made a service request and mailed it Sat, November 22th</strong>.<br />
It arrived according to UPS Tracking at Service Center's HQ in Laredo, Texas in that afternoon on Tue, November 26th.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>23 ACTUAL days (16 business days) &nbsp;has been and I have yet to get my replacement!</strong> I live in North Texas, like an 8 hour drive.&nbsp;<br />
I have not received a confirmation e-mail and all I get from Xbox Support Representatives is just vague answers. After Monday, it has officially broken the record in replacing a Xbox item. Previously I had 3 Xbox 360
<strong>CONSOLE</strong> repairs made in only 18-23 days (timing including sent and return shipment).
<br />
<strong>This [Xbox One PSU] is just an accessory, not hard to just send me a new one within 5-10 business days I have already shipped it.<br />
</strong>I get the Thanksgiving holidayand&nbsp;the recent "winter" storm but I am losing faith on Microsoft products and services by each passing day!&nbsp;<br />
Normally, <strong>I should of already received my PSU replacement within December 5-11th.<br />
<br />

<p>Yes but I was afraid the "Advanced Exchange" program only covers the Xbox Console Unit, not the accessories that come with it. It is unfair however that I have to shell-in 15 extra bucks to send the power supply unit and expected a quite or reasonable shipment
 return but the AE program let's only the console-faulty users to ship the console for free and get it within the week. I feel like that is unintended DISCRIMMINATION. If I paid the same price as the ones with a faulty Console we should deserve a piece of that
 pie. Enough Said!</p>

<p>I forgot that I could not have exchanged at Best Buy because they had it sold out. Now, the 3rd way of release will come by christmas and yet I have yet to experience the console! what about the other guys that had the Advanced Exchanged program eligibility!
 Once again, that is not fair! Well I finally have a return shipment for my PSU and the damage as a loyal customer has already been done.

<p>Yo Punisher, When did you finally get your replacement Power Supply? &nbsp; And did your actual on-line service request ever get updated to reflect that it actually shipped out? &nbsp;I have the exact same issue, I sent mine in on the 27th of November, it was received
 at their warehouse in Texas at the beginning of December, and I am STILL waiting for my replacement PSU. &nbsp; It broke an hour into using my new console. &nbsp; And the more I call phone support or chat support, the more annoyed I get, as they have NO ANSWERS. &nbsp;They
 just keep telling me to " keep waiting, and that "we have it covered" and even worse "maybe it shipped and the online service center just doesn't reflect that". &nbsp;Really?? &nbsp; I was annoyed I had to pay to ship it back in the first place, now this is just gotten
 ridiculous and will be a month or more before I get a new Power supply. &nbsp; </p>

<p>Yes I got mine like almost a month after I send it in, I don't understand why I did not get a free 1-month Xbox Live membership but I would of expected something for waiting that long.</p>

<p>Just be thankful you got it at all. My PSU died December 17th. They still haven't sent one and I'm stcuk waiting for an escalation to the advocacy team that never happens. They've given me plenty of XBL time, but that's like giving me free gas cards when
 my car is still in their shop. If I don't have a car, what can I do with the gas? If I don't have a working Xbox One, how can I use the XBL time?</p>

<p>My xbox one stopped turning on 3 weeks after i got it. &nbsp;I returned to the xbox one and got a letter back with it saying no problem found. &nbsp;Tried to turn it on same issue. &nbsp;I returned the PSU, with me paying the expense of shipping, it was received by them
 on 2/25...I still do not have a replacement. &nbsp;Support is no help, "this is escalated to the Advocacy team" this is with a manager "we have no record of receiving it" you should have it in the next 4 days.. on and on and on and on. &nbsp; I have chatted with about
 10 reps and no PSU still.... VERY FRUSTRATED.</p>

<p>Hi Kentarou,</p>

</p><p>Windows 10 supports aptX connection as it has the necessary codecs for the said connection. To make sure that you get the best out of your Surface Book 2, remember to keep it updated. Read more about updating Surface and Windows by going

<h2>            Windows 10 apps error code 0x8000FFFF</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this error code everyday on the Store App, Xbox App, and even Edge won't connect to the internet. If I reset (power cycle) my modem/router, these apps are able to connect again, but they will fail again later. What is wrong with these Windows 10 apps?
 Anything not Microsoft connects to the internet with no problems (Chrome, Steam, Origin, Nvidia updates). I haven't changed any settings on the TalkTalk router/modem, my Xbox One and PS4 connect online with no problems too.</p>

            Ran the troubleshooter and it tries to reset the windows store cache but fails. It states the Windows store cache may be damaged. Running WSReset.exe also doesn't fix the issue.

<p>Really?? I have moved from Apple to Microsoft and starting to regret it. I have never had to go through all these steps to correct an App that should just be working in the first place! Please provide a patch.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. It suddenly occured some weeks ago. I sync my contacts towards a gmail account. I don't know if that is the problem? Have Google changed their API or something lately? I doubt it since I can still edit contacts
 in my Android phone and from Thunderbird email client which also syncs with Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens on different computers and also on my girlfriends so it is not isolated to a particular installation.<br />
Common factor is Windows version 17763.379 (even if it happended before that) with people app version 10.1812.10232.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparantly a bug in the app itself or some other dependency failure. Resetting and/or resinstalling the app do NOT help.
</p>
<p>I don't know how to escalate this. The only forum I know is the Feedback Hub but I don't think that is taken seriously since too much rubbish is written there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I can create, save and sync a new contact but I can't edit it. The field "Other info" works but not "Add Email", "Add phone" etc...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to Rename the <strong>Windows Update components folder</strong> and try to install the updates once again.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It turns out that some invalid registry entries residing at this location might be related to user accounts that no longer exist on your computer, so removing them should do the fix.</span></p>

            It is <span style="font-style: italic">extremel</span>y unlikely that you need to replace the hal.dll and since there are seven files on the XP installation CD that will expand into hal.dll, which one would you choose?&nbsp; It depends on your hardware, but
 that is <span style="font-style: italic">extremely</span> unlikely to be the problem (did I already say that?).&nbsp; I have never had to replace a hal.dll file for this problem.<br />
<br />
The real problem is more likely that XP just can't find the file either because of some file system corruption or an afflicted c:\boot.ini file.<br />
<br />
For that error, I would always first boot into the XP Recovery Console and run a chkdsk /r... - sometimes that will fix things right up.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If the chkdsk /r runs clean and you have the same problem, then rebuild your c:\boot.ini file but rename the old one first so you don't build on top of the afflicted one - this tidbit is missing from the MS KB article which assumes too much.<br />
<br />
You can do all this from the XP Recovery Console, but do go through those Methods in that KB article and see how you get on.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
For example, <span style="font-weight: bold">Method 1</span> will not work if your system does not boot.&nbsp; Maybe you will have better luck with the other "Methods".<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work out, then I would suggest providing a little more information about your system:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack? (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

    <title>Resource Monitor not showing any disks after installing new drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruce bracken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resource Monitor not showing any disks after installing new drives</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 7 installed on an SSD with two additional internal HDDs (all SATA II). All disks worked fine, all showed up in My Computer fine, and all displayed properly in the Resource Monitor.</p>
<p>Due to a lot of video editing, I decided to add additional SSDs to my computer,&nbsp;so I ghosted a new SATA III SSD with the Win7 OS disk data and plugged that into my Rampage III Extreme SATA III slot, added a second SATA III SSD to the other slot, and kept
 the old SATA II SSD and HHDs all on the SATA II slots.</p>
<p>After ghosting the new SATA III SSD with the OS drive data, I ran Windows Recovery to allow for it to make the final necessary fixes so it could become the new active boot drive. I also changed drive letters around to accommodate my new drive setup and preferred
 priority.</p>
<p>All of that worked flawlessly - all drives show up in My Computer and work as expected (though the SATA III drives perform slower than I anticipated), but the problem is that now, in the Resource Monitor on the Disk tab, NONE of the drives appear.</p>
<p>Why did all the disks disappear in the Resource Monitor, and what can I do to get them back again?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Bruce Bracken,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from the issue, how are you doing today?</span></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with the resource monitor not showing up any disks after installing new drives.
</span><span>This can be really frustrating for you and I appreciate the efforts that you have put in. Let us work together as a team and try to get this issue fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method -</span></p>
<p><span>Ghosting the install to the other drive might be the reason as to why the resource monitor does not show any drives.
 This also might be the reason for the slow performance since the trim service might not be running.</span></p>
<p><span>Re-installing Windows normally should resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Nirmal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond. The whole reason I cloned the OS drive from one to another is so that I don't have to re-install Windows from scratch, along with the many other applications, preferences, workflows, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate learning how to make the Windows Resource Monitor, and the Windows trim feature, all work properly on my cloned drive so that I don't have to spend the next 4 days re-installing everything from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bruce</p>

            <p>Never heard back about this, and I was forced to take the excruciating route of re-installing the OS from scratch, and then a few days of reinstalling programs and setting up preferences. What a pain. It's unfortunate that Windows 7 monitor resource breaks
 so easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you have created a bug in your system to get this fixed.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem on my desktop... and I didn't even clone the system drive. Don't know exactly when this happened, but I know I was working with drives around that time. I did add 2 (defective) disks that I want to scan, and my laptop drive and a
 new SSD because I wanted to clone the laptop drive to the SSD (the previous attempt with Clonezilla failed, and Windows on the desktop complained that both drives had the same ID or so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop drive and SSD are gone, hopefully when I remove the defective drives it will revert back to normal. If not that would be quite a bummer... any idea how to fix this without reinstalling the system? I would really rather not have to do it, it would
 take more than a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop, based on the Core 2 Duo T8100 doesn't display the individual drives either, never has I think. So I was under the impression that it depends on the features of the SATA controller perhaps, and that old machines just didn't support it.</p>

<h2>            My Computer won&#39;t sleep or hibernate</h2>
                    For some reason my computer suddenly won't hibernate. I'm using Windows 8.1 and suddenly on Thursday I've noticed that my computer won't go into sleep mode or hibernate. I have my display, sleep, and hibernate timers set to 10 minutes, but only my display
 will turn off. If I restart my computer it will hibernate once than not do it again unless I set my timers to one minute each than it will hibernate. I have used Command Prompt and entered "powercfg -requests" and it shows that nothing is keeping my computer
 up. What is going on?

            Hi Jason, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />Turn off Fast StartUp or On depending on how it is set now to see if that helps.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low-level chipset drivers, and the major onboard device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />Note using Win Key + X and Win Key + W (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings as needed). Win Key + D calls the desktop and the using  Win Key toggles Desktop and Start Screen.
<br />
<br />Check Startup Programs. Use the Clean Boot to see if that helps. If so it is a process of elimination.
<br />
<br />Right Click in the lower left-hand corner - Task Manager
<br />Or WinKEY + X - Task Manager
<br />Or Right Click the Taskbar - Task Manager
<br />
<br />Check the StartUp tab.

            So I refreshed my computer and that seemed to solve it. But now it's doing it again after my HP Support Assistant said I needed to download a Realtek audio driver update.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>There's not a really good answer to this unless you notice that the battery life is a lot shorther now than when you first purchased the machine.</p>
<p>Computer manufactureres say that batteries in laptops&nbsp;are parts that suffers from wear, therefor there is only a 1 year guarantee on it, opposed to the computer which may have 2 or 3 years warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a battery reaches 3 years of age, very often it will shown sign of wear as in rapid discharge, and the computer suddenly shutting of even if it's 10-30% battery life remaining. When those events occur, it's time to change to a new battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since your computer is from 2008, and I assume you haven't replaced your battery since then, I would say it might be time to change it, but if you don't&nbsp;experience any of the symptoms I described above, or that&nbsp;doesn't bother you, there is not need to replace
 it yet.</p>

The answer was in there all along. If you know what you're doing, turn off UAC while you replace the files. It's as simple as that. And no, there is no way to modify the paging file pagefile.sys while Windows is active. If you are not happy with it then you
 must do whatever you wish to do while Windows is not active, e.g. while in Repair Mode or when booting the machine into Ubuntu. Note that whatever change you make to it, Windows is likely to undo it at the next reboot.<br />

<h2>            Windows Firewall in Windows XP Keeps Turning Off By Itself</h2>
                    Recently (last week or two) I have been having a problem with my Windows Firewall turning off by itself.&nbsp; A red shield appears in the Systray with a message that the firewall is turned off and no longer protecting the computer.&nbsp; I either click on this
 message which takes me to the "Security Center" or go to the Control Panel "Windows Firewall" icon and turn the firewall back on by clicking the "On - Recommended" radio button.&nbsp; But within an hour or two, I get the same red shield warning that the Windows
 Firewall is back OFF.&nbsp; Seems like if I am working on the machine, this happens a couple or three times a day.

            I have XP Professional and the firewall keeps shuting itself off. I have gone all the way through the Windows instructions found at<a href="http://help.live.com/help.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.live.com/help.aspx</a> including uninstalling Window Live One Care and
 reinstalling. I was so happy until the next day when the same thing happened all over again. Today both the firewall and virus protection had turned themselves off. The good news was that I was able to get them back on after about 10 minutes. I emailed the
 windows&nbsp;support for&nbsp;help and they linked me up here. What's next?

 it would turn itself off.<br />

            I've ran the Wise registry cleaner, and while it does find stuff and fixes it, the firewall problem is still there. I keep running the windows malicious software removal tool, malwarebites antimalware, and the regular security center scan with no success.
 A few weeks ago the firewall pop-up that says it's off came on and I got a virus in the time it took me to enable it. More advice on what to do about this?<br />

            <p>It started right after the last automatic update.&nbsp; The conspiracy theorist in me has to wonder: &nbsp;MS ends support for XP this year - could this have been planted to make people upgrade to Windows 7?&nbsp; Causing a problem for XP users might make them spend the
 money for a Windows upgrade to solve the problem.</p>
<p>If they really care, then they'll correct whatever caused this problem with the next auto upgrade.&nbsp; If they don't, then I may be right.</p>

    <title>Unreasonable situations with communication ban - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sage anubis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unreasonable situations with communication ban</h2>
                    I was banned from communications today and its been hell. The reason i was banned to begin with was a couple guys playing Rainbow 6 were being toxic so when they spammed party invites and started messaging i replied to them in the same manner. Yet i was
 the one to get banned? How does that make sense? I figured it was no big deal, i could just contact support and get it situated in about half an hour. Boy, i was wrong. Apparently you have to jump through hoop after hoop to even contact the enforcement team.
 Almost like they dont even want you to be able to reach them. I started filling out their questionaire and it was riddled with oddly worded questions, even a few trick questions. Why? I wasnt even upset at first but all this is just irritating. A small issue
 that couldve been resolved in minutes is now turned into a pain in the <strong>[Mod Removed-Profanity]</strong>. Apparently the support team isnt even allowed to contact the enforcement team? Whats up with that? Ive never seen such a lack of transparency between
 microsoft and their community. This is just unreal. I love microsoft, i love xbox, ive played for as long as i can remember, other than this you guys are doing an amazing job. All i want is to get this issue resolved, it doesnt make sense that the toxic people
 on xbox can now use the report button to give people this hard of a time. I though that was meant to stop them?

<p>Looking about a bit - looks like it works fine in web browsers that are not "Edge" (Firefox, Chrome, etc.) if you mean "AdBlock Plus"...

            With my SP3 Pro, when I first connected to a TV via HDMI, I had same problem and the thing that fixed it for me was adjusting the 'ratio' setting on TV, no PC settings had any effect, this worked for me, (over 12mths now).
