<h2>            I need help</h2>
                    <p>Hello;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently i have began having trouble with the typing cursor/indicator moving to the left and a auto scrolling problem when i move my mouse. I have managed to fix the issues for the most part following other answers but it still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i decided to uninstall and reinstall both my keyboard and mouse it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i looked into my devices &amp; printers i saw EL2IN1-1102T </p>
<p>Status: unavaible</p>
<p>Status: Driver Error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i trouble shooted the device what came up was</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does not have a driver:</p>
<p>which lead to this: Problem with PnP devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unknown Device: Driver not installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;I applied the fix presented to me by the trouble shooter and that error still shows up</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have already uninstalled and reinstalled windows and did several virus scans. The only other thing i could think of that may have caused this was when i accidentally spilt water on my keyboard but i took a towel to it and left it upside down for a while
 and did a keyboard check.</p>

            okay I managed to fix everything other than the auto scroll. I used a keyboard tester and found multiple keys on my board were activating the home page key

            okay it looks like I have fixed auto scrolling and typing indicator/cursor thing; what I did was go around and through the settings and disable everything that had to do with the back ground and turned filter keys on. I have not had this problem for a
 long time since doing this. so it appears all my issues are fixed now.

<h2>            Kid&#39;s account not appearing under Permissions of my Windows Account</h2>
                    I have created a child account (with Microsoft account) for my son on a laptop with Windows 8.1 installed but his account does not appear under Kids' accounts when I log onto my Microsoft account (the one I used when setting up his account on the laptop).
 How can I set up parental controls?<br />

            Thank you for the reply but it doesn't help. My child son's account does not appear under Kids' accounts under my account, so I can't setup parental control. The information in the link you provided does cover this.<br />

<h2>            how to virus scan with dos prompt</h2>
                    i have a dell cpu with xp home which turned into a black screen after a suspect download. after that no way to boot up without getting an error message that the cpu has detected a problem and is shutting down to avoid damage.&nbsp; i managed to get my cpu to
 boot to the dospromt using my dell os install disc and did a chkdsk -r.&nbsp; the next suggestion was to do a virus scan. my question is how do i do a virus scan on a cpu with only a dosprompt access. (hd is 160gb)<br />
thanks

            You are in the Recovery Console, not DOS. There is no DOS in XP. You can't scan for viruses from the Recovery Console. You would need to either boot with one of the rescue CDs offered by some of the antivirus companies or use a Bart's PE with plugins.
 Another method is to pull the hard drive from the infected machine and attach it to a working XP box and scan from there. I don't recommend doing that because there is a chance of infecting the host machine.<br />

    <title>HDMI Port on Laptop not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> subsquentual  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Port on Laptop not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is a MAJOR problem that I've had recently, and I have searched the internet for possible solutions.</p>
<p>And none of them seem to work. Here's a quick debrief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time that my HDMI port on my computer worked, it was around Feburary-March when I went up to a friend's house to stay a few nights. We watched some movies through my computer on the television that they had, and I didn't get a single problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't really need to use my hdmi cable after that, not until now anyway. And now, it refuses to work. I went to ANOTHER friend's house to hang out and watch movies, only to find that my cable would not work on either of their tvs. She even had a second
 hdmi cable, brand new, we opened it from the package that day, and it didn't even work. Needless to say, I was kinda upset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have 2 different hdmi cords. One is the standard with the hdmi on both sides of the cord. Another is an hdmi on one side, and the red, yellow, and white rca jacks on the other, to allow you to connect to older televisions without their own hdmi
 port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both wires on multiple televisions, none of which is working. One tv remained on static, however when I would change the brightness on my computer, it changed along with the television as well. I would say it is the cables, but I know for a
 fact that the normal hdmi one worked before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my video drivers, as another solution suggested, but it did nothing for me. I do not have any restore points back to when it last worked unfortunately, and I've gone through every display setting I can find that relates to video output. I'm at
 a loss...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 7 Dell, model N5050. It has a 64-bit operating system, and its processor is Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU B950 @ 2.10 GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, IT USED TO WORK PERFECTLY! I had my own cool tv for a time and I used it all of the time with my computer. Until my sister sold it when I moved out because I couldn't get it in time. So I know that it used to work. Sometime between February and
 currently, something happened. I doubt it's the old hdmi cable because I used two of them on the same televisions with no fix. The RCA cable may be bad, i really don't know because none of the cables are working. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            System and Compressed memory makes my games lag by eating up memory.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem with this **** System and compressed memory thingy, it's using all my ram lol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i'm gaming tomb raider im getting lag spikes every few minutes, using a remote monitoring software, I can see on my phone that it keeps using the page file.</p>
<p>And each time it does that, it lags, lol.</p>
<p>Further checking with task manger, i find the culprit, it's the dreaded System and compressed memory service, just hogging over 6GB ram, just the same as tomb raider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can i ask this service to just **** off and let me game in peace? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2flinustechtips.com%2fmain%2fuploads%2femoticons%2ftongue.png" height="20" width="20" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for my system specs:</p>
<p>xenon x5660 @4.7ghz</p>
<p>3x 8GB Crucial ddr 3 1600mhz @ cas7</p>
<p>p6tdeluxe</p>
<p>samsung 840 pro ssd.</p>
<p>CF 7950 @ 1ghz core, 1380 memory. ( Struggling with heat, lol)</p>
<p>Corsair HX1050.</p>
<p>Shitloads of fans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with my specs and amount of ram, it shouldn't be a problem. and my windows 10 install is just 4 months old, and i'm not running many programs in the background either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing i can think of,is primocache which is using 6gb of my ram for caching, although i should still have 18gb left &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas folks? i'm about to throw my pc out of the window x)</p>

</p><p>Hey there, I was wondering if there's a way to reverse the third step without using my previous registry backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having a similar problem as the OP like two months ago and someone in another forum gave me the same recommendation you wrote in your third step, naturally I backed up my whole registry before doing it and it worked great.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I no longer play the game that I did this for, so I wanted to re-enable memory compression, but turns out that, I don't know if it's because the backup is so old and I installed more programs between the day I made the backup and now (therefore the registry
 was edited multiple times) it won't let me use my backup. I can manually locate those two lines in the registry but I'm not quite sure what to set them at to re-enable memory compression.&nbsp;

<p>That's what my friend did. It worked... but then we ran into more issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all unrelated, but if anyone else has had these issues, please chime in.</p>
<p>&nbsp; First off, he told his computer to remind him to install Windows 10 later. He was immediately prompted to restart his computer. He did and Windows 10 installed even though he told it to remind him at 3pm (Started at 11am). Said issue happened and we resolved
 it with said solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now Task Manager never refreshes even if you manually refresh it, Ethernet and WIFI are non-existant in task manager, and running ANY application causes Windows 10 to stop responding. and the entire screen to tint white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He's having our friend who built the computer come over later and see if he can fix his space heater because that's all it is right now. Worse case is he will format the rig and but 7 back on.</p>

            <p>I have this problem. &nbsp;As an interim fix, turn off wifi or flip the airplane mode before you power on. &nbsp;After you have logged in you can turn Wifi back on...just note this will happen again if your screen is set to autolock.</p>

    <title>Trouble with Surface Pro 4 and external displays on a docking station - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble with Surface Pro 4 and external displays on a docking station</h2>
                    <p>Bear with me and don't jump to conclusions.&nbsp; The conclusion I'm inclined to jump to is there's something wrong with the docking/charging port on the Surface Pro 4 in question, but let me explain the behavior I've seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Surface Pro 4 doesn't seem to like the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>Back in November, the device was still on the 1703 build of Windows 10</p>
<ul>
<li>It would lock up and the screen would go blank when connected to one Surface Dock</li><li>On a second Surface Dock, the external monitor would blink in and out rapidly</li><li>*If I remember correctly, it also wouldn't charge while connected to those docks, but worked fine with its normal AC Adapter</li><li>Both docks worked fine with several other Surface Pro 4 and "New Surface Pro" devices</li><li>The user had one of the vertical/drop-in docks from another Surface he owned and the Surface Pro 4 charged and drove an external monitor just fine with that docking station</li></ul>
<p>Earlier this week, the system stopped showing the display on the Surface itself while docked (in the Surface 3 Dock)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you went to Display settings, it would show both displays (although the Surface one was tiny), but would be set for "Show only on 2"</li><li>If you told it to "Extend these displays" it would ask you to confirm the change but revert to "Show only on 2"</li><li>After replacing the user's system with a "New Surface Pro" and Microsoft Dock, I removed the Surface Pro 4 from the old style dock and the Surface Pro 4 display did not turn on<br />
</li><li>I powered the unit down by holding the power button and the Surface display came back on the reboot (thankfully)</li><li>I connected the Surface Pro 4 to a dock at my desk that has worked fine with several other Surface devices, but external displays connected to the dock would be recognized, but with a tiny square and attempts to "Extend these displays" would revert to "Show
 only on 1"<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9450db4d-6111-4e2a-966c-befff9262405?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9450db4d-6111-4e2a-966c-befff9262405?upload=true" /></a></li><li>(The docks have been upgraded with the Surface Dock Updater tool - most recently with Surface_Dock_Updater_v2.9.136.0.msi)</li><li>I applied the&nbsp;SurfacePro4_Win10_15063_1801001_4.msi firmware &amp; drivers for the 16299 build - no change to docked display behavior</li><li>I upgraded to the Fall Creators Update - no change</li><li>I applied the&nbsp;SurfacePro4_Win10_16299_1801001_0 firmware &amp; drivers for the 16299 build - no change</li><li>I've tried different cables, active display adapters, different monitors - all work fine with multiple docks and multiple Surface devices, but this Surface Pro 4 will not work with an external display on any Microsoft Dock</li></ul>
<p>Other devices on the dock work.</p>
<p>A display is detected when connected to the dock, but it doesn't show the proper resolution and will not identify or be put into service.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the docking/charging port isn't connecting on all pins?</p>
<p>This seems like a physical problem rather than a software problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a diagnostic tool that will verify the connector is making contact on all pins?</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.&nbsp; I ran it successfully, but it did not find any issues (nor did it fix my issue).&nbsp; The nearest Microsoft Store is over two hours away, so that isn't a practical solution.&nbsp; I initiated a support chat
 and was told to try resetting the device.&nbsp; That seemed reasonable as I would need to clear it before sending it in anyhow (the support specialist said that would be the next step).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did the reset:</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Reset this PC &gt; Get started &gt; Remove everything &gt; Remove files and clean the drive &gt;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After the reset, there are significant problems that keep me from even testing the monitor/dock situation.</p>
<p>(Was this because I had moved to the Fall Creators Update?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't open Settings.&nbsp; If I right-click the desktop and pick Display Settings I get a window:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>ms-settings:display&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action.&nbsp; Please install a program, or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A run of sfc /scannow and the&nbsp;Surface Diagnostic Toolkit did not help (no Edge browser, but I could run IE from the Start menu to download the tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it looks like it's going in for replacement and I won't be able to find out if it was a software or hardware problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>explorer.exe&nbsp; ms-settings:display</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It may help to do that from an Administrator command line.&nbsp; Otherwise, from there you could also open Device Manager&nbsp;
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>&nbsp; to help reach the same Properties page that &nbsp; <em>Display Adapter Properties</em>&nbsp; would open for you.&nbsp; See what you have for a driver version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW others have been complaining about your symptom without a dock and I have asked if the symptom changes if you use Portrait orientation for the Tablet.&nbsp; Also, if you have a VGA alternative I would try that.&nbsp; (All as a test to understand the scope of your
 symptoms and also give you some possible workarounds.)</p>

<p>Before they agree to replace it, they will ask you to wipe and reimage. You may want to try that yourself to see if you can get past the ms-settings issue. And it may resolve the dock problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).</p>
<p>Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</p>
<p>Step 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</p>
<p>Step 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</p>
<p>If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Step 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</p>
<p>Step 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Just remove my files.</p>
<p>Step 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Reset.</p>
<p>Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).</p>

<p>Thanks for the detailed suggestions.&nbsp; I haven't been as clinical as I'd like during this investigation, and while I'm curious, I'm not sure how much more time I should spend fighting the silly thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RE:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>explorer.exe&nbsp; ms-settings:display</span></p>
<p>From an administrator command line, I get a window titled "explorer.exe" saying "Package could not be registered."</p>
<p>Interestingly (at least to me), if I type Command in the Start menu, I will be presented with Command Prompt as my Best match, but nothing happens when I click on it.&nbsp; If I navigate the Start Menu and find it under Windows System, it opens just fine (and
 gives me the Run as administrator option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep the Portrait orientation option in mind if I get back to a point where display troubleshooting is the concern.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the system reset set me back to where the system isn't operational enough to address the display situation.&nbsp; It still
 appears to have the problem as if I connect a monitor to the mini-DP port on the Surface itself, the display will mirror (without access to the display settings) and it still does nothing if the same monitor &amp; cable are connected to the dock.&nbsp; (Active mini-DP
 to HDMI adapter with properly rated HDMI cable.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say VGA alternative, do you mean using a mini-DP to VGA adapter instead of DVI/HDMI/DP?</p>
<p><br />

<p>The technician I chatted with was prepared to make the exchange, but suggested I try the reset first.&nbsp; The condition the system is in now is the result of the reset recommended by the tech, so I think I've already fulfilled that obligation.&nbsp; I'm not opposed
 to wiping and reimaging from flash, but I'm leery of taking the time and rendering it even less functional than it is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like I'll have to circle back to this later.&nbsp; The support site is "under maintenance" and the recovery image isn't downloading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

When you say VGA alternative, do you mean using a mini-DP to VGA adapter instead of DVI/HDMI/DP?

</p><p>I haven't gone that far.&nbsp; I only have one Surface adapter and use a converter between it and a VGA cable.&nbsp; It is just a suggestion in case you happened to be so equipped.</p>

            <p>Hi ok still trying to get this to work :( i downloaded ultima online enhanced client again went into safe mode and started game these are the &nbsp;messages i recieved.
</p>
<p>could not create hardware rendered&nbsp; clk ok to try software emulation,please not this will seriously degrade performance.
</p>
<p>and when i press ok&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not create game renderer please verify that your vidio card meets the minimum hardware requirements and that you have the latest drivers installed. I have Nvidia g force 8400 gs ,and last week microsoft put in driver auto.Now
 to be honest i have not a clue what all that means :( I just want this game to work, thanks :)</p>

<h3> immortalavatar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller replacement</h2>
                    
<p>A couple of weeks ago I sent in my Xbox One controller for a replacement. I contacted xbox support and they said it'll be 10 days for the turn around for the controller. I waited 10 days still no controller. I contacted xbox support again and they said that
 the controller never arrived at their facility.&nbsp; I have a tracking number to prove that it arrived there. I'm stuck with no controller for almost a whole month now and I'm still waiting for the replacement. My order number is:<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>Xbox support made a case number for the advocacy team:&nbsp; <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>

<p>Hi there, I believe the best way to get this resolved is to keep at it with phone support as they've already given you a reference number and know where it's up to etc. I don't think anyone on the forums will be able to assist you.</p>
<p>Surely if you have the tracking information that it arrived at the address they've provided it should be proof enough, if not go back to the post office and explain the situation and see if they have messed up some how.</p>

<h2>            Windows constantly trying to install update &#40;KB2656351&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have windows 7 premium.<br />
<br />
I use eset antivirus/firewall (premium version).<br />
<br />
I have windows set up to download and install as it pleases..<br />
<br />
A few days back when I attempted to shut down it notified me installing 8 updates.<br />
<br />
In the morning it is still installing, I have to go away for the weekend, when I return I am told that the machine had to be restarted a number of times before it would work correctly... it had remained untouched in it's state of closing down installing updates
 for 2 days!<br />
<br />
After that updates where installed individually.<br />
<br />
After that the machine wants to install an update every time I shut down... the (i) shield icon that appears next to the [Shut down] button that signifies windows wants to install an update during shut down now appears a few minutes after start up.<br />
<br />
I have looked through windows updates and noticed a number of update (KB2656351) being successfully installed. (states it has been successfully installed on a number of different occasions).<br />
I un-installed this update and allowed windows update to reinstall it.<br />
<br />
I have a failed update: KB915597 that is not currently installed.<br />
Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070643: Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.119.477.0).<br />
<br />
I have tried to use MicrosoftFixit.. it finds no faults.<br />
<br />
Any idea how to identify which update windows is trying to install every time I close down, and then how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />

<h2>            To Save Or Not To Save&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>What is it with those games with NO SAVE?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost all the games I bought have no save! The programmers decide for us when the game should be saved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what if I get tired and stop playing... I'm screwed! If I exit I have to start all over. Ridiculous!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it so complicated to create a save routine? DAMN!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last game I bought (R.A.W. for Realms of Ancient War) made me play for 3 hours to find out later that not even a checkpoint was saved. I have to start the game all over! This is bullcrap!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not even Batman AC (or the other one) as a save... so if I&nbsp;want to play those games, I really must be prepared to play 6 to 8 hours to make sure something will be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really feed up with this crap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arkham City has an auto-save feature, I'm pretty sure. </p>
<p>Most games with auto-save are really good at handing them out. You might lose some progression between checkpoints but nothing to warrant a 6-8 hour single session. If your time is really that limited, perhaps seek out games much more accommodating to that,
 like many of the games in the XBLA, such as Doom or Trials.</p>

<p>Sorry but Arkham City/Asylum only saves after you accomplish a major task or goal. Otherwise you always restart at the same point. Frustrating!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a game for every colors in a rainbow and the last one I got was RAW (see 1st post), an arcade game. That one was the last straw... The problem is that we don't know it until we buy it. And then, too late, screwed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course many game handle this "feature" very well but too many doesn't handle it at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell you, they find it to difficult to create a real save. A save? You want me to save all of that stuff!? You crazy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really dont know why they do things like that... But I assure you that if I'd write a game, a save with checkpoints would be my first priority.</p>

<p>I played through <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> three times, and as I recall it saves from transitions to levels as well.&nbsp; Basically, walk through a door and it'll save.</p>
<p>As an old-school PC gamer, I agree that I wish modern games would allow for real saves, as too few do.&nbsp; Checkpoint systems are good, but they're never fully adequate.</p>

<p>I actually went trough a door lately, after beating some mobs. and I&nbsp;don't think it saved anything... I was watching for the save symbol and I&nbsp;don't recall seeing it. Later I did restart at the same point and the mobs were still there. I'm gonna try again
 cause my memory is not too clear on that one. It's gonna be easy cause I always restart at the same spot!</p>

<p>He there Highbuzz! I understand you took part in a promotion to get some free points. When exactly did you redeem the prepaid LIVE code? Did you do this in the proper prompts for the promotion, or did you enter the code online at Xbox.com?<br />
<br />
Also, please keep in mind that these point codes will be emailed to either your WLID or your contact email (<a href="https://live.xbox.com/MyXbox/ContactPreferences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../ContactPreferences</a>) if you have one. They
 are usually sent between 6-8 weeks from the end of the promotional period. Please keep a look out there, including all junk, trash, and spam folders. Let me know if this helps, thanks!</p>

 for it but its noot the good deal... (thats for the thing i sucribe for my 200pts) not the redeem code... :s and I go check that... (I never recive any email out of my confimation of my 12month)
</p>
<p>Note: im in canada (and most of your promotion dot work) i dont know why...</p>

<p>Thanks for the update! The 200 points you got were most likely from the Rewards program. I don't believe this was in place of the 600 points.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, you entered the code in the proper prompt on that promotion, correct? Did you redeem the code in the usual redeem prompt on the console or on Xbox.com?<br />
<br />
Also, as for the date, can you check <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://billing.microsoft.com</a> for the exact date you redeemed the code? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Cannot find system path</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started up my computer today, and some things didn't save from yesterday. &nbsp;I redownloaded them where I usually put them (in the downloads folder). &nbsp;I try to open the application .exe download which I have done tons of times before, but I get a system path
 cannot be specified. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have done zero changes from yesterday to today. &nbsp;I can still download steam games. &nbsp;It's something with the path and I cannot find it out. &nbsp;I've googled the system variables and tried to change those. &nbsp;I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue with system path. You are unable to find the location of downloaded files.&nbsp;The issue could be if there is some third party conflict or some type of corruption. The issue could also be if some system files
 corruption or your system is affected by viruses/malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps provided below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists and you are able to login to your computer then I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />

<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and open <strong>
Accessories</strong>.</li><li>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the Program list and then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: </li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong><span><br />
If still issue persists I would suggest you to run the <strong>Microsoft safety scanner.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            GameCrush, Why Does It Exist&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just don't understand the point of this service at www.gamecrush.com, why would you pay money to play with a girl if you can just do it for free with randoms? It just doesn't feel right, why in the world does it exist?</p>

<p>InB4 someone insults Crazy like a jerk.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Because some people are dumb enough to pay for it. Their self confidence is to low for them to talk to girls who aren't paid to. It's a waste of money and made for pathetic saps.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm also fairly sure it's against the Xbox Live ToU (offering a service for something in return) the service being your time and the something being money.</p>

<p>It doesn't feel right because it isn't. It's also quite pointless making paid services in order to play with females.
</p>
<p>But of course, for it to still be around, there are obviously some idiots out there who are willing to throw away their money. It's stupid, very much so.</p>
<p>I will, however, laugh if it IS breaking the Xbox Live ToU and whoever tries the service gets banned.</p>

<h2>            CoD Ghosts message&#58; You can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play multiplayer games online</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp; my son and I both have Xbox Live Gold account.&nbsp; When he is signed in and tries to play CoD Ghosts: Extinction on Xbox Live it gives him an error saying he can't play multiplayer games online and to have his parents (me) change his privacy settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that a more specific error comes up that says "The current profile is not allowed to play on Xbox Live".&nbsp;&nbsp; When I go to his Privacy settings, there is nothing I can see that is preventing him from playing on Xbox Live. When I bring up "Subscriptions"
 it shows that he has an Xbox Live gold account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help us figure out how to configure the Xbox One so my son can play CoD Ghosts online.</p>

<p>I figured it out. &nbsp;Before changing anything I noticed that my son's Privacy settings were on Custom. &nbsp;All of the choices were to allow all content as I figured it should be. &nbsp;However he was not allowed to play anything online.</p>
<p>I changed his privacy setting from Custom to Adult, which had the same settings anyway, and then it worked.</p>

<h2>            Other User option missing to login using domain credentials</h2>
                    I cannot find "Other User" option after I had connected my laptop on the domain server. Which means, I still cannot use the Domain credentials that I supposed to login. Besides, I am able to work and login on the Desktop which I have connected directly
 on the router. What might be the resolution on this issue? im out of ideas right now.

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist, it sounds like you're experiencing an issue with the console freezing and restarting while playing games. what I recommend doing is performing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle on the console</a>. If the power cycle doesn't fix the issue you can always attempt to do a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a>. As well be advised while performing the soft factory reset it will remove the profile from the Xbox console so be sure to know the log in info. Please let me know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

                    Help please!&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Laptop (Packard Bell EasyNote TH36)'s DVD Drive (SlimType DVD A DS8A4SH) stopped reading discs and also doesn't appear on 'My Computer' as well.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Control Panel Troubleshooter for my DVD drive says:</div>
<div>'Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can understand why this happened because I recently edited the registry to delete some registry keys for MS Office 2010 (suggested by this site itself).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That means that I might have accidently deleted something associating to the functionality of my DVD drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I read some articles on this site about Using Microsoft Fix It solutions. I used it. the software downloaded and ran but at the end it says the fix cannot continue because it came across an error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me restore the original registry values or other, for my DVD drive with clear instructions.... I have a big project coming up and I have to have my DVD drive working by then....</div>
                </div>
