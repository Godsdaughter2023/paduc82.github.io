<p>Microsoft Picture Manager was part of the Office 2007 and 2010 suites - I can't remember for previous versions -&nbsp;and has been discontinued with Office 2013. If you have Office 2007&nbsp;or 2010&nbsp; installed on your PC Picture Manager should be there but not necessarily
 visible as icon on your Desktop or Taskbar or as a tile on your Start screen.</p>

<h2>            I was harrassed, so I defended myself. Other guy reports me, I get chat banned automatically by what I presume to be a bot. I report him, nothing happens. Can I get a manual review&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I (My gamertag is Astroworld02) was playing a game of Rocket League (I was having an off game, not playing particularly well), and my teammate begins spamming "Wow!" and "Okay." the entire game (This is common in Rocket League when you have a bad teammate
 and you're expressing your frustration in Quick-Chat). He then proceeded to say "See the [mod removed] on my team" in general chat (The @ was to bypass the chat filter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, obviously, I found this to be pretty frustrating. I messaged him afterwards, saying "Position yourself dude, don't just chase the ball and grab boost. I'm over here setting up attacks while you're on the other side of the field grabbing [mod removed]
 boost". I then start another game to try and forget about it and move on, I attempt to quick chat, and BOOM. Communication banned. At first, I thought it was just one day so it didn't bother me. However, upon further investigation, I discovered it was for
 a WEEK (Yes, I swore. That's on me 100%. But I swore ONCE, and I get chat banned for a WEEK? Seriously?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is to my knowledge my first infraction, so why was I communication banned for a week when he harrassed me first? The primary issue I have is he said in a message "Reported." and almost immediately afterwards, I was com banned. That's frustrating because
 that, to me, means it was an automatic bot thing when it read my swear word. The bot had no knowledge of the situation and automatically com-banned me when it saw my swear, even though he called me a&nbsp;(Mod Removed)&nbsp;and harrassed me all game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm simply asking for a manual review. I even said in the message conversation that he called me a [mod removed] (To which he replied "Totally", evidently to act like he hadn't). If you still find me to deserve this (Albeit kind of absurd) week long ban,
 so be it. But it's only fair for him to get a ban as well, if not for the same amount of time then maybe a shorter one, but still a ban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reported [mod removed] twice (Both in-game and on Xbox-live) and to my knowledge nothing has come of it. Frankly, this is probably just a petty revenge thing for me, but I want him communication banned as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As long as you reported him, the enforcement team will investigate him as well and take the appropriate action. They do not use the forums and calling out other gamers is not allowed on the forums. They also will not tell you if/when they take action on
 the other player. So even if he hasn't been suspended yet, it doesn't mean he won't be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agreed. Some people will attempt to bait you into slipping up and then report you when you respond to their bait. Don't know how old OP is, but this happens in the workplace all the time.&nbsp; You can't control other people. But you must control yourself: You
 will be held accountable if you slip up and you get reported. Some people will talk trash, and then report you for doing it back. As hard as it may be, don't say anything back to them, and report them.<br />

<h2>            MSVCP110.dll missing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So i was reinstalling windows 8 last night and bought myself a pro key.<br />
I did a clean install an installed all the updates. Then i was upgrading to 8.1 and installing updates and stuff. Then i was about to install my regular programs like spotify, steam etc.. And it shows me this error message "The program can't start because MSVCP110.dll
 is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem." So i googled a bit and found out i had to reinstall Visual C++, and so i did. But again, running this installer showed me the same error message. So i tried to install a older
 version, which worked. But it didnt solve the "msvcp110.dll missing" error. So i googled again and found out i had to install updates and stuff, so i went to windows update and installed everything. Restarted and still gives me the error when trying to install
 something.<br />
I have done a clean boot aswell, still no luck.</p>

            <p>Hello Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description I understand that you are getting error message “MSVCP110.dll is missing” while trying to install a program. There could be several reasons for causing this issue, depending on the context.
<span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you receive this error message on every program you install on a particular program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Which link are you referring to and downloading the Visual C++ file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Which version of Visual C++ is currently installed in the Computer?</p>
<p>Refer the link this through Programs and Features.</p>

<h2>            Multiple BSOD Blue Screen of Death Boot Loop - Windows 10 - HELP</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have been having a problem with my HP Pavilion g6 laptop,&nbsp;running Windows 10 (build 14361).&nbsp;I have had&nbsp;a boot loop of BSODs on it and I cannot access Windows. I have tried to make a recovery USB from another laptop of mine, but unfortunately nothing
 work. What happened was I turned on my computer and logged. Once I signed in I got a BSOD with the error code MEMORY_MANAGEMENT. I thought it was a one time error, so when I turned it back on again, I got a BSOD saying DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL and it
 said that NTFS.sys failed. It kept on doing the same thing over and over again, until I made a recovery USB and booted it up. I accessed WinRE, and I went to the command prompt. I tried to make a backup of the old ntfs.sys file and replaced it with the one
 on the Boot X:. I rebooted and got a new error. It said BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO. I opened up WinRE and I went to cmd and decided to do something that I saw on reddit. What I did was I went to C:\Windows\System32\config and I replaced DEFAULT, SECURITY, SOFTWARE,
 SYSTEM, and SAM with the ones in RegBack. I rebooted and yet I got an error saying that \Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM was missing or corrupt (something like that), and that it couldn't boot (not a BSOD). I replaced it back with its original and kept the
 others. Then I booted it up and got a BSOD saying CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. I then put everything back to normal (put ntfs.sys back to its original one; replaced those files in C:\Windows\System32\config with their originals, and I got a BSOD saying 'BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO'.
 I&nbsp;have tried to get into Safe Mode and I got the same errors. I also tried CHKDSK, but that didn't work. I have a UEFI firmware with a GPT partition table. What should I do???</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. What is happening now is that whenever I turn on the computer I am only greeted with a plain black screen. Nothing comes up. However, since I have Android installed, I can open up Grub2Win through boot device options and select Android,
 and it runs perfectly! What could be the cause?</p>

    <title>Disk use at 100&#37; &#40;lots of pagefile.sys files&#41; but memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlote wolter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk use at 100&#37; &#40;lots of pagefile.sys files&#41; but memory use at 50&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1500 with 8GB of memory running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I have 100% disk use after very simple tasks, such as opening a new Firefox window. Performance overall is very bad.</p>
<p>When I check in Task Manager I find that the biggest users of the disk are System, Trend Micro and Carbonite. And, it seems that memory use never goes above about 50% (I have two DDR3 cards of 4 GB each for a total of 8GB. All memory tests out as fine using
 both Dell's and Microsoft's memory test tools.). </p>
<p>But in Resource Monitor I get other information. The System use is mostly pagefile.sys files of various types. Sometimes four or five various pagefile.sys files are at the top of the disk use while the memory use remains at 50%. It goes above 50% only when
 I run the memory tests.<br />
So, it seems that Windows is not using all of the 8GB. Why? I have no idea, and I don't know how to change that.<br />
Anyone know how to change Windows use of memory?<br />
From all I've read, this seems to be an issue with Virtual Memory Management. However, I don't know how to do anything about that, and Microsoft offers no help under Control Panel.</p>
<p>I did reinstall the Intel Rapid Storage Driver about six months ago. Some posts suggested that might play a role, but I'm not sure how.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on disk usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>

<p>c. Click on Troubleshooting.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;On the left pane, click on view all.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:</p>

<p><span>Hi Nurul,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a feature that enables your computer to become a hotspot. This helps users to extend their signal of wireless Internet connection to
 other devices. If it doesn’t work properly, you need to refresh the connection of the source (WiFi router). In this way, it could eliminate intermittent connectivity and will return your network status like when you started using the Internet. To resolve your
 concern, we suggest that you reset your TCP/IP or Internet Protocol to its default settings. To do this, follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1:</span><span> Run the
<strong><span>Network troubleshooter</span></strong>. To diagnose your network configuration, perform the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open
<strong><span>Start menu</span></strong>, then click
<strong><span>Settings icon</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click
<strong><span>Network &amp; Internet</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the left pane, click
<strong><span>Status</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click
<strong><span>Network troubleshooter</span></strong> to diagnose and fix network problems.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #2</span><span>: Perform an Internet connection reset via Command Prompt.
 To reset your Internet connection, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press
<strong><span>Windows + R</span></strong> to open the
<strong><span>Run</span></strong> window.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type
<strong><span>cmd</span></strong>, then press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type the following commands, then press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong> after typing each commands below:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh int ip reset resettcpip.txt
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh winhttp reset proxy</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh int ip reset</span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh winsock reset</span></em></p>
<p><span>4. Restart your PC to complete the process.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #3</span><span>: We also suggest that you restart your router and wait
 for 15-30 seconds then turn it back again. Then, visit this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/c60dcfa3-c596-41d4-8c1a-b0d738e1d9fd/use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I suggest you to use the following methods and try to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: SFC Scan</strong></p>
<p><span>System file check(SFC) is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted,
 changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this please follow the article below</span></p>

    <title>Is there any advantage to upgrading my wireless router&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there any advantage to upgrading my wireless router&#63;</h2>
                    I was thinking about getting a Linksys EA3500 but don't knowi if there is any advantage with that router over my current router the Linksys E2000 router for gaming. I thought the fact that ithe EA3500 operates on both the 2.4 &amp; 5ghz simultaneously it would
 double the amount of bandwidth. Is there any advantage in getting this new wireless router? My 360 is only about 20ft away from my E2000 router currently.

<p>Well, I looked at the specs for both and they both have some similarities and differences.</p>
<p>The e2000 does use the Wireless N technology, so you should be getting standard "N" speeds. Please visit speedtest.net to check the speed of your router. I would try Wired and Wireless to see the differences.</p>
<p>The ea3500 probably has some better parts, considering that its newer, and it seems you can configure it using an app (apple and android compatible.) From the description I got this "Two spatial streams (2TX and 2RX) for 2.4G band and three spatial streams
 for 5G band (3TX and 3RX)." So you may see some speed improvements but depending on your set up, not by much, maybe, I honestly cant tell. It also has an added USB port for HD's.</p>
<p>I would say that if you need a newer router then go for it. But if you visit speedtest.net and you are getting good speeds or at least what you are paying for then stay with your current router.</p>
<p>BUT, using 5ghz (N routing) does not necesarily double the capacity of bandwidth. It just uses a different frequency and therefore is less effected by devices that use 2.4ghz (wireless routers, cordless phones, etc.) Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind when buying a new router, It depends on how fast your internet speed is and how far away your xbox is from &nbsp;your router! The closer the better. I use the Cisco861w-gn-a-k9 861w Ethernet Security Router. And I can be a block away and still
 have a great connection!</p>

<p>Internet routers can only do so much. Yes it will help, giving that your Xbox is only 20 feet away, but if you really want to upgrade your connection, I suggest looking into a different internet plan.

<p>Considering your xbox is only 20 ft from your wireless router(not sure how many walls or other forms of interference you may have), I think upgrading your wireless router would be negligible if you only plan on using Xbox LIVE for multiplayer gaming. You
 may be able to reduce latency slightly due to less dropped packets from less interference when using the new standards or using 802.11a/n (5 GHz), but that band also doesn't penetrate walls very well so your signal may or may not work at 20 ft. You also have
 to remember that when using some of these other "standards" or "speed boosts" on certain routers, they are only compatible with similar gear, so you may need to be a wireless network bridge with the same "standards" or "speed boosts" for your xbox to be able
 to use them. I think the one thing to mainly keep in mind is that the current standardized wireless rate is 55 Mbps which is usually halved actual rate so unless your actual ISP provides you with more than 22 Mbps, there would be no point of upgrading it for
 your Internet connection. </p>
<p>That being said, if you plan on using Windows Media Center on your xbox 360 to stream television or movies in HD through your own internal home network, I would recommend using wired ethernet to have the best experience because you'll be on the borderline
 of streaming HD if you're using wireless and it'll fluctuate quality.</p>

<p>Stick with an "N" standard router. Wireless N is technically a standard of speed and range. Companies like Cisco Linksys, Belkin, and Netgear limit/cap the speed that is available to you. You should pick a router based off what speed you have coming into
 your house from your ISP (Internet Service Provider). If your Xbox is not that far away from your router, you still want to make sure you pick a router that will not limit the speed coming in from your ISP, but also make sure your not picking a more expensive
 one, just because it is more expensive. If you pick a higher performance router, but the speed coming in does not compensate, then it would render the new router speeds useless. In my opinion, almost every cable internet company would not have speeds over
 what the Linksys E2500 could handle. I would say the Linksys E2500 would be a better choice for you, unless you are on a business connection, or a higher bandwidth connection, such as T1+.</p>

<p>Also, I wanted to add that having a dual-band router is also useless if the Xbox does not function on 5GHZ. If the internal network card on your Xbox 360 does not support 5GHZ, and only 2.4GHZ then buying a dual-band router would also be useless.</p>

<p>To Samuel3201 point and your question about 2.4/5 GHz simultaneous. The xbox 360 will not be connected with 2.4/5 GHz simultaneously. Your router being 2.4/5 GHz simultaneous/dual band just means that it will be able to route traffic on both the 2.4 GHz
 and 5 GHz clients at the same time, but not combine them. Think of it as the router having 2 phones and talking to 2 people at the same time as opposed to only have a single phone talking to one person, hanging up and calling another. Also xbox has only released
 wireless adapters that are compatible on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz using the standards b/g (2.4 GHz) a(5 GHz) on the old wireless adapters and then the new wireless adapters can do those other standards plus n(2.4/5 GHz).</p>

<p>@samuel they don't cap anything. That's the maximum theoretical speed wireless can send and receive under this standard. You'll always be limited by the speed from your ISP before your gigabit routers will be</p>

 understand why it took so long for them to understand that the computer had a complete power failure, and I needed to send it in.

<h2>            Windows 7 activation error&#58; 0xC004F061</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I'm baffled by an activation issue my Windows 7 is now throwing up.<br />
<br />
First, some back ground info:<br />
<br />
I bought my Sony Vaio VGN-FW51ZF 18 months ago from a reputable, UK high street retailer which came pre installed with Windows 7 Home edition. I knew I wanted some of the ultimate features so bought the upgrade to Ultimate from a different, but equally reputable
 UK high street retailer.<br />
<br />
At the time the upgrade went smoothly.<br />
<br />
A couple of months ago my laptop had a massive software failure which rendered the system useless.&nbsp; So I used my original Vaio recovery disc to format the machine and take me back to factory settings.&nbsp; That seemed to work fine.&nbsp; But my upgrade to Ultimate did
 not go so smoothly.&nbsp; Accidentally I did a full install from the Ultimate disc.&nbsp; Realising my error I reset to factory settings immediately and started the process again.&nbsp; This time upgrading to Ultimate successfully, or so I thought.<br />
<br />
I started to see the bubble pop up in the sys tray telling me to “Activate Windows”, but I now get that standard 0xC004F061 error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have since put my laptop back to it's factory defaults to try again, but no luck and I am now caught in a viscous loop where nothing seems to be working for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've looked through Microsoft help guides and I find support for people having this issue upgrading from other versions of Windows to 7, but none helping with an issue like mine. So please guys, any help you can
 give is most welcome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One final bit of information that has thrown me today: I've tried to contact Microsoft through their website but had no luck. When getting through to a person they ask for you activation code, well both my original
 Vaio Windows 7 activation code and my upgrade are classed as “not valid” so they're unable to help. Again I stress, both the laptop itself and the windows 7 upgrade are from high-street stores in the UK.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help guys. I'm really hopeful we can sort this and I get my fully working laptop back. As someone who's self employed I need to get this sorted as soon as possible.<br />
<br />

<p>However, whenever I reboot my PC back up it is still enabled with DSE.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Hanzo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is the Command completing or giving an error?  Make sure you've got the syntax and especially spacing on  command precise, comparing with the tutorial here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable...</a>
<br />
<br />If it appears the system is corrupted then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Start Menu Most Used - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fanggt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu Most Used</h2>
                    <p>On the start menu, you can right click on a Most Used app to remove from list, "Don't show in this list".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: How do you add it back into that list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed an app that I'd like to have it added back. A setting that I'm missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And just in case: Adding another tile or shortcut else where is not the question.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As noted in the other reply, the request is to add the item back to the Most Used list.&nbsp; Using Pin to Start puts a tile on the right side of the menu, not where it was requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these "Most Used" apps supposed to be user-managed, or actually reflect usage?&nbsp; My "most used" apps have never been used.&nbsp; I've launched Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, and Mozilla many times since my upgrade and none appear under "most used".&nbsp; It appears
 to be static, and unidirectional (I can delete from it but can't add to it)</p>

            <p>I think I've found my problem - don't know if it applies to others.&nbsp; If you have a program pinned to the Start Menu, it seems that it will never appear in your Most Used list.&nbsp; I was wondering why Excel, Word, etc., never showed.,&nbsp; So I ran a bunch of other
 apps and they appeared.&nbsp; Then, on a hunch, I unpinned Excel from the menu, and it immediately appeared in the Most Used.&nbsp; I re-pinned it to Start, and it disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So apparently the Most Used list is the list of apps you use the most except for those that you use enough to pin them to start because you use them the most.&nbsp; Perhaps is should be the "Most used of the non-most-used apps" list. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>OP - unpid AfterEffects from the Start Menu and see if it appears on the Most Used.&nbsp; It sounds like you did exactly what I did, except I don't recall if I ever actually marked it as "Don't Show".&nbsp; You may still have that problem.</p>

            <p>Excellent advice and it works ! Just had a play around and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not exactly logical as like you have said but at least people can now have either a list of their most used, or arrange the tiles to suit.</p>

            <p>Both annoying and understandable.</p>
<p>Economy of space usage, I suppose Msft programmers were thinking.</p>
<p>However, at times, I actually SIT on my left hand and would like to be able to select my most usefuls from the keyboard alone without having to move to the mouse.</p>
<p>Using the Winkey then demands that you use the mouse to select a pinned tile. Always two hands/two devices. Nuisance.</p>
<p>Actually, the Winkey and arrows restrict you from Start-pinned tiles - unless you TAB over to the tiled area, and that's (Tab) on the far side of the keyboard.</p>
<p>Why couldn't horizontal arrows take you to the tiles? At the moment (Win10AU), they do nothing.</p>
<p>Oh dear..</p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter on Windows 7 or 10 Tech Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benwagnerpcbuilder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter on Windows 7 or 10 Tech Preview device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i have a few windows 7 laptops and one running windows 10 tech preview and while windows 10 just seems to not yet have support at all, windows 7 should have application based support for miracast based display's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>one laptop is running win 7 and has intel Centrino wireless card which I believe is capable of WiDi.&nbsp; is this then capable of miracast to the MWDA?&nbsp; how do I do this if it is possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>second laptop has an upgraded wifi card to the&nbsp; Atheros Killer wireless N 1103 tri band.&nbsp; also running windows 7.&nbsp; I don't believe that WiDi is capable to this card but it should be certantly capable of Miracast via software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>last laptop also has killer 1103 card but this one has windows 10 tech preview on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>currently im having the 1366x768 res issue with my SP3 and my droid razr M cannot connect to miracast display's at all so I have yet to see wireless display work in the native res of 1920x1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help with this would be great and if any Microsoft people are reading this MWDA needs software patch on the SP3 ASAP ive seen a lot of complaints about this res issue.&nbsp; some recommend disableing wifi and bt to make it work then reconnecting everything
 in a certain order.&nbsp; look into it please and fix asap I want my $64 (after tax) chrome cast to work... or else I could have just bought chrome cast.</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>jBrooke,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Firstly, check if there
 are updates available for the program, if yes, install the latest updates from the program manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t help,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Put the computer in clean boot, to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Enable clean boot, see
<strong>step 1</strong> in the link below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</span></strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
</span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After you figure out the
 problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - remember to put
 the computer back to normal startup follow <strong>step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, Please visit the link below to find a community that will offer the support you request.</span></p>

                    <p>I just installed this printer and got it hooked up to the router, so I can use it over WiFi, but when I print the test page from the laptop (Windows 7), the paper feeds through (so they're talking to each other), but there's no writing. The computer it's
 hooked up through is a Mac, could that be my problem? If so, does anyone know of a workaround? Oh, and I've already checked, all my drivers are updated. Thank you for any assistance!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you able to print directly from MAC?</span> </li><li><span>Was it working fine earlier in laptop or are you trying for the first time? If it was working fine earlier, are you aware of any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span>
</li><li><span>Is it a network printer? If “<b>Yes</b>”, is this printer connected to domain network (server-based network)?</span>
</li><li><span>Are you facing this issue specific with some documents or with all documents? If the issue is with specific documents, please provide the name of program?</span>
</li><li><span>Did you check the ink level?</span> </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the methods that you have not tried earlier and check after each method:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>It is not required for Printer to be connected to MAC, which might cause an issue as it is two different platforms.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Check the current status of ink level.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove Printer connection from MAC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn on Wi-Fi for Printer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b><span> Turn on Wi-Fi in MAC and Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4:</span></b><span> Check if both computers are able to detect printer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5:</span></b><span> Run<b> “Add Wireless printer wizard” </b>from Windows 7:<b>

<h2>            NAT problems at my apartment</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello I am experiencing problems connecting to a friend on Xbox Live and I have a moderate NAT and normally I could fix this easily to make it open, but the problem is I have moved to go to school and am currently in an apartment with its own Wifi,
 (i.e. we dont have our own router or anything but use the apartments wifi) Sooooooo since I do not have access to a router or anything I have no idea how to fix my NAT to open, Please help!! Also he is in a college dorm room so any help for him also would
 be great if it could help, although before I moved I had problem connecting to his dormroom connection, Thank you!</p>

<p>NAT is handled at the router level so even if you use a bridged connection through a PC and the PC is still on the apartment's wifi/internet, it will be the same result.<br />
<br />
Best bet would be to contact the landlord like Inferior suggested previously.</p>

            <p>Hi Baron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the Remote Desktop option is missing in the list of allowed programs in order to communicate through Windows firewall. You might need to check&nbsp;if the Remote Desktop is enabled in the system settings as it is disabled by default. So, I would
 suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, right-click on <strong>Computer</strong> and click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Remote settings</strong> in the navigation pane.</li><li>In the <strong>Remote Desktop</strong> section, click the radio button&nbsp;to <strong>
Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>The firewall rules set up automatically, when you turn it on. However, check if you get the option in the allowed programs for firewall.</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, please try Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to add mstsc.exe (Application for remote desktop) in the allowed programs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>System and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Firewall</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Allow a program or feature through Windows Firewall</strong> on the navigation pane.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Allow another program...</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Browse </strong>and navigate to the location C:\Windows\System32.</li><li>Select the file <strong>mstsc </strong>and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Add.</strong></li><li>You might now be able to see the Remote Desktop option in the list of programs. Check the box and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Activation keeps repeating</h2>

<p>Hello</p>
<p><span>We have had to reinstall XP Pro after a virus. After we activated windows it appeared fine until the machine was restarted at which point the login screen told us windows had to be activated - then it said the&nbsp;period&nbsp;had expired
 so we got the code from the telephone number it said to ring and entered that, which it accepted...but then keeps going round in cirles saying need to activate, already activated, or period expired.</span></p>
<p><span>We have also tries this&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;312295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;312295</a>&nbsp;but had to do it the manual way as the machine wasn't able
 to login and so we couldn't get on the&nbsp;internet&nbsp;to start the help guide! Still goes in cirles as above though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas please as this is the machine my partner needs for work and we are desperate!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks you!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds to me that the virus is still in the pc. Did you disconnect from the internet when you ran the virus scanner?</p>
