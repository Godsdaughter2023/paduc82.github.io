            <p>You have had no more BSOD errors. That is not to say you will get no more but it is now over 24 hours since the last error. The WMI errors seem to have stopped so I think that problem is fixed. You have a few Warnings about your internet connection. This
 is one:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Log Name:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>System<br />

Description:<br />
Name resolution for the name answers.microsoft.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The warning is one of those that occur&nbsp;from time to time and one that&nbsp;can be difficult to stop. Normally if this problem is encountered the way to try to resolve it is to reset the router. However, the problem invariably returns. In this case we probably
 know something about the problem as it involves access to these forums. Late yesterday and earlier this morning there were problems with the Microsoft server handling the forums. Many users were encountering slow connections.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you should do know is sit back and enjoy using your computer. Post again&nbsp; if you encounter further problems. Don't forget to mark your problem as answered when you are satisfied that the problems are resolved.</p>

<h2>            Changing Microsoft Account on Windows &#40;while keeping files&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently created a new Microsoft account (so that I can have a more mature email address than the one that my mom made for me as a kid). I want to use this as my main account on my windows computer, but I don't want to lose all of my current files
 and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change my default account while keeping all of my apps, data, settings, etc?</p>

            MS does not provide a way to "transfer" everything from one email account to another. They just could not imagine a time when someone would need to do that. 
<br />
<br />The simplest thing to do is continue to use the same email account, but add your new one as an "Alias".  
<br />
<br />Here are some "how to" instructions, they all say about the same thing, just use the ones most understandable to you.
<br />
<br />
<br />2018 01 26- MANAGE ALIASES ON YOUR MICROSOFT ACCOUNT - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />HOW TO CHANGE THE EMAIL ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR MICROSOFT ACCOUNT
<br /><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-us/my-account/micro...</a> 
<br />Some people say these instructions are easier to follow
<br />
<br />CHANGE THE EMAIL FOR YOUR ACCOUNT – ALIAS
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026162/microsoft-account-change-the-email-for-your-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402616...</a> 
<br />
<br />When your old email address doesn’t suit you anymore, but you want to save your contacts, online storage, subscriptions, and settings, then add an alias to your existing Microsoft account. An alias is another email address that works with the same account. 
<br />
<br />I HAD A TYPO IN MY EMAIL ADDRESS USED TO ACTIVATE OFFICE 2013, NOW I AM STUCK!
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/i-had-a-typo-in-my-email-address-used-to-activate/68465f5c-01d2-43b6-943f-583a98b1ef07">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum...</a> 
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt; When activating Office 2013 home and business I had a typo in my email address domain name.  Now I am stuck because the verification email isn’t going to an actual email box, so I can’t verify.  If I try to start over the product key is rejected as it is already in use!
<br />
<br />HELP!!
<br />Update, after waiting 90min on hold MS the fix is to install the product (I happened to have the download) and then click “I want to activate with product key”, then put a bogus code in so it will switch to give you a ‘I want to activate by telephone”.  Call the number on the screen and explain everything, then they will activate your OFFICE 2013!  The last step is to start a new live account and switch accounts.  What a pain MS! &lt;/snip&gt;
<br />If you want to change the registration (and not the log in information) from Personal account to Organizational account then you may refer the link mentioned and check:
<br /><a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://commerce.microsoft.com/help</a>
<br />Note: In the above mentioned link browse to the following:
<br />•	Click on Getting Help&lt; Contact Customer Support.
<br />•	Under Product select Office 365 Home Premium or Office 365 University.
<br />•	Under Problem Type select Security, Privacy and Accounts.
<br />•	Under Category select Managing My account.
<br />•	Under Contact Method either select START Chat or Request a call.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;

<br />HOW DO I CHANGE MY EMAIL ADDRESS FOR MY OFFICE 365 HOME PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION

<br />
<br />Answer
<br />“Now why would anyone ever want to do something like that”  &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt;
<br />
<br />Sorry, but apparently MS did not think that anyone would ever want to do that when it designed the Office 365 activation system.  There is no easy fix for your question.
<br />
<br />Move Office 365 University to a New Email Account - barely possible 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_account/moving-office-365-university-subscritpion-to/053401f9-2f7b-4684-90d2-2e876873fd96">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum...</a> 
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Well after nearly 2 hours of hold time, someone finally picked up.  I explained my situation and he said he’s been getting a flood of phone calls in the past week regarding the issue.  He explained that many people have registered for Office 365 with incorrect or misspelled email addresses/accounts and they currently have no power to change this.  He only offered to escalate the issue to the next level and take down my contact information. 
<br /> 
<br />For anyone with the same issue, you should keep calling and make some noise over this because it’s insane that MS locks in your account, giving you no ability to change it.  If I get no reply back on this in a few days, I will try and cancel my Office 365 University subscription.
<br />
<br />However, I am now running into a roadblock because they require me to re-verify my university status.  When I go enter my .edu address, they tell me it has already been used for verification of the 365 subscription that customer support just cancelled.  I’ve emailed them back about it and hopefully they can correct this.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;

<br />
<br />We are forced to include this Standard boilerplate legalistic bafflegab disclaimer for any links to non-Microsoft websites:
<br />
<br />(Short form: use these links at your own risk, just like everything else from MS!)
<br />
<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

            Hello MATTBURTON01,
<br />
<br />This works for me few years ago, it might help you.
<br />
<br />Go to PC Settings app and click to the Account section, so if you already have the new account there you'll have to make it as admin account.  Then you will be  able to use PC Settings/Accounts to switch to it from the local account.  So when you get into the new Microsoft account you should have all your stuff.  
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day

    <title>Scrambled keyboard, remap keys&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Scrambled keyboard, remap keys&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My old laptop keyboard took a tea-dive and stopped working (it is also missing some keys) so I ordered a replacement keyboard from the manufacturer. When it came, the letters were scrambled (like my "A" key wrote "W" and stuff like that). That is very annoying.
 I've uninstalled and re-installed appropriate drivers, made sure my keyboard language was correct, made sure the "NUM" key wasn't on, everything. Is there any way I can just remap the keys in Windows 7?

            Hi Morowyn,<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model of the keyboard?<br />
2. Does this happen with all the documents that you type(Ex: Microsoft Word, Notepad)?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<p><span>You may try to verify if the keys functions properly using the onscreen keyboard.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to start the on screen keyboard:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on Start.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Open the Control Panel (Classic view).</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on Ease of Access Center.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on On-Screen Keyboard </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may open notepad or Word pad and check if it works fine. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if it works fine.
<span>&nbsp;</span>To boot to the desktop in safe mode keep tapping F8 key during restart. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode select it and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link to know more about how to boot the computer in safe mode:

            Thank you for the quick response, Babu. After some research, I discovered that I was sent the incorrect keyboard for my laptop. Until I can order the correct keyboard, I will have to do as you said and use the On-Screen Keyboard. Thank you very much!

            Currently Windows 10 Home Edition does not support Hyper-V virtual machines.
<br />You will need Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise 64bit Editions.
<br />You can upgrade <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12384/windows-10-upgrading-home-to-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12384/...</a>
<br />
<br />You also need to find if your Asus Notebook supports the Hyper-V requirements.
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization...</a>
<br />
<br />Alternatively you can use virtualbox as well if you do not want to upgrade your edition.  I used to use it all the time in Windows 7 and it's free.
<br /><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>  
<br />But you still need to make sure you hardware supports VMs.  
<br />
<br />And when you create the Windows 7 virtual machine you will need a license for it if you want to maintain updates.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any further questions.

<p>Thank you both for your replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did install the latest version of Oracle's VirtualBox but I couldn't get it to install Windows XP from my licenced installation disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have another go if it still won't install XP &amp; try my Windows 7 disc now that I've got he groovy guide that Andre posted.</p>
<p>

            What is the error message when you try to install Windows XP?
<br />
<br />What you probably need to do is make your Windows XP disc an ISO first using ISO recorder, then mount it in VirtualBox, learn how:

<p>I used the ISO programme to turn the installation CD into a single ISO file &amp; I did the same with my Windows 7 Pro CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the VirtualBox USB support so I can transfer files from USB into VirtualBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following your guide, I installed both XP &amp; Windows 7 onto VirtualBox but I deleted XP &amp; will stick with Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't yet bought the Lexia 3 Diagbox but at least I now know I&nbsp; can install it on my notebook.</p>
<p>

<p>Same issue on my 3 minis!<br />
</p>
<p>The troubleshooter reports that they have corrupt update database and says it fixed it - this worked on ONE only - it still lists 408776 as failed, but it proceeded and installed 4089848 bringing it up to current 16299.334</p>
<p>
</p><p>The others are stuck at versions 16299.125&nbsp; and 16299.248</p>
<p>.125 unit tells me device is at risk and has the [Retry] button. When I hit that, it gets past intializing and fails at installing 0%</p>
<p>
</p><p>.248 unit tells me "awating restart" ... tried numerous times and it looks as if its working but then can't complete and rolls back the changes.
</p>

<p>This is me replying to my own issue</p>
<p>The issue still exists, failing to update and rolling back automatically</p>
<p>Repeating this process every week</p>
<p>Security updates appear to be functioning correctly</p>
<p>I have no idea how to progress this</p>
<p>If you search in the forum you will find other issues with updates where I have managed to eventually resolve things but this one seems terminal</p>
<p>Is there a way to tell Windows 'skip 1803 and try the next one ?'</p>
<p>I can't believe it's a hardware spec issue, the PC is fairly new and overspecced for most requirements</p>
<p>Any suggestions gratefully received</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and my dvd drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristincade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and my dvd drive</h2>
                    <p>I have a hp notebook 1515-ay082nr win 10. When I got it I did a factory restore to default to start fresh. (It was used) I had not used the computer prior to reset other than seeing it on long enough to navigate to setting and reset. Ok. I do know the dvd
 drive did work. Play movies, open, ect. When I met the man he showed me the dvd drive worked cause I wanted it mainly for that dvd player. Well after reset turned it on it tells me it needs to install a update so I install it. No way around d it. It's for
 windows 10. Now my dvd drive will not open, or do anything. No error code is coming up other than the dvd drive wont open. In devices it tells me it's working.&nbsp; I've disabled and even removed. Put everything back and still nothing. Tried updating driver and
 its saying its got the latest version . Idk what the heck to do. Can anyone out there help me. I know a little but it's not enough to get me by this time. I need a new brains assistance.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Stop code Critical_Process Died</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Windows 10.</p>
<p>Computer (Toshiba Laptop) won't boot today. Unaware of loading any new programs. Put it to sleep and now it won't boot.</p>
<p>Start is interrupted by a blue screen: ':( Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.' Microsoft collects some information then restarts. It says Preparing Automatic Repair then Diagnosing Your PC. A blue screen appears 'Automatic Repair' with two
 options: Restart and Advanced Options. Restart doesn't help. It just says Attempting Automatic Repair then returns to Your PC did not start properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advanced Options gives Choose an Option. They are Continue, Use a device, Troubleshoot, and Turn off your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshoot gives Reset this PC, Recovery Tool, Advanced Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advanced options gives System Restore, Go back to the previous version, System Image Recovery, Start-up Repair, Command Prompt, UEFI Firmware Settings.</p>
<p>System Restore doesn't help. Gives me a popup window with one option that was automatically created (I was asleep when it was made). Clicking 'Show more restore points' gives two more options, both Windows Update. I cannot engage either. I get a window asking
 me to 'Confirm disks to restore'. The only option is Local Disk C, but I cannot tick the box. The Next button is greyed out. I tried the first option of the Automatic Restore Point but this has not helped.</p>
<p>I tried 'Go back to the previous versioln' but this has not helped.</p>
<p>I don't have a system image on the computer</p>
<p>Start-up Repair doesn't help.</p>
<p>I haven't tried the last two as I'm aware it's easy to make things worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 'See more recovery options' I have Start-up Settings. This gives seven options including low-res video mode, safe modes, and disable modes.
</p>
<p>Enable Safe mode just restarts as though I had switched off and on. No safe mode. Same for Safe mode with networking.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hesitate to use Reset this PC as I have a lot of work that is almost finished and that I have not backed up. I am looking after someone and did not bring my backup disks (three months of work!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please offer some guidance? I will try to find a shop where I can buy a laptop drive reader and a new external disk tomorrow morning (but it's Sunday, and this is rural England, so I will probably have to drive many miles).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you have the Go Back option then it means you received the latest Version Update within the past ten days after which it goes away.  Have you had problems with that version as many have?  A crash like that usually means drivers, so when you get back into Windows it will be important to update all of your drivers from the PC  maker's Support Downloads webpage to the latest.  
<br />
<br />Since you've tried Go Back and all repair options correctly, I'd do the Reset choosing to Save files.  If it fails you can use another PC to create the bootable media to Clean Install follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can even use the repair Command Prompt to rescue your files if you think you have some out of the User Folders, go through the mini-Explorer provided to copy them all out to the same flash stick or an external hard drive:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary to access the Repair Mode or do the Clean Install, you can create Windows 10 installation media on another PC by installing the Media Creation Tool and following the steps given on it's download page here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If using another PC to create the media uncheck the box for Recommended Settings and choose carefully your licensed version and bit rate (normally 64 bit).  
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshooting to try Startup Repair,  System Restore or go back to Troubleshoot Options to Reset. 
<br />
<br />If those all fail then use the same media to Clean Install following the tutorial I gave.  You dont' need to reinstall all of your programs at once, just the ones you need to do your work, making it an hour or two project.
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding. If I click Reset and Save Files, is there any chance of the files being deleted? I only need to save Word, Excel, and Outlook files, along with some text (notepad) files (some wav and mp3 would be handy, but not essential, and I don't
 have any pictures or videos). I didn't know I could access files without Windows being booted, so I'm learning already. I was going to unscrew the Toshiba, remove its drive, and copy what I need directly to another drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reassure me there's no danger of deleting files this way and I'll give it a go now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read some of your links and will follow your instructions/guidance once I have the files secured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old Vaio running W7, so will create the USB key if all fails. I'm not sure whether the Toshiba is 32 or 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

            No, Andrew, there's no guarantee when someone doesn't back up their files.  The hard drive can die without notice at any second and everything is lost.  This is why one should keep a regular backup of the User folders to external drive, and another Cloud backup using OneDrive (5gb free) or Google Drive (15gb free) that will let you specify User folders to save in real time to the Cloud where they are fire- and theft- proof.  
<br />
<br />So if you don't have one of those then that's why I suggested how to copy the files out first, even though the Reset should Save Files if you choose that.

<p>I tried the reset and save files. Downloaded the software through the Vaio and onto a blank 8GB USB key. After two seconds of 'Getting things ready' it states there's a problem with the PC, no changes were made, and the only option is cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using command prompt and the notpad.exe I can see the files but there is no right click to save option. I get the message on the command window "Microsoft Windows (version 10.0.17134.1)", and "Not enough memory resources are available to process this
 command". I read several posts about this being a known problem, most of which are from May/June of this year. Can't help but wonder why Microsoft is still taking control of the computer I paid for and installing updates when I don't want them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will buy a hard drive reader tomorrow and hopefully be able to copy the files I need. I know I should backup to an external drive. I like the idea of privacy when working on other people's work (academic files and unpublished stuff) so I don't use a cloud
 backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that I must now buy a new drive and download Windows again and Office and everything else. Or just call it a day for the Toshiba and buy a new computer. This Vaio has lasted nine years; the Toshiba just over three years!</p>

            Unless the hardware itself if failing there is no reason to abandon it when all you need to do is reinstall Windows, and based on hundreds of thousands who have followed the install in the link I gave you will never have any further problems like this again.  That's because Windows 10 depends entirely on quality of the install and the install I gave you to do yourself is a far better install than you could ever pay for.  
<br />
<br />There are other methods to rescue files in the tutorial I gave including using a Linux Live Disk, Paragon Rescue, or do a Custom install to the drive without formatting (just select C and click Next) which will archive your files in C:\windows.old during install.  
<br />
<br />I've had all my User folders rooted in OneDrive for years and during that time have never had any problems or heard of any storing files in the cloud.

<p>The notepad.exe now has the Send option. I'm saving all the essential files. Do I have to switch off the dodgy laptop to remove the key each time I remove it? Can I just unplug it, plug it in the working laptop, the eject it and plug it back into the dodgy
 laptop while Command window and notepad.exe are still open? Reluctant to test it just yet.</p>
<p>Thanks for your ongoing time, patience, and support. I stayed up till eight this morning reading about related things. No local (20-mile radius) shops open. Will buy an external drive tomorrow. I have four drives at my own home, but it's not in England.</p>
<p>Much happier now I have some of the essential files. Will post again on Monday, once I'm feeling brave (due to all saved files).</p>

            Andrew, it may depend on the state of your hardware if the explorer will remain functional when you remove the stick to transfer files over.  You might need to boot back into the Command Prompt to open notepad.  
<br />
<br />You can also remove the hard drive and install it to another drive to copy files out, or copy them all to an external drive at once. 
<br />
<br />Remember that you will not see progress bar on the copying operation but just have to wait longer for each larger group of files you copy.  Then it's critical to compare the size of the copied files on the problem and rescue drives, and spot check that files of all types open after transfer to the rescue location.  Files can become corrupted during any of these copy operations, and copying them out of a failed install is especially risky to their health.  
<br />
<br />There is nothing like this experience to burn into our memory the need to keep files backed up, so I'll give you my brief on that now so you have all options at the ready:  
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can copy or drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can buy additional space for cheap.
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that using Cmd notepad.exe while the installation media was plugged in gave me more files, so I've copied them to the functional W7 laptop too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just tried to run the media, but after accepting T&amp;Cs and clicking the save files option, I'm given a compatability report that says 'The upgrade option isn't available if you start your computer using Windows installation media'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had registered the Toshibs Satellite S50-B when i bought it, and the details state that is was running W8 at 64bit. My wife believes we updated to W10 as 64bit. Are there any files or folders that would confirm whether it's 32bit or 64bit? I understand
 from reading that the sysWOW64 doesn't confirm this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the drivers that Toshibs is willing to provide. Should I try as 32bit and then upgrade to 64bit once I can access the W10 thing, or will this cause further problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping that by getting it going again after the update, I would have the necessary files in the .old folder. Once it was working, I would delete these, backup the drive, finish my work, then do the clean install as you suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
        </p>

<p>The 32-bit option simply isn't recognised by the W10 laptop. It just starts as usual. The 64-bit option takes me straight to the Install sequence. I'm guessing this confirms it's a 64-bit installation, as was the previous W8 that I changed to W10 well over
 two years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried copying Drive C to a new external backup drive. Several files could not be copied, for reasons such as I had to have Administrator rights (I can't login to W10 as it won't boot, so I can't change this); the file names were too long (!); and the files
 did not exist (again, !).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now clicked the clean install and am looking at six partitions, all under 'Drive 0'. As I can't run such as Produkey, would you please confirm that what I'm about to do is correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your link you have a picture with four partitians, only one of which is Recovery. I have three of the Type 'Recovery'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive 0 Partitian 1 is WinRE, Total size 1GB with 699MB free. Its type is 'Recovery'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partitian 2, ESP, 100MB and 43MB free. System</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partitian 3, [no name], 128MB and 112MB free. MSR (Reser</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partitian 4, TI31...A, 917.9GB and 834.7GB free. Primary</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partitian 5, [no name], 812MB and 349MB free. Recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partitian 6, Recovery, 11.6GB and 746MB free. Recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Toshiba has 8,192MB Ram and a 1TB HDD + 8GB SSD Solid State Hybrid Drive</p>
<p>Will I need a partitian for the solid state drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the latest drivers from Toshiba and from Driverscape.com (https://www.driverscape.com/manufacturers/toshiba/laptops-desktops/satellite-s50-b/164857)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have my W10 activation key/number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about to connect the Toshiba to the Internet with a cable, then delete all the partitians, then click New and format the drive. I understand I will see some partitians appear. I will separate files from programs. To do this, I will allocate 120GB (ample
 for system restores) to C (the first large partitian) and leave the rest for one partitian that will contain files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will install into C (or P4). Once it's complete, if necessary I will install the downloaded I will update W10 until there are no more updates (I do hope this will not repeat the nobbling-after-update that has caused this error originally). I will also
 update all drivers through Device Manager. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will then download and install Office 365. Backup the computer, then add Norton and Firefox and my saved files. The I can continue with my work (the profs and editors are being very kind and patient with me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you see anything I am missing?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 top 1&#47;4 inch of screen flickers below bottom taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro 4.&nbsp; For a month or so the top 1/4 inch of my screen is displayed on the bottom of my screen (under the task bar) and flickers.&nbsp; I have done all of the hints online.&nbsp; Deleted then reinstalled screen driver. made sure hyper v was off.
 and some others.&nbsp; Nothing fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not crazy about trading it in for a refurbished unit, I purchased a new one because I did not want a referb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am not convinced that my problem is hardware.&nbsp; Following an online tip I changed my screen resolution, dropping it down to 2560 X 1600.&nbsp; The screen no linger flickers.&nbsp; If this was a hardware problem I don't believe that would have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer to keep the original recommended resolution so could someone give me some help on this?</p>

</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>We appreciate raising this concern to us. Regarding about the concern that we have, if the Surface device flicker. It is likely caused by driver of the screen that need to update or in the screen it self. Since that
 this issue is fix when you lower down the screen&nbsp;resolution by&nbsp; 2560 X 1600. Possible this&nbsp;is only a software issue.

<p><span><span>If the issue still present in the UEFI, this is already a screen issue that need to replace your Surface device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Just incase if the issue is not there at all. We can proceed to the next troubleshooting. We can do a

    <title>Xbox One Standard Headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sog tank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Standard Headset</h2>
                    
<p>Having trouble with my headset. I haven't tried to use it until tonight, and it will not work at all. Games aren't recognizing that I have a headset plugged in. And apparently the buttons on the headset itself are supposed to illuminate, which they are not.
 Is there something I need to do to turn the headset on? I haven't been able to find anything in the settings. And I haven't had any luck with the troubleshooting page. Any advice is welcome.</p>

<p>Problem has been resolved, sort of. I went to the local Microsoft store today. They weren't overly concerned about determining what the problem was, so I still don't know. But they did swap out my controller and headset for new ones. Thanks for all of the
 suggestions.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Unplug headset, turn off controller and plug in headset and turn controller on again.</p>
<div>
Examine and clean your Xbox hardware
<div>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the headset, the cord, and the connector for visible defects. </li><li>Make sure that no dirt or debris is on the headset connector. To clean the connector, use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol.
</li><li>Verify that your Xbox One Controller operates correctly. Verify that you can use the controller to turn on and turn off the console.
</li><li>Firmly insert the Xbox One Chat Headset connector into the expansion port that is under the directional pad (D-pad) and the right stick on the controller
</li></ol>
<div>
Test the headset
<div>
<p>To do this, start a party (requires connectivity) to test the audio. To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Say “<b>Xbox, go to a party.</b>” Or, select&nbsp;<b>My Games and Apps</b>, then select&nbsp;<b>Party</b>.
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Start a Party</b>.&nbsp;<br />
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;You don’t need to invite anyone to your party. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Turn on Party Chat</b>. </li><li>Make sure your headset is not muted (make sure the orange LED light next to the&nbsp;<b>Mute</b>&nbsp;button is not on).
</li><li>Make sure the volume is turned up. </li><li>Speak into the microphone. </li></ol>
<p>If your headset is working, you will see the green dot next to your name light up. If your chat headset is still does not working, it may need to be repaired or replaced.</p>

    <title>Can I redeem Microsoft Points Cards to buy games for Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I redeem Microsoft Points Cards to buy games for Xbox One&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>There's a retail store near my house that's selling 4500 MS Points cards for a good price. I have bought one of these a few months ago and redeemed it on my Xbox 360 and it was converted into R$ 112,50 (around US$ 56).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering if I can redeem another card like this on Xbox One, in order to buy games on demand.</p>
<p>Putting it in another way: can Microsoft Points cards be redeemed on Xbox One either?</p>
<p>Or, if I redeem it on my Xbox 360 or on Xbox.com, will I be able to use this money to buy content on Xbox One?</p>

<h2>            irda and Surface 3 under windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encounter some problem with an sigmatel irda dongle and a Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually have 2 computers and the Surface 3, all on Windows 10, Insider slow ring (Build 14372) I managed to make work the irda dongle following the guide : https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3150989 plus a little manipulation in the device manager,</p>
<p>transfert from my Uwatec to the computer works, no problem.</p>
<p>but on the Surface 3, when I plug the irda, that I go to the device manager and activate the dongle, invariably, I got a blue screen with a "kernel_security_check_failure" that happen between a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes max, one time I had enough time
 to start linking my Uwatec and start transfering data with SmartTrak, so I know the installation worked but... Something crash the whole Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried to uninstall the drivers and reinstall for the irda, also I tried to uninstall what is under Universal Serial Bus Controllers like I saw in another post. Always the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does anybody have an idea of what can be wrong between the Surface 3 and the irda dongle ?</p>
<p>Or anybody managed to make work an irda dongle with a Surface 3 without issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hello Nico.be<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Determining the cause of this issues typically requires the use of the debugger to gather additional information. Multiple dump files should be examined to see if this stop code has similar characteristics, such as the code that is running when the stop
 code appears.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff539316%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Use the event log to see if there are higher level events that occur leading up to this stop code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These general troubleshooting tips may be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you recently added hardware to the system, try removing or replacing it. Or check with the manufacturer to see if any patches are available.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If new device drivers or system services have been added recently, try removing or updating them. Try to determine what changed in the system that caused the new bug check code to appear.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-information-event-logs-event-viewer#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Event Viewer</a>. Look for critical errors in the system log that occurred in the same time window as the blue screen.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 continuously forgets my password...is this a glitch with windows 7 or do i need to take my pc back for replacement</h2>
                    i have a sony netbook that is running windows 7.&nbsp; i created a logon and password.&nbsp; i logged in on several different occasions with no problems.&nbsp; Out of the blue on my next logon windows 7 wouldnt take my password.&nbsp; i knew it was correct, but downloaded
 software to hack and reset the password.&nbsp; i went into windows 7 again and reset a new password...making sure to write it down and make it easy for me to remember.....several attempts to login went ok...then again for whatever reason it forgot my password.&nbsp;
 i dont want to have to hack the system everytime this happens and am considering taking the pc back for replacement.&nbsp; is anyone aware of a glitch in windows 7 that is causing this or some kind of windows patch that fixes it.&nbsp; i dont want to take the pc back,
 but am frustrated.&nbsp; appreciate any help anyone can provide.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Is there a possibility of changing that time frequency ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above lines makes sense and Thanks in Advance for your assistance.</p>

<p>Hi Mani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the missed conversation from Skype for Business will be saved the Outlook's Conversation History folder automaticlly. I also understand that you want to reduce the time (10-15 min) to save the Skype for Business conversation. After doing the research,
 we know that conversation is normally saved in Outlook by the Client using EWS, and we have no such option or feature mentioned to reduce the time. For your this&nbsp;valuable comment, we recommend you post this need/comment to
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business UserVoice</a>, the related team will notice at you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding and sorry for we can't meet you need up to now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
