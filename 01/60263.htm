<h2>            Error code 8x000000a when using SD card</h2>
                    Hi, I recently inserted my camera's SD card into my laptop and avg told me it detected a virus on the card, I clicked "fix problem" and it apparently fixed it. But now it doesn't let me view the photos on the SD card, it just comes up with the error code
 8x000000a. I've tried the card in a different laptop which doesn't detect any virus but still gives me the same code. But the photos are still viewable when the card is in the camera. I've tried opening it through my computer but tells me something to do with
 could not find file path, and the term 32RECYLER is shown. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Many thanks

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

<h2>            Programs crash every time I try to print with HP Photosmart C4750. </h2>
                    I am using Windows Vista (home) and Microsoft Office 2007. I've just installed the driver for the HP Photosmart C4750 printer but I am unable to use it because every time I try to print, the program I try to print from crashes. I've tried Microsoft Word
 and Notepad. In addition, I tried to go to Control Panel then "printers" to try and remove the printer and then re-add it, but as soon as I click the "printers" icon, Microsoft Explorer crashes too. I'm connecting to the printer wirelessly. There is another
 user who uses this printer wirelessly and it works for them and i do believe they also use Windows Vista. I also tried to turn off any anti-virus protection and firewalls, hoping it would do something, but nothing's helped. Please let me know if you have any
 advice. Thank you!

<p><span><span>Hello moonsparkle,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The crash of the spooler when trying to open remove the printer is a clue that you might have corrupted printer drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you run the printer troubleshooter that automatically diagnoses and repairs problems with printing:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-printer-problems</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Find the faulty module that can be causing the applications to crash when trying to print. You can start from analyzing the event viewer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can refer the below article that will help you with this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Open-Event-Viewer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can refer the the below link that will help you analyze the event viewer entries:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can alternatively post the entries in your answer if you have any difficulty in finding the errors.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If nothing works, I suggest that you reinstall the drivers for the printer. You can uninstall the printer drivers from the Device manager or uninstall
 the Photosmart software and try to install the drivers again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

<p>I have the 55" of the Samsung series you are looking at and its flawless. When deciding on quality you need to look at the frame refresh rate over digital optical quality because it makes the retinal vision sharp to watch and clean linear animation on this
 machine is really good even for fast paced 1080p movies. I haven't found anything that has better digital feed than this Samsung but the cost of good hardware is expensive. You don't need to go 65". There is little to gain by size after around 50" because
 detail is so clear from the 240hz output. I sit almost 14' from my 55" Samsung.</p>
<p>Also the Samsung doesn't let you down on inputs and outputs. It has 3 HDMI slots with 4 extra USB inputs and two of each have an optical line out for recording or running direct inputs to your surround sound system. You have choice in how you setup sound
 and recording. The TV also has a direct record feature to USB on the fly or timed recording. You can eliminate some hardware and simplify your whole sound system if you use the TV as device. Really smart technology from Samsung. I hope they don't reduce to
 input/output tech in the future.</p>
<p>Because this is a Smart TV it should will connect to you internet wireless if you have a wireless modem. It allows you to do a whole lot more with running the TV as a huge PC monitor. Simply if you know how to use this technology you will use your TV as
 the screen for your devices. There are apps for Android or Apple devices so you have freedom to use a tablet to scroll through files whilst watch the TV screen, whilst it records a show in the background, and whilst you have a number of other devices running
 and connected to the hardware. A simple switch between the inputs will bring up that device in at the present state. So if you stop playing Xbox One and jump between the TV or the internet each device remains connected.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<h2>            How to remove Spawner Program</h2>
                    <div>&nbsp; I think I have a spawning program in my router, I completely hoof and mouth cleaned both my Desk and Lap when I went from Vista to Win7. &nbsp;Formatted the hard drive and all. &nbsp;In any case, I keep getting text files written to C:\user\name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Cookies\file.txt</div>
<div>When I look for this folder, I cannot find it although I supposedly can see the hidden folders in my explorer. &nbsp;My AVS antivirus takes me right to it when I get an alert, so I know it is there....but I get an alert and there are already multiple files
 there to delete...all text files.....so I know some a leaking through. &nbsp;I have gone from about 7 spam messages a day to 70, another indication that the files are getting through. &nbsp;</div>
<div>First, how do I unhide this folder...I am not too stupid to run my own computer immaterial of what MS policy is....</div>
<div>Second, how can I go about finding and irradicating this/these spawner programs? &nbsp;In plain text the files have names like trade.doubler and media choice and such.</div>

1. Click Start.<br />
2. Type the three letters cmd into the Search box and press Enter.<br />
3. Type the following commands and press Enter after each:<br />

            I get past the UserProfile line now, but when I try to type in it still cannot find the Cookies under the Microsoft folder.  Both trying the entire change of directory, and changing the dir one folder at a time: 


cd AppData return 


cd Roaming return 


cd Microsoft return 


cd Cookies return 


system answer The system cannot find the path specified 



For some reason the system does not think this folder exists, but when I get an alert, half time time it goes directly to the C:\Zane\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Cookies\Low and let's me delete the files.  The other times it just shows the "Documents" folder (and from experience I know there is no chance of finding the bugger).  Is it possible that the malware is causing it?????? 


I don't know my MS DOS all that well, but I know enough to know I SHOWED it the path that I am seeing, and it did not react. 


This has to be a common problem, because I am seeing all sorts of different names in the text files I am getting rid of....like I say "Trad

            I think you have a problem with reporting exactly what you see on the screen and with the commands you type. Initially it was the "CD" command that tripped you up and now it is the folder "C:\Zane\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Cookies\Low" which you quote
 but which is most unlikely to exist. It's this well-known inability of computers to deal properly with commands that are only an approximation of the real thing. Humans can cope with this sort of thing!<br />
<br />
I recommend that you ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you, someone who can look over you shoulder and see with his own eyes what's going on.<br />

            Thanks Pegasus....but I am not the guy who calls repair because the computer is unplugged. &nbsp;I know what I see, and recognize my mistakes. &nbsp;I wish I could send you screenshots. &nbsp;I started with computers with the old VC 20 (Commodore did not call it the
 VIC 20 as vic is a dirty word in German) &nbsp;and STILL have the 14 disk set of Windows 3.11 &nbsp; I would say I am hardly new to computing. &nbsp;This situation has me very puzzled and hoped someone on here had run into a like situation. &nbsp;I do know how to read a path,
 and the antivirus shows me the quoted path. &nbsp;As you say, the computer agrees with you that it does not exist.....but I can delete (from the AV program) out of exactly this path. &nbsp;No, I have not made a mistake, I see it on a daily basis. &nbsp;I also left a few
 files in there before I did a search in explorer, just in case the folder was deleted after sending the txt files...no dice. &nbsp;Of course if you don't&nbsp;experience&nbsp;it yourself, you would blame the human operator, but since I am that human operator, I know he is
 not to blame. &nbsp;Since Windows 95 I have complained that Microsoft thinks their program is much better than the human and hidden things, or refused to obey commands......I thought that this was just another case of "you are to stupid to work this machine, trust
 us".......... &nbsp;Actually, I still think it is...... &nbsp; &nbsp; Again, thanks for your time

            OK, lets have some screen shots. Activate the pop-up box that reports your problem, then press Alt+PrtSc. Now open PaintBrush (mspaint.exe) and click Ctrl+V to paste the screen shot. You can now save the picture as a .jpg file. Alternatively, depending
 on the flavour of Windows 7 you have, you can run SnippingTool.exe to grab the contents of the pop-up panel in one go, then save it as a .jpg file.
<br />
<br />
When finished, upload the .jpg file(s) to www.skydrive.com and post the link here.<br />
<br />
P.S. Es ist mir völlig neu, dass "Vic" auf Deutsch ein unflätiges Wort sein soll. Bei uns bedeutet es gar nichts.<br />

<h3> helennoble  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVG detecting false positive trojan horse Generic27</h2>
                    AVG Resident Shield "detected" trojan horse Generic27 on hpqdcmgr.exe on 3 separate computers in my house and when I ran housecall by Trend Micro and the online scan from Microsoft everything was clean. I have contacted AVG and have not received a response
 yet. What do I do? If I try to ignore, AVG isolates the file making it inaccessible. I'm inclined to think that if there was a trojan on all 3 computers Microsoft or housecall would have detected it.

<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and keep Windows 7 programs&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I just brought Windows 8 Pro Upgrade and upgraded to it from Windows 7 Home Premium. I have chosen to keep my programs, settings, and personal files from Windows 7 and so everything has moved on over to Windows 8. Before deciding to buy Windows
 8, I had tried the Windows 8.1 Preview but that did not let me keep my programs from Windows 7. I did some hunting online and found that one cannot keep their programs if they upgrade to Windows 8.1 Preview from Windows 7. Will this still be the case once
 Windows 8.1 comes out? What about for users who upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8? Will one lose their programs from Windows 7 after they have upgraded to Windows 8 and then upgrade/update to Windows 8.1 once it comes out? The most important programs that
 I have on my PC are Word and Excel from Microsoft Office Starter 2010 that came with my PC. I do not want to lose these. Thanks.

    <title>USB3 DVD Brief Data Flow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ml48603  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB3 DVD Brief Data Flow</h2>
                    Hardware &amp; Software<br />
Windows 7 x64 Ultimate SP1<br />
Sager NP9280/Clevo D900F i7 6GB RAM laptop<br />
Laptop has USB 2.0 ports native, current X58 Express Chipset Drivers v9.3.0.1019<br />
Rosewill RC-615 USB3 Expresscard Adapter w/ Renesas Drivers 2.1.28.1<br />
SYBA SD-EXP20070 USB3 Expresscard adapter w/ Renesas Drivers 2.1.28.1<br />
<br />
When attempting to play a standard def movie with Windows Media Player from a USB3 external DVD drive with a USB3 cable connected to either a Rosewill RC-615 USB3 Expresscard&nbsp; adapter or SYBA SD-EXP20070 USB3 Expresscard adapter plugged into a laptop with Intel
 X58 Express Chipset the movie will play for between 5 seconds and 6 minutes, then stop playing. The last frame received remains in WMP and the player remains in play mode indefinitely until WMP is shutdown with the red X or the USB3 cable is disconnected from
 the external USB3 external DVD drive. Choosing safely remove hardware from the tray results in no response, so at that point the USB3 cable is disconnected.<br />
<br />
With the Deivice Manager open during testing the USB Mass Storage Device line item appears as expected, driver USBSTOR.SYS v6.1.7601.17577 and the DVD drive appears as expected, driver cdrom.sys v6.1.7600.16385.&nbsp; This behavior is observed with a Vantec CB-ISATAU3
 SATA/IDE to USB3 Adapter attached to the DVD drive and a ByteCC ME-535U3 enclosure connected to the same DVD drive. Another DVD drive was also swapped in and the same behavior is noted.<br />
<br />
If the ByteCC &amp; Vantec devices are connected with a USB2 cable to the USB3 ExpressCard adapter the movie flows uninterrupted. Same results for the ByteCC &amp; Vantec devices connected to the laptop's native USB2 ports. I have Thermaltake USB3 SATA docks running
 through the Expresscard USB3 adapters with no problem whatsoever.&nbsp; The connection of DVD drives triggers this problem.<br />
<br />
The fact that the DVD drive will connect at USB3 speeds and play a movie for a short time (no windows slow connection tray error appears when connection is made) leads me to conclude that the hardware is working and that there is a&nbsp; software conflict which
 stops the data flow.<br />
<br />
UpperFilters and LowerFilters have been removed from the DVD Class category which resulted in&nbsp; longer movie run times in the 2-6 minute range. I am stumped. Any ideas from the forum?
<br />
<br />
I have uploaded a .pdf file to my website containing screenshots of what is happening when the DVD drive is hooked up USB3. See south-paw.net/downloads/USB3 DVD Brief&nbsp; Data Flow.pdf<br />

            Method 1 I have not tried, but will look into running that one.<br />
<br />
I tested your method 2 before posting my problem to the forum. Of course there are no drivers provided by the manufacturers of the ByteCC enclosure and the Vantec adapter.&nbsp; The same behavior results from method 2.
<br />
<br />
Method 3 is not applicable as it concerns a <span>NVIDIA USB EHCI chipset.&nbsp; Is this a chipset on the motherboard or in a Expresscard</span> USB3 adapter?<br />
<br />
Here are some other tests I ran that produce the same behavior as previously mentioned.<br />
<br />
Attempting to use the DVD drive with Nero KwikMedia v1.10.24000 results in the same behavior: USB Mass Storage Device and DVD Drive appear in device manager as expected. The result is the movie plays for up to 10-20 seconds, then stops. I tried working with
 just a data. <br />
<br />
I also ran Nero Express v10.6.10700 that comes with Nero V10 and set it up to read a unprotected DVD and create a iso Image of that DVD. The process started normally and ran for about 5 seconds creating a small .iso on my hard drive as expected, then the became
 quiet and the process stopped.<br />

            Vantec offerred a firmware update from Prolific for the PL2733 SATA to USB Bridge Chip. Initial results were amazing. Without so much as a Win7 reboot the USB3 drive started working.&nbsp; I was able to make some ISOs and watch a movie for 15 minutes without
 the DVD stopping.<br />
<br />
After performing the Prolific firmware update of the Vantec Adapter with positive results I came back the next morning to work through my pile of DVDs that I need to ISO and the same problems I was having with the Vantec adapter's original firmware came back.<br />
<br />
When I attempted to make an iso the process ran for only 3 minutes before failing.&nbsp; I reflashed the Adapter with the firmware update and tried again.&nbsp; I was able to make 3 successful iso images.&nbsp; Then the iso making process started failing again 3-4 minutes
 into an iso.<br />
<br />
I flashed the firmware again and was able to make 2 more successful iso images. Then the iso process started failing again after 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
I flashed the adapter again. The iso making process failed on the first attempt. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I then tested the Vantec adapter with the old SATA and IDE HDDs that I store my ISOs on and the Vantec adapter was not working with the HDDs anymore.&nbsp; Things kind of went to pieces with this Prolific firmware update.<br />
<br />
An IDE HDD connected to the Vantec adapter is loaded in the device manager as a Prolific USBCFReader Device under the HDD category.&nbsp; This results in failed attempts to view the directory.&nbsp; That is whether I am hooked up USB3 or USB2.&nbsp; If I use an old enclosure
 with the old IDE HDD I can see the directory and write to the drive as expected.<br />
<br />
I uploaded the screenshots of the Device Manager showing the Prolific USBCFReader Device into one PDF at
<br />
south-paw.net/downloads/Vantec Adapter with IDE HDD.pdf<br />
<br />
Fixing the firmware seems to be a step in the right direction to get the USB3/DVD problems resolved.&nbsp; I advised Vantec to see if they can work on a better firmware to resolve all the DVD/USB3 problems. I also requested a firmware update from Bytecc for the
 enclosure using the VIA VL700Q4 SATA to USB Bridge.&nbsp; Could be that firmware needs work to make DVD/USB3 compatible.

            I did some additional testing Sunday night with Vantec adapter.&nbsp; I reflashed the adapter and tested SATA and IDE HDDs.&nbsp; IDE doesn’t work, SATA works fine.&nbsp; See the following screenshots at my site:<br />
<br />
south-paw.net/downloads/Vantec Adapter IDE SATA Testing.pdf<br />
<br />
Is the failure to read IDE a firmware problem, or a case of windows installing the incorrect driver?

            Received a replacement Vantec Adapter this week.&nbsp; The Vantec tech said they tested the adapter before it went out and a pioneer DVD drive that the adapter was tested with worked, with no stoppage of data flow.&nbsp; During my testing the IDE and SATA drives
 are working as expected. Again the connection of a DVD drive results in a failure to continuing reading a DVD after a random period of time, in this trial 3 minutes and the data quit flowing to the Nero Kwik Media player. No errors from the media player just
 a frozen frame when the data stops flowing.&nbsp; I tried to check the level of the firmware loaded into the Adapter with the Prolific tool but the firmware was locked so that the tool wouldn't read the firmware level.&nbsp; At this point I am trying to find out what
 the Vantec hardware test configuration was exactly for comparison to mine at home.&nbsp; I am still waiting on the replacement ME-535U# ByteCC enclosure to arrive for testing.<br />
<br />
What does the support engineer know about Win7 usb selective suspend feature?<br />

            This last week of March I received a replacement Byte Enclosure ME-535U. I connected the enclosure to the same system I have described previously. I played a movie with Nero KwikMedia and the movie played right through till the end with no problems noted.
 The SATA/USB3 bridge chip in this replacement Byte enclosure is:<br />
<br />
VLI VL700-Q4 1110<br />
A3843R8961<br />
<br />
This is the same chip that the first enclosure had. Since one enclosure functions normally and the other does not it could be the first enclosure was defective, or the second enclosure has been updated with a new level of firmware that fixed the brief data
 flow issue that was experienced with with the first enclosure.&nbsp; Byte did not include a letter with the replacement enclosure to explain the test findings reached with the first enclosure.<br />
<br />
I think the manufacturers knew there were compatibility issues between USB3 and USB2 devices, ie. not all devices that operate flawlessly on USB2 will operate flawlessly on a USB3 connection.&nbsp; The reason I say that is this: I am old enough to remember when
 USB2 came out replacing USB1.1. Manufacturers of laptops didn't build in USB2 ports alongside USB1.1 ports.&nbsp; They only built in USB2 ports that worked with any USB1.1 device.&nbsp; This time around when USB3 came out manufacturers built in USB2 only ports alongside
 USB3.0 ports. Why else would manufacturers take the profit hit to do this if USB3 was perfectly compatible with USB2 and USB1.1/1.0 ?<br />

            Check newegg.com reviews - people having the same issues and suggest it's down to the supplied USB3 cable. &nbsp;Not sure if you fixed your problem - if you did could you supply the fix, if not then it might be worth trying the new cable;

                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is trying to install a cumulative update for windows 10 (KB4022715), and it's telling me that I have no space to install the updates. The thing is that I have windows installed on an SSD which still has 329 GB free and a HDD with 631GB free.
 Any updates other than&nbsp;KB4022715, it will update and install, but not this update. This has failed to update multiple times for about a month. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system KB4022715 failed to install on 6/13/17. this was an unusual event for my system, I checked the error code number associated with the failure and it was related to a server failure (that's not on my end, the other updates also downloaded during
 the same session also failed with the same error code). I then let it be and did not attempt to force anything from there. On 6/15/17 all of the updates downloaded and installed successfully of their own accord with no input by me to manually update however
 I had been watching for if this would happen (I did expect it to as I have seen this behavior before on other devices when viewing their update history).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this the only failure of an update recorded in your update history? Is there an error code associated that you could supply us with? Has it attempted to download and/or install more than once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that you can try if you wish is to download the update (this is a cumulative so it may be quite a large download) to your HDD then try installing it from the downloaded file (this may or may not be a .exe, it may be a .cab or a .msu file type,&nbsp;if
 you need help with that let us know)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link but be careful, don't download and or try to install the wrong one, If you are certain that your device was fully up to date before this cumulative update was released the Delta should do for you, if you're not sure the cumulative link&nbsp;should
 be used (if this is the case note that the x64 is about 1.1GB in size and the x86 is about 600MB in size).</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are using a third party anti-virus software try turning it off or better yet fully uninstalling it first then restart the device and manually check for updates again before trying the direct download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what further info that you can provide and/or let us know how it goes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard</p>

    <title>How to use the &#39;Refine&#39; option in Windows 10 search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lost beginner  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to use the &#39;Refine&#39; option in Windows 10 search</h2>
                    <p>I have a folder on my PC called media , contains a lot of music and video etc. Movies tend to have an mkv extension.</p>
<p>If I go to the media media folder and put some text in the search box , say 'harry' I get a bunch of movies with harry in the title and a bunch of songs with harry in the title - so far so good. If I then try to 'Refine' the search by selecting 'Film' in
 the Type drop down list - I get a 'No items match you search' message . </p>
<p>What do I have to do to see what files are recognized as 'film' types ( or kind:=movie as the search box gets adapted as - no idea why the terminology got changed from 'film; to 'movie' ) and how do I modify it so that mkv files are found when filtering
 on this type. Don't know if it makes a difference but vlc is my default player for files with a mkv extension , and it has no issues playing the file - this is just a search problem.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct. The <strong>Refine </strong>option allows you to refine files by all kinds of predefined types. How it search for files by
<strong>Kind </strong>was made by design and we currently have no way of setting a criteria, for an instance, letting .mkv files be defined as
<strong>Films</strong>. The .mkv file type, is considered as not supported by Windows Media Player, which could be a reason why these files are not categorized as Film or Movie by Windows. Have you tried selecting
<strong>Video</strong> instead of <strong>Film </strong>to check if you are getting search results?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>I just bought a new laptop and i want to upgrade it.</p>
<p>I will upgrade RAM memory to 8gb and buy a new graphics card.</p>
<p>But im not sure about my current graphics card is it strong enough to play gta V on minimum.</p>
<p>People say that for that game you must have 500mb vram.Im planning to buy a new graphics card with 1gb vram.</p>
<p>But im not sure if my current graphics card has 1gb.I dont want to spend money on new graphics card if current one has 1gb vram.</p>
<p>I think it has because i run new games pretty smooth.Now i just wanna ask does my card have 1 gb vram or not?I dont want to buy something that is same as my current thing.It says 64 mb..So is it 64 mb?Or it is 1gb?</p>

<h2>            So-called &#34;available&#34; gamertag issues</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
I was so excited when I found a gamertag that was "available". Until I attempted to change my gamertag to it and it said it was taken; even though when I searched it it did not exist. I spoke to support and the reasoning I was given to why this was happening
 was complete nonsense. This seems like a major flaw to me, especially being a 10+ year gold member who just wants a new gamertag. I can't be the only one who agrees with this. I already posted to xboxuservoice however 24 hours later there is still no moderator
 approval. I find this to be quite a joke considering the size and successfulness of the company Microsoft. Anyone have thoughts on this situation feel free to reply and get this topic hot. Sincerely a thoroughly dissatisfied and annoyed xbox user.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to read about your Gamertag change issues. Sometimes there are Gamertags that have reserved words, for example 'Capcom' or 'Sony', or character names from games - this is a VERY grey area, so please don't take my comments as gospel, as I am only
 speaking from experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving forward, we can only advise you to choose another Gamertag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>L</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're trying to change your gamertag but it says its unavailable. Unfortunately there are many reasons a gamertag may be unavailable. It might seem like the gamertag is unregistered
 in a search but there's a chance its tied to an old inactive or shut down account. Gamertags do get released back to the public at some times from some of these old outdated account that were holding the tags. Here's an article talking about that for a bit
 more detail: <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2016/05/16/xbox-live-gamertag-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>As the previous ambassador mentioned there could be used jst notin the same. Ontext as you are usijg</p>
<p>And no you have to use the exact context to find it. As per the privacy of the user</p>
<p>You cant force someome to change their name be cause you have a different spelling</p>

    <title>Old Windows old overwritten&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coherency  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old Windows old overwritten&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had a bunch of important files in my Windows.old folder when I upgraded from windows vista 32-bit to Windows 7 64-bit and then I had to reinstall windows 7 to update my product key, then I upgraded to windows 10.</p>
<p>Anyway I was just about to transfer all of my select files from my original vista to windows 10 and now I just have a new windows.old folder without all of my original files.</p>
<p>Did this REALLY just overwrite my original windows.old folder and discard it? Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>&gt;_&gt; if so... would system restore fix it...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Nvm about the system restore, all my old restore points are gone apparently.</p>
<p>"Everything will be left exactly where it was" right... just not everything, basically "everything that isn't anything will be left exactly where it was, fu, deal with it." Right? RIGHT?!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately in this case, Windows.old is specific only to the latest install and only archives the last install, not previous installs where the files remain stored there.&nbsp; This is why it's important to keep the files sorted into the latest User folder
 set so that they can easily be backed up by dragging the named User account or select User folders to external storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer to root those User folders in OneDrive so they're synched across all my devices while remaining rooted safely in the cloud, which has worked flawlessly for me for five years.&nbsp;

            <p>The backup image that I made after upgrading from windows vista to 7 was erased apparently, I'm assuming after reinstalling windows 7 a 2nd time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Windows discriminate against Windows.old alone?</p>
<p>Who thought up the idea of deciding to make a folder - specifically designed to protect our files during an update - the very target of deletion after an update? If it was designed to protect our old files, and Windows desperately wants to make it their
 target during an update, could Windows at least let us know ahead of time? It was protecting these files for me only days ago; why did Window's treatment of these files take such a 180 degree turn to the point to where they became the only targeted files during
 an update?</p>
<p>Why advertise in a fashion which could really be taken to court as a bad faith case by blatantly lying when making the claim:<br />
"The partition you have selected might contain files from a previous installation.
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>If it does</strong>,</span></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old.</span>"</p>
<p>The partition I selected <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">did contain files from a previous installation</span>, these files and folders
<p>These files were very important to me, I entrusted their safety to Microsoft because I thought Microsoft was a respectable company that means what it says. I have found that that is not always the case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is literally lawsuit material, if what this whole ordeal took from me was more than simply heartbreaking and had actual dollar value to it, then I would sue Microsoft. Still, It had value to me... :(
</p>
<p>I'd pay some tech guru upward of 200k to restore them sooner than buy myself a lambo; but even if I had that kind of money, I understand that they're gone now... I didn't even know they were at risk of being lost, so I didn't back them up a 3rd and 4th time
 or however many different times and ways I have to back them up before they're actually backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've kept some of those files safe and transferred them from computer to computer for nearly 10 years... the most I can do now is have my old laptop fixed and recover a very small fraction of them, maybe a 1/10 at most if I'm lucky, I really only used it
 for school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was around 25gb worth of select data, not just a sloppy quick save-all type thing... I predict that I will be bitter toward Microsoft for several years over this.</p>

            <p>This just happened to me with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>I had recently installed Windows 10 on my PC and was still in the process of sorting through data in the Windows.old directory.</p>
<p>Despite delaying the anniversary update several times, It installed last night and when it did. It completely overwrote my Windows.old directory which still had several very important directories/files in it. This is extremely frustrating.

            It's not going to help now, but a "backup" on the same drive is not a backup. If the stuff is important, you need at least one copy in another location. Assume your home will burn to the ground and plan accordingly.

            <p>This is the reason why it's critical to have all files backed up externally at all times.&nbsp; Easiest is to have an external drive to drag your active User folders to periodically.&nbsp; For more automated solutions see
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/220986/how-to-use-all-of-windows-10%E2%80%99s-backup-and-recovery-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Use All of Windows 10’s Backup and Recovery Tools.</a>&nbsp; You can even stash up to 5gb in OneDrive which will be protected in the cloud against fire and accessible anywhere by signing into OneDrive like an email account, or opening the OneDrive folder
 on your PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I've never seen file recovery software work when a drive has been formatted.&nbsp; However since the presence of a Windows.old folder means it hasn't been formatted completely, then you can try a solution like

<p>Thanks for replying, I can't seem to find the "Change connection properties", and my ipv6 was already enabled.</p>
<p>I'm still on windows ver 1803, and my os build number is 17134.286 if you need that information.</p>

<br />E. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>The Game DVR should have a pause button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jm_4051  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Game DVR should have a pause button</h2>
                    This does make sense. Having a pause button should help screen recording in the Game DVR. It dosen't make sense if the Game DVR dosen't have a pause button. If Microsoft have an update to their Game DVR and Xbox, I think I should recommend that there will
 be a pause button. Without the pause button on the Game DVR, your videos on YouTube might start to fail. And also, without the button, if you made a mistake to the video, you can't replace it because there is no pause button on the Game DVR. I think that's
 all for now.
