            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes, you cannot run Hyper-V inside another virtual machine. However there may be other<br />
combinations. Check in the VMWare, Virtual Box, and TechNet Forums (where Hyper-V<br />
is supported).<br />

<p>My brother started to play his game the other day and he hadnt unlocked CSZ and Quan Chi yet so in the spot that CSZ is suppose to be&nbsp;in there was two Skarlets. This tells me that that second spot that CSZ is in can be patched out and a DLC can be put in
 that spot BUT the real question is: Will NRS do it?</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Sleep Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pbike908  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Sleep Problem</h2>
                    <p>I've tried just about everything, and can't get my Windows 8.1 laptop to sleep timers&nbsp;to work properly.&nbsp; This problem pretty much began when I updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 (surprise, surprise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run all windows updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using screen saver</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated the BIOS and graphics drivers, and verified all other drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through all the Power Options many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through all the settings in Device manager to make sure nothing is allowed to wake the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm&nbsp; not using Homegroup</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled ipv6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the powercfg /energy report many times.&nbsp; The only thing that is requesting energy are run of the mill apps like Explorer, Chrome, and windows services</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing connected to any USB ports</p>
<p>
</p><p>The confounding thing, is that the display will always&nbsp;"turn off" properly with the timers--but won't always go to sleep.&nbsp; Also, I can always force the computer to sleep by closing the lid or pressing the sleep button on the keyboard.&nbsp; Once the computer
 goes to sleep, it never wakes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me, that If I can force sleep by closing the lid and/or by pressing the sleep button keyboard, there is nothing preventing the computer from going into sleep state.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is going into sleep state versus hibernation, because when the computer
 hibernates I have to use the power button to turn it on</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automatic sleep timer will work sometimes.&nbsp; Usually after a fresh restart and only if I have run relatively few programs and Apps and only surfed a few websites.&nbsp; The more I use the computer, the less it is likely to sleep.&nbsp; And I've run powercfg /energy
 reports at various times and can't really determine any sort of pattern as to what prevents the sleep timer from working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, no matter how much I've used the computer, I can always forces it to sleep by pressing the sleep key or closing the lid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking around the internet, including reading through this site, I've pretty much come to the conclusion that this is a well known problem with Windows 8.1 and it appears Microsoft is pretty much silent on this topic with the exception of telling folks
 to run through the usual culprits which I have been through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is indeed an unsolvable bug at this time, Microsoft could at least fess up to it so that we all stop banging our heads against the wall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to what else to try would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Karthik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very much appreciate the reply, as I haven't seen this suggestion in any web searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aspire M5-481PT</p>
<p>Intel I5-3337U 1.8 GHZ CPU</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 4000 Video Card</p>
<p>Graphics Driver 10.18.10.3621</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the instructions on how to do a clean boot, and I understand why you suggested that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't quite understand how it is that will help me solve the problem since ANYTIME I do a restart or power down the sleep timer works properly--for awhile!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, last evening the sleep timers were working properly.&nbsp; Today, I haven't started any other programs that I wasn't using last evening.&nbsp; And the sleep timers are currently not functioning.&nbsp; The display will blank, I can force sleep by closing the
 lid, or I can force sleep by pressing the sleep key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently not running anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I am running IE, Chrome, Norton, Onedrive, Icloud, ITunes, WIndows Mail App, WIndows Store, the normal background Adobe stuff, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not playing music in the background nor running a video player nor anything like that.&nbsp; Onedrive nor Icloud is doing any sort of massive synching.&nbsp; Every thing is just sort of idling away...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems to prevent it from sleeping is if I just keep using the internet--meaning the longer I generally surf the web visiting normal run of the mill sites.&nbsp; It seems like the more I surf the web, the less likely the sleep timers are to work properly.&nbsp;
 And If I close everything and restart, the timers work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, If I do the Clean Boot, I am sure it is going to work!!!&nbsp; After all, anytime I restart the sleep timers work. I am willing to do the Clean Boot, I just don't see how that it going to bring me to any sort of resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can email you the powercfg /energy reports if that helps.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I suggest you to perform a Clean Boot because&nbsp;I wanted to know whether this issue is occurring due to any software conflicts. You have already tried almost all the troubleshooting steps and the issue still persists so I guess this must be occurring due to
 some software conflicts. I understand that you are not facing that issue all the time but still I suggest you to try Clean Boot once and check if you find any difference.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I understand WHY you want me to do the clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, it is my understanding that purpose of the clean boot is to&nbsp;establish that the computer will sleep with only Microsoft services loaded.&nbsp; Since EVERYTIME I shutdown/restart the computer the sleep timers work properly, I've concluded that nothing loading
 in the start up is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND,&nbsp;If the problem is due an application I am running, then I fail to see how a clean boot is going to help me resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as programs that I am running, I have limited my self to Itunes and Internet explorer.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my earlier post, I can run these programs for "awhile" and the sleep timers will work properly.&nbsp; After "awhile" the sleep timers will no longer
 work until another shutdown/restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When one does an internet search on Windows 8.1 sleep problems, HUNDREDS of hits come back.&nbsp; And many reference that the problem only began with the Windows 8.1 upgrade.&nbsp; Some folks report back solving the problem, many report that they fail to come to a
 resolution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And there are MANY that reference that the sleep timers work for awhile and then stop and also reference that they can always force the computer to sleep by hitting the sleep key and or shutting the lid.&nbsp; And this last sentence is exactly the problem I an
 having.&nbsp; And since many report an identical situation as myself (not to mention the HUNDREDS that refer to sleep problems) I've come to the conclusion that whether&nbsp;Microsoft wants to admit it or not, Windows 8.1 did something that affected the sleep timers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the record--I can't find any reference anywhere that Microsoft has acknowledged a problem with some folks sleep timers with the Windows 8.1 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I am leaning towards doing a refresh and I will report back my findings.</p>

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform a Clean Boot because&nbsp;I wanted to know whether this issue is occurring due to any software conflicts. You have already tried almost all the troubleshooting steps and the issue still persists so I guess this must be occurring due to
 some software conflicts. I understand that you are not facing that issue all the tome but still I suggest you to try Clean Boot once and check if you find any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well Kathrik, I have been running the computer in clean boot for a couple of days now, and I am still experiencing problems with the sleep timers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that my only recourse is to reset my computer, and reinstall Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say, I am doubtful that performing a refresh will solve my problem.&nbsp; My reasoning is I have another computer (different brand) that I purchased about the same time (April 2013) that also came with Windows 8 preinstalled.&nbsp; It too experienced sleep
 problems after installing Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I did a clean install on the other laptop, and it is still having problems with the sleep timers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In performing internet searches on Windows 8.1 sleep timer issues and reading the associated end user reports, on this site as well as many others, it appears that modifications to Windows 8.1 impacted many, many computers sleep timers.&nbsp; And many users appear
 to report back that they were unsuccessful in resolving them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet Microsoft doesn't acknowledge any wide spread problems nor do they acknowledge that many users are unsuccessful in resolving them.&nbsp; In almost all instances, the users report that their sleep keys and closing the lid will always initiate sleep, however,
 the timers will not.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Karthik, I refreshed both both computers that were having sleep problems and reinstalled all of the applications that I&nbsp; most frequently use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is....The sleep timers appear to work!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that refreshing early 2013 Windows 8 computers and upgrading to Windows 8.1 is much more cumbersome that it needs to be!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 1 gigabyte of Windows 8 updates that have to installed prior to "Store" permitting the Windows 8.1 upgrade.&nbsp; This would be all fine and good, IF one could install all the updates at once.&nbsp; On BOTH computers, I could only install a few updates at
 a time or else the updates would fail.&nbsp; In once instance, I got half way through all the updates, and the update process failed and RESTORED me to the initial Windows 8 refresh--meaning I had to start all over again.&nbsp; ARGH to say the least!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Microsoft couldn't accommodate a simple Windows 8.1 update immediately after the refresh is a mystery to me...</p>
<p>

</p><p>Not a viable for option for me, as I use both Iphone and Ipad.&nbsp; I flirted with turning on and off many things in the background and my sleep problems would go away for a little while, and then return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing a fresh copy of Windows 8.1 is a pain, but it's free.&nbsp; And one can keep all their data installed.&nbsp; For me, the reinstall was totally worth it.&nbsp; I've been running 8.1 on two computers for nearly a month now and have had no sleep issues.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop File Explorer from opening extra windows when clicking drive icon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody point out a solution to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: When I click any drive icon in File Explorer, a random number of File Explorer windows will be opened (usually 1 - 3 windows). It is so weird that it happens only when I click a drive icon, but not happen when I click a folder icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are my Windows version &amp; File Explorer Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Version = Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.371]</li><li>Folder Options &gt; General &gt; Browse folder = Open each folder in the same window</li><li>Folder Options &gt; Click items as follows = Single-click, Underline icon titles only when I point at them</li><li>Folder Options &gt; View &gt; Advanced settings &gt; Launch folder windows in a separate process = no</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open File Explorer</li><li>Click any disk drive icon once</li><li>Extra File Explorer windows will be opened at random number (usually 1 - 3 windows)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note 1: The solution provided in another topic doesn't work for me ( <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files-winpc/how-do-i-stop-file-explorer-opening-a-new-window/5e013792-5a6a-45de-ba5f-40bae0e86c1c">

<p>
</p><p>Note 2: I tried changing all combinations of the Folder Options mentioned above (single/double-click, separate window, separate process) and yet I'm still facing the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :-)</p>

<h2>            How do I complain about customer service&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have a Surface Go which have a broken touchscreen. A strip about 5mm across the screen is totally unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I ran the diagnostic tests and was able to generate a repair job. And now the problem starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I am supposed to print the shipping label and the courier is to collect the packaged device. But due to some bugs, the shipping label is unable to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I chatted with 3 customer service personnel over 3 days, they keep telling me to wait for the system to generate the label.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Meanwhile I have to rearrange the pickup date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I check again today, and the shipping label is still not generating. Nor am I getting any responses from their email, supposedly assuring me that they would follow up on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. I tried emailing them, no reply even after 8 hours. So today, I went to the chat again to get help, guess what? I am no longer able to chat or request for a call back. Their last customer service personnel most probably blocked me from getting customer
 service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I complain and escalate this? Or just I just forget it, write off the faulty device and boycott Microsoft from now on?&nbsp;</p>

            Forget it, the customer service sucks like a dyson. Its basically there as a gatekeeper to stop you from getting service. My go has stopped working. Its expired. I just wanted to know about the returns process but oh no! have you tried this, have you tried
 that...its like the dead parrot sketch from Monty Python. Shame on you Microsoft. I will stick with apple. I almost came back...but with customer service like yours...forget it<br />

            Very well, there are a tiny number of account settings there, and there's even a way to turn off in-app sounds -- which I didn't want to do. There's still no vibration control.&nbsp;

            led, vibration controll is mostly not the app some tell the phone what to do that is more a phone settings controlls.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My Nexus 5X i have under Android Settings -&gt; Notfication -&gt; Led / Screen light / Vibrations settings what gonna happens when some app tell is a new notfication.
<br />
<br />
And some phone and android version dosent support some stuff that depends of what API level the app uses for what android version etc for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            I agree. I eventually managed to find the settings panel, but what a dreadful UI design. I know I'm old, but what is this obsession amongst software companies with reinventing the wheel - completely redesigning something that works so that all its users
 have to learn a new interface? Often (like this time) they get it badly wrong, and must realise this will cause their users extreme frustration. If Microsoft doesn't know what I mean, as an example: having to click on a blank space to bring up your own user
 profile - really??

<p>This new Skype for Android (and Windows 10 by the way) is truly dreadful. It took a pretty good program and rendered it almost useless, except to people who think the main reason for Skype is to explore the color palette on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hearing troubles (hearing aids), and NEED the ability to select the ring tone and vibration to ensure I am notified if a call comes in. It seems impossible to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I take a snapshot of video from the incoming call? It seeks that feature has gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in summary - added some useless things, took away some really useful things, and made it attractive to a demented parrot. Pretty bad.</p>

            <p>Hi Boob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask few question to assist you better in this regard:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* What is the Make and model you PC/Laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to check for the option in your BIOS settings. Refer the device User Manual for more assistance in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note </strong>: Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</p>
<li>
<p>Updating BIOS should only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions
 exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer the below link and see if it helps:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/want-to-set-num-lock-to-be-on-and-active-at/7b48ae6f-fa9c-4bc2-8359-81e0c5e5d6a2?auth=1"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/want-to-set-num-lock-to-be-on-and-active-at/7b48ae6f-fa9c-4bc2-8359-81e0c5e5d6a2?auth=1</span></a></span></p>

<p>This worked on my Laptop and my desktop, I don't see why you have to change the registry but MS must think it is funny to turn off the num lock. See the link below.</p>

            <p>If you want the Default to be Num Lock = on&nbsp;prior to sign-in, then the correct method is to set the&nbsp; number under that registry key (HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard) "InitialKeyboardIndicators"&nbsp;to a value 2 above the current value (from 2147483648
 to 2147483650).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After login, the Num Lock status is determined by the Num Lock status of the key when the user logged off the last time.&nbsp; So if you log off with the Num Lock on, then you will log on and the Num Lock will come on after you log on.&nbsp; The Registry key change
 is only for prior to log on.&nbsp; When the user signs off, then Windows sets the value of ""InitialKeyboardIndicators"&nbsp;under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard to 2 if the Num Lock is on and 0 if off.&nbsp; It then reads that value when the user logs in and sets
 the status accordingly.</p>

            <p>None of that works. It doesn't matter what value I set, InitialKeyboardIndicators is reset to 2 when I reboot and the num lock key is not set.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If I turn off fast reboot&nbsp;it all works as it should do</strong>. But it takes a lot longer to boot. I guess the clue is in the name 'fast reboot'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is beyond stupid. The world has never needed a num lock key. Those of us who remember the first PCs will know that the initial keyboard didn't have a separate&nbsp;numeric keypad.&nbsp; The same keys doubled as arrow keys and numeric keys. When the world moved
 on in&nbsp;1985 to having arrow keys and control&nbsp;keys separate, some idiot of an engineer at IBM&nbsp;thought that they should maintain compatibility with the old keyboard and allow the &nbsp;numeric keyboard to be arrow keys as well.&nbsp; Even though there was a perfectly good
 set of dedicated keys. There was never any reason for it and I don't know anyone that uses it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was some way to hard-code this into the keyboard so we never again get this nonsense.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It can also be set in the BIOS, so you might check there.&nbsp; I tested on 2 machines and I got the correct behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it is worth, I have almost never used the numbers on the numeric keypad (only when I was typing in a lot of data), but rather always the arrows, so to each his own.</p>

            <p>Yes, I checked the BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact when I boot up, the Num Lock light is on until Windows starts its little dance with the dots.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works OK if I reboot as well. It seems to be the 'fast boot' procedure that does something.</p>

            I am assuming that you are not able to login to your computer or you are able to login to but not able to do anything.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. Otherwise, you can resort to below

            Hi  IAngelV, this is not a good sign . ..
<br />
<br />1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, you can try rolling back to 1709, but honestly your best and probably only option is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset

            To answer your question, heck no, MS will not replace anything or pay for fixes. If you read the license terms you will see the MAXIMUM they will pay is a refund of the purchase price of Windows, US$100 or more likely less for an OEM license.  That is after you fight with their "impartial arbitrator" ...

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>

            <p>There are not likely to be any service packs for Windows 10, because Windows 10 uses a different model for updating. Windows 10 is what Microsoft calls Windows-As-A-Service, which means it's being continuously updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a brand new operating system, and like all new operating systems it needs lots of updating to fix all the early bugs and install features that were missing when it was first released. Windows 10 is due to receive two major upgrades: one in
 October and the other in Q1, 2016. You could consider those as service packs, but Microsoft has dropped that terminology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should know that&nbsp;<em>every</em> new operating system is released with lots of bugs and other problems that get worked out in the first 3 to 6 months after release. For most 'normal' people, it's best to wait 6 months before installing a new operating
 system. Tech enthusiasts, on the other hand, enjoy playing with new operating systems and dealing with the early problems. That's part of the fun. But it's not everyone's idea of fun.</p>

            <p>I don't like windows 10, therefore, I would not recommend it. I have Windows 10 Pro, which is suppost to have more features than Windows 8 and Windows 7 pro, but it doesn't. Infact, all versions of windows 10 are lacking the ability to change window border
 colors. You are strictly stuck with White color window border, which make it impossiple to see which window you are currently imputing stuff into (active), and not imputing stuff into (inactive). Also, it can get pretty hard on the eyes when the white background
 of a program meets the window border, infact, they blend in so much that you cant tell the difference between the application background, and the application window borders. THAT IS A BAD THING..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good things: start menu is back, and better support for touchscreens.</p>

            <p>Windows 10: Forever Buged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do not wish to use my PC as an experimentation device, if i want to experiment on Windows 10, i would install Windows 10 on my old machine, place it in developer mode, and enable Windows Insider mode in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Note, Since Windows 10 is now considered Windows-as-a-service, We will always have bugs in windows. I think it is sad that Microsoft is taking an OS origionally built in the 1980, and destroying it. Windows is pretty much a "piece of history", it
 is also sad that Microsoft is removing Windows Controlpanel - Something that has Been in Windows NT since Windows NT 3.0, and Windows 2.0. I want microsoft to ditch the Windows name, and make a new OS that their lazy a**'d developers can screw with as much
 as they want. This is the last time I say it - Dont screw with Windows 10. They should have stopped using the Windows name as soon as Windows 8 came out, and leave Windows Vista II (Windows 7) be the last Windows Ever. I honestly think that Windows 8, and
 Windows 10 are worse than Windows Melenium Edition. It is pretty bad when i can get Windows ME to start up and shut down faster than Windows 8, and Windows 10 could. Windows ME is running on top of the line hardware for it's time, and Windows 10 i have running
 on very descent hardware (at least it is too me) - an Intel Ionic core 7 (AKA Core I7), Nvidia GEFORCE GTX 965M, 8 GB of Ram, 1TB seagate drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it so slow? Well, it is slow because Microsoft went and integrated a million useless apps that i consider bloatware, and then made it imposiple to uninstall many of them.</p>

<h3> pauline.h9  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I open mass folders at the same time&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    One of my laptops died on me a few years ago, and this summer I took them in to get the information and pictures off it. That went fine, but the only thing is, is that for all of my pictures, each picture is in it's own folder, in other folders. I have
 2000+ photos, so it's going to take me a long time to drag/cut paste all of them into one new folder. Any suggestions on how to do it? Thanks.

<p><strong><span>Hi Cjthan,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You can check for the compatibility of a device at the compatibility center of Windows 7. Refer to the link provide
 below -</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=adm8511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=adm8511</span></span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>We currently do not have any information from the manufacturer with the compatibility of the device with Windows 7. You may refer to the below link
 for FAQ’s on compatibility and you may provide suggestion for the device to be included in the compatibility center -<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/faq.aspx#faq1_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/faq.aspx#faq1_6</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Also, I would suggest you to try installing the drivers for the convertor in compatibility mode (using vista or XP)
 and check if it works on Windows 7.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If a program written for an earlier version of
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span> does not run correctly; use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program.
 To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.<br />
<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link for step by step assistance on running the program compatibility mode-<br />

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may use the hardware and devices troubleshooter and check if it lists any issues-</span></span><span><br />

    <title>ALL OF A SUDDEN MY COMPUTER IS NOT BOOTING AND I AM PISSED. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexandria frandsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            ALL OF A SUDDEN MY COMPUTER IS NOT BOOTING AND I AM PISSED.</h2>
                    I have an eMachines e725. It's up there in years tech wise, my mom got it about 8 years ago. But we've kept the drivers updated and done needed maintenance, taking it to a small repair shop to have it checked up on every other year or so. Works like a
 charm!&nbsp;<br />
My mother gave me this laptop around Thanksgiving. I use it for gaming as well as assignments for college. I don't run anything too rough on it, the newest game I have installed is Portal, which is maybe 10 years old?<br />
Well, Monday night, I went to take a break and decided to play the Sims 2. The Sims 2 works perfectly on this laptop, doesn't trouble it at all. However, this time the entire thing froze. I tried CTRL-ALT-DELETE, nothing. So I turned it off via the power button.
 I powered it back on, nothing. It powers up to the eMachines logo with an f2 setup option, however, there is a BIOS password that no one remembers, so that's out. That's the only button that pops up. Them it goes to a black screen with no cursor. The fan and
 hard drive are still running, all the appropriate lights are on as they should be...it's just a blank, black screen. And the only way out of it is to press the power button. And then it flashes a green screen before it shuts off, which concerns me but I'm
 sure is nothing bad. It's a quoick flash before it turns off. I KNOW the display works fine. If it didn't it wouldn't be able to display the logo, would it?<br />
<br />
My concern is that I could have a particularly nasty virus on it. My mom had Norton Antivirus running on it for years but the contract expired and I, being a poor college student, can't afford to renew it. So therefore I've kept a close eye on the task manager
 and my systemx86 folder for anything suspicious. I'm not am expert oioin those matters, but I did some looking around to see what I needed to keep an eye on, researching the names of files and applications that I was concerned about.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And then over the holidays my sister was using my laptop and got onto firedrop.com which from what I understand is a very virus-infested site. She downloaded a few things but I deleted those files. However I'm sure I've missed a few, and I'm concerned that
 one may have um...ruined my computer. There have been a few viruses scurrying around but I've contained most of them.<br />
<br />
I've thought that the computer itself has been acting a lot like it needs to have Windows 7 reinstalled on it--recently my grandfather had to do the same with his laptop and it acted in a similar matter, thiugh it is a 5 year old HP laptop. I have decided not
 to update to Windows 10 until updates and support for Windows 7 ends, I'm quite comfortable where I'm at OS-wise. Fortunately, I have a CD on its way. I just want to verify that I'm on the right track. Is there anything I might be forgetting or missing?

            <p>Hi Alexandria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern, we suggest that you perform <strong>SFC</strong> and <strong>
DISM</strong>. The S<span>ystem file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption.
</span><span>When it cannot repair the damage, DISM should be run to fix as many errors as possible.</span><span> You may follow the steps provided by
<strong>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</strong> on his <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">article</a></strong>.</span></p>

            <p>Statistically speaking, an 8 year old Gateway laptop is 98% likely to be dead.&nbsp; Running without good antivirus protection is a fools game.&nbsp; And, by the way, Norton is about the worst of them all.</p>
<p>

            So last night I turned on my computer, anticipating getting beep codes. I had my BIOS programmer (??) beep codes page loaded here on my tablet so I could decipher them, and after about 15 minutes of waiting, system repair loaded. got the "Windows cannot
 repair this system automatically" dialogue message and I looked at the problem signatures until #7, &nbsp;which read "NoOsInstalled," sure enough. I didn't know the st 6, so I actually took a picture of the rest of the codes, I'll attach the image to this reply.

<p>
</p><p>The OS CD arrived in the mail on Friday and I went to run it. I put the disk in and then waited. System repair ran again, and this time it gave me an option for "advanced options" and one of them was factory reset. So I factory reset it, and it works like
 new!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have to say you are one very technologically-ignorant fellow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. "An 8 year old Gateway laptop is 98% likely to be dead." If you properly maintain your computer, it can last for a very long time. Example: my grandpa has had the same desktop since 2004. He updates and maintains it regularly and here it is, 2017 and
 it works wonderfully. Then again, the only original part left is the actual tower. However he does still have all of his files and save data from 2004. He hasn't had the need to replace the entire thing and lose everything. He does have his HP laptop as more
 of a "just because I can" thing. He takes it with him when he's on the road for extended periods of time however it's mainly used for when the grandkids are over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "Running without good antivirus is a fools game." Okay but the thing is is that I can't afford it. I'm in college, I can't afford that stuff. So unless YOU are willing to pay for it...I'm pretty good at figuring out what is a virus and what to do about
 it. I have ad blockers on my web browser and nothing can download without administrative consent. The administrator is me, and I always review the source and the log information before I accept, even if I know it's me (for example, when I'm downloading updates
 for games and such.) I'm a bit of a task manager ****. If it's not running by Microsoft or my system, I'm rather intent on keeping a very close eye on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. "And, by the way, Norton is about the worst of them all." Actually in all the years I've used a computer with Norton, there has never once been a virus come through with that antivirus. The same is said for everyone else I've met running Norton. Yes,
 they are pushy and obnoxious, however they aren't "the worst of them all." Go to Avast for that one. The censorship is a little annoying at times, however it is very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I'm actually 400 miles away from home for school without a car or gas money, so I can't go to my local repair shop. So...</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. "We are volunteer advisors." Exactly. Advise me as what I should do, not criticize me. I'm not telling you to fix my computer. I'm asking what I should do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Oh, and I'm sure you would like to know this: a factory reset. Easy way to fix it. I put in the OS disc and reset the whole thing and it works like new. As a matter of fact, I'm using it now to type this reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. "Odds are very high, the disk drive is done for." Actually, no, it's just fine. Thanks. I didn't even have to take the damn thing apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. "They just don't last long, and not with games, especially." This system has been running the same games for years and hey, it's 8 years later and it still works. Must be doing SOMETHING right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you, though.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft virtual wifi miniport adapter</h2>
                    After a recent update of windows I can no longer access the internet through my wireless card.&nbsp; The problem is the virtual wifi miniport adapter.&nbsp; I have read all the forum answers to this same problem.&nbsp; I have disabled, uninstalled, updated driver online
 and nothing fixes it.&nbsp; I have the code 31 problem and the only way I can get online is by wired connection.&nbsp; I didn't buy a laptop to be tied to a desk and a wire.&nbsp; I have even tried to install a USB wireless card and it doesn't work due to some of the same
 errors.&nbsp; I have tried restoring back to the point before the update and nothing works.&nbsp; If anyone out there has answers to this problem other than the ones already posted I would appreciate it.

            Unfortunately you can't "merge" two accounts in one. As for your second question you should elaborate some more in the info you are requiring.&nbsp;
