<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 running at 10 fps with a gtx 1050</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've finally bought forza horizon 4, and as I start the game, everything looks good, it put the graphics on medium, just like in the demo, and I start playing, as it finally loads, I see that the game is running at 10 to 15 fps, and putting it on
 lowest settings, or lower resolution doens't help, for context, I got an i5 7400, a gtx 1050 2GB, with 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and in the demo, it runs at 60 to 80, on the same medium settings, climbing to almost 150 when on lowest, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: In the full game, whenever I try to run the benchmark, the game just crashes.</p>

            That's really strange. The game should be running good and should look beautiful. Have you checked to see if there are any updates available for the game or even for your graphics card?

<p>That is for forza horizon 3, so the step 2 won't be possible, but I will try the other methods, to see if it helps</p>

</p><p>EDIT: Nope, it did nothing, still 400+fps while loading, and sudden drop to 10+ fps, followed by the end of the loading screen, and the car loading</p>

<p>Yes, you can. If this user is not under your contacts list yet, add this user using the contact's Skype name or email address in the search directory on your Skype&nbsp;application. Once you are connected in Skype, you can initiate a video call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To initiate a call, you can follow steps provided in this support article: <em>

<p>Adding a country code is for calling the number and not the Skype account. For you to initiate a video call with a contact, make sure that you are initiating a call to a Skype account and not a phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you are initiating a call to a Skype account, use the search directory and enter the Skype name or email address of your contact. Once the account you are looking for appears in the search results, click on that contact and click the video
 icon from the chat window.</p>

<h2>            Lost files from Windows after restart</h2>
                    <p>Hey community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a month or so ago I updated my computer after not updating it for a while and in doing so after my computer turned on it removed a bunch of my files on my desktop, my Chrome didn't remember anything I did (bookmarks and cookies) since August 2015, my taskbar
 had files removed and my desktop folders disappeared.</p>
<p>I have posted about this here:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-reset-after-windows-update/06bfc6eb-6ac3-4500-92df-423a63b6940b#&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I found my files inside Users&gt;(me)&gt;Desktop and found all my files missing from desktop (I saved it all in one folder called DESKTOP 2), everything else I just decided to live with it and move on. Someone mentioned creating a recoverable system
 image and I managed to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I had internet issues to which the problem usually is solved by restarting my PC which I went on to do. After coming back from the shop and checking my PC, the internet worked again. &nbsp;(No Updates)</p>
<p>Now the issue here is that it recovered back to the state of my PC before the first restart with the updates (All chrome bookmarks are present, so are all the icons on my desktop and taskbar), and I should be happy, but I am actually incredibly angry right
 now. I had moved on already and started using my computer normally only to have it revert back to the old image. This means everything I have done the past month does not exist. ALSO All the folders on my desktop got removed again, I went to the folder where
 I found the files the first time, but now it just says that the files are empty. So all the portfolio stuff I have REWORKED on the past month doesn't exist, nor does anything I have worked on FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the recoverable system image, it does not exist as Windows does not recognize I created it, as it does not recognize me doing anything the past month. It basically just erased a month of PC life + Extra files because why not. 20 minutes ago I had
 150GB of space left, now I have 600GB. So it DID delete my files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions</p>
<p>Why did the first thing happen, when I updated windows and all the files and icons were placed in a different location? (I know they weren't missing based on the amount of space left on my C Drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did this happen after restarting my computer a second time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this happen every time I restart my computer, how will I know for sure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to prevent this from happening in the future? (As I'm sure I can literally do nothing about this other than just sit and be incredibly &nbsp;frustrated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I seem frustrated and angry that is because I am. I lost 3 years worth of work for just restarting my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- LoveGiant</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: A little tiny update. I found 'some' of the files that are missing in recent places. But when I double click on them, a pop-up appears saying "the file has been moved or deleted, remove this icon?" Still frustrated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue apart from updating?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also realize the inconvenience you are experiencing due to data loss issue. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovering lost data in Windows can be the most annoying kind of data loss, simply because the file has usually been deleted because of user error. The important thing here, as with any kind of data recovery, is to keep calm, and think about what you’re
 doing. Act rashly and you make it harder to recover that file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find a file on your computer or you accidently modified or deleted a file, you can restore it from a backup (if you're using Windows backup) or you can try to restore it from a previous version. Previous versions are copies of files and folders
 that Windows automatically saves as part of a restore point. Previous versions are sometimes referred to as shadow copies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>refer this article and check.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Recover lost or deleted files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17119/windows-7-recover-lost-deleted-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17119/windows-7-recover-lost-deleted-files</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: To restore a previous version of a file or folder that's included in a library, right-click the file or folder in the location where it's saved, rather than in the library. For example, to restore a previous version of a picture that's included in
 the Pictures library but is stored in the My Pictures folder, right-click the My Pictures folder, and then click Restore previous versions.</p>

</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Back in June it sounded like your user profile became corrupted (somehow) and when that happens and Windows can't login to your profile properly it creates a new/temporary profile for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may recall seeing a message similar to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been logged on with Temporary profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>That explains why when you did get to the desktop all of the stuff you usually see is missing and all the things associated with your original login are missing of don't work the same way...&nbsp; it is just as if you created a new user account on your system
 and logged in with it...&nbsp; that user would only see that new (mostly empty) desktop.&nbsp; That is what you would expect to see for a new user and a new user would not have Chrome knowledge from your original login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happens it is extremely unlikely that all the files and things associated with your original user profile have been deleted or removed from the system - they are still there under your original profile but you just can't see them while you are
 logged in to this temporary profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already discovered that what you thought was missing was really still on your system under your original username in the Users folder, right?&nbsp; You desktop and other files were still there and never really got deleted but nobody (except me) recognized
 the corrupted profile problem and you did not reply to my post back in June or you would not have had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of a corrupted user profile you have not lost any files, you do not need to read any articles about how to recover lost or deleted files or data recovery (unless you want to waste your time and potentially make things worse).</p>
<p>Then you took your PC to a shop (?) and who knows what they did or don't do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who knows how your original user profile became corrupted but it is usually not a difficult situation from which to recover with no data loss (all your stuff is still on your system).&nbsp; You can't "fix" your corrupted profile, but you can make a new user profile
 and copy all but the suspicious/corrupted files from your old user account to the new user account and be on your way:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not recognizing or understanding the original problem of a corrupted user profile back in June and/or getting bad advice is most likely the largest contributing factor to your mixed up and woeful situation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" sent you on a wild goose chase back in June and this Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" is sending you on another wild goose chase now and neither seems to recognize what the original problem was.</p>

            <p>Yes, it did indeed seem like I was talking to a bot when chatting with one of these so called "experts". I am not sure about seeing a popup message of "logged in with temporary profile" but have since then realized that my profile was corrupt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time I updated my windows my files were in my original profile under Users&gt;(profilename)&gt;Desktop&gt;Desktop 2, and so I just copied that folder back onto my desktop and continued on with my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second time I restarted (yesterday) I couldn't find this folder. The chat bot just blamed it on malware on my PC and several other reasons (basically anything but Windows), but I highly doubt that is the issue as it has worked for several years unscathed
 now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a program called Recuva right now, and afterwards will work on fixing my corrupted profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and comment!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At least in the first case you know that the your files (desktop, etc.) were not really missing or deleted and were still on your system but just not in the place they would be if your original profile was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This comes up once in a while in the MS Community where folks <em>freak out! </em>
when they log in to an almost empty desktop and don't see any of their Quick Launch icons and can't see any/many of their installed programs in All Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then begins the theories...&nbsp; your HDD is corrupted, you have have malware, try Safe Mode, try Clean Boot, try sfc /scannow,try System Restore, try Repair install, try waving your magic wand, etc.&nbsp; (all things to "try" and "check if it helps") but all one
 needs to do is check the Users folder and find their original user name and all the stuff is right there.&nbsp; Then you just have to follow the instructions to fix a corrupted profile.&nbsp; But now they have wasted a day or two trying things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can "fix" your corrupted profile.&nbsp; Something is wrong with one of these files in that User folder:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Ntuser.dat</li><li>Ntuser.dat.log</li><li>Ntuser.ini</li></ul>
<p>Which is why you don't copy those to your newly created user profile - or you will bring the problem along with them and then you will have the same problem again when you restart because your "new" profile is now corrupted adding another level of new profiles
 (you didn't do that did you?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recuva seems to be a pretty good program and it has helped lots of folks so I hope that works out.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows setup cannot find a location to store temporary installation files&#34;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've recently decided to make the switch to ssd and I've just received it today. &nbsp;It's a 64 gb Corsair model and I'm planning to primarily use it for Windows and a few other often used applications. &nbsp;I've formatted the drive to MBR and have a single partition
 allocating all memory (64 gb) but for some reason Windows is refusing to copy any files to the ssd. &nbsp;I've got Windows 7 64-bit currently running on the same system through a hdd, I'm not sure if this is the correct way to go about transferring Windows files
 between drives but if anyone is able to help that would be much appreciated.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Intel graphics control panel</h2>
                    Intel graphics control panel question: I have a Lenovo Thinkpad R500 running Windows 10, with Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1) graphics. I can't bring up the Intel graphics control panel. I have the impression
 it's not available because the age of the Thinkpad makes Windows 10 drivers not available. Any answers?

            I am having the same problem. The video is an onboard Intel adapter. I have installed Windows 10 twice with the same results. During install the resolution is correct and the full screen is used but once Windows install is complete the Microsoft Generic
 driver is used and only 2 resolutions are available which give me just 2/3 of the monitor screen. I can't find any 32bit Windows drivers for Intel on there site.

    <title>DLC Between Multiple Xbox One Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DLC Between Multiple Xbox One Accounts</h2>
                    
<p>So I don't know if this is actually a problem with my Xbox or if it's just a ridiculous new thing Microsoft are pushing on us but I don't appear to be able to use any content that my brother redeems on his account. We have 2 accounts on the Xbox One currently
 and I purchased the console with an install code for Call of Duty Ghosts. The problem is, he redeemed this on his account and now I am not able to use the content as it asks me to either put in a disc or redeem a code for the content I am trying to play.</p>
<p>I have the same problem when trying to use some DLC for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. I am trying to play the Freedom Cry DLC which we both payed 50/50 for because we put together for games and DLC that we both enjoy to save us both some money but again,
 it was purchased on his account so it just takes me to the store where I can buy it for £7.50.<br />
<br />
Is it telling me that I need to purchase two copies of EVERY game or DLC that I want to play costing effectively twice the money and taking up twice the space than is necessary?<br />
This has never been a problem on my Xbox 360 where I have been able to successfully share every DLC and game I have with my brother without anything like this happening. I am especially annoyed at the fact that I can't play COD Ghosts because it is a digital
 copy and not a CD so there will be no other way for me to play it other than forking out another £40-50 on the game so we can play it on both accounts.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To share DLC between profiles on the same console you need to have the console set as the home console.</p>
<p>So while signed into the account that owns the DLC you need to go to the settings app then select the set home console option.</p>
<p>This option also allows you to share your gold membership with other profiles on your console as well.</p>

<p>So I'm having a bit of a problem. I downloaded some dlc for an arcade game on my boyfriends profile. We both have a profile on our main console, and I thought I would be able to use it, because when we play Ghosts (COD) I can use anything he's downloaded
 as long as he's signed in.. but for some reason even with him signed in I can't play the Kingdom of Kelflings DLC that I downloaded on his account through mine..
</p>
<p>Is this some new rule that Xbox is enforcing? I've tried transferring the licences to the console and re-downloading it, and nothings letting me play it on my account..
</p>
<p>Care to help a girl out?</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! I'm very sorry to see any issues with DLC you may be having. The ability to share the DLC is based on the publisher; Call of Duty games are notorious for DLC not being able to be shared. If you are curious about a specific game's DLC and it's ability to be shared between accounts, please reach out to the publisher of that game. This thread is over a year old. If you need further assistance, please post up a new thread detailing what you're running into and troubleshooting you've completed. This way our community can get you the individual support that works best on the forums. :)</p>

You can't change the default font or font color used for items in Windows. But you can make all of the text (and other things like icons) on your screen larger, or you can change the text size for specific items without changing the size of anything else on
 the screen. </p>
<p><br />
<b>Refer this link to change the size of fonts:<br />

<p><span><br />
<strong><span>To install a new font on your PC, first you have to download it from a website, a network, or software.</span></strong><br />
<br />
Once the font is downloaded, press and hold or right-click the font you want to install, and then tap or click Install.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Tip:</span></strong> You can also install a font by dragging it into Fonts in Control Panel.</span></p>

    <title>Not able to open old version dosshell.exe in full screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not able to open old version dosshell.exe in full screen</h2>
                    While trying to run an old version of 'Dosshell.exe'&nbsp; from within win 7, even after adjusting with the compatibility wizard, it keeps returning to the di-box stating&nbsp; "this pgm cannot run in fullscreen mode" with choices ignore and cancel, neither of which
 accomplish anything.&nbsp; The familiar screen partially begins with the dosshell header and ver. #, but the window does not populate with the various drive letters\contents.&nbsp; any thoughts??&nbsp; P.S. the fullscreen issue shouldn't matter as I unchecked that option
 under properties menu regardless. <br />

<p>Why are you trying to use old version of Dosshell.exe?</p>

            <p>Below are some rough notes of mine which may offer a few clues even if they are not 100% relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The issue occurs because the Vista device drivers do not support running all of the DOS video modes. The Vista device drivers are based on the Windows Vista Display Driver Model (WDDM).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be able to work around this problem by installing the Microsoft
 Windows XP version of the video drivers for your video adapter".</p>

<h2>            Problems with Windows 10 Tablet Mode on Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Trying to help a friend solve problem with WIndows 10. &nbsp;Purchased new desktop computer and it was working fine. &nbsp;Apparently he did something that put it into Tablet mode. &nbsp; After a great deal of difficulty, I was able to restore the desktop but the monitor
 displays two boxes in the center of the screen. &nbsp;One is vertical and is solid line, the second is horizontal and is dotted line. &nbsp; Would seem to reflect the use of a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the instructions to go back to the desktop mode. &nbsp;However, the instructions direct you to go to the settings menu and click on "make windows more touch friendly." &nbsp;Have been unable to find this menu item. &nbsp; &nbsp;Cannot find anything on the web
 that addresses the issue of these "phantom" rectangle outlines and how to get rid of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Monitor wont turn on even when pc is running - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Monitor wont turn on even when pc is running</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
Okay so this occuring problem started off on last Saturday when i was playing game. My computer froze, which forced me to force shut down. When i turn on, it seems fine, so i decided to retest it by playing another game. It froze again. So this time, thinking
 its my graphic driver, i went to check if my driver was up to date, which it was. I even tried to remove graphic card and reinsert it in but it didnt resolve the issue. I checked the gpu, by testing my old one, which has worked for me before i change to my
 newest one, but the same problem occurred. After this, i went to check reliability report, and it said its hardware error (livekernelevent 117). Confused, i went to do some research and it said to update driver which its already up to date. I tried reinstalling
 windows twice, once by myself and the other time was with helps from a Window answer desk's assistant. It seems to have solved the problem but I was wrong, and it crashed again. I did some more researched and found other alternative, to clear CMOs and reset
 bios on motherboard, but it didnt help. Now my monitor wont evem turn on. My monutor is set to turn on automatically when i turn my pc on. Im running out of leads and am desperate for helps or tips on what is the possible problem here.<br />
<br />
Pc Specs: Custom build<br />
Windows 10<br />
<br />
-Monitor: Asus 60hz monitor (forgot the other details)&nbsp;<br />
-CPU: core i5 4770k quad-core&nbsp;<br />
-CPU has water cooling&nbsp;<br />
-Motherboard: Gigabyte z97x gaming 3<br />
-GPU (old): Geforce Gtx 760 (Asus oc2 edition)&nbsp;<br />
-GPU (new): Geforce Gtx 980 (Asus oc2 edition)&nbsp;<br />
-PSU: Evga superNOVA 1000 g2<br />
-1tb HDD&nbsp;<br />
-500gb external drive<br />
-2 8gb RAM sticks<br />
Nvidia driver: newest 361.xx hotfix<br />
<br />
Peripheral:<br />
-Razer DeathAdder Chroma<br />
-Razer BlackWidow Chroma&nbsp;<br />
-Mad Catz 7.1 surround sound gaming headset<br />
<br />
As you can see, its a pretty decent rig for gaming. So i get furious when theres something wrong with it<br />
<br />
Now i've been using my computer with my old gpu for a year, and i've only made the change to gtx 980 during Christmas 2015. So i dont know whats wrong.<br />
<br />
GPU not over heated (Checked with asus build in monitoring software)<br />
<br />
CPU has liquid cooling/not overheated (checked with cpu monitoring software)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
GPU came factory overclocked<br />
<br />
So its either motherboard, PSU or the windows 10 new updates...?<br />
<br />
Any tips would help&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fm.bestofmedia.com%2fsfp%2fimages%2fdesign%2fusr%2fsmilies%2fsmile.gif" />&nbsp;</div>

            I tried using windows 10 media tools on my usb, and it doesnt seem to show anything. Its a desktop. I also suspected its gpu hardware errors, so i tried to change wires and also tried my old one again (760 was working fine with my desktop for a year) but
 that graphic card doesnt show anything either.

            ok...great so you know it's not the monitor nor the video cards...did you custom build this computer?... any other pc cards installed remove them....you can try removing the memory cards one @ a time too...so we can eliminate everything besides the mother
 board{which would be the last culprit} I guess.*john <br />

            <p>I used to build and dis mantle and do minor computer repairs..and being an electronic technician I know how to troubleshoot...it's hard to do it via email with out actually working on it...could be a bad ROM, defective audio card, hard drive , power supply
 missing voltage, ...video card{we dismissed that}...main pc board{mother brd}...unlikely but it does happen...</p>
<p>My old 2003 hp small factor is running more than it should but still keeps on going....some electronic circuits can really take it eh?...hee hee</p>
<p>Please let us know your results Wilson...keep on experimenting....don't get hosed.*john</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - .NET Framework 4.6 Advanced Services</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to know what's the difference between NET Framework 4.6 Advanced Services and .NET Framework 3.5.</p>
<p>Both are on Windows Features, but&nbsp;only the 4.6&nbsp;has the&nbsp;box checked. </p>
<p>Some days ago Windows Update tried to install &nbsp;"Microsoft-Windows-NetFx3-OnDemand-Package.cab", but it failed.</p>
<p>I would like to know the difference between them and what should I do for&nbsp;to have this update.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            microsoft account messes up keyboard settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 PC´s </p>
<p>one windows 10 with an azerty keyboard</p>
<p>one with Windows 8.1 with a qwerty keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>both are linked to my Microsoft account but switching between pc´s is very hard as when I put my one pc to qwerty on next login on the other one it switches the azerty pc to qwerty and the other way its the same so to be able to work with it you switch it
 back to azerty but then the qwerty pc is switched ton azerty on the next login</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is very frustrating, why is this a synced online setting while this should be system hardware dependent... or at least keep these settings stored per system... people sometimes log on on different pc´s that can be quite different in configuration</p>
<p>
</p><p>how can I solve this other then disconnecting my Microsoft account on one of my pc´s?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I had the same problem and the solution is easy.</p>
<p>In Win 10, go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync your settings</p>
<p>Switch off under Individual sync settings: Language preferences</p>
<p>And you're done.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Headset Microphone not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luke stone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset Microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been having some trouble getting my Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headset microphone working and was wondering if there was anything I've missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 8.1 freshly installed on a custom-built desktop using an Intel i5 quadcore processor on a MSI motherboard. I'm using Realtek HD Audio Manager for my audio drivers. I've made sure that all my drivers are up to date and windows troubleshooter
 has not detected any problems. I've also made sure the microphone is enabled and set as a default device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue is this, I'm using a headset splitter adapter to separate the headphone feed from the microphone feed, when plugged in (using either the motherboard jacks in the rear or the daughter board jacks in the front) the headphones will work fine without
 a hitch, when the microphone is plugged in Realteck will ask me to identify it, and once I set it as a microphone I can see the device on the audio manager. The headset microphone has three buttons, two for volume and another that is supposed to be a pause
 function, but only when pressing those buttons does any sound register on the mic. The green/red bar shows the mic not registering my voice, or any other ambient sound, the only thing that will register as sound is the clicking of those buttons. This wouldn't
 be a problem if I was more proficient in Morse code, but I was really hoping to be able to speak through my mic.</p>
<p><br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Stone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that the headset Microphone is not working on your Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some hardware conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you tried connecting the headset Microphone to a different computer?</li><li>As you mentioned you have run Windows troubleshooter are you referring to Windows audio troubleshooter?</li></ol>
<p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you have not <strong>run audio troubleshooter</strong>, I would suggest you to follow the steps to
<strong>run audio troubleshooter </strong>and check.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + C</strong> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
under Settings.</li><li>Now type Play audio in the search option.</li><li>Click on <strong>Play audio troubleshooter</strong> to run the <strong>troubleshooter.</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to check if microphone works using Sound Recorder app. Sound Recorder is an app you can use to record audio for up to three hours per recording file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try adjusting the microphone volume and check. Refer to section <strong>“How can I adjust the microphone volume”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sound Recorder app for Windows: FAQ</strong></p>

<p>Using the Sound Recorder app I was able to get sound as before, but not of my voice. The only sounds recorded occurred when I clicked one of the three buttons on my headset mic. The result being a mostly silent recording with the occasional clicking noise.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Gerry Cornell</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using MSI FX420 Model with Intel Core i5 2nd Gen Processor with 8gb RAM and with a RADEON HD 6470 M Graphic Driver-</p>
<p>
</p><p>*when i install the driver from the CD it says RADEON HD 6470M which ive been using since 2011 and not having any problems since then. but lately when i clean install the windows because of the blue screen i decided to use this driver again but got the same
 problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i download the graphic driver from the offical site of msi&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.msi.com/product/notebook/FR420FX420.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>i got the RADEON 7200M which is also working good but lately when i try it again after suffering from constant blue screen i still have no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>i only get the BLUE SCREEN thing since last week of January</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply and sorry for taking me this long to provide you all the files needed since i am having a hard time dealing with my computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>here is the mini dump file i gather: *i am on safe mode when i get this file*</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://1drv.ms/1KSe3gm</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>here is the driver view exported file: *i decided to disable my graphic card so i can normal boot my pc and install the driver view so i can generate this report when i didn't disable the graphic drivers on device manager i got the bluescreen*</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://1drv.ms/1KSerLU</p>
<p>
</p><p>and here is the exported System information *disabled driver to get on normal boot when i generate this report</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Sir</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some reason intel auto detect software cant detect any new drivers for me to get updated. the graphic to be precised&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and i think i forgot to mention that i have a SWITCHABLE GRAPHIC maybe the reason why ATI installed on Intel device im not so sure about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have updated the drivers but unfortunately i am still suffering the same problem when i tried to normally boot up my computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>also about the program i have non of them installed on my computer but i have an adobe photoshop i just dont have the lightroom thing</p>
<p>
</p><p>for now i am using my computer without any graphic driver and i didn't have any blue screen, or laggy issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope that its not a hardware problem since the graphic on my computer is non removeable</p>
<p />

    <title>Windows 10, Windows Update, Headset microphone issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregfisk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, Windows Update, Headset microphone issues</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent windows update, it caused issues with my sound card.&nbsp; I have a Sound Blaster Z, with a pair of stereo speakers with subwoofer plugged into the port on the back of the card.&nbsp; After the update, the speakers wouldn't work.&nbsp; Windows did
 something that messed up the ports, and I had to jump the speaker plug from port to port on the card before I found one where it piped the sound in again.&nbsp; It has done that before, and each time, it's annoying as blazes because it means you have to verify
 that all the functions are still working.&nbsp; And that all the programs like windows media still work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there's more.&nbsp; Before, my friends and I were playing online video games using microphone headsets, the Corsair VOID versions.&nbsp; They worked just fine, and we didn't have to do anything involved to get them to allow chat in our games like Rainbow Six Siege,
 which we all play through Steam and on Windows 10 desktop computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after the recent updates, we discovered that we couldn't hear ourselves talking anymore.&nbsp; Some games worked, some games didn't.&nbsp; Most didn't.&nbsp; We tried running troubleshooters, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers for the head sets, running diagnostics,
 checking the windows SOUND control panel settings, all the usual stuff.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to fix the issue.&nbsp; The Sound tab showed that Windows was hearing us speaking into the mics, and showing the green indication volume bars that show windows can hear our
 voices inputting.&nbsp; But nobody online could hear them.&nbsp; Windows is blocking the outgoing audio somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only 'fix' that we have been able to contrive is to go into the windows SOUND tab, then in the PLAYBACK tab, DISABLE your speakers, and any other peripheral hardware that uses audio.&nbsp; This includes VR helmets, webcams, everything.&nbsp; Leave NOTHING but
 the microphone headset device as your primary PLAYBACK device, and primary RECORDING device in the recording tab of windows SOUND.&nbsp; Make sure everything else is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only then will you be able to speak to each other in online games using your mic headset.&nbsp; It's annoying to have to go into your sound settings and disable everything when you want to play games online and use your headset, then turn them on again when you're
 done.&nbsp; It didn't do this before.&nbsp; And it shouldn't be doing it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I share this information for the benefit of others who may be having this issue.&nbsp; And also as a plea for help to Microsoft, who created this issue with their update.&nbsp; Somehow you messed things up in the sound settings so that microphone headsets don't broadcast
 audio.&nbsp; I urge you to FIX this in your next update.&nbsp; Find out whatever it was you did to the sound settings, which is causing this conflict and fix it - or reverse it.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>
My OS is windows 10 and i had the same issue my Logitech Orbit Sphere AF it stopped working so i went out and bought a new Logitech c920 compatible with USB 0.3 but same thing is happening my PC tells me the device is working properly to change to USB 0.2 as
 it does not work in USB 0.3 now i checked this before i purchased the new webcam and as it is a plug and play device i would have thought that the system would recognise it and load the drivers etc: but no not in Windows 10 i used Device Manager to locate
 all USB devices and updated the drivers but still no luck i have tried every fix possible to get the device to work and have run out of options now. &nbsp;I would like to add that Windows 7 was a much better system by far and i never had issues like this when i
 used it, if it isn't broke don't fix it i say but since upgrading to Windows 10 which i thought would be a great idea i have had nothing but issues on all levels and i am so sorry now that i did make the change. Even Windows Vista was better than Windows 10
 and that was one of the worst programs i used until now. Please anybody help me if you have found a fix for this issue it would be much appreciated and i thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>

    <title>Skype for Business opens blank screen and won&#39;t enable login - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype for Business opens blank screen and won&#39;t enable login</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 latest patch level and Skype for Business latest patch level.</p>
<p>for some reason, Skype login stopped working and instead of connecting it pops up a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event Viewer:</p>
<p><span>The program lync.exe version 16.0.4654.1000 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Security and Maintenance control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>Process ID: 2b20</span></p>
<p><span>Start Time: 01d3b1288b361c52</span></p>
<p><span>Termination Time: 4294967295</span></p>
<p><span>Application Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\lync.exe</span></p>
<p><span>Report Id: 2e244546-9ebe-4823-9cd0-af99a9a92f26</span></p>
<p><span>Faulting package full name: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Faulting package-relative application ID:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>whatever account name I use to try and login to Skype pops up that blank screen, so this is not account issue.</p>
<p>connecting through another laptop/desktop/mobile with the same account works, hence its probably local issue on the laptop I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed some articles online (delete Skype Tracing directory and so on) and even uninstalled and reinstalled Office.</p>
<p>that didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone is familiar with this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Haim</p>
<p />

<p>Hello Haim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you posting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the "<span style="font-style: italic">The program lync.exe version 16.0.4654.1000 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed</span>", to exclude the Windows OS cause this issue, we suggest you create a new Windows user account to try again:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, besides the Skype for Business, does the issue occur on other Office applications, like Outlook client. And, please tell us the version of the Skype for Business client if possible. Also, we appreciate if you can provide us a screenshot about
 the "<span style="font-style: italic">Skype for Business opens blank screen and won't enable login</span>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>New contact name does not appear in new email recipients list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petr vones  say:</h3>
<h2>            New contact name does not appear in new email recipients list</h2>
                    <p>There is a bug in latest version of Outlook Mail mobile application when composing a new email. Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. open People app and add a new contact:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name: John Smith</p>
<p>Email: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. open Outlook Mail app (use default Outlook.com account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. create a new email</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. on To field, press the people contacts blue icon on the right side</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. select the John Smith from contacts and confirm, you are back in Outlook Mail app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expected: email To field have <strong>blue 'John Smith' recipient</strong> added with email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** inside</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actual: email To field have <strong>blue ' *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' recipient</strong> added with email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** inside</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recipient name is not copied from the people contact list anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Before you post your universal no solution answer (try this or that), perform these steps on a Windows 10 Mobile device. You will be able to reproduce it for sure.</strong> I can reproduce it on two different devices with two different Microsoft
 accounts. No soft restart nor removing and adding the account helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Windows 10 PC Mail application has the same issue. Also note that old Windows 8.1 Mail application does not have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail app local copy of contacts is stored in C:\Users\xxxx\AppData\Local\Packages\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\HxStore.hxd file when first started. Deleting the file causes to refresh it once but watching it by Process
 Monitor is clear the People app does not cause to update the file and that's why it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there actually any testing ? You can find such basic bug in few minutes.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have already tried the said situation on our end and yes, you are correct, whenever you are adding a contact in the “To field” instead of the name of the contact, the email address is the one showing. This is a new update and the interface itself has
 been changed. It is currently the normal interface of the “To field” for <strong>
Outlook</strong>. If you want to raise an opinion in regards to having the name to be shown instead of the email address, you can leave a feedback instead in the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> app on your mobile and indicate what you want to be changed or reverted back to
<strong>Outlook</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.</p>
