<h2>            After update keyboard only works for login but not after that.</h2>
                    <p>I just did another update to windows 8.1&nbsp; I have MS Wireless Comfort Keyboard 1.0A which came with a MS Wireless Optical Mouse and a MS Wireless optical Desktop Receiver 3.0. (all 3 pieces were in a package).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I did an update to windows&nbsp; the keyboard would send letters for login but not for other things, like Word, or search on the charm bar.</p>
<p>I turned off the computer.</p>
<p>I changed the batteries and logged in again.</p>
<p>The keyboard would type for login but not for other purposes.&nbsp; I turned on sound and could hear clicks.&nbsp; The mouse still worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I had purchased an identical keyboard and mouse set for my wife I tried her keyboard.</p>
<p>Her keyboard would type for login but not for other purposes.&nbsp; I turned on sound and could hear clicks.&nbsp; The mouse still worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried my keyboard on her computer, and it worked.</p>

<p>That's interesting.&nbsp; In my case both devices stopped working and the reason was that the OS decided to stop recognizing my powered hub, which the wireless receiver was plugged into.&nbsp; My workaround was to move the receiver to a different USB port.&nbsp; My fix
 was more involved, which I documented before...</p>

    <title>Cutscenes missing objects, losing audio, and looping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abu smitty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cutscenes missing objects, losing audio, and looping</h2>
                    
<p>On Xmas, I received an Xbox One with 2 games (both on disc): ACIV and DR3. &nbsp;I've installed both and ACIV worked perfectly for the hour that I've played it. &nbsp;DR3 has not at all.</p>
<p>Here is a list of events from the past 2 days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed DR3 including the 5GB patch (first time took about an hour and a half)
</li><li>Tried to play it when it was around 40% complete because a message popped up, "Ready to start!" (From an extensive internet search, this was likely my problem)
</li><li>I encountered problems loading the game so I backed out and waited for the installation to finish at 100%
</li><li>I loaded back in and gameplay seemed fine, but cutscenes are totally broken and unwatchable. &nbsp;I'm missing objects during cutscenes (e.g., the paper, the bicycle wheel, and the bee in the opening scene); loading times are extremely long (several minutes)
 before cutscenes and before the game boots up; sometimes the cutscenes will loop (e.g., the main character will pick something up and the cutscene will play this sequence over and over and over); the background audio will sometimes cut out during cutscenes;
 sometimes the dialogue will cut out, the game will freeze for a few seconds, and then all of the dialogue missed comes out at the same time; sometimes the cutscene will freeze and then skip to a later part of the cutscene; sometimes the "Loading" screens before
 cutscenes freeze </li></ul>
<div>Here is a list of my attempted solutions these past 2 days:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game 5 times. &nbsp;For each time I attempted to reinstall the game, I tried something different. &nbsp;However, I always let the game installation reach 100% before attempting to play the game or even open an app.
</li><li>First, I tried uninstalling the game, then holding the power button for 10 seconds, then reinstalling the game when it boots back up. &nbsp;This did NOT work.
</li><li>Second, I tried simply uninstalling the game, then reinstalling the game without rebooting. &nbsp;This did NOT work.
</li><li>Third, I tried uninstalling the game, turning off the Xbox, then unplugging the brick for 2 minutes, then plugging the brick back in, then turning the Xbox back on when the light on the brick changes from white to orange. &nbsp;Finally, I reinstalled it. &nbsp;This
 did NOT work. &nbsp;(I believe this is the process for clearing the cache) </li><li>Fourth, I uninstalled the game, tried directly connecting the Xbox to the router to see if the download speed had something to do with the problem, then reinstalled while plugged into the router. &nbsp;This did NOT work. &nbsp;(Also, download speed was quicker, but
 still took at least an hour) </li><li>Fifth, since I have only had the game for 2 days, I was not concerned with my save file. &nbsp;Therefore, I deleted the saved game data within Dead Rising 3; uninstalled; then reinstalled. &nbsp;This did NOT work.
</li></ul>
<div>After these several failed attempts, I have reached out to Xbox Support on Twitter and even Capcom Vancouver on Twitter. &nbsp;They both surprisingly replied, but only told me to uninstall and reinstall the game. &nbsp;Once the download reached 100%, I was to play
 the game to see if it was fixed. &nbsp;Well, that did not work and I have not heard anything more from them on Twitter.</div>
</div>


<div>A couple of additional notes: I am visiting my family for the holidays so I will be attempting this again when I return home. &nbsp;My younger brother also got an Xbox One and the same game. &nbsp;His copy installed fine and he plays it on his XBox One with no problems.
 &nbsp;This means we have the same connection, only different systems and copies. &nbsp;For one of my attempted fixes, I tried installing his copy instead of mine to see if that made a difference. &nbsp;It did NOT.</div>


<div>Also, after my first uninstall/reinstall, I restored the system to factory settings. &nbsp;This, of course, did NOT work.</div>


<div>Finally, I have recorded some videos with "Xbox Record that" showing these problems. &nbsp;Is there a way I can post these somewhere for someone to look at? &nbsp;If so, how?</div>


<div>Here is the ultimate question though: What do I do now?</div>

<p>You could try installing the game with the console NOT connected to the internet, or without your profile logged in. Then log in and get the update. The game should install faster and then the system is not attempting to update and install at the same time.
 I can not say this will work, but it might be worth an attempt.</p>

<p>Yeah, I tried this too, but it did not work. &nbsp;I even tried to play the game offline without the patch after 100% installing it and I still have problems. &nbsp;This led me to believe that the disc was the problem, but I encountered the same problems with a different
 disc. &nbsp;At this point, I think I have corrupted data stored somewhere and I can't delete no matter what I try (e.g., deleting profile, deleting saved data, restoring factory settings, clearing cache, and uninstall/reinstall). &nbsp;It would sure be nice to have
 access to storage.</p>

<p><span>With Windows Fax and Scan, it is not actual seconds but the amount of retries the program will allow before hanging up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can go into <b>Fax settings</b> then click on the <b>advanced tab</b> to increase the number of
<b>attempts </b>and adjust the <b>time</b> between retires.</span></p>

Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Unable to &#34;CONNECT&#34; to any adhoc networks in Windows 10</h2>
                    I am not even getting the option of setting up an adhoc network as we used to get in Windows 7. However I followed this post
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/creatingconnecting-ad-hoc-networks-for-gaming/108e08c3-0b93-4bfe-8d34-6495b0e772c7<br />
and i am able to start a network through cmd and others are able to connect, but when someone else with windows 7 PC creates an adhoc network I am
<strong>UNABLE </strong>to connect. I am able to see those networks when I click on connect on networks tab, it says "<strong>Unable to connect to this network</strong>" without even giving any error or asking password. Please help.

<h2>            Microspft Support Staff Are Completely Useless</h2>
                    This is my first time needing Microsoft support and frankly I'm shocked at the pathetic attempts by Microsoft to offer support and customer service. Online, here, Microsoft staff comment to my question then disappear to never return. They ask for more
 information, because our feed back is so important, but once I post more info they don't follow up. Calling the answer desk is even worse. They know if people with Windows 7 install a Windows 10 upgrade that serious damage has been done to those PCs. They
 pretend to not know and send you on a wild goose chase for answers. The answer desk decided I needed technical help and transferred me to that department, they cut me off. I called back and was scheduled an appointment by phone four days later, yeah four days.
 Realizing from other commenters here that Microsoft was not going to help I took my PC to my IT repair guy. The damage was extensive and costly. The PC had to completely disassembled and every component wiped clean, then have all th

            <p>I'm finding it hard to believe installation of Win10 has anything to do with the inside of your computer being so dusty that an IT guy had to disassemble it. You come across as someone making up a story to put down Win10.</p>
<p>However, you have a valid point about Microsoft support, especially on this site. They just seem to forget about threads they've replied to.</p>

<h2>            Question to Mister Andre Da Costa.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Mister Andre Da Costa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote already several messages asking how I can delete my waiting upgrade of Windows 10, but all answers to do that are
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>t</strong><strong>o me to complicated.</strong></span> Today, I was just in time
<strong>to cut off the upgrading</strong> because, despite <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>I annulated reservation and delayed date. </strong></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I want to get rid of the upgrade, I am using Windows 8.1</strong></span>&nbsp; Do you know
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>a quite simple way for a computer dummy,</strong></span>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>to delete completely this upgrade, it already stands in Windows update and says to retstart before other updates, but that's impossible, because that starts the upgrade and makes me loose all I got.
</strong></span><strong>So also all waiting updates of Windows 8.1 cannot be installed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Chris.</p>

            <p>You have some GWX triggers that you need to stop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow Method 2 &amp; 4 on this website.</p>
<p>http://www.askvg.com/how-to-remove-get-windows-10-app-and-its-icon-from-taskbar/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can use Disk cleanup to get rid of install files:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run the <strong>Disk Clean up tool and select the&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><em>Clean up system files</em></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;after the initial scan. Select the&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Temporary</strong>
<strong>installation files</strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;for deletion. Once they are removed reboot your system and then check for Windows Updates once again.</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
</strong>This GWX triggers, I was told that before but did not dare doing it, it said it was of Win. 8.1. I was before also told to delete
<strong>all drivers downloads</strong> but what if there was a win. 8.1 among them?!
<strong>I don't know how to get there any more. I</strong>s that also still necessary after I will have done what you tell me to do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the disk clean up the field marked: " Allow files...contents indexed. It's not vinked on mine, do I have to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I all do these steps, there's nothing I have downloaded or saved that I could loose? I will do it tonight (Belgian time).</p>

            <p>Sorry, there are so many steps to take before you can get to your Windows 8.1 updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not</strong> <strong>check</strong> box for "allow files in this drive....." Checking that box is for indexing of files/folders that Microsoft provides for faster searches. But it is only really valuable if you have a lot of files to search though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That update KB2976978 has been un-installed. <strong>Don't worry ! </strong>It will not appear in your update listing when you have completed the "pending" Windows 8.1 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not familiar with any drivers that you need to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GWX is the method that Microsoft uses to install Windows 10. It's important to disable/delete GWX as suggested on website that was provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do Disk cleanup you may need to "turn on Show hidden files/folders"</p>
<p>Microsoft puts the install files in this hidden folder. When you turn on show hidden folders, go back to local c disk and sees if this "$Windows.~BT" folder appears.</p>
<p><span>The “$Windows.~BT” is a hidden folder, so you must&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/trick-to-enable-show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">turn on the Show hidden files
 and folders</a><span>&nbsp;in File Explorer.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;to reveal and show and hidden files and folders in Windows system with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Windows Explorer, click on&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Folder Options</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Organize</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Folder and search options</strong>.</li><li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&nbsp;tab.</li><li>Click and select (tick) the&nbsp;<strong>Show all hidden files and folders</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Show all hidden files, folders and drives</strong>&nbsp;option under “advanced settings”.</li><li>Click OK when done.</li></ol>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, I'll have a better look in hhd C, because I didn't noticed it before. I couldn't go via explorer &gt; tools, I always must go via control panel, so now in folders, view, there I scrolled down to the specific folders and saw it is always
 been set to show hidden files and hidden folders (no option for the drivers). There are still several option there in advanced set by a pc technician before. ONE point I must mention: the button "Apply to folders" is on active. I saw on the example you give
 that that button is not set active. Is that important? I wait to do the clean&nbsp; up until you tell me.</p>
<p>The file "$Windows.~BT" is visible, I went on it and looked for GWX but cannot find it ( I before saw somewhere in a folder GWX, but it said it is of windows 8.1, but I forgot where, maybe in a system 32 or in my system 64 folder??)</p>
<p>I saw a folder called "roll-over" created on August 12, also a few drivers created on August 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Your "Apply to Folder" on active is okay. That's way my pc is set and I have show hidden folder set.

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 on Win 10</h2>
                    Is there any good reason why my Music Library (C drive) shows two copies of each track of the music I store, as back-up, on an external drive. The external drive lists one copy of each track.

</p><p>Karthicka_R: Thank you for your suggestions and for responding so quickly to my question. I will follow your suggestions and let you know what results. But, basically, I wanted to know whether media player needs two copies of each track to achieve playback.
 Will deleting one of each two tracks result in player dysfunction?</p>
<p>Thanks, again.</p>

<h2>            qualcomm atheros ar9485 wifi adaptor connection issues</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased an ASUS &nbsp;laptop with this adaptor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been an unbelievable number of problems with it which I see have been experienced by many others who have posted on this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems I have had are:</p>
<p>1. Initially told me my network was limited and not connected to the internet when other devices in the house all manage to connect through it with no problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Changing the power management setting seems to get rid of that problem only to be replaced with a situation where it works when placed next to the router but says there is no connectivity when more than four feet away even though still has a bar or two.
 Other devices including a sub £100 android tablet have absolutely no problem finding a wifi signal all over the house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 Even when next to the router frequently drops the connection after a few minutes non use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having decided to try a windows laptop after giving up on them a few years ago for a mac I had hoped microsoft would have go their act together a bit better than to be told by an "engineer" that I should be checking the ethernet connection cable on a wifi
 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled it and reinstalled the adaptor and updated the driver to 10.0.0.260. I have also tried checking and unchecking all of the various boxes that have been suggested in this knowledge base. Some such as changing the power management settings
 do seem to work in getting rid of the "limited connectivity" bug but at the end of the day I am still left with a seriously substandard bit of kit that just doesnt do what it is supposed to do. What I want to know is if there is any-one out there who has worked
 out why this widespread problem exists and what the definitive fix for it is.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I did step one and started it in safe mode the error didn't occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I started it in Clean boot after disabling all non Microsoft processes and restarted the error starts again on start up. This implies to me that this means there is a problem with a Microsoft component, is that a correct assumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the box at the heading does say "error in Microsoft .NET framework"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would a reintsall fix this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience you are facing. Can you share when exactly are you getting this error?</p>
<p><span>D3d11.dll errors are most commonly caused when two programs share the same .dll file. When a program is deleted sometimes it will delete
 the .dll file associated with both programs. Errors can also occur from a faulty d3d11.dll file or incorrect versions of the file. I suggest you to uninstall the programs you have installed recently and check if you get the error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes.

<h3> esther kim 09  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have a headphone jack problem&#33; Please help&#33;</h2>
                    Whenever I plug in my earphones in my headphone jack, the sound usually doesn't come out on the first try. I always have to adjust it to a sweet spot to make it work but whenever I move my laptop to another place, the sound does not come out. When the
 sound isn't there, I have to take minutes to fix it. And, the sound only comes from one earphone, not both. I tried to fix the problem by defaulting my sound settings to my earphones but my earphone device does not show up or is not detected. I am running
 Windows 10, and I would really really like some help. Please tell me how to fix this problem. I also have tried multiple earphones on my computer and it has the same problem. I only hear sound from one ear, and I always have to adjust it to a sweet spot in
 order to hear and it takes a lot of time. Thank you very much in advance.

<h2>            How do I get my PC to automatically turn on every morning at a certain time</h2>
                    <p>I have seen multiple posts about getting your pc to shut down at a certain time but I am yet to find one on how to get it to start up at a certain time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here we go, I wake up early each morning and go out and want my PC to be powered up ready for use at a certain time so that when I get back I can simply walk into the room and get on with my daily tasks, as it saves me from having to walk in press the power
 button and wait for it to load up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that someone in the community knows how to get this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>You can use BIOS settings of your motherboard to start up your PC at a certain time.</p>
<p>If your PC shutdown and power off then is no way for starting up PC from Task Scheduler because your operating system is not available in this state.</p>

<h2>            Bugcheck&#58; 0x0000001e</h2>
                    
<p>As above, nearly every 2nd - 3rd day, AFTER I've shut Win7 down. Once I turn the system on again, I know its crashed (because its dual booting with Windows 2k). It boots straight in Windows 7 (It doesnt show the menu, so I can choose 2k, or Win7), then a
 black screen appears, with the line flashing left hand side of the screen. And hangs. Only thing I can do, is reset. Once I reset, it brings up resume or something, which fails, but if I reset / reboot again it'll bring up the boot menu, so I can choose the
 OS I want to boot into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory has been tested, its fine. I've scanned for errors. No errors. The ATI drivers havent been installed on this (its using Win7 vid drivers).&nbsp; I see it has something to do with KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED. Which still doesnt tell me anything. And the
 only time it happens, is when I shut Windows 7 down. It doesnt crash, while I'm in it / using whatever program. I could be on it all day, and it wont (with any bugcheck, or stop error). Any other ideas, on what else I can check?</p>
<p>NOTE: This has only started within the last week. Its been fine before now (since Win7 was installed about 3 mths)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>See this thread on how to troubleshoot BlueScreens using BlueScreenView and MyEventViewer and<br />
other methods.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/8df6485a-50cc-4cdc-be3e-0f05c7745117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/8df6485a-50cc-4cdc-be3e-0f05c7745117</a></p>
<p>====================================</p>
<p>Are you using RAID? If so those drivers would be very suspect. Also diskspace and other hard drive<br />
issues are high on the list.<br />
<br />
If you are sure disk issues are not the cause :</p>
<p>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic bluescreen
<br />
troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and antivirus/antispyway/security
<br />
programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and when you get to the driver section refer
<br />
to the generic methods in next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 1e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001e</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>ntstatus.h </em>file located in the
<em>inc</em> directory of the Windows Driver Kit.</p>
Resolution
<p><em>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</em>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.
 Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the
<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the
<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p>If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><em>Hardware incompatibility. </em>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p><em>Faulty device driver or system service. </em>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending
 system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware
 diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>

there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>The dumps would be handy. &nbsp;Perhaps you could upload them to an alternate location if SkyDrive is not agreeable to you.</p>
<p>There appears to be an omission or inaccuracy in your transcription of the error details - the precise hex numbers are important in the absence of the crash dumps. &nbsp;All that can really be determined by what has been provided is that you experienced a&nbsp;KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
 bugcheck, which you already knew. &nbsp;Everything else comes down to general guidance for dealing with a blue screen/bugcheck.</p>
<p>Do note that RAM that passes memory tests is not necessarily "good" RAM - it is just RAM that hasn't failed a test.</p>

<p>Nope not using RAID. Its only got 1 IDE hdd in it (which is dual booting with 2k). BIOS is up to date. There are no NIC or sound drivers for the mobo on the ASUS site. Its too old (Its a 754 not AM2 or3) . Its using the default drivers for the NIC, the video,
 the kb, the mouse, and the audio. There are NO old drivers on it (since most of them are win7's default drivers). The videocard drivers for it arent installed. Win7's are good enough</p>
<p>Its a PC I decided to test Win7 on first, because Win7 has too many probs on this PC (with this tuner, and annoying probs - The solid b/g bug, the icons on the taskbar / whatever its called disappear all the time, and&nbsp; I have to delete iconcache.db and kill
 explorer.exe all the time to fix it. Its a system I built so it doesnt use / have any other driver (for HP, Dell etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesnt have any trial sw on it (like most HP / Dell systems install). It doesnt have a separate firewall on it besides Windows. Has MSSE on it</p>
<p>I'll have to wait for it to crash again, since ccleaner probably deleted the dmp files. I've installed that Bluescreenview program. I'll see what that says, next time it happens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there is NO bluescreen, The only thing that says it is event viewer, once I shut it down. I dont get or see a bluescreen at any other time. (ie: When I'm actually using it)</p>

            Perhaps, run&nbsp;systempropertiesadvanced.exe and in the Startup and Recovery settings, clear the checkbox by "Automatically restart". That way, if the system encounters a problem while shutting down you should know about it and would need to respond to the
 bluescreen (generally by cycling power).

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you got the Bug_Check error 0x0000001e or BCCode: 1e then there was a BlueScreen even if the<br />
minidump was deleted. Check with the MyEventViewer (using the time tip) to see if anything is listed<br />
just at or about a second before it happened.<br />
<br />
Check the Cause and the Fault_Wire site for the recommended solutions.<br />
<br />
Even default Windows drivers can have issues and/or be driven out of bounds.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Since Quote doesnt work (it brings up the windows and says done). But I cant type anything. I'll have to click on reply instead</p>
<p>@ No.Compromise. Auto restart is unticked / cleared. Only prob is it doesnt do it every time, when I shut down. It hasnt done it since I posted the prob here (YET)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@ Spirit. The only error in event viewer is the one in the topic. And whats the Cause and the Fault_Wire site?? I've never heard of it. Is Myeventviewer event viewer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll install the ATI drivers then and see what happens</p>
