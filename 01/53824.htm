<h2>            Xbox live captures deleted</h2>
                    So I noticed yesterday that 10 of my 133 captures got deleted. They weren't the oldest, but random ones. I had 98% percent full and it was like that for a while I thought since its there it wont get deleted and if I keep it at that percentage. Luckily,
 a few that I liked I placed on One Drive. Some that I liked got deleted. It's strange now that I have 122 clips I still have 98% storage. I tried placing as many as I can on One Drive, but just now that storage got full. Why did my videos from different times
 get deleted? I watched some of them recently (watch in 30 days to not get deleted) yet they got deleted.&nbsp; I'm very new to game consoles, so there may be something I'm not aware of. :( Thank you!

</p><p><span>Three weeks ago, the </span><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/10/11/october-2018-xbox-update-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">October update</a><span> arrived for Xbox One owners. The update added the new avatars, Xbox
 Skill for Cortana and Alexa, Dolby Vision video streaming, and new narrator languages. However, Microsoft also wanted to make changes to the GameDVR storage policies at the end of the month, and those changes have arrived this week.</span></p>
<p><span>Players now have double the amount of storage space they used to have for Xbox Live Captures. So that players
 use this space efficiently, Microsoft will now be automatically deleting existing video clips over 90 days old that have no views. Any new clips recorded from this point onwards will be deleted after 30 days if they haven't got any views. Players can still
 back up their clips to a virtual drive or external storage before that expiration period, and if you're unsure on how to do this, Microsoft has provided instructions</span></p>

<p>The exact same thing happened me. All my clips, even those viewed at least once before the update rolled in, have all been deleted.
</p>
<p>Such a <strong>[Mod Removed-Profanity]</strong> decision for Microsoft to go through with without properly informing people. What’s even the point of having double the storage space if they’re just going to delete clips anyway.</p>

<h2>            Google Chrome acting up. What to do</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been using google chrome on my laptop since I got it about 2 years ago. Google Chrome started not working and when ever I do a google search on Chrome, I get this message:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96f1a937-95c1-42e9-b5fc-67c060f42202" height="195" width="325" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was wondering if any one had any idea how to solve this problem. I have cleared my downloads and history and it doesnt solve anything. I have reloaded the page, mulitple times, and the "Aw Snap!" message keeps popping up.</p>

    <title>Razer Onza Controller. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Razer Onza Controller.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,Ive been interested in purchasing a Razer Onza controller,but I had a bad experience with the Black ops controller last year ,basically it lasted about 2 weeks and died,I know they are made by different company's but im now wondering whether to get
 the MW3 official controller(I like the design and it will be a Chrimbo pressie)or plump for one of these,so I wanted to get some feedback from people who own or have had a go with the Onza,many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have the Razer Onza tournament edition one, first one only lasted 2 months before the sticks decided to keep directing one particular direction, at which point I sent it back and got another one. The lights are good at night, the extra buttons help in
 games like Halo, where you can assign the extra bumper buttons to anything, like stick clicks. The extra length triggers work nicely, and the changing of stick resistance can come in very handy for certain games, like driving in Forza. It does take some getting
 use to, but once you do, it will feel weird to go back to a normal controller. </p>
<p>There are a few negatives to the controller, has to be cabled (not a problem if you sit close anyways, it does have a "trip connection" so if someone walks past, catches the cable, it doesn't pull the usb out) sticks may wear down in one direction, and become
 unplayable, especially for FPS games. </p>
<p>I would recommend it, but I have to say, I am not too overly impressed about the build quality, especially for the prices they charge for it. I think it should be reduced to official controller prices, but saying that, at least official controllers won't
 break as easy/quickly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope I helped. </p>

<p>Avoid the Onza mate, for anything other than driving games they're useless. As mentioned, the sticks develop a mind of their own very quickly and the build quality is shocking, stick with the official 360 pad.</p>

    <title>Help -- Audio is out of synch with video in Movie Maker for second - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fiddlepix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help -- Audio is out of synch with video in Movie Maker for second block of a large AVCHD file split by camera into 4GB blocks.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camcorder breaks long videos into 4GB blocks that play seamlessly together when done right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Movie Maker (2012 Build 16.4.3505.0912) is not loading the blocks correctly other than the first block of each video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sound is out of synch with the video and I cannot find any way to fix it or have the program reanalyze it to get it right.&nbsp; I've tried with several files now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the transition from one block to the next in Movie Maker results in a stutter when playing, but it should be absolutely seamless.&nbsp; This is true for the preview when playing within Movie Maker as well as any exported/saved movie files (.MP4).&nbsp; This
 might be related to the audio being out of synch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial blocks are AVCHD&nbsp; (.MTS) format.&nbsp; They all play perfectly in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer is not powerful, but should be plenty to perform this simple editing task:</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 620</p>
<p>Intel i3-2120 CPU @ 3.30 GHz</p>
<p>4GB RAM</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1</p>

            <p>Hi FiddlePix,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate the details you have provided. The audio/video sync issue you encounter is typically caused by corrupted codec or outdated codec. To eliminate these symptoms, we request that you perform these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <span>Download and run the tool for fixing bad codec. Here is the link where you can download the tool:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/en-us</a> </span></p>
<p><span>2. Search for latest codec package available using any of your preferred search engine and install it in your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know the result afterwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Leonard_Su,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help and links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the MS Support link you provided does not find any codex problems on this machine, so the problem is elsewhere I guess?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since been able to fix the audio/video out of sync issue by turning off the preprocessing of files in Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp; Unfortunately this means the file plays all choppy when I'm trying to edit it and using Movie Maker becomes a pain, but at
 least the finished product is in sync and plays properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this did not fix the stutter when transitioning from one block to the next.&nbsp; (Blocks are roughly 4GB in size.)&nbsp; The transition, which should be completely seamless, results is a significant "hiccup" that I cannot fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camcorder is a Panasonic HDC-TM900K.&nbsp; I'm not filming in 3D, just regular 1080p.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find anything on the web about problems splicing the video files back together for this camera, so the problem seems to be on my end somehow....very frustrating.</p>

            <p>Hi FiddlePix,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate the details you have provided. It's possible that Movie Maker is exhausting the resources of your computer when rendering the movie and cause that issue. W<span>e request that
 you split the video into several parts then save it as movie.&nbsp;This will help Movie Maker&nbsp;to easily render the movie when the saving process starts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are the steps on how to split the video in Movie Maker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Open the affected project file in Movie Maker.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Slide the timeline all the way to the right&nbsp;by pressing
<strong><span>(+).</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Once the video has been expanded on the story board, go to
<b>Edit</b> tab</span></p>
<p><span>4. Select the point you want to split then press right-click and select&nbsp;<b>Split.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you have divided the video into several pieces try to save it by pressing these keys.</span></p>
<p><b><span>ALT &gt; F</span></b><span>
<b>&gt;Save</b> <b>movie</b>. (Choose your desired settings for the movie.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know if these make any difference.
 If you still encounter the same issue, please feel free to reply back so we can further investigate the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi FiddlePix,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The preprocessing (<i>File preparation for faster editing</i>)&nbsp;should be turned
 on because it enhances the performance and stability of Movie Maker when editing a movie. Keep in mind that it will need most of your resources (<i>mostly RAM and&nbsp;VGA</i>)&nbsp;when rendering the large size of movie. It would be best&nbsp;to close all running application&nbsp;except
 for&nbsp;Movie Maker when performing the steps above.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the result afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

            1. The most important reason for this issue is that caller ID is not setup. If this is not setup, set it up.
<br />
<br />What is caller identification and how do I set it up? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>

            Hi Miriam.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />2) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try Startup Repair. 
<br />
<br />3) If that fails run a full Disk Check from the Command Prompt also in Advanced Troubleshooting Options.
<br />
<br />     At the command prompt, type the following, then press “Enter“:
<br />    chkdsk /r c:
<br />
<br />    If your bootable drive is a letter other than “C”, replace “c:” with the bootable drive letter you use.
<br />
<br />    Select “Y” for yes on the question regarding checking the disk the next time the system restarts.
<br />
<br />    Restart the system. Be patient while chkdsk checks your drive for errors. It could take a really long time.
<br />
<br />Reference:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />4)    At the command prompt, copy/paste or type the following, then press “Enter“ after each:
<br />    bootrec /fixboot
<br />    bootrec /fixmbr
<br />
<br />If those fail try rebuliding the BCD from here:  <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/...</a>
<br />
<br />5) If all else fails you can try the automated Reset in Troubleshoot options. 
<br />
<br />6)  If that fails or you want the gold standard install do the Clean Install at  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.   You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the tutorial linked. It is a better install than any amount of money can buy.  
<br /> 
<br />   I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>Yes, the xbox live gold shares between the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One on one account, so if you have gold one one you have it on the other for free, just log in on the same account on both devices, but only one can be online once at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The My Home Xbox feature to share gold does not share across to xbox 360 backwards compatible or the real xbox 360, so if they need to use the xbox 360, they will each need gold to play on that console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the xbox 360 gamer profile reset, can you explain more about that? If you mean moving to Xbox one from the xbox 360, your achievements are not reset - but you may have to rebuild your progress on the Xbox one version of the game if it's not backwards
 compatible from xbox 360.</p>

<p>I'm not to sure if this is were to post since I never posted on here before. Anyways,</p>
<p>I'm using Xplornet, and was wondering if there is any issues with being able to download updates for games or apps on xbox store. I start an update for my blueray player app and it started it fine but as soon as it hit 6% it just stopped downloading and
 refused to go further. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, pausing and unpausing but nothing like that worked. It happened on a few other downloads too. When I just leave it and just let it download it ate through roughly around 200mb (the app is
 only 31.52 mb) for just waiting about ten minutes, which an update like this would've taken normally 1 minute minimal.</p>
<p>This started happening after I had a console update a week ago. I normally have my console offline and just put it online here and there to talk to a friend or to update a game or something. This happens on my computer to with the windows 10 store, so I'm
 just curious if my ISP isn't compatible with microsoft stores or something, because it sure seems like it. Just in case if you need my router its a Cisco Linksys10519, I have gaming settings on and i have tried opening ports but nothing seems to work.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3103688&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since this update was installed, the Microsoft Solitaire Collection crashes when the advertisements load. Not that - that&nbsp;- is a bad thing, but it seems that all multimedia content, of the same format, follows suit. The effect is the program does a quick
 exit with no messages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This started after the *Windows 10 OS 1511* update on this PC (HP G72 laptop). My other PC, which doesn't have the *Windows 10 OS 1511* update,&nbsp;but has Windows 10 (and is a home built rig), does not have this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling this update and that was a 'no go'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Everything appears to be OK on the PC and Flash Player seems to be working on the laptop for both IE and Edge. The failure occurs when I try to use the MS Solitaire Collection. Everything loads OK until the advertisement starts to load. At that point, the

    <title>my microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3500 does not track on plain white - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henrynjess  say:</h3>
<h2>            my microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3500 does not track on plain white paper</h2>
                    I have a new Microsoft Wireless mobile mouse that does not track on white paper.&nbsp; The one that I bought on 25/11/2011 worked OK until May 2012.&nbsp; It was responding slowly, so I fitted a new battery.<br />
<br />
This did not rectify the problem, so I took it back to the store where I bought it, and they gave me a replacement mouse the same as above.&nbsp; I fitted the new battery supplied with the mouse, and I still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
When I move the mouse the pointer on the screen does not move correspondingly on white paper.&nbsp; When I move it on printed paper it works OK.&nbsp; I have a HP wired mouse and a Logitech mouse that work on the same surface connected to the same computer with no problem.&nbsp;
 Obviously I only have one connected at one time.&nbsp; I have even tried uninstalling other mouse.<br />
<br />
According to the write-up about the Microsoft mouse, it is supposed to work on all surfaces except glass or reflective materials.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that the mouse is faulty and should be replaced again?<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
It was working OK on a HP all-in-one computer running Windows 7. This computer has the hard drive combined with the screen similar to a laptop.&nbsp; The system is up to date and the computer is about one year old.<br />
<br />
As was stated before, the first mouse was working until recently.<br />
<br />
When the new mouse was installed it automatically downloaded the latest software and drivers, as well as intellipoint.<br />
<br />
It works OK on a page such as a telephone book with lots of printing, but will not work properly on plain paper where the first one worked previously.<br />
<br />
According to the write-up about the Microsoft mouse, it is supposed to work on all surfaces except glass or reflective materials.&nbsp; It seems that this mouse does not live up to the claims by the manufacturer..<br />
<br />

            I solved this problem some time back.&nbsp; I got sick of trying with Microsoft mouse and returned it to store and got refund.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I purchased a&nbsp; Logitec wireless mouse that was supposed to work on any surface, but had the same problem, so I returned that one also, taking a sample of the paper with me to show the dealer the problem.&nbsp; I got a credit for that one and bought&nbsp; a Logitec M305,
 as I already had one working on my laptop on the same paper.<br />
<br />
I now use separate Logitec M305 wireless mouse on each of two&nbsp; computers which work fine on the same surface, and all surfaces that I use, including a polished wooden table.<br />
<br />
It seems that Microsoft have no real answer to this problem, as I have had no further response from them and I had forgotten that I had ever had a Microsoft mouse.<br />
<br />

            No single malicious software scanning program seems to know about everything, so it is prudent to use more than one.&nbsp; I would rate AVG as "fair", but I have also known it to quarantine (effectively delete) critical XP system files resulting in a no boot
 scenario.<br />
<br />
If you still have problems after running <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MBAM</a> and <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SAS</a> and provide more information about your system, you can figure out what is going on and fix it.<br />
<br />
Seeing multiple copies of svchost.exe running in Task Manager is normal, but sometimes malicious software will hide behind one of the svchost.exe processes because the malicious software knows that you cannot see it when you are using Task Manager.<br />
<br />
You might be able to get some clues using about what is going with your svchost Processes using Task Manager and maybe figure it out.<br />
<br />
You will always be able to figure out what is going with your svchost Processes if you use Process Explorer.<br />
<br />
Download Process Explorer so you can see what is "really" running on your system, especially behind those multiple svchosts Processes you see running in Task Manager.
<br />
<br />
Download Process Explorer from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a><br />
<br />
You'll like Process Explorer when you get the hang of it.&nbsp; Process Explorer is the Windows Task Manager on steroids. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Process Explorer installs nothing so it will not slow your system down since it only runs on demand. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Process Explorer may look a little intimidating at first since it presents so much information, but you will start to get to like the way it works when you are looking for performance problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can even tell PE that you want it to be your new default
 "Task Manager" from now on.&nbsp; You can still run the original Task Manger too.<br />
<br />
Once you get Process Explorer running, expand the columns, drag the corners of the display to make it bigger, etc. so you can see the most information as possible in the window.&nbsp; Now you can really see everything that is running on the system.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of my poor system when I use Process Explorer:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/2567/processexplorer.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/2567/processexplorer.png</a><br />
<br />
The CPU column is usually the most interesting to get started with performance issues - who is using the most?
<br />
<br />
It is okay and normal to have multiple svchost processes running.&nbsp; Important XP Services are actually running under the svchost Processes. Sometimes there is just one XP Service running under a svchost Process, sometimes there are several XP Services running
 under a svchost Process.<br />
<br />
Sometimes malicious software will hide behind a svchost Process since the malicious software knows you will not be able to spot it in Task Manager.&nbsp; It will hide behind a svchost.exe Process to fool you, but you can outsmart it.<br />
<br />
Malicious software can also disguise itself to appear to be a legitimate XP Process or it could hide under/behind other Processes that you see running in Task Manager so you cannot see it running.<br />
<br />
The malicious software would like to fool you into thinking that you need to use a System Restore Point, perform a Repair Install or reinstall your XP from scratch when you really don't have to.<br />
<br />
When looking at the display in Process Explorer, you would like the most CPU to be associated with System Idle Process.&nbsp; That is the "free time" on your system so the more free time it has, the better. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you look at the performance graphs and see red spikes (or not) double click the graph in the top left corner to display the usage graph.&nbsp; Hover the mouse over any spikes to see what causes them.&nbsp; Even if the spike has already scrolled past in the display,
 you can still hover the mouse over the spike to see what caused it.&nbsp; You can also just wait for a spike to occur and then see what caused the spike.<br />
<br />
To help understand your svchost processes and what is running beneath them, read this article and you will be smarter than the average bear:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial129.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial129.html</a><br />
<br />
Then with some Googling, you can look at each thing running in Process Explorer and behind your svchost processes and see what it is and decide if your configuration needs it or not and then decide what to do about it. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you think you have one svchost.exe Process that have run amok, using Process Explorer, you can right click that offensive svchost, Properties and on the Services and Threads tab you can see what is running under it. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is a CPU column that will need widening (make the column wider) so you can see CPU.&nbsp; Perhaps you can spot which background process is consuming so much CPU under the svchost.exe process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look around under the svchost processes and you will find the
 problem. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can also see what is running under every svchost just by hovering your mouse over the svchost.exe process.&nbsp; Some of them will just have one things running under them and some will have several things (hopefully all legitimate XP services) and some will
 have a lot of things. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have a svchost Process that you think is afflicted, what is running under your afflicted one?<br />
<br />
No running process should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
First, see what you can find out using Process Explorer and then if nothing is obvious, seek additional guidance.

            <p>Yeah, I know there are some programs better than AVG. If it was not the case that other programs don't run on this particular machine,&nbsp;something else would be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past I had also seen multiple instances of SVCHost, but there&nbsp;was not the system slowdown as I now notice. Also, in the past,&nbsp;I have not seen as many SVCHost instances.&nbsp;The number of instances and&nbsp;seemingly associated slowdown cause&nbsp;my concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I had heard of malware disguising themselves under different processes, but wanted to check whether is a "safe" number of SVCHost instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will&nbsp;give Process Explorer a whirl and see&nbsp;what it reveals.</p>

</p><p>Ok, I am having problems with my windows update and so I did the automatic fix it for the Windows Update but it wasn't able to fix the corrupted files. ( I know its corrupted files because the fix it told me it was. So then I turned to Sfc /SCANNOW and ran
 it under as an administrator and it told me <span>Windows Resource <span>&nbsp;</span>protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them</span>. So, I did the DISM /Online /Clean-Image /RestoreHealth and when it was done. It said " The Restore Operation
 was completed successfully. The component store corruption was repaired. The Operation was completed successfully." Now then, I ran Sfc /SCANNOW again and it says that the files are corrupted. How is that possible if the files were "repaired". What should
 I do?</p>

</p><p>Instead of checking the corruption via <em>SFC</em>, check it via <em>DISM</em> itself. For that try the first two commands mentioned here:</p>

<h2>            Lag issues, across all games</h2>
                    
<p>About three or four days ago I began experiencing rubber band lag through out all my online games on XBOX One. At first I thought that it may be my internet provider, since this is usually the issue. However, after trading in my modem, hard wiring the connection
 to both the modem and router, I have had no avail.</p>
<p>Additional information:</p>
<p>Ping: 12ms</p>
<p>Download Speed: 20.9mps</p>
<p>Upload Speed: .9mps</p>

<p>I've also checked the various forums, looking for solutions and feel that I have exhausted all other options.</p>
<p>My real question is there something wrong with my XBOX that I already have to get it repaired, after only a few weeks of having it?</p>

<p>Did you speedtest and ping, IP connectivity test, from your console?<br /><br />Appreciate if you could post up the make and model of your router and your modem as well. Also, state whether you connect wireless or wired with your console.<br /><br />Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same is going on with mine. I've played Forza 5, COD Ghosts, and BF4 and when I can actually get into an online game, about every 30 seconds or so there is a wave of lag making the games almost unplayable. I have a great internet connection and I even tried
 "port forwarding" to increase my connection but to no avail. It has to be either the servers somewhere or the Xbox system itself, let me know if you figure it out.</p>

<p>Hey Galaxy Jake,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the lagging you are experiencing and can totally understand the frustration behind it all! you are experiencing this in each game while playing online? Just because, have you tried a wired connection and if so do you still get that lagging
 issue?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reach back and let us know what you find.</p>

<p>Yes I am getting this lag in every game I play online. I didn't get any kind of ethernet cable with my Xbox One, and even if I did have one it would be very impractical to use. I connected wirelessly with my Xbox 360 just fine without any lag at all.

<p>My cod ghosts says the servers are down. I can't even play 2k because it says you have to have an online connection to use this file even though I'm signed in and can see who's online. In Forza 5 I can't even download any vinyls or custom paintjobs.</p>

<p>i have played defiance on my 360 and have had no lag at all for an mmo, but a crap load on the X1 with a game that only connects 2 people?</p>
<p>i thought that the X1 was going to server bases mp rather than host based?</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook has an option to send reminders on your screen to serve as a notification. It must be enabled first before it can appear in your screen. To have a better understanding of your concerns, we'd like to ask you some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using the Windows 10 Mail app or Outlook?</li><li>What is the notification display you are referring to?</li><li>How many email accounts connected to your Outlook application?</li><li>What is the setup of your email account? Is it an <strong>IMAP</strong> or<strong> POP3</strong>?</li><li>Which version of <strong>Outlook</strong> are you using?</li><li>Have you already enabled this notification?</li><li>Are you having issues with receiving an email?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We’re looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry it has taken me until now to respond.&nbsp; The fires in Southern California have caused some scary issues with our home but everything is fine now.&nbsp; To answer your question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Outlook with Office 365 version 1710</p>
<p>The notification that I'm referring to is the one that I think Windows 10 and Outlook generate when an email is received.</p>
<p>I think there are three different email accounts on this computer</p>
<p>The email is setup through our exchange server.</p>
<p>I guess the version is 1710 since that is the Office version</p>
<p>Yes I've enabled notifications both in Windows (which were already enabled) and also in Outlook</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Mail is received just fine.&nbsp; The only issue is no popup notification when mail arrives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me and again I apologize for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

            Hi <strong>Paul</strong>,<br />
<br />
If you have set up message rules and a new message is moved out of the default account Inbox, you may not receive a Desktop Alert notification, or the Desktop Alert notification might not appear for the full duration of time that you configured in the settings
 for the Desktop Alerts feature. We suggest that you reconfigure the message alert pop-up in your Outlook. Kindly refer to this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-new-message-alert-pop-up-on-or-off-9940c70e-b306-442e-a856-d94b20318481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Turn new message alert pop-up on or off">

    <title>Re-activate Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rism_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-activate Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I am using a company laptop, and I upgraded the OS from Enterprise to Pro using my own product key. My company account is linked to that pc, and it doesn't have the update which links the product key to a Microsoft account. If I reinstall Windows 10 Pro
 and set it up with a personal account, will I have to reactivate it or will it recognize my computer as it had Windows 10 Pro before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any reply is appreciated!</p>

            The ability to link accounts is only available in Windows 10 1607 and later. 
<br />
<br />If the computer previously had Pro, it will automatically reactivate.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
