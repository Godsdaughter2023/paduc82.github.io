<h2>            what is Surface 3 and docking station compatible monitor</h2>
                    <p>hi, recently i got myself a surface 3 (non-pro) edition. I bought it with the compatible docking station for the surface 3. Im looking to have a better display for my surface with an external monitor. The surface 3 resolution is only at 1920x1280 and my
 docking station resolution is 3840 x 2600.&nbsp; Am i able to use a 4k monitor with the docking station? I don't use the surface to play game , i only use it to surf web and watch movie ( netflix,hbonow,etc.)

<h2>            I give this game a 8.5 because of bad DLC and extras</h2>
                    
<p>The complaints I had with the last game is still complaints I have in this one. I've beaten this game on normal and still only have one batsuit. People even talk about there being a free roam mode I still haven't seen yet. I got Catwoman for pre-ordering
 from Gamestop and it came w/ 3 costumes (2 of them can only be used in map packs). I also got the Nightwing and Robin DLC and have their costumes but still one batsuit. Being able to use Catwoman in Arkham City is nice. Not being able to use Nightwing and
 Robin in other than map packs sucks hairy bean bags.</p>
<p>Enemies still get to get off cheap shots even though you should be hitting them first. Robin breaks his combos too easily. I understand Batman should be a better than the others but they should be able to break weapons too.</p>
<p>I'm gonna wait on the next one when it comes out.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about not being able to use the cotumes, they should all be availible when you decide to go back into your file saved that you have beaten. As for the free-roam, the ENTIRE game is free-roam. At any point you can break off from the main story
 and complete any of the side missions or explore most areas. As for the difference in play between characters, how do you think the others should be able to break guns and weapons when one is a female and the other two don't posess the strength of Batman?
 This is an excellent game and the DLC has been up to par. But if you want to rate it low on your personal scale, then by all means feel froggy.</p>

<p>Besides, the DLC is extra content, that is an optional extra, it makes no difference to the games greatness in anyway. That's like saying I will give Oblivion an 8.5 because of the "Horse Armour" pack. Rating a game based on something that did not come with
 it, and costed extra doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>@Mamba I paid for the DLC thinking I would be able to use Nightwing and Robin outside of the challenge and predator maps. Yeah Free-roam for Batman and Catwoman but not Nightwing and Robin. @Archon I shouldn't have to pay extra for any of that in the first
 place. What ever happened to getting the complete game when you bought it. This is one of the main reasons I don't pay for Xbox Live Gold membership anymore. Sony and Nintendo you play their games online for free. On top of that if I'm paying for Xbox Live
 gold I shouldn't see advertisements at all. M$ is making money off people coming and going.</p>

<p>It's merely added content, the game is complete with or without those two extras. I don't deny it is a drag for those that don't have xbox live, and therefore could not activate the Catwoman dlc- but the other two make no difference. Are there not descriptions
 for the Robin and Nightwing DLCs anyway?</p>

            <p>Hi Vikram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you apps Windows Store are not working and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Are you referring to this situation right after the upgrade or they worked for sometime?</li></ul>
<p>The issue can be caused due to several reasons like pending Windows updates after the upgrade, display driver being missing or corrupted etc. Let's try the following methods and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Install all the pending updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Type <strong>Settings</strong> in search bar and click it</p>
<p>b. Click <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong></p>
<p>c. Let Windows check for any pending updates, if found install update(s)</p>
<p>d. <strong>Restart</strong> the computer when prompted</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click to run the <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">troubleshooter for Windows apps</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Clear&nbsp;Store cache</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong>wsreset.exe
</strong>and click <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Run the System File Checker tool </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 5:</strong> Visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest drivers available for the same computer model as you have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>1. It's an Acer Aspire 6120<br />
2. Yes, both wired and wireless.<br />
3. Not that I'm aware of<br />
<br />
The Fn key is not depressed, and I can't see anywhere to turn it on/off otherwise.<br />
The On-Screen Keyboard does not appear - when clicking the option to turn it on, a dialogue box pops up confirming that I want it to run, I click yes, the box reappears, I click yes, then nothing happens.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finding and running MSConfig (as I couldn't type the run command suggested in the troubleshooting method) and performing a clean boot doesn't seem to have solved the problem either. I was wondering about trying to boot it into Safe Mode to see if that
 made a difference but I don't know of a way of doing that without a working keyboard. Is there one?</div>

            By a DOS boot, do you mean you literally booted MS DOS from a bootable media?<br />
If so, and you see the same problem (truly outside Windows) then there is clearly a hardware failure and the keyboard needs to be replaced.<br />

                    <p>I recently downloaded the Family Safety tool for Parental Controls.&nbsp; I would like to be able to recieve activity reports and it seems to be a good tool for this.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the program does not seem to recognize games that are being played via Steam.&nbsp;
 It shows listed in the apps that Steam is running, but Steam runs all the time in the background regardless of whether or not a game is being played.&nbsp; How can I get it to recognize games being played through Steam?&nbsp; Additionally, there are a couple other games
 that are not being recognized either.&nbsp; How can I get it to recognize that an app is actually a game?</p>

            <p><span>Hi MisterJoshCooper,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The games are not being recognized because they are being played through another program such as Steam which Family Safety did recognize as an app. Please note that games must be installed in order for Family Safety to recognize them as a game.
</p>
<p><span>Regarding the other games that are not being recognized by Family Safety, are they also games played though another software? Please provide us with more details so we can address your issue better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            Sorry but I cannot see where to download the driver from on this site? I forgot to say that I have already downloaded a driver .exe file from Sharp USA site which had AR-M162 in it's file name but when run it did not list that particular model and none
 of the drivers worked. I also downloaded from several sites which were cons for driver update software and none worke. So can any body help? I also still need Button Manager to setup the scanner option.

<h2>            Start button, task bar, settings, and reset</h2>
                    <p>I know this is a common problem (due to nearly endless discussions on the topic) but no fix I have found so far is working. The start button doesn't work, the task bar doesn't work. NOTHING happens when I try to open settings, no matter how many ways I try.
 It just causes the task manager, explorer window, whatever, to freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried to reset windows entirely, but obviously I cannot access that through settings. I tried through Restart &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Reset this PC. But guess what? There is NO Reset this PC option. It's just not there. This is my main concern. Every
 other solution that I have tried, that fails, leads me to reset, but I can't find anything that solves the problem of not even having the option to reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot create a new user. When I click "create new user," nothing happens. I would list all the things I've tried, so as not to have repeated suggestions but I've lost track. If it's on the first two pages of a google search on these topics, or on
 youtube, I've probably tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm desperate... Finals are next week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new ideas?</p>

<h2>            WIndows 10 Upgrade, computer thinks it has two monitors, only has one. Intel G45&#47;G43, on dell all-in-one</h2>
                    <p>Strange problem... maybe. I see some chatter about it on the internet, but no solid solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows 10 upgrade, I was left with a totally black screen. Some research (on another computer, for sooth!) suggested that with Intel video hardware sometimes the system thinks it has two monitors, so try this and that... (Window-P, down arrow,
 enter) and voila, the display comes up. But it won't stay. Each reboot requires the same blind jiggery-pokery to get the display back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to roll back driver on the video; nothing to roll it back to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various combinations of settings, but most of them refuse to save ("can't save that; try another combination of settings" -- that's an improved error message? Gah!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insists it is running dual monitors. When I ask it to ID the monitors, it shows the "duplicated" icon on the one. When I ask it to detect, it says (approx) could not detect any other monitor. But it still insists multiple monitors are a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is being done for some one else, and he is not the sort who probably even can work this blind magic to make the display come alive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help at all (!!) will be much appreciated. Is this even the correct forum for this question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I guess I will look for evidence of an upgraded Intel video driver...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Phil</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: turns out the driver for this chip set is maintained by Microsoft; Intel site (which makes no mention of WIndows 10, at least under G45/G43 page) says (in essence) "install your windows updates if you think driver is out of date." (Not terribly useful.)</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We have been seeing black screen issues of several types after upgrading to Windows 10. The main causes observed so far are driver issues, output to unexpected port, and possibly
 also issues with the Lock Screen app. Please use these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you see the black screen
<strong><span>only</span></strong> <strong>
<span>after sign-in </span></strong>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></li><li>
<span>If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>If this resolves the black screen, use corruption resolution steps (dism, then sfc), and run the all apps PowerShell command in

<span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></li><li>
<span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.

</li></ul>
</ol>
<p><span><span>Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the detailed reply. I learn some more things about Windows 10 (and the new directions the OS is going) from it, but this did not clear the issue. Let me provide some more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On boot up, the bios signs on, then the 4-pane window symbol with the busy icon below. That clears to a blank screen and stays that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use either ESC or space, and then login blind. I then use window-p / down arrow once / enter, and the screen shows up. (That puts the "mulitple monitors" into duplicate mode.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager shows only once video card. (This is a Dell all-in-one -- I don't like all-in-one's but it's not mine.) The video chipset is Intel G45/G43. I checked Intel's site and it informed me that drivers come from Microsoft, use the update system to
 install any new ones. Well... I checked for updates, got the cumulative update installed, but that changed not the driver version, which is 8.15.10.2702.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no driver to rollback to. (I had already tried that before posting to this site.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the blank screen (no mouse, by the way!), shows up before logging in, I ran the DISM tool suggested above anyway. It found no errors and performed no repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fiddled with a lot of video settings changes, but always get "the display settings could not be saved. Please try a different combination of display settings." (That's a bizarre, unhelpful message, by the way, for the average user.) Even if I try
 to change the resolution, even reduce the resolution, that's all I get. The display settings will not change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So... I'm still stuck. I can't return this computer as it is its owner. I need more options. I appreciate your help. I would hate to have to revert this machine to Windows 7. (I had to do it on my own, by the way, for very different problems. That makes
 it more important to me to see some success some where.)</p>

            <p>Further note (addendum to above posts):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed that Intel has release *some* drivers for Windows 10, but unfortunately it does not cover the chipset I'm dealing with: G45/G43, under Windows 10. Intel still insists that one's up to MSFT to provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone over in ever increasing (and diminishing at the same time, if you know what I mean) circles with the video installation, settings, tweaks...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can not change resolution</p>
<p>Can not change to single monitor mode, although it has only one</p>
<p>Uninstalled video driver and rebooted; no change</p>
<p>Tried automatic driver update; no bingo</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can some one from MSFT at least say if that is (or isn't) a bad driver and a replacement is expected out in NN days / weeks or months? If it's a few days, I'll wait. If it's longer, I gotta revert to Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MORE INFORMATION, MSFT! An official questions and answers and how it seems to be at this moment, up to the date news, would be very helpful, including what you are or intend to do, where it's at. You know, chatty version of a bug tracking system for public
 consumption. That would help me with decisions. Also decisions like when to quit knocking my head against the brick wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My issue is similar but different...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a surface pro 3 that recently upgraded to windows 10. I usually put into a MS docking station...prior to the upgrade, the screen on the tablet was duplicated on the extra screen connected to the docking station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now, when the machine goes to sleep sometimes ( about 50%) when i wake it, i get a black screen on my screen...When i check settings on the tablet, it has changed by itself from duplicate screen to screen extended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea how to fix?</p>

            <p>I did a workaround. I created a batch file that runs at startup that automatically changes the display to duplicate.</p>
<p>Only issue I had was batch file would only run at login. So I changed another setting so it would automatically log me in when computer was started.</p>

            I am having the same issue. I just installed Windows 10 and once I updated the NVidia drivers, I got black screen. Then, after various reboots, for a while it worked just fine. Then I made the mistake of turning the computer off. Now I'm back to black
 screen. Ctrl log-in gets me the Windows home screen, without my desktop shortcuts, and it's apparent when I click on the icons in the task bar that the programs are indeed opening - but not visibly. Clearly they are opening on the imaginary desktop Windows
 10 thinks I have. Instead of copy-pasting a fix for "black screen," I would sure love to see someone at Microsoft actually address this question. How do I make Windows 10 understand I only have one screen? How do I do that when I CANNOT SEE OR ACCESS anything?

            You probably already know this, but MS is the last place anyone should look for an actual fix to Windows problems.&nbsp; I'm not the only one who's found them singularly useless at actually addressing the problem. However, I've been searching the net and have
 not found useful fixes for this particular issue, although many people seem to be experiencing it. If I find something useful (I doubt it will come from Microsoft) I'll share it here.

</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Have you installed all pending Windows updates?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Its a manufacturer who releases new compatible drivers for their devices. However you can install previous operating systems drivers in compatibility mode also install all pending Windows updates as driver updates are also part of Windows updates. Hope this

            <p>I have a similar problem as these other people. I have all updates from Intel and AMD (i have 2 graphics cards.) and From Windows Update, But my screen still goes from laptop screen to another invisible screen. Screen 1 is invisible screen, and screen two
 is now my laptop screen. I found that if i add another monitor to my Thinkpad T500, the problem goes away. Hope this helped.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I can use a&nbsp; CanoScan LiDE110 Scanner using Windows XP but not Windows 7. However the older version Canonlide 100 will work with both XP and Windows 7.
</p>
<p>I need to use the 110 version with Windows 7 . The software installs correctly on both XP and Win 7. It scans the document / image and freezes when scanned.</p>
<p>Any solutions</p>

            <p>Hi Nella,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that you are unable to perform system repair and disk defragmentation from standard user account as it prompts you for Administrator password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand how frustrating it can be when things don’t work as expected. Not to worry we
</span></p>
<p><span>will try to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are logged on to Windows with a standard account, you can do almost anything that you can do with an administrator account, but if you want to do something that affects other users of the computer, such as installing software or changing security
 settings, Windows might ask you to provide a password for an administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not set any password for your administrator account, Press Enter without entering anything in the password space. If the issue persist, I suggest you to set password for your administrator account and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Post back with result so that we can assist you further.</p>

<p>The blank password for the Administrator account, while booting into Safe Mode, only works under certain circumstances. Yours does not appear to be one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recover from demoting your own account you need to go through a rather complex process. Let's take it in steps to see if you can follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the Control Panel / Backup and Resture and create (=burn) a System Repair Disk (=CD). If successful, goto Step 2.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Change the boot order of your BIOS so that the machine uses the CD drive as its primary boot device. Now boot the machine with your Repair Disk. Go to Step 3 if you get to the Repair Menu without getting challenged for a password.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select System Restore, then restore the machine to a point before you demoted your one and only admin account.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Boot up normally, then create, test and document a second admin account in order to be protected against future mishaps.</p>

<h3> lindseybenger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Essentials 2012 re Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 10. &nbsp;I want to download and use Windows Movie Maker as I did on my previous laptop. &nbsp;From what I can tell, Windows Essentials 2012 is no long available for download. &nbsp; I can't find any other way to download Windows
 Movie Maker. &nbsp; I've looked in the Windows 10 app store and searched all through the forums and other websites. &nbsp; Maybe I'm overlooking something simple because there doesn't seem to be any reference to an inability to download Windows Essentials and/or Windows
 Moive Maker on a new Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Windows Movie Maker on my new Windows 10 Laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows Movie Maker is part of the Windows Essentials 2012 which reached the end of support last January 10, 2017. I regret to say that it is no longer available for download. For reference, you may review the

</p><p>You might want to add a caveat that that program isn't by Microsoft at all. They may have a similar name and be hosted in the Windows Store, but that's not a Microsoft creation. It's made by VideoPix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't have any suggested replacement for Movie Maker in the store. You are on your own now.</p>

            X10-59871 is the generic OEM (aka System Builder) version of the Windows XP Pro installation CD, at the SP2 level.
<div><br />
<div>If you intend to install this on a "home-built" PC, you will need to use the key that you unfortunately lost.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you can still boot up that PC, running <a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Belarc</a> or <a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder</a> will give you that key. Write it down and/or type it up and keep it in a safe place!</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you intend to install this on a major-OEM PC (such as Dell, HP, Sony, etc.) AND if that PC has a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker on it indicating Windows XP Pro, then you may use your CD along with they key on that COA sticker.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if you merely downloaded the .iso for this CD, as Noel pointed out, no one here can give you a Product Key. Not only does it violate copyright and the EULA, but it would also mean whoever gives you the key will lose a working system (since the key
 would become invalid on the original PC)!</div>

            <p>I am also having this problem. It is on my Surface Pro. Immediately after I upgraded the Surface Pro from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 (Build 10240) on July 30 the Mail app was working perfectly. &nbsp;I had added 5 email accounts to it, including my Outlook.com
 account, my ISP account, my Yahoo account and two GMail accounts. &nbsp;All were working fine for a few days then they stopped working a few days ago with the above error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the emails that had been downloaded before the sync stopped working are still in view, even after removing and re-adding the accounts, but nothing new will sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting and re-adding the email accounts. &nbsp;That did not fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the Mail and Calendar app (the only way to do this is with brute force through the PowerShell) and reinstalling it from the Store. &nbsp;That also did not fix anything. &nbsp;Even after removing the Mail and Calendar app and reinstalling it I can
 still view the emails that were downloaded before the sync stopped working but nothing new will sync and I still get the same meaningless error code. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched on the error code and the results indicate that it applies to a whole range of issues with completely unrelated features and functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I should mention that the Mail app is syncing those same 5 accounts perfectly on a desktop system with Windows 10 Build 10240 installed. &nbsp;This is the desktop system that I have been using for the Windows Insider Technical Preview program. &nbsp;It has had
 every build released on the Fast ring installed on it as upgrades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My problem appears to be solved, at least for now. I did a system image shortly after the upgrade as soon as I determined that everything was good. I restored that system image and the Mail and Calendar app started working again. I have allowed all the updates
 to continue so the Surface Pro is completely up to date again and Mail is still working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have signed the Surface Pro up for Insider Previews on the fast ring so the latest beta build is now installed and running on it. Mail is still working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there's probably nothing in what I did that is likely to help anyone else. I was just lucky enough to have made a system image at the right time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same symptoms. Worked until recently until I found out that it had stopped syncing two days ago.</p>
<p>In the account settings, the option "Change mailbox sync settings" is greyed out.</p>

            <p>Hi again</p>
<p>This situation is getting ridiculous!!</p>
<p>More and more people seem to be having similar problems..&nbsp; My "Change mailbox sync settings" is also greyed out and cannot be activated.</p>
<p>I then deleted my two mailbox accounts with the intension of reinstalling them but the error code 0x800706ba will not even let me do this.</p>
<p>I considered going back to Windows 7 but reading on different forums the problems incurred by&nbsp;many who have done this, it does not seem a viable option. It seems that with all the niggles with Windows 10 we are all up the creek without a paddle and no solution
 is forthcoming from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>same problem here. I contacted microsoft and they wanted to do a "deep troubleshooting procedure" at the cost of $100.</p>
<p>I removed the app via powershell, reinstalled it from the store and it will not allow me to add my account now. Error code 0x800706ba</p>

<p>Hi Efrain,<br />
<br />
The error code that you’ve encountered on your computer may be caused by some configuration or files mismatched. To sort out your concern, we suggest that you perform the rebuild option on your Windows computer from the
<strong>Windows Recovery </strong>environment using the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. This process will repair Windows boot configuration in order to run the
<strong>Operating</strong> <strong>System</strong> properly. This option will not remove the files on your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, you may follow the steps below: <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Press the <strong>Shift</strong> key on your keyboard while pressing <strong>
F8</strong> quickly and continuously.</li><li>On the<strong> Choose an option</strong> window, select <strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>On the Command Prompt window, press <strong>Enter</strong> after typing each of the following commands:
<ul>
<li><strong>bootrec /FixMbr</strong></li><li><strong>bootrec /FixBoot </strong></li><li><strong>bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>Once you’re done, you may restart your computer, and then check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you receive a message, take note of it and send it to us.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the suggestion works for you.<br />
<br />
