<h2>            Skype password reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reset my password on my Skype account and when i try i get told to send the recovery code to an email that<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>is no longer on my skype account</strong></span>. I can not understand this . I changed the primary
 email address a long time ago because i can no longer access that old email address - in fact it no longer exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still logged in on another device and in my account details i can clearly see the primary and secondary emails that i had set up a long time ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does the recovery process ask me for the email that i initially signed up with over 15 years ago ?????&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>I also tried to go through the recovery process and no matter how accurate my info, i still get rejected - EVEN THOUGH I AM LITERALLY COPYING FROM MY OWN PROFILE SCREEN !!!</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the recovery process i am asked if i have ever bought Skype credit and i answer yes but that was a couple of years back the the credit card is expired
<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">BUT THE FORM ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO ENTER EXPIRY DATES IN THE FUTURE. How am i supposed to enter the right info ??</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">i don't know what to do! Please advise</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thanks</span></p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3c4401a3-84d4-409a-ac20-f445fbfe86bf" title="Wolfpackw">
<p>
</p><p>You can only recover your Skype account through the verification form.&nbsp;For additional information, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</li><li>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</li><li>You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</li></ul>

<p>Hi Kenneth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply but i can't use the information that i had previously because this account is
<strong>VERY OLD. THUS date of birth and other fields were not required back then.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If i was to fill it in with whatever i had back then , i would have almost nothing to fill in. I logged on many times and over the years i added information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this verification be done over the phone by a human person ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't reply with a cut and paste reply telling me that the reason why it does not work is because i have not filled in the correct information.</p>
<p>I have filled in the correct information but Microsoft has made a mess of managing the information and has not accounted for the discrepancies between the old and new systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good way to verify would be to ask questions about recent activity - like how banks do it. I can tell you recent info much more accurately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it doesn't make sense to just say "fill in what you had originally" because things change - addresses, names, cards expire etc. -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Microsoft ignoring the fact that i deleted that old email address from my account a long time ago since i had no way of accessing it anymore??? IS that not the right thing to do - update one's information as it changes ?? Why can't i get the reset
 code at the new email address that i set up many many months ago ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not makes sense - what is the point in adding an address to your account if it does not get used???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to conclude that Microsoft , in their infinite wisdom have decided that the first time someone forgets their password, they will send to the old address which they are storing in contravention of the Data Protection Act and GDPR since i deleted it
 and that means that i am no longer sharing that information with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider this situation carefully before pasting one of the ready-made replies in here. This is a serious offence and i will draw attention to it in the social media sphere. It would be best to just try to pass this matter on to someone who can actually
 help me right now, or give me a number i can call right now to reach someone that can help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no point in waiting until Twitter-sphere picks this up, and any other media and it blows up in MS' face.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat&nbsp;<span>YOU NO LONGER HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THE EMAIL ADDRESS THAT IS REMOVED FROM MY SKYPE ACCOUNT - WHY ARE YOU STILL USING IT???</span></p>

<p><span>Yesterday i began to do a backup of my C: drive in order to reinstall&nbsp;the OS on my pc (windows vista

i run the chkdsk on the drive twice, it replaced some bad files but i still get the same message again and again.<br />

<p><span>If you are continuously getting hard drive errors and it does not pass a hard drive test, it is likely that the drive is failing as has been mentioned and
 may need to be replaced. I would recommend you at least make a backup to another hard drive or CD/DVD in the event of a complete failure.</span></p>

<h2>            PC constantly crashing</h2>
                    <p>My PC which I bought premade by iBuypower about 2 years ago has been crashing consistently about 4-5 months prior to now. No matter what I am doing it seems to crash or freeze and then crash, whether that's gaming or browsing the internet. I have reinstalled
 windows 10 multiple times and the problem still persists. I have replaced EVERY component in my pc and yet it still crashes. The amount of time and money spent I should have bought a new pc by now. I have researched far and near for any possible solutions
 throughout the internet and I have read some threads which had similar issues but their remedies have not worked in my case. I have not replaced the case yet but at this point I might as well. Any input and feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi IamDumbfoundead, I am Rob, an independent and a 12 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />Since you have re-installed Windows the issue has to be hardware though be sure you are running the latest BIOS and chipset drivers available.
<br />
<br />Have there been any BSOD or repeating error messages? If BSOD you can post the minidumps so I can analyze them. If Error Messages check the Event Viewer log (see below).
<br />
<br />Have you removed and reseated (not just snugged) all cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible)?
<br />
<br />Is the power supply well capable of the requirements of the computer?
<br />
<br />Heat cause a lot of strange issues especially on gaming machines. Open the case and use a strong fan blowing into it on the CPU and video card as a test to see if that helps.
<br />
<br />Bring the system down to as simple as possible, including minimum memory, to see if that helps.
<br />
<br />Check the memory extremely thoroughly as indicated below.
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />Check in Event Viewer for possible references.
<br />
<br />Using Event Viewer to Troubleshoot Problems
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/school/using-windows-admin-tools-like-a-pro/lesson3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/school/using-windows-...</a> 
<br />
<br />Ignore it, not all Event Viewer errors can be corrected or are important.
<br />
<br />FullEventLogView - Free is a simple tool for Windows 10/8/7/Vista that displays in a table the details of all events from the event logs of Windows, including the event description. It allows you to view the events of your local computer, eventsof a remote computer on your network, and events stored in .evtx files. It also allows you to export the events list to text/csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file from the GUI and from command-line. 
<br /><a href="http://nirsoft.net/utils/full_event_log_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nirsoft.net/utils/full_event_log_view.html</a> 
<br />
<br />TIP  : Options - Advanced Options - allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file - set it to a bit before and after the time of the EVENT.
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

            Hi IamDumbfoundead
<br />
<br />Please check to see if your system has produced any minidump files:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the inputs. To answer some of your questions, for the BSOD's, the errors is either CRITICAL PROCESS DIED or UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION. Now yesterday a new error developed such as KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED. I just replaced my PSU yesterday as
 well so I don't know if it's because of the PSU just yet. However, I have looked for the minidumps and I cannot find any. When I look through my events, specifically the volmgr, it says the creation of dump failed. So this could be the reason why no dump files
 are being created. Also, I have made sure all of the cables are snug and reseated. From what I have been told 500 watts is sufficient for my hardware. The thing about the heat issue is that my pc crashes intermittently, whether I am gaming or just leave it
 idle, so I don't believe heat is the issue, but I am no expert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree with you that it is a hardware issue, but I have swapped and replaced every component such as the CPU, ram, mobo, gpu, psu. I have manually updated all drivers. I do have the PC connected to a power board, I don't know if that may be a problem
 or not.</p>

            Please through every step outlined in my previous post such as making the system as simple as possible.
<br />
<br />Plug the PC directly into the Wall to see if it helps. The Issue could be a brown out condition in your house though you would expect there would be other indications.
<br />
<br />500 watts is not a lot of power for a gaming pc.

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out why there are no minidumps. So when my PC crashes and gets the BSOD, the PC does not restart nor does it goes to 100% as if it is creating an error file, it literally stays on the BSOD, until I restart the PC. Also, another strange issue that
 occurred a few times is that when I was gaming or attempted to start a game, my whole PC would freeze, no BSOD or crashes, it just freezes, until I restart it manually. This issue either happens when I attempted to start a game or when I am an hour or two
 into gaming, which is very odd and intermittent. Also with the components I have 500 watts is sufficient, according to apps I have used and opinions from others.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did the driver verifier but nothing really came back or at least nothing happened. The temps of the CPU while I was gaming stayed under 40 degrees, SSD stayed under 40 degrees, GPU was borderline 79-80 degrees, but that's normal from what I've been
 told. I also plugged the PC into the wall outlet but the issue is still consistent. For example, today I left my PC idle for maybe 2-3 hours and I came back to a BSOD, with error code UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION, and it stayed at 0%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post that screen resolution will not work in safe mode. So you cannot increase or decrease display resolution in safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<p><strong>Apply to Folders</strong> works on a per-type basis. Folder types are:
<strong>General/Generic, Documents, Photos, Music, Video, Contacts</strong>, and a few others. So you have to use it once for each folder type.</p>
<p>You can determine the type of folder by viewing the <strong>Customize</strong> tab in the folder's
<strong>Properties</strong> dialog:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34e6e9da-0e48-4d0f-acbe-69f6ced02a95?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34e6e9da-0e48-4d0f-acbe-69f6ced02a95?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For each type, Windows creates an entry in the Registry under:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams\Defaults</p>
<p>Here, there is only a template set for Documents, represented by the entry named '{7D49D726-3C21-4F05-99AA-FDC2C9474656}'</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b930b9f9-3177-4614-a6f4-8d5ef74a9877?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b930b9f9-3177-4614-a6f4-8d5ef74a9877?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>You can check here to see if you have a template set. The common folder types are:</p>
<p>-----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----<br />
{5c4f28b5-f869-4e84-8e60-f11db97c5cc7} Generic<br />
{5fa96407-7e77-483c-ac93-691d05850de8} Videos<br />
{7d49d726-3c21-4f05-99aa-fdc2c9474656} Documents<br />
{94d6ddcc-4a68-4175-a374-bd584a510b78} Music<br />
{b3690e58-e961-423b-b687-386ebfd83239} Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>So check to see if you have templates set for these types.</p>

 the data. The Repair-bde command-line tool is intended for use when the operating system does not start, or when you cannot start the BitLocker Recovery Console. However, if the drive has been physically damaged, it may not be recoverable.</span></p>

<h2>            &#39;Some Files Missing&#39; while trying to create recovery media &#40;Updated Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My system came with OEM installed Windows 8. I was able to upgrade it to 8.1 Pro through my college. Then came windows 10 and i was able to upgrade again to windows 10 pro. None of the people who updated were given a Product Key or installation media. To
 ensure i am protected against any unforeseen OS issues, i tried to create a recovery media. A 32 GB USB drive ought to have been sufficient I believed. But it never mattered.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as i start the wizard to create the recovery media and click next (both with backup files option checked or unchecked), the next screen very graciously informs me that some files are missing and recovery media couldn't created and that i should use
 installation media to reinstall the OS if needed. Now without Microsoft providing me with the Product Key, this is going to be a very expensive affair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems people get 2 kinds of errors, (Dont know if there are more ways to mess with us on this issue)</p>
<p>1) Where the process begins and you start seeing a green progress bar and then it dies on you without any explanation.</p>
<p>2) Where you aren't lucky enough to see the progress bar and the software tells you that Microsoft has
<strong>conveniently</strong> forgotten to put some essential files in Windows 10 to allow you create a recovery to save your work/life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My case is the latter one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if i have installed the Operating system incorrectly. (I dont see how i could've done that since i had
<strong>absolutely no part </strong>in the process except for confirming my desire to upgrade to Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if installing / uninstalling software available from the internet (<strong>regular usage of a computer</strong>) could've done this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know if there is a fix to this issue. (Unlikely, since these questions are still unanswered on various forums online.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know if Microsoft is planning to/<strong>has a desire to</strong>/has started work on this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont even know why i bothered to post this entire thing here since i dont see any hope of this being resolved by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even contacted the online tech support and asked them about this issue. All he could ask me was to run sfc /scannow in an elevated cmd and see if it recognizes any issues with my system files. (Spoiler alert: It didn't!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that he asked me to create another profile with admin privileges and try to run the wizard again. It didnt work for me either obviously.</p>
<p>After that some other technician (after re-establishing connection) told me that Microsoft doesn't have a tech division that takes care of recovery issues. Thats when i lost hope.... i think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone figures something out, please let me know. You are free to try the methods i was asked. Let me know it works for you.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>You posted your problem as a Discussion rather than a Question&nbsp;and it seems to have been missed.&nbsp; Have you been able to resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you create the official Windows 10 media on a 4GB or larger USB flash drive/thumb drive&nbsp;by running the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; Create the Edition that matches your Windows 10 Edition (usually Home or Pro).&nbsp; This can do all that the Recovery
 drive media can do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you choose to create an ISO file, you can mount that and run setup.exe from it to update your existing install.&nbsp; Choose to keep Windows settings and do not enter any product key during or after the install.&nbsp; Windows 10 free upgrade does not use any product
 key to activate Windows.&nbsp; This may also restore the ability to properly create the recovery media by running recoverydrive.exe which you are having issue with, but as mentioned, the full Windows 10 install media can perform the same purpose for you.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Messaging Glitch</h2>
                    Hello! For some reason, my Xbox one shows me as having an unread message. I head to messages and don’t have any unread. Then, on the app on my phone, the icon has a red 4, but no messages when opening it.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is fixed on the Xbox but not the app, then the app may just be having some temporary issues with updating the servers that those messages have been read. It&nbsp;seems like it could&nbsp;just a glitch in that the notifications are still visible although
 the message itself has already been read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to have the Xbox app on a Windows 10 PC to check? Also check account.xbox.com and then look at your messages if it's glitching online as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't already, go ahead and uninstall the app, restart your phone, and then install the app again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what it shows online.</p>

            I’ve had the issue in the pas. For me, my Xbox randomly selected a chat that was practically all the way down my messages list, and marked it as unread. I just had to find it, and “read” it again.&nbsp;

            yes, other people have noted the same problem.  Here are some possible work arounds
<br />
<br />SCREEN BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT BROKEN AFTER WINDOWS 10 VERSION 1803 UPDATE - FOR LAPTOPS WITH INTEL HD GRAPHICS
<br /><a href="https://www.directly.com/dashboard/index/952735745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.directly.com/dashboard/index/952735745</a> 
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />After doing the 1803 update, my Acer Aspire 7741 laptop with Intel HD Graphics (and I3-370M processor) had its Screen Brightness adjustment broken.
<br />
<br />The setting bar for screen brightness adjustment inside the Windows settings panel (brightness slider) is visible and adjustable, and adjusting the values by the shortcut "Fn + arrow keys" also works; BUT despite the change of brightness values at the software level it has no immediate effect on the hardware level. Setting a new screen brightness value, will only become implemented at the hardware level after a reboot of Windows. So each time my computer boots, it correctly reads and implements the latest set screen brightness value. However, adjusting screen brightness values should of course also be possible without requiring a reboot. Hope this bug will get fixed by Microsoft soon.
<br />
<br />The above described problem, apparently is related to: Laptop users with "Intel HD Graphics" (utilizing the latest Intel screen driver 8.15.10.2900).
<br />
<br />A workaround to fix the bug, which seems to work for all the screen adjustment bug hit laptops with Intel HD Graphics -except for Acer Aspire laptops. The workaround is to install an old Intel screen driver version 8.15.10.2253 (for Intel HD Graphics), instead of utilizing the latest driver version 8.15.10.2900. For 
<br />further instruction, please visit the three links below):
<br />

<br />indicating it does not work for Acer Aspire) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/8gbu3v/cant_control_screen_brightness_after_installing/?st=jhhp5hc8&amp;sh=7fb863cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/8gb...</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />However, we are so far 2 users of an Acer Aspire laptop with Intel HD Graphics (Aspire 7741 and Aspire 5752G), who unsuccessfully have tried to fix the bug on our computer by implementing the above described method.
<br />
<br />FYI, I have tried using all of the following Intel HD Graphics screen drivers: 8.15.10.2900 (default), 8.15.10.2253, and 8.15.10.2021. Also tried out just to use the Microsoft Basic Screen Card driver. None of these attempts solved the problem for my Acer 
<br />Aspire.

<br />8 WAYS TO ADJUST THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IN WINDOWS (ALL VERSIONS)
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/adjust-screen-brightness-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/adjust-screen-b...</a> 
<br />If you use a laptop, a tablet or some other mobile device, you need to adjust the brightness of the display, so that you can see better, depending on whether you are indoors or outdoors. Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7, offer many ways of changing the screen brightness and most users do not know even half of them. If you are looking for the fastest way to change the display’s brightness, read our tutorial:
<br />
<br />REG HACK
<br />
<br />In the Windows Start menu search for: regedit  
<br />
<br />
<br />In the left panel of RegEdit look for the following folder:  
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ ControlSet001 \ Control \ Class \ {4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318} \ 0000  
<br />
<br />(Sometimes the final folder can be 0001)  
<br />
<br />Located in this folder look for the following record:  
<br />Feature Test Control  
<br />Open and give a value of fb20 in hexadecimal and Accept.  
<br />It will then appear as 0x0000fb20 (64288) in the right pane.  
<br />Additionally, place the following record in the same folder:  
<br />
<br />KMD_EnableBrightnessInterface2  
<br />Open and give a value of 0 and accept.  
<br />After these steps, restart the computer.  
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

 to customize the power theme, by removing it from ever 'sleeping' Power: No hibernate, No sleep, turn screen OFF after 30 minutes.&nbsp; STILL COULD NOT WAKE IN THE AM.&nbsp; So i changed the power theme again: Power: No hibernate, No sleep, Turn screen off NEVER. STILL
 COULD NOT WAKE IN THE AM. So i changed it again. Power: No hibernate, Sleep after 1 hour, Turn screen off NEVER. STILL CANNOT WAKE IN THE AM.&nbsp; The only way i can 'wake' my computer in any of these scenarios is by using the Power button and shutting it down.
 Since i have apps running when this happens, i know i have seriously screwed up some programs. I know there was a device driver issue in 2015 with the Intel graphics that was causing a similar problem, but since it has been 4 years, i am HOPING that this was
 resolved and my version of the driver&nbsp; Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 version 24.20.100.6025 is not the problem. At this point i can only set the power to never hibernate, never sleep, never turn off the display, and run a screen saver. From what i have noticed,
 this is the only way to keep from seeing a black screen in the AM. This is a serious problem and i do not know what to do. Does anyone else have this issue and is there a solution that a NON IT person can fix without professional help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>FYI this laptop had windows 10 installed when i purchased, however, the backup portion of my settings has a section that says:
</p>
<p>"LOOKING FOR AN OLDER BACKUP? If you created a backup using the Windows 7 Backup and Restore tool, it still works in Windows 10.
<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">Go to Backup and restore (windows 7)</span>"&nbsp; Does this mean that this laptop was manufactured with windows 7 and the store where purchased, installed Windows 10 prior to my purchase?&nbsp; Or is this just the name of the backup tool?</p>

            Hi jkhcast 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />I recommend that you update your BIOS for your PC.
<br />So you will need to go to HPs site and find the BIOS for your model.
<br />From there follow their instructions to update your BIOS.
<br />See if that helps at all.

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>after the upgrade to windows 10 the scanner on the Canon MP800 stopped working (still works on XP and windows 7). The printer part still worked. After the lastest update the printer stopped working as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer and scanner still work well and I would still like to continue to use them. Is there is a way to get the printer to work.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer/scanner and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and&nbsp;drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<p>I've found the printer does work. The scanner does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft changes the nature of the driver spec then surely the issue lies with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canon responded and said that they no longer support driver for the printer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>They say that they respect the right of the customer to upgrade their OS. The problem is that it becomes necessary to upgrade the OS to support new hardware and ensure security (etc) updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you've pass responsibility to Canon and Canon passes responsibility to the customer even though the driver model is created by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a work around to allow my scanner to work.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Canon writes and provides the drivers. Try using the latest available version. Other than that you can revert back to previous Windows version or get a supported printer/scanner.<br />

<p>I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right place, or if anyone else had difficulty getting it. but I bought the Scott Pilgrim game like six weeks ago...it said up to 5 weeks just to get an email. since then I've been checking my email at least once a
 week just to see if I was suppose to get some sort of notification or something. Did I miss something? Was it just suppose to appear in avatar editor? Do I get a code? I know its trivial...but its part of the reason I went ahead and bought the game...don't
 normally do the xbl game thing.</p>

<p>They should email you a code for it. Usually the wait time starts at the end of the promotion. So if you bought it 6 weeks ago, you may still have to wait a week or so depending on when the promo ended. If you stilll don't get it, you'd need to try contacting
 support or posting in this forum - <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I had/am having the same problem, and like you pretty much only bought the game because it came with the item I was going to buy anyway. I still haven't gotten mine so if you post whenever you get yours I would greatly appreciate it. I tried to get a hold
 of Microsoft and I was told that they didn't have that promotion in their records.</p>

<h2>            Alarms app suddenly not working</h2>
                    <p>I normally set an alarm on my&nbsp;Surface (Windows RT 8.1)&nbsp;to wake myself up in the morning, but a few weeks ago, it stopped working. It wouldn't show a notification on the lock screen or sound off. I have also tried setting an alarm to go off when my PC was
 awake. This time it would show the notification, but still wouldn't sound off. The alarms app was working perfectly fine a few weeks ago and stopped working without any warning, making me run late several times.</p>

    <title>Help needed to fix permissions issue please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soft answer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help needed to fix permissions issue please</h2>
                    Hi, I have win 7 64bit home premium. My user permissions have been messed up by a piece of software which I have now uninstalled. I am having difficulty fixing the problem. I am only a slightly tech savvy home user. I have been trying to follow the following
 advice, however it doesn't work for me:-<br />
&nbsp;Type %LOCALAPPDATA% into the navigation bar (include the % percent signs).<br />
- Then right click on the Temp folder and go to properties. Select the Security tab.<br />
Once you're in the security tab select your user and make sure the user has full control of the folder. You can see this in the following image:<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrqdf4gnqrgojdy/Screenshot%202014-02-03%2010.29.03.png<br />
- In addition to that go to "Properties" -&gt; "Security" -&gt; "Advanced" and select "Enable Inheritance" and "Replace child object ...". The image below shows the screen:<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/w0y7caz0i91g3q7/Screenshot%202014-02-03%2014.08.57.png<br />
(I should say that Dropbox didn't cause the problem, but was affected, as were other programs using the temp folder, hence the source of the advice)<br />
<br />
First basic info about permissions set up on my machine, then the difficulty with the advice.<br />
I have three user accounts on my machine with the following levels of permissions - Admin,(admin level) Personal Account(standard), and Guest (guest level).<br />
Machine is not part of a network<br />
&nbsp;I have noticed that when I look in Admin&nbsp; Local\Temp security, users are listed as follows :-<br />
SYSTEM<br />
Administrators(asus-PC\Administrators).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Authenticated Users<br />
<br />
Authenticated Users have all permissions except full and special, so I assume this does not include personal and guest.<br />
personal and guest are not mentioned. &nbsp;<br />
While in Admin, win explorer does not find the personal\local\temp folder even in 'computer'<br />
&nbsp;So I have to access it from the Personal Account.&nbsp; The security tab in temp folder here lists users as follows: -<br />
Admin(asus-PC\Administrators)<br />
Everyone<br />
&nbsp;( Everyone account has only read, write permissions)<br />
Attempt to log into guest a/c brings blank black screen<br />
DIFFICULTY I WOULD LIKE HELP with please, is:-<br />
When trying to change permissions in personal\local\temp security, which I have explained I cannot seem to access from Admin account, I have the following difficulties:- I can delete the word Everyone, but when I try to add SYSTEM the process begins then error
 msg&nbsp; appears saying access denied.<br />
&nbsp;When I try to add Personal Account to this list I get the following error message " the following object is not from a domain listed in the select location dialog box, and is therefore not valid " (I have the correct font case, and have tried without a space,
 and have tried adding Personal Account(asus-PC\Personal Account).<br />
<br />
Sadly, a restore point that would otherwise have been useful, is no longer in the list of restore points available, so would like to fix this without having to do anything more major. Thanks, Jay

            <p>This all sound like rather messy damage caused by Melware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the program you uninstalled that you say has caused this problem? </p>
<p>I ask because it may still be there affecting your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, you can try running <strong>chkdsk</strong> to try and sort out you operating system some. You could then download JRT to your desktop and run that which will sort out anything that shouldn't be in your registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To run chkdsk</strong>:<br />
<br />
Start orb and then to Run<br />
Type in <strong>Chkdsk /r</strong> Note the space between k and /<br />
Click Enter ...It will probably ask if you want to do this on the next reboot...enter Y<br />
<br />
If the window doesn't shutdown on its own then reboot the system manually. On reboot the system will start the chkdsk operation<br />
<br />
Note... there are 5 stages...<br />
It may appear to hang at a certain percent for a hour or more or even back up and go over the same area...this is normal...<br />
DO NOT SHUT YOUR COMPUTER DOWN WHILE CHKDSK IS RUNNING OR YOU CAN HAVE SEVERE PROBLEMS<br />
This can take a bit of time to complete depending on your system.<br />
When completed it will boot the system back into windows.<br />
<br />
Reboot after your done running chkdsk /r...<br />
then Go to Start then Run and type: eventvwr.msc&nbsp; press Enter<br />
When Event Viewer opens, click on Applications... then scroll down to Winlogon and double-click on it. This is the log created after running chkdsk... you can copy and paste the log back here if you wish.</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Run JRT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Download to Desktop only&nbsp; (does not have to be installed) JRT<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> HERE</a> and run the program (do not touch anything until it finishes).</p>
<p>It will remove anything from the registry that should not be there.</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if things have improved, but you might have had has some vicious melware that only a clean OS install can fix. Make sure you backup all personal files now, just in case things are going from bad to even worse. Get your personal data OFF the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have recommended can do no harm, only good.</p>
<p>Knowing what that program you uninstalled was might help a lot.</p>

            <p>Hi, I have good reason to doubt that it is a malware problem, and want to follow the user error/inexperience line of enquiry before I do anything to the disc. Though Chkdsk could be a good idea. Am hoping someone on this forum will see something I am doing
 wrong.&nbsp; Have discovered that unlike the other versions of Win 7, none of&nbsp; The 'home' versions have a 'local security settings' editor, or a 'Group policy 'editor. This is explained here:-</p>
<p>http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/326685-gpedit-not-available-win-7-home.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://technobloggings.blogspot.com/2011/12/windows-7-home-premium-unlucky-view.htmlhttp://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/326685-gpedit-not-available-win-7-home.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this could also explain why I am having such problems correcting the permissions.</p>
<p>I may need to find a tech locally who can evaluate the advice given in these links, and work 'hands on' with this machine to put things right, as I am not experienced enough. Sometimes this OS needs extra steps in a process that are not listed in advice
 given on the web.</p>
<p>The software that caused the problem is Adobe XI. Although there are rumours that it only happens to pirated versions, this is not true.
</p>
<p>Regarding JRT, I am super careful what I install on my machine and where it comes from. I noticed a couple of good comments about it on the net, but There doesn't seem to be much of a history. I already have the premium version of one of the security softwares
 most highly rated by AV-Test in detection and dealing with all types of Malware. (But there is always room for error in any software, of course.)</p>
<p>Thanks, Jay</p>

            <p>JRT does not install on your computer when used. It's just one of many non-install tools in most tech tool kits that help clean up melware damage (a safe one that can be used without tech supervision). JRT has been around since Adam was a lad :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be far easier for you to upgrade to W7 Pro. than to try to do a hack job on
<strong>W7 home</strong> to try and access <strong>gpedit.msc </strong>(group policy editor). Using a downloaded binary software to try and do this and then altering your registry, may or may not work.&nbsp; It might also seriously mess up your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your wary of downloading and using software, it's a good idea to stay that way. Especially from a software source that uses the below disclaimer.</p>

            <p>In the end, have decided to do system recovery, as it's actually probably the best, quickest, and cheapest option of the bunch as I have good back up. I was trying to avoid this, but of all possibilities it's starting to look simplest. I did try to run Chkdsk
 /r in my admin account. It flashed up momentarily, then disappeared. No sign of it running when I checked in task manager. Reboot - still nothing. Tried again - still nothing. I live in a different time zone to most people on the forums, so there is a full
 day between question and answer, which makes the process very lengthy</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all your advice, I have learned a few things in this process. Jay</p>
