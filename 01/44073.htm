<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t install halo update</h2>
                    
<p>It has been a week trying to install the new updates for halo MCC but I keep getting this installation error. I can't remove update either.</p>
<p>it's not a connection problem, so don't ask.</p>
<p>Connection: 105mbps,&nbsp;Connection type: LAN</p>
<p>I've reset many times, did the disc trick to make it re-establish a download, and nothing works.</p>
<p>I even deleted the game and redownloaded (3 hrs wasted), still didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Error code: 0x87e0000f
<p><span>Any advice!?</span></p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>its not system.exe causing it rather its Windows defender, indexing, security and maintence that is causing the issue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is when your computer goes into idle mode Windows task scheduler will trigger indexing of the files to improve search return results,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing that happens when your system goes into idle mode is windows defender see this as opportunity to do a root kit scan it use to be done three times over 24 hours now I believe it does these whenever the system is free to ensure the kernel and
 the root tree are not infected etc and or damage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During this time you will notice you your led light on computer tower going crazy this sign defender and indexing is working in the back ground.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A similar thing happens with anti-virus programs these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now issue with indexing is Internet explorer history is scan as it does this it will also trigger usage over the internet I never quite worked out why it does this its been in every version of windows since 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only explanation is windows is doing a backup of the file tracking history so you can restore that the index files to your system when you sign into your Microsoft&nbsp;account similar to one drive or its upload it to Microsoft for diagnostic reasons to improve
 indexing system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that there is no reason for indexing to access the internet but I noticed it on every computer I go too friends included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with security and maintence during the time your not using your computer it will kick to check your system for updates, relay diagnostic that its discovered that Microsoft need to improve and maintain your system and to correct issue that have been solved
 these are the reason why system.exe appears to be running at high pace. and using a lot of resource its normal process and it very noticeable on a laptop with only 4g of ram installed then on a desktop computer with more ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that due to the banks on the ram are being access all the time.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Windows 8.1 Korean Input..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an acer Aspire S7, which I bought from US. Honestly, I did not want to upgrade into 8.1 because I thought that there would be some issues because 8.1 is new... and the laptop just upgraded it automatically. After that, I can't switch my keyboard
 to Microsoft IME Korean Keyboard. The language switch option just does not show in any of toolbars or touchpad keyboard. My default language is in Korean, and I can see Korean fonts fine. I even downloaded the language pack and added Microsoft IME Korean to
 one of my input methods. This also happens for Chinese input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked so well when I was using windows 8, so I know that it's not the laptop's problem.</p>

<p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can add a keyboard layout to a language and switch to using that if you want to use the same layout to type in different languages.

<h2>            Frayed wires in Play-charge kit, Controllers, Wired headset...all accessories breaking</h2>
                    
<p>I am writing this post in hopes to spread awareness of how Xbox is designing their equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My experience with Microsoft, and their Xbox one accessories is as follows:</p>

<p>Since the launch of Xbox One, I have owned a total of: &nbsp;5 wireless controllers, 2 play and charge kits, and 3 wired headsets.&nbsp; Now, let’s be clear, I don’t own all of these things just for fun…I’m not a collector of xbox accessories…I don’t plan to sell
 them on ebay at a later date for a profit..</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have had NO CHOICE but to purchase these things in order to USE MY XBOX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;That last part is key.&nbsp; Because really, what is an Xbox One without its accessories?&nbsp; It’s nothing but an oversized, bulky, and honestly fairly ugly paper weight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Suppose I could have used the clumsy voice commands to navigate through the menus, but only to watch Netflix…not play a game, or communicate with my friends (through xbox live which I am also paying a monthly subscription for).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to get 2 of my 5 controllers for free from Microsoft as replacements for the 2 “bad” controllers they sold me on day one.&nbsp; Both controllers had broken left analog sticks after just a couple of weeks of use.&nbsp; One of these new controllers is also
 beginning to fail, this time the A button is getting stuck and being “pressed” more times than I intend it to…so I reckon I will be onto my 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;controller soon…but that’s neither here nor there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I had to buy the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;controller was that it took Microsoft nearly HALF A YEAR (after countless hours of phone calls and email chains) to send me replacements for the 2 “bad” controllers I was sold at launch…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for about 2 Months (Feb-March), I had no controller…again, I had NO CHOICE but to pay for a 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;controller (while waiting for replacements) when I’m only ever using 1 at a time.&nbsp; My choices were A) Don’t use your xbox.&nbsp; Or B) Pay for another
 controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launch I’ve seen tens if not hundreds of threads on the forums discussing the same issues I’ve seen with my controllers….these threads never see any attention from an Xbox admin, they never see any responses.&nbsp; Xbox/Microsoft denies that there is ANY
 problem with their controllers.&nbsp; At this point in time, most of the threads are now locked or deleted (by xbox/Microsoft) so we are no longer able to openly discuss these issues…like they don’t exist..</p>
<p>&nbsp;I thought the forums were an open place for discussion, and not Nazi Germany, but I guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The controllers are bad enough, but really that’s just the beginning.</p>
<p>As stated above, I am onto my 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;play and charge kit.&nbsp; Let me start this by saying: Xbox, do you really hate your customers so much as to not have the charge kit built into your already overpriced system? Even PS3 had it….like come on guys…get
 serious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anyway, the issue with the play and charge kit is simple…it doesn’t charge.&nbsp; The wires in the cord frayed almost IMMEDIATELY after I took the kit out of its box.&nbsp; At first the cord would still charge the controller, but I couldn’t be playing while it charged….so
 how can it be called a “PLAY and charge kit”?&nbsp; It would charge only if the cord was bent in a certain direction and the controller had to be perfectly still, any slight movement would disconnect the frayed wires and so, the controller would disconnect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got to a point where even if I left the controller on the ground, plugged in to the cord, propped up so the wires and everything was in the appropriate position, the vibration of footsteps in the room (i kid you not) would cause enough movement to disconnect
 the charging cord.&nbsp; So basically, I have to keep a constant eye on my controller while its charging or it will likely become disconnected very quickly and not charge at all.&nbsp; I do not think this was the intention of the play and charge kit….certainly not how
 it is marketed.&nbsp; 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;cord was tossed, now onto my second.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My second play and charge cord has already begun displaying the same issues as the first.&nbsp; It is clear that the wires are frayed and have a hard time staying connected unless carefully placed in the appropriate orientation.&nbsp; It is a chore EVERYTIME I want
 to charge my controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, who could forget the wired headset!?!&nbsp; I am now onto my 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;wired headset in under a year.</p>
<p>These things are probably the worst of them all.&nbsp; Within the first month after launch, I began to notice that my microphone would cut in and out.&nbsp; I first thought it was a connection issue, but it turned out (similar to the charge kit) it was just another
 case of frayed wires.&nbsp; If I wiggled the cord around and held it in place, the fray wires would connect and I could be heard…but that was the only way…I had to hold the wire (where the cord meets the controller adaptor) in the proper orientation to get a connection.&nbsp;
 It got worse and worse over the next couple weeks until it was simply un-usable.</p>
<p>At that point in time, I was in the process of having my replacement controllers shipped, and was luckily able to piggyback a wired headset replacement with the controllers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, since then, my replacement headset has failed in the exact same way as the first.&nbsp; The microphone began to cut in and out, I noticed if I moved my arms (while holding the controller) the mic would continuously connect and disconnect.&nbsp; Again,
 it became useless…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, here I am again, forced to buy another accessory to simply USE MY XBOX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me make it clear again that I did not abuse these accessories…my controllers/headsets rest safely on top of my xbox when not in use, I do not pull or bend the cords (especially around the controller adaptor, as I know how HORRIBLE OF A DESIGN that is).&nbsp;
 Every time I plug the headset into my controller you’d think I was handling a butterfly.&nbsp; I am SO careful, yet they continue to break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these are my own experiences…many of my personal friends with the Xbox One have had identical issues (especially with regards to the controllers and headsets).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, as I have gone through 5 controllers, 2 play and charge kits, and 3 wired headsets in less than a year… I ask xbox this.&nbsp; Do you expect your customers to keep spending 300$ a year to maintain their accessories?&nbsp; Simply to use their console?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is it going to take for Xbox/Microsoft to sell me a functioning piece of equipment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click “Get a Replacement” on your website, thinking “Oh, that’s nice, they know there is an issue and are sending replacements!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this link only leads customers to a checkout page where they can BUY ANOTHER…which is NOT the same as getting a “replacement”.&nbsp; Very tricky wording there Xbox…very coy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So…what is it going to take?</p>
<p><br />
Do I need to go through the escalation process every time an accessory breaks? I don’t have enough time in the day to spend 2 hours on the phone with your terrible call centers.&nbsp; What would you have me do Xbox? Please advise, I would love some advice here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any lawyers out there? I've seen a few posts about a lawsuit but it seems they are yet to anger the wrong person.</p>

<p>Xbox...i want to contiune to support you as i have for the past 10+ years...but you are making it extremely difficult to do so. &nbsp;Why are you selling your customers junk?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox Gold sharing on one console and cross platform - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacknapierwayne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Gold sharing on one console and cross platform</h2>
                    <p>So my little sister has xbox gold and I have just a live account. There is only one console between us. My question is: Is there a way we can share her gold membership across our two accounts and play games like Fortnite and Sea of thieves either on the same console at the same time or cross platforms (one of us one the console and on of us on PC/Laptop?) If there is I would be very grateful if someone could give me instructions on how to do so. I have tried googling this but couldn't find anything that made sense. Thank you.</p>

    <title>mouse pad causing trouble and resetting windows at a standstill - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eoinmacq  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse pad causing trouble and resetting windows at a standstill</h2>
                    Got my new sony vaio laptop less than a week ago, updated to windows 8.1 straight away. Immediately afterwards the mouse started jumping around the screen, I reinstalled drivers which stopped it jumping around but disabled the zoom function. So I decided
 to just cut my losses and reinstall the original os to see if that would fix the problem. It's been going for a few hours at this stage and has stopped on 41% and won't budge.
<div>Need help please :(</div>

            <p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>I had to manually turn off the laptop before I received your reply. I got windows 8&nbsp;re-installed but the problem with the mouse is persisting. However, now, it is not as bad as before. The zoom function is a part of the touchpad, by dragging two fingers
 outwards or inwards on the pad you can zoom in or out on internet explorer. This function has returned since windows was re-installed. What I've also found is that software that came with the laptop is not working, eg. Sony ACID music studio 9.0, and sound
 forge audio studio. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do. I thought the re-install would fix everything but it hasn't. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>Eoin</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Yes the problem has persisted through the re-install.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As i'm typing this i'm in clean boot mode and the mouse is working fine, also, updates that wouldn't install before have installed now. Yet some software still won't open. I'm getting an error message:&nbsp;</div>
<div>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony\ACID Music Studio 9.0\musicstudio90.exe</div>
<div>The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded and tried to re-install this particular program, but before the installation was complete i got an error message saying:</div>
<div>"ERROR: -2147163964 occured during installation</div>
<div>Module C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony\ACID Music Studio 10.0\sfvstwrap.dll failed to register. HRESULT -21470895. Contact your support personnel."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not very computer savvy, and i'm not really sure what i should be doing in clean boot mode other than installing the updates that wouldn't install normally. Any more ideas?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for all your help.</div>

            <p>Hi Eoin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>As the mouse is working fine in clean boot mode, the issue might have occurred due to some third party programs. Try enabling each third party services or programs one by one in clean boot mode to see which one is causing the mouse
 pointer to jump around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</b>” to return the computer to a
<b>Normal startup</b> mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and try to register the dll file:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <b>
Search</b>.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click

            hi again, 



I'm still having trouble. I went through clean boot, checking services and startup programs and restarting. I thought i had narrowed it down to a service, but after rechecking it by accident and restarting, i found that the mouse was still working fine. As i'm typing this i'm in normal boot mode and it's working, but i'm not convinced i've actually solved the problem. It seems to come and go randomly. i also tried to run regsvr32.exe in the command prompt but received the error message: 


The module "sfvstwrap.dll" failed to load 


Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug it to check for problems with the binary or dependant .DLL files. 


The specified module could not be found. 



Also i'm receiving a random error soon after startup under the heading "wireless configuration" saying "notification dll has not been registered, program will not work correctly." 



Is there some other way of completely starting from scratch, i have a serious pain in my **** at t
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes after logo and 2 spins of circle. Even on reinstalling from CD or USB. Samsung R530.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>My Samsung Laptop R530 which had Windows 10 installed and working for over a year, had the mouse freezing issue.</p>
<p>I tried to fix with all possible suggestions. A few times a day it would freeze and a hard shutdown was required.</p>
<p>Two days ago after freezing, the laptop started into "Preparing Automatic Repair" but it does 2 spins of the circle and freezes with the 3 dots stopped showing. A hard shutdown and starting again will not help. It goes to starting with the Windows logo and
 again 2 spins of circle and freeze. I tried all options under the sun. BIOS help is only F2 to enter or F4 to Restore, which shows the 4 color ovals Windows logo, and it freezes in about 2 circle spins or a few seconds.</p>
<p>1-Reset by removing battery and power holding power button for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>2-Reset the BIOS (Phoenix 03JD) with default settings. With WiFi off in BIOS. With all other options given. Same problem.</p>
<p>3-Removed (disk restore did gave same problem) internal SSD Kingston 250GB, to see if it would boot with USB Win 10 disk or DVD Win.10 disk, both made with the Windows Tool. Same problem. Under BIOS I changed the order for the USB pen and DVD to first choices.
 Same problem. One would think the laptop would boot and inform no SSD present to install. But no, same Windows squares logo, 2 spins of circle and freeze. Removed WiFi card as one of the suggestions, same logo, 2 spins, freeze. If no USB pen or DVD, BIOS informed
 no drive. With USB Pen it started directly. With DVD it showed the stepber which BIOS said: Boot From AHCI CD-ROM : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. NO EMULATION &nbsp; System Type- 00 &nbsp; &nbsp; Press any key to boot from CD or DVD....</p>
<p>4-I dismantled the laptop and piece it together after, removing the BIO battery. Same problem.</p>
<p>Does anyone can help me out, or I should consider the laptop dead and use the SSD and parts in a new laptop? I did not want to spend the money, but it seems all options that I find do not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could be hanging the installation, even without the SSD. It boots (USB pen or DVD) only to squared Windows logo, 2 circle spins and freeze. Help anyone, please....</p>

            Thanks for answering so quickly. &nbsp;I wasn't using a camera. &nbsp;I was using a Canon recorder model number VIXIA HFR50. &nbsp;When I plugged it into the USB port and nothing happened, nothing at all. &nbsp;I went to the "how to section" and could not find any information
 on Windows 10. &nbsp;On the bottom of the page was a message to the effect of that the instructions listed were for previous OS. &nbsp;I'm a real newbie when it comes to this computer stuff. &nbsp;Probably would be easier for the both of us if you think of me as being retarded.

<h2>            Start Button and Search Box in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>They don't work. Having read through a number of posts I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore. It didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roll back to Windows 7 then reinstall Windows 10. Well, I just found out that you had 30 days to roll back to Windows 7 which is long past. Then I found out that you could still roll back before the November update was installed. Well, since updates are
 automatically installed and that one was installed today - just before I encountered this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that a number of people have this problem and it appears that the only answer is to reinstall Windows 10. How do I go about doing this without being able to roll back to Windows 7 (which it is starting to look like I would rather do anyway)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            WIN 10 - window keeps losing focus and ALT &#43; TAB not working properly</h2>
                    <p>After windows 10 update from win 7, I have been facing the following issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. ALT + TAB to switch between multiple windows doesn't work properly especially when a web browser is involved. When I switch only the current window loses focus but the other window doesn't appear, even if I manually click the needed window from the taskbar
 using my mouse. I had to press windows+D to go desktop and then select the needed window. This happens especially when the switching happens between a web browser and another window like explorer etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When the internet connection is off(WIFI) any window that I look into currently loses focus in few seconds but when the internet is ON, this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any support.</p>

            <p>Abdul Malik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution you provided worked perfectly!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. ALT + TAB</strong>&nbsp;- Troubleshooting solved the problems. It is working smoothly as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Clean Boot</strong> - I found the culprit service which causes the focus loss!&nbsp;I followed the steps provided and narrowed the service to "SavevidService" a software I downloaded to download videos from the internet.</p>
<p>Now guide me the next step, should I simply uninstall it or can I have a work around so that I can still use it while the issue can be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. It is highly appreciated.</p>

I just got a Win 10 machine.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
After I installed Office 2016 CTR, I could no longer use the &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; shortcut to switch between applications.&nbsp; Since I do this hundreds of times an hour it is a major PITA.</div>
<div>
I thought it was simply installing 2016 but that is not the case. After restarting my computer &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; worked. But only until I started Word 2016. After that it was borked again.</div>
<div>

            <p><span>Getting the error: Not a valid 32-bit application can have many causes:<br />
I have listed some of them below and possible solutions.</span></p>
<p><b><span>File is corrupt, bad, or missing</span></b><span>.
<br />
- If the hard disk drive is corrupted or bad it can cause working programs to fail either because not all the data can be read from the hard disk drive or because the program has become corrupted while on the drive. Run scandisk and defrag on the hard disk
 drive to check for any potential errors.<br />
- If you're running the program from a shortcut on the computer, verify that the program is still on the computer. In some cases if the program is no longer installed on the computer you may get this error.<br />
-You can download the application again and see if you still get the error message.</span></p>
<p><b><span>File is not designed for your version of Windows:<br />
</span></b><span>- If you're trying to run a program that is not designed for your version of Windows you may get this error.
<br />
- Although many older programs designed to work in older versions of Windows will work with new versions of Windows, unfortunately, not all programs will work.<br />
- If the program is an older MS-DOS program or early Windows program you may get this error.<br />
- If the program is designed for a 64-bit version of Windows and you're running it in a 32-bit version of Windows, it will not work and generate this error.</span></p>
<p><b><span>File is a virus, worm, or other malware file.
<br />
- </span></b><span>This error can be generated by a file that is a virus, worm, trojan, or other type of malware file. Often, this will be caused because the virus scanner installed
 in the computer will not allow the file to be installed or run. Try scanning the file to verify it is not a virus and/or infected.<br />
- If the file has been checked and is clean, it is still possible that the virus protection program and/or another program installed on the computer is causing issues during the install or execution of the program. Boot the computer into Safe Mode and try running
 the program; booting the computer into Safe Mode will make sure nothing is running in the background that could be causing this issue.<br />
<b><br />
Hardware incompatibility.</b><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>- If you're getting this error during the installation of a program it's also possible that the CD-ROM drive or the drive you're installing the program from is not compatible with Windows or has drivers that are not compatible with Windows.<br />
- Download the latest drivers for your CD drive or other drive from the computer manufacturer or from the hardware manufacturer. (Microsoft does not make driver for other hardware)</span></p>
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>You will want to provide (even if you post further here as well - which you might as well since you have this conversation going to cover all bases) the exact error (verbatim) that you receive.&nbsp; The more detailed your information, the more likely someone
 can assist you.</p>
<p>For example - right now we assume (here) that you have Windows Vista - but do not know the<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Find-which-edition-of-Windows-Vista-you-are-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> specific edition of Windows Vista</a> or if you are running

32-bit or 64-bit version</a>?&nbsp; All of that information could be useful in both places.&nbsp; Would also be good to know if you have no service packs, service pack 1 or service pack 2 installed on Windows Vista and which antivirus application you utilize.</p>

<h2>            Recover Vista post crash and bodged repair.</h2>
                    Vista crashed during a routine update - just hung at step 3 of 3 for 24 hrs.&nbsp; Comp would not restart in any mode.&nbsp; I loaded my old xp os so daughter could finish homework.<br />
<br />
I now have a very poor comp.&nbsp; I wish to recover vista but am lost.&nbsp; All vista files are visible but xp has control.&nbsp; i did not make a recovery dvd as I didnt read the instructions on the book - (fool) - thought i was clever.&nbsp; Stop laughing at the back there!<br />
<br />
Can I recover vista from the current files loaded, and make it the prime os in use?<br />
<br />
Can i make a vista recovery disk now, even though the xp has control?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<p>Hawaiis0,</p>
<p>First I definitely suggest you backup any and all important data from your system. This is a good habit to keep. Consult this article on how to natively backup data in XP:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/backup.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/backup.mspx</span></a> (Note: if your files from vista did not populate into you’re
<b>my documents</b> folder, select <b>“Let me choose what to backup”</b>)</p>
<p>Considering you’re already in XP, Mark L. Ferguson answers are spot on. I would like to add that you are entitled to a copy of your Vista Install Disk, most OEM supply this on request within a certain time frame. Contact them for more
 info.</p>
<p>This thread might be beneficial for locating your OEMs support page
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/82827745-f077-4455-a519-8403fb88dbe9</span></p>
<p>Make sure you have a copy of your product key (might be on your tower, either the side of the back), you might be able to use a borrowed Vista Install Disk to load back your OS, more steps can be provided for this if this is the route
 that you choose. <br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Updates Causing Blue Screen of Death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samnrli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Updates Causing Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently have been having trouble with my Windows 10 HP Pavilion laptop. The 'about' section indicates that I have the Windows 10 Home Edition, Version 1709, and OS Build 16299.192.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three or four times now, I have encountered issues with the blue screen of death. My computer will suddenly not allow me to shut down (start button doesn't work, can't click to open the windows menu). I have alternated between manually forcing the computer
 to shut down with the power button, to closing the top and letting the computer sleep over night. The next morning, however, the computer is unresponsive and requires me to shut down manually anyway. Upon restarting, I receive the blue screen of death and
 the computer restarts automatically. Then I have access to the 'advanced options' and have found that restoring my computer to a previous point helps. After this process is complete, my computer is fine once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, because this has happened repeatedly, I began searching for a more permanent solution. I just downloaded the "Show or Hide Updates" troubleshooter package from Microsoft. A whole bunch of updates showed up, but now I'm not sure which update(s) is/are
 causing the problem. When restoring my laptop to a previous point, the only descriptor of the update was a date (which I believe has always been 1/12/18), and a descriptor (critical update). The updates described in the troubleshooter, however, are much more
 specific and numerous. Is there a way to find out which specific updates are causing the problem? Or is there another solution entirely?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! Any help is much appreciated!</p>

            KB4056892 is likely the culprit. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />See if KB4056892 is installed or not. 
<br />
<br />If it is, right click it then uninstall it.
<br />
<br />KB4056892 has since been succeeded by KB4058258, so you should download that and install it to see if it resolves the problem:

<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

</p><p>I recently purchaced 2 PC's after 8 years of being a mac user. I Always dive into the full experience so I made new microsoft accounts and started using one drive etc etc. I also opened up games and saw a weird avatar there and I then remembered I also used
 to have an xbox live account. So I can log into that one and I see my gamertag there and avatar.
</p>
<p>nice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to move that live acount to my current microsoft account, this is possible but it is only explained on how to do it on a console.</p>
<p>But I do not have a console!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this live account is also used in windows I would have expected it to also be possible using a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,</p>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>William</p>

            <p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft account is an email address and password that you use to sign in to Windows. It's free and easy to set up, and you can do so with any email address you choose, or get a new email address. (For example, you can use an Outlook.com, Gmail, or Yahoo!
 address for your Microsoft account.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign in to your PC or device with a Microsoft account, you can get apps from the Windows Store, back up all your important data and files using free cloud storage, and keep all your favorite stuff—devices, photos, friends, games,
 settings, music, and so on—up to date and in sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per issue description it seems that you have a live account earlier and now you want to use the same email address as your Microsoft account to login to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the steps provided in the following Microsoft Tutorial and article to add new account or Microsoft account on your computer.</p>

            <p>Thank you kindly for the answers, but they are not the answers I am looking for.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps I am misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do not want to use the microsoft account that has my gamer tag bound to it (gmail)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. My current microsoft account (outlook) has been fully setup, including one drive etc</p>
<p>3. My understanding is that you advise me to use my older microsoft account again (gmail)</p>
<p>4. My understanding then is that I do not have easy access again to my one drive</p>
<p>5. My understanding is that I then have to move my one-drive content to the other account (gmail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>or....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just transfer my gamer tag (live id) from the gmail microsoft account to the new outlook microsoft account as that is a possibility but only explained when using an xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is it possible to transfer my gamer tag from my gmail ms account to my fully setup outlook account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt reply and sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my knowledge and research it is possible to use your Xbox account on your fully setup outlook account. You can use that account as other Microsoft account on your computer along with the previous one which is already setup on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps which you need to follow are provided in the link mentioned in my previous post. Try to add that account as Microsoft account on your computer and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the current status of your computer and we will be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>Hi Vincentxx90,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>a. What is the&nbsp;make and model&nbsp;of your computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to uninstall the Display Drivers from the Device Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Follow these steps to manually uninstall the Display driver:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click
<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then click <strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the <strong>Display driver</strong>, and then click <strong>
Properties.</strong></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, click <strong>Uninstall</strong>, and then click<strong> OK.</strong></p>
<p>Now download and install the latest updated Graphics Drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p><br />
As the game is not listed in the Windows 7 Compatibility Center, I suggest you to&nbsp;run the game in Vista Compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p><strong>Program compatibility</strong> is a mode in Windows that lets you run programs written for earlier versions of Windows.</p>
<p>If an older program doesn't run correctly, the first, and easiest, thing to try is the
<strong>Program Compatibility troubleshooter</strong>. It can automatically detect and fix common problems that prevent older programs from installing or running correctly.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Program Compatibility troubleshooter</strong> by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under
<strong>Programs</strong>, click <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Arnaud,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to the forums. As you made the purchase for a code for
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/sea-of-thieves-anniversary-edition/9pcd5s0dmf5z?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sea of Thieves - Anniversary edition</a> via CDKeys, a 3rd party retailer, then you would need to get into contact with them for further assistance in order to receive the code for the additional DLC (the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/sea-of-thieves-sea-dog-pack/9pgkgllc73jt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SoT Sea Dog Pack</a>) you purchased as these items were not purchased directly from the Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular DLC is not sold separately and should have been included with the download of the game. It is notable that the items in the pack do not automatically appear in the inventory and must be manually collected by the player according to the game
 developers. It may be possible that the items in the pack are already there; however, if you search for them and they are not, then you would need to seek the code for redemption by following up with CDKeys directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further information on how to collect the items once the pack is redeemed, I recommend that you check out the Sea of Thieves Forums for more detailed information:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seaofthieves.com/forum</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps out.</p>
