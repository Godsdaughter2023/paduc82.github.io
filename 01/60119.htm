<h2>            Error&#58; &#39;Windows cannot access&#92;&#92;PC1&#39;. Error code is 0x8007005</h2>
                    
<p><strong><em>Original Title: Networking only works in one direction</em></strong></p>
<p>I have a simple hardwired network of&nbsp;2 PCs. Sharing is enabled on both. PC1 can see and access PC2 without problem. PC2 can see&nbsp;all folders on PC1 but PC2 cannot access PC1. Whenever I select any folder on PC1 I&nbsp;get&nbsp;'Windows cannot access\\PC1'.
 Error code is 0x8007005. Both PCs are running XP Professional.</p>
<p>I have tried other PCs via&nbsp;the wireless router but always get the same&nbsp;result. PC1 can always access the other PC, but not vice versa.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Extremely slow start up Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackimoss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely slow start up Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>For about a month, my computer is taking about 6.5 minutes to start up. I've removed unnecessary start-up apps and programs and it made zero difference. I also&nbsp; checked for it to use Best Performance for my computer. Now my text looks thin and barely visible.<br />
<br />
It starts the first screen before asking for my PIN in about a minute. Then once I enter my PIN, it takes about six minutes to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also loads all pages&nbsp; and apps very slowly once it starts up, including loading Word documents, etc. It even types slowly now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 and all updates have been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at wit's end with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Use a utility called tweakit (I don't remember the exact spelling) to rund diagnostics and repair your system. It may run for about 5 hours, but once done you will see the difference.</p>
<p>good luck!</p>

<p>Clicking off Fast StartUp did not help.<br />
<br />
The TweakIt looks complicated and I don't trust it. I would not know what to do if it wrecked my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, does the lack of space on my Recovery Drive impact this?<br />

If not, what else can I do?</p>

                    <p>Hey guys, I was told by support to post on here to see if anyone can help.</p><p>So for the last 3-4 days,&nbsp;while playing CoD: Infinite Warfare,&nbsp;I&nbsp;have had no achievements unlock at all, and I dont mean saying 'Done! unlocking...' I mean straight up nothing. No progress bars filling. Nothing. &nbsp;After the first day I decided to try Modern Warfare remastered and am about 8 levels in with, again, no achievements (for finishing levels or anything). Also tested a totally different game (Super Time Force) to make sure it wasn't just CoD and still got nothing.<br /><br />Now I will say I&nbsp;have gone through a tonne of trouble shooting solutions that i found online including power cycling, deleting and redownloading my profile, deleting and reinstalling the game and even did a factory reset of my xbox to see if it would help and nothing has worked.&nbsp;<br /><br />In saying all this, I am a preview member but I never got the dashboard preview on this xbox since i upgraded

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you referring to organization through which that email was created? Or</li><li>Are you referring to Gmail account which was used for an organization and now you want the same email to be used by another user?</li></ul>
<p>If you are referring to the email that belongs to an organization from which you have resigned, I would recommend contacting the same organization in order to make changes in the ownership of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to same Gmail account to be used by another user, you may change the password if you want&nbsp;and let the other person use it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query. If not, please revert with more information so we can assist you accordingly.</p>

<br />Probably you need to disable Legacy BIOS to fix your issue

<h2>            Windows Store tries to Open in Internet Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a weird issue with Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the last few days, I cannot access the Windows Store from the Start Menu. The current link on the start menu would try to open the Windows Store in Internet Explorer. I can open the store through any link from apps.microsoft.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to quickly repair the link on the start menu?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what you have mentioned, I understand you are unable to access the store app and whenever you click on the store app, it takes you to Windows store in Internet explorer. Don’t worry; we’ll help you out with this issue. Just a few questions first, to
 get a clear picture of the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>From when did this issue start?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you make any changes to your computer before this issue started?</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you get any error messages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Restore store cache</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to reset the store cache and check if that resolves the issue. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows Key +R, to get the Run window</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “WSReset” in the run box and press enter</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Now it will say that the Windows store cache has been reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: SFC scan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the command prompt type the following command: “sfc/scannow” and press enter</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Now, restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Clean boot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." Refer this link to perform a clean boot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://mail.agent.cvgs.net/owa/redir.aspx?C=f4fcd81a71ac48f1b903a27ad00773a1&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fkb%2f929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The issue started after testing the program "Classic Shell" available at Windows8StartMenu.Com. It was an idea of merging both the traditional start menu and Metro UI. Unfortunately, it did not work out and I uninstalled it. Other than that, there were no
 other changes made with the exception of installing VMWARE Workstation 9 (but I&nbsp;convinced VMWARE would not cause this issue). No error messages appear when opening the Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issues is not with the Windows Store but actually opening the Windows Store. I can view and open the Windows Store numerous ways like through a link at apps.microsoft.com or even resetting the Windows Store Cache.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue seems to be the link on the Start Menu. The link tries to open "C:/Windows/WinStore/WinStore.htm" inside Internet Explorer instead of the native environment designed for Windows Applications. I posted a screenshot of the window on my SkyDrive at:
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=1358E43DEA121216!1522&amp;authkey=!AO_STtUQHt6XzGg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=1358E43DEA121216!1522&amp;authkey=!AO_STtUQHt6XzGg</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is quick fix and should not merit any extreme solutions such as a Refresh or Recover. I could roll back to a backup of the system image,&nbsp;if necessary. I am currently investigating an issue involving the System File Checker (SFC) and&nbsp;the Intel
 Rapid Storage Technology software writing file errors to RAID volumes, but that is for another thread.</p>

<h2>            How to recover OS system after SSD failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SSD drive with the Windows 10 operating system died.&nbsp; I cannot even boot up my computer anymore.&nbsp; I originally purchased Windows 7 and converted to 10 during the free upgrade.&nbsp; I' don't have the Windows 7 product key.&nbsp; (I had my entire system built by
 Fry's Electronics and I don't remember getting any OS disks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a new drive (HDD this time) and a new Windows 10 Pro on USB flash drive, but would like to "recover" the original OS (7 or 10) and save the new W10 Pro license for a future computer if possible. Any ideas of what I could do?&nbsp; My computer also
 has a second drive (an HDD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if I can't recover the old OS (7 or 10).&nbsp; I am assuming I just need to install/hookup the new HDD and simply use the USB flash drive to install the new OS.&nbsp; If there is something wrong with that scenario, please let me know.</p>

            You can save your new Windows 10 Pro for a later date, you should have no trouble clean installing and activating Windows 10 on that system
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers
<br />
<br />Grab another Flash Drive (note contents will be deleted)
<br />
<br />Click this link
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
<br /> 
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)
<br />
<br />The Windows installation media you just created contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro, make sure you install the version you previously had running on that system
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: It is always advisable to pull out the secondary drive while you clean install Windows 10 onto the Primary drive. Once the installation has completed and you have installed your drivers, you can connect the secondary drive again!

    <title>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED when playing games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aqhu  say:</h3>
<h2>            CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED when playing games</h2>
                    <p>The problems all started about a month ago (give or take). I had just been up playing the witcher 2 the night before with no problems, then the next day the game kept freezing and as I couldn't do ANYTHING to close the game in that state I was forced to
 shut down with the power button, this happened a couple times until windows got stuck in a BSOD loop on startup. I had no choice but to format the SSD and reinstall windows. After this there didn't seem to be any problems, until about one week ago when all
 the games I tried to play started to freeze after short time ingame (ESO/GW2/Diablo 3), it would freeze then after a minute or 2 I would be able to close it with task manager. At this point I noticed that my GPU had started to overheat quite badly whenever
 I had a game open so I attributed it to that, and bought a new GPU, upgraded my BIOS and installed the new card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after that while I was playing diablo 3 and not long after I started it froze and I tried using ctrl+alt+delete to close it through task manager, but nothing happened so I got up and left to use the washroom. When I came back I got an error message
 which I don't fully recall, all I can remember is it contained the words "logon" or "login" and "task manager", then I got a blue screen saying CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED and the computer reset, a couple of times in a row, each time doing a disk check or something
 like that and then restarting and doing it again. After doing this a couple times it asked me to do a system restore, which as I recall didn't actually do anything and the screen just sat there giving me no indication that anything was happening, then after
 a while of that I shut the computer down with the power button, and it started up properly afterwards, at which point I updated some of the drivers for my motherboard and then restarted on account of that but also, I had a message in my action center... flag
 icon thing in the bottom right telling me to restart to fix hard drive problems. After the restart I have not had any error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only tried twice since getting the critical process died error to play games, first guild wars 2, which after about 10 minutes ingame started behaving strangely (no sound effects) and then eventually froze just after I closed it using alt + f4. The
 second was the witcher 2 again, but after running around for a few minutes I decided to close it to avoid the risk of having to reinstall windows once again. In neither case did the GPU overheat massively like the old one did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have not been any problems outside of trying to play games.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That article doesn't seem to be of much help. My computer so far only hangs or freezes when I have had a game open and running for 5-10 minutes, which is not listed in the article. Windows is up to date, has not frozen while installing updates, and I do
 run a virus scan every night so that doesn't seem likely.</p>

<p>It seems verifier was not enabled for this crash. To see if verifier is enabled, type&nbsp; verifier /query in a cmd window and you should see a list of drivers that are been verified.</p>

            <p>When I first tried verifier earlier I was not able to get into windows, I saw the little blue windows icon and the loading circle then the screen went black and the computer rebooted. I assumed this was the desired outcome so I just booted into safe mode
 and archived the files, then typed verifier /reset into a cmd window and rebooted and started as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just now tried a second time, with different results. After again setting up verifier as described in that link and rebooting and choosing to boot normally, I made it to the desktop then it crashed then gave me a blue screen error after a few seconds.
 I tried booting normally once more but I didn't make it quite as far as the desktop that time, though I did receive another blue screen error when it crashed and I believe it mentioned some kind of kernel error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I then booted into safe mode I tried typing verifier /query into a cmd window and it told me there were none being verified. Is it not supposed to do that when booting into safe mode? I don't know what else I could have done - I did follow the instructions
 written in that link, and I had no chance to ensure that it was enabled after rebooting since it was crashing before I could do anything.</p>
<p>

            I updated the realtek audio drivers from the realtek website and tried a game again, and after 5 minutes froze, again. I'm guessing that wasn't the problem. I was eventually able to close the game through task manager but everything was extremely slow
 and unresponsive afterwards - it wouldn't even shut down - I had to use the power button on my tower to shut it down, and there are still problems now after rebooting.

            <p>First of all, thank you very much for your help. After quite a bit trouble I may have inadvertently found what the problem was and fixed it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After the earlier crash, I did a clean reinstall of windows 8.1 on my SSD, and there were no problems afterwards. Then I plugged my secondary HDD in and suddenly - my SSD was no longer being detected in BIOS. I tried unplugging the HDD, and after doing that
 the SSD was detected again, and worked properly, but then the same thing happened when I plugged the HDD back in.<br />
<br />
Then the SDD stopped being detected all together, with or without the HDD being plugged in. I tried plugging the SSD into different SATA slots - still nothing. I went and got a spare SSD that my brother had to try that out - to rule out that it was my SSD that
 was the problem - and even that wasn't being detected. So then I tried using the old SATA cable that had been connected to my old HDD and it worked (after going back and making sure it was all properly, tightly connected), the SSD was being detected properly.
 I then tried that same older SATA cable on my own SSD and it worked. I then tried the newer SATA cable that had originally been hooked up to my SSD again and it suddenly wasn't being detected any more.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So now I have my SSD hooked up with the older SATA cable that was originally hooked up to my old HDD, and my HDD hooked up with the newer (and apparently faulty) SATA cable. It now all seems to be working properly and I have had no crashes in any games despite
 having them open for a good 40 minutes whereas before they would cause a crash after no more then 10 minutes. Everything seems to be fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tl;dr - Reinstalled windows, switched SATA cables, made sure they were all properly, fully connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this brings up a couple questions - first of all, is it possible that at some point (I did clean the dust out of my computer not too long ago) I ever so slightly knocked a SATA cable slightly loose and that was the cause of all the problems? or is it
 possible that the SATA cable that used to be connected to my SSD was faulty somehow and is the culprit? even though it is now connected to my secondary HDD and seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I have read your reply and disabled nvidia update, just in case. I did install AVG again after I reinstalled windows though, would it be advisable to uninstall it and just use windows defender or some other anti virus?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you very much.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB3037581 repeatedly istalls. No error code.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install an "important" windows update on my computer. It claims to be installed successfully, however, after each reboot, it tries to install again. Since I get no error code, I am unsure, what to do. My system information is given below.
 I have already seen that other users seem to have problems with this update, as well. However, their situation seems to differ from mine as they are being given a certain error code. Manual downloading and installation of the update did not work, either. The
 program states that another programm might block this. I have already tried the windows troubleshooting. Since I am a standard PC user with little experience with these kinds of problems, and since this a very annoying problem, I would greatly appreciate all
 your help!</p>

            <p>Dear Suheendra S,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried both methods. However, neither of them have solved my problem. Some details about my experiance:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked fine, however, I got an error mesage when reregistering some of the BITS files claiming that they were either not found or unable to regregister (I have checked for misspelling!). Since most of them worked fine, and since no information was given
 for such a special case, I have just continued with the standard described process described in the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting my computer, I have installed the update using standard windows update. As before, the system claimed that the update had worked. However, slightly later, windows update wanted to install the update, again. Hence, the method was unsucessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started the system in clean boot and tried the manual update (downloaded from the windows server, before). I got the same error message as before (my system is in German, therefore a german error message and and my attempt of a translation are given).</p>
<p>
</p><p>German (original) error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Installisationsassistent trifft nicht zu oder wird von einer anderen Anwendung blockiert."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Translation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The installment assistent is not correct or is being blocked by another application."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope, my information is helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to raise awareness to the fact that my labtop is supplied by lenovo. Thus, some software from lenovo is installed. Is it possible that some of their software is conflicting with windows 7? If so, how could I check that? It might well be something
 really dull that is causing the problems that I, being unexperianced with such problems, am missing, here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope, you can help me with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
        </p>

            <p>I have exactly the same issue with the same updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more, they unpack to E:// while trying to install, but everything else, as usual, goes to C://.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found every thread related to this on the internet and tried everything to resolve it. Various Microsoft scans and advice etc., starting with no additional services, as suggested in your thread. Uninstalling .net framework and reinstalling - still no
 luck at all.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm having the same problem for the same three updates. Also, ever since my computer decided to try to install these updates, my processor has been overloaded with every application I open. &nbsp;I'm not quite sure what it is exactly, I'm idling between 15-30%
 cpu usage and it quite often jumps above 70% for no apparent reason, and when I am doing something simple it flat lines at 100%. Its getting hard to do anything, and my computer was running perfectly two days ago. For some reason I can't do a system restore
 to a date before this new windows update so I'm stuck dealing with this .Net framework update problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the troubleshoot tools/diagnostics have helped. Every time I install the updates, it reports as being successful, but when I go to look for them in my update history to uninstall them, they aren't there. I've run the windows update diagnostic and
 it says it fixed "service registration is missing or corrupt" but it cannot fix "Problems installing recent updates". The .Net framework repair tool doesn't fix anything either. I've run all sorts of virus and malware scans and they say my system is clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if it is related, but two of my svchost.exe processes are taking up a lot of memory. One is a host for windows update, and the other one contains a variety of seemingly important services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running windows 7 ultimate 64 bit SP1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<p>Intel i5 4460 @3.20 Ghz</p>
<p>ASrock H97 Pro4 motherboard</p>
<p>8.00GB DDR3 ram</p>
<p>MSI nvidia gtx 970 gpu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates that are recurring are:</p>
<p>KB3023224</p>
<p>KB3037581</p>
<p>KB3035490</p>

            <p>UPDATE: Windows has sent out 2 more updates for x64 based systems. One is an update to help with upgrading windows, and the other is a security update. I installed the first update (KB2952664) successfully, and I then checked under my Installed updates log,
 and it appeared under today's date (7/28/15) and could be uninstalled. The other previously mentioned .Net framework updates and the security update (KB3022777) say that they were successfully installed, but they do not appear under my installed updates. After
 restarting my computer, the security update from today doesn't show up in my Installed updates log, and now windows is saying I need those three .Net updates again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My processor is still bogged down all the time by windows applications. TrustedInstaller.exe seems to jump in at random every once in a while. I don't really know what to do now, I've looked through many websites and fixes and things that don't seem to help
 at all. I called microsoft but after finally being put on hold for technical support they terminated the call. I guess it could've been to there being a high traffic of phone calls, but I was hung up on three times without any warning. I just want my computer
 back</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            I did not realise virtual miniport adaptor: This is not an HP related item and is a generic Microsoft driver included with the installed operating system. As it is a "Virtual" adapter, it is unlikely to have any impact on your internet connectivity.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try reloading the driver by going to "Control Panel" &gt; "Device Manager" &gt; "Action" &gt; "Scan for Hardware Changes". If this doesn't correct the issue, you can try the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/fixit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft Fix-it Solution Center</span></a>&nbsp; (if you type 'virtual miniport adaptor' in the search bar it will bring up lots of suggestion, not&nbsp;sure if
 any helps&nbsp;)</p>

            Hi Atilesh
<br />
<br />This seems to be a known issue, please try this fix:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Batteries section
<br />
<br />For each device in that section:
<br />
<br />Right click and choose Disable
<br />
<br />Then right click and choose Enable
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager

            Hi AtileshDusseea.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try fixes for battery icon first:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/battery-icon-missing-in-windows-10/791788c3-6e68-40cf-8b06-97c0c7c7eb03">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br /><a href="https://thewindowsplus.org/missing-laptop-battery-icon-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://thewindowsplus.org/missing-laptop-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />If those don't work then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />1. Reset Mail app 
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; Scroll down and click Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Click Advanced options &gt; Click Reset &gt; Restart your computer 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and Reinstall Mail app
<br />
<br />A. Uninstall - Windows Key+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />B. Reinstall
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />(If there is a problem in reinstall, you can always reinstall from MS Store)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            This is intended &amp; imo is a good security feature. If you receive a suspect email it is easy to check the link is genuine by hovering the mouse cursor over it &amp; if the text doesn't match the url then it is possibly a faked link.
<br />An example: the url says www.officialsomething.com but hovering over the link shows www.faked.com this would be a scam site &amp; you'd know without visiting it.
<br />It cannot be removed or turned off as far as I know.

    <title>Windows 10 Randomly Freezing After October Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l&#233;on dimitribarbosa melo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Randomly Freezing After October Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having constant freezing issues with my Windows 10 after the last update. My PC was perfectly fine just before it, but as soon as it installed the issue began: windows started to freeze randomly. Most of the times it happens when I open up a program
 or an app (any), including the browser, and somethings it happens randomly (for example when I'm watching a video in a player or listening to music). It usually lasts for up to 15 seconds, but sometimes it takes up to 30 seconds or more for the computer to
 get back to normal. When it happens I can't do anything, the mouse cursor still moves, but that's it, everything else becomes frozen. I've also noticed that when it happens the HD light keeps glowing steadily. I'd like to report this problem, and I also wonder
 if this has happened to anyone else. It's really annoying and it impairs my work with the computer. I don't know why Microsoft keeps pushing releases of broken updated like this one, even when it is known before the release that the update has issues. It's
 not the first time this happens after an update... last yet the same thing happened, and yet here we are again with the same problem. I just hope for a fix as soon as possible.</p>

            There was a way but the thing is Windows 10 1809 is being pulled off so you can't do a repair install as well.
<br />Consider waiting until tomorrow and see if the cumulative update resolves it.

<p>I am having the same issue and it has been a nightmare.&nbsp; After a recent update my computer started randomly freezing up.&nbsp; Mouse wouldn't move, keyboard does nothing and no amount of waiting around helps.&nbsp; Hard drive is not doing anything either so nothing
 is happening in the background.&nbsp; It is absolutely a problem with a recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't re-imaged this older PC in a while so I did so with Windows 7 to make sure it wasn't a hardware issue.&nbsp; Windows 7 runs fine.&nbsp; From what I can see people have mentioned driver incompatibility especially with display, LAN or motherboard drivers.&nbsp;
 While this PC has hardware which is older it has never had an issue with Windows 10 until this October (2018).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did another format of the hard drive and did a fresh install of Windows 10 and it still does it.&nbsp; I don't know what else to try at this point.&nbsp; It's maddening that Microsoft forces these "updates" on us.&nbsp; I have wasted a day and a half of valuable time
 trying to get a stable PC for business use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STOP FORCING UPDATES THEN RUINING PERFECTLY WORKING MACHINES.</p>

<p>What do you mean it has been "pulled off"?&nbsp; Do you mean they've rescinded it?&nbsp; I'm attempting to get Windows 10 working again on a PC that has worked flawlessly since day 1 of Windows 10.&nbsp; It seems the October 1809 update seems to have ruined my PC making
 it freeze.&nbsp; The only way to get it working is to do a hard reset which caused more problems repeatedly doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should try safe mode I suppose but I haven't been able to figure out what 1809 is negatively reacting to within my computer.&nbsp; This has been awful and cost me so much valuable work time.</p>

<h2>            Don&#39;t have original password for Microsoft account on Windows 10 computer, can&#39;t log in using new password even though it is connected to the internet.</h2>
                    <p>I'm helping someone get back into their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They changed their password for their microsoft account, forgot it, I helped them get a new password for the microsoft account, now when we try to log into the computer using the new microsoft account password it says "Your device is offline. Please sign
 in with the last password used on this device." The computer is connected to the internet but continues to say it is offline. I've found some tutorials on bypassing this but require me to use the command prompt, which requires me to have access to an administrative
 account on the computer which is just the one account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the computer to realize that it is connected to the internet and can use the new password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have the new microsoft password for the account and I'm able to log into the microsoft website using the new password.</p>
<p>- The computer is connected to the internet. I know this because other computers connected to the same network are connected to the internet. When I unplug the network cord, the network connections menu in the bottom right shows no connections available,
 when I plug it back in it shows a network and connects to it. So it does connect to the network but will not accept the new password and continues to say "Your device is offline- etc."</p>
<p>- I don't have the original microsoft password used.</p>
<p>- There are no other accounts or users on this computer. Just the one microsoft account.</p>
<p>- I cannot use the shift+restart to troubleshoot to advanced options method because I don't know what the original password was to this account.</p>

            <p>Hi Micah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help us isolate this problem, allow us to ask a few questions regarding the challenge you currently have.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Before they changed the password to their Microsoft account, are they able to log into the computer using this account, or local account?</li><li>Is the computer able to get online even though you're getting the message "Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device."?<br />
</li><li>How and where did you change the password of your Microsoft account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to login to the computer using your Microsoft account, then there is a possibility that they might have changed their Windows password. If so,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14105/windows-8-what-to-do-if-forget-windows-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> tom salvitti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Windows Fax and Scan - Can&#39;t get it to auto save to network location</h2>
                    <p>We are using Windows Fax and Scan (Version 6.1 Build 7601: Service Pack 1) -- its the version included with our Windows 7 Enterprise 32 bit client OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed a scanner at a sleep lab , scanner works flawlessly. There are multiple sleep techs that will log into the one&nbsp;computer with the scanner (so in short multiple user profiles) and scan patient RXs.&nbsp; Problem is the Sleep Manager wants the scans
 to automatically save to a central location so no matter what tech logs in their scans will save to the same location as everyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key is AUTOMATIC saving. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's the background info -- the heart of the issue ... it appears a feature that Windows Fax and Scan offers is not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go into Fax and Scan there's an option in tools -&gt; Scan Routing.&nbsp; If you read about the feature its supposed to AUTOMATICALLY save to the network folder indicated, its not doing that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I check the box for "save to network folder" (don't know the exact wording)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'm using xxx's because I don't want to&nbsp;publically announced the real share location) \\xxx\xxxxx\xxxxx\Neuromuscular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is 100% a valid and working share name -- been in use for years many people save to it....Windows Fax and Scan says "Not valid Network Share"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So someone said just use \\server\share</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok I create a folder on my computer let's call it Computer1 and name it sharefolder. I share it and give "everyone" read/write access...the share is
\\Computer1\Sharefolder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug that into Windows Fax and Scan -- it doesn't complain that its a bad share anymore. So I think great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scan a test page --- it doesn't autosave to 
\\computer1\sharefolder.&nbsp; I can move it there but that defeats the whole point of scan routing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sleep lab will be scanning hundreds of Rx's slips per day , management will not allow time wasted by doing manual moves of scanned images to the save location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Got to be honest I'm a little peeved right now because in my view its like Microsoft advertised a feature in one of their applications that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

    <title>Download Error for Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool x 64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kardis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Download Error for Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool x 64</h2>
                    <p>I didn't know off hand where else to post this but wanted to see if others were getting this error.<br />
<br />
I haven't found another topic discussing this directly and it could be I was using the wrong search criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the mediacreationtoolx64 program provided by Microsoft from their Windows 10 upgrade site (to manually upgrade instead of waiting) I attempted to create a bootable USB stick with this tool to perform a clean Windows 10 install. &nbsp;This was after
 I was having issues when I originally upgraded my Windows 7 Pro 64 bit OS.<br />
<br />
After I did this my network card kept having issues (ex. Would not show up in System Information at all), my DirectX would not work properly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
While the network card issue was a problem I could work around that but not the DirectX. &nbsp;I spent 2 days going over all the forum posts on Microsoft's various websites for errors with this going back as far as XP even trying to find anything to help, including
 registry hacks. &nbsp;I searched all over Google, updated DirectX, ran all the various patches for it (was specifically with the old DirectX 9 files that some online games still require, League of Legends being one).<br />
<br />
After 2 days I decided to try and download the ISO file for Windows 10 with this same tool and instead burn it to a DVD. When I did this and got it installed and on the desktop I immediately installed one game to test for specific errors I could reproduce on
 demand, namely I could open the client for the game and get into the start a match area but once the game loaded the match it would crash with a 0x7B error or say the DirectX 9 files are missing (.dll specifically ones).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the game finished installing and updating it worked perfectly fine and all other errors were gone as well, no more unknown devices in Device Manager that I couldn't solve, no more NIC issues, monitor issues, etc.<br />
<br />
This leads me to the conclusion that the option or creating a bootable USB device with this media tool provides corrupted files with the OS download or missing files.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm this? &nbsp;At this point I have had to tell friends and family to stay away from this tool and download the ISO from MSDN and use another software to burn it to a DVD or create a bootable USB device instead of using this one stop method.</p>

    <title>Turtle Beach X41 help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpwheely  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach X41 help</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>My X11s recently broke on me due to the mass of wires it came with, so not made the missus all that happy by buying some X41s over the weekend :D
</p>
<p>Problem I have is with the set up, for some reason i have managed to lose the scart socket from elite, meaning one of the new cables with the x41s can not be connected.
</p>
<p>Not all bad however as ive managed to use the colour leads (if this makes sense) to plug in the box and hear the sound through my headset without a problem. The only issue is I have managed to lose game soudn through the TV and was wondering how I get past
 this problem as my little lad plays the xbox sometimes and there is no way im letting him use the X41s!!!
</p>
<p>Will I have to go out and buy a new scart to connect the thin black wire it comes with? Any help greatly appreciated.
</p>

<p>You can pick up the adaptor from eBay quite cheap or just change the wires if poss when your lad goes on it. Can't really understand what you have plugged &nbsp;in where though, need more info

<p>On the back of you 'coloured' lead for the xbox is a small optical port, use this for the X41's and then connect the red &amp; white sockets on the end of that cable to your tv's audio in. Idealy you need a hdmi cable (if using a HD tv) and the audio pass through
 for the turtle beach... </p>

<p>Oh also once you have everything set up be sure to change your audio setting on the xbox to 5.1 surround and it might be a good idea to get 4X rechargable batteries and a charger. i aways keep a set on charge ready to be swapped over.</p>
<p>Your gaming is about to take the next step up as these headphones are very good :)</p>

<h2>            How can I print just one page from numerous pages on windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    When I try to print just page 1 of 3 it will not let me. It prints all three pages. I cannot find the option to print a single page or a range of pages. How do I get to that option? Thank you.
