            well that will be fair if in any part of my w8 contain the legend "software upgrade" or something like that and not just "windows 8 pro" in the web page is very clear that the download need an installed qualifying windows OS, that's why I went to a physical
 store to get an stand alone one

            Microsoft did not release a Retail Full Version of Windows 8 only upgrades. My original answer stands. The only other option is to purchase the Windows 8 OEM full version from a company like New Egg or Amazon. The last time I checked it was selling around
 $130.00 US. Also there is no Microsoft support with this version. Any questions please read the complrte Windows 8 requirements and conditions.

Purchasing a full version of <span>
Windows 8</span>
<div>
<p>If you want to build your own PC and install <span>
Windows 8</span> or <span>Windows 8 Pro</span>, or want an additional operating system running in either a local virtual machine or separate partition (including a Mac), you can purchase the
<span>Windows 8</span> or <span>
Windows 8 Pro</span> System Builder products (OEM versions). If available in your country or region,
<span>Windows 8</span> and <span>
Windows 8 Pro</span> System Builder products can be purchased at participating stores, you'll need to ask a sales rep for more information.
<span>This version does not include customer support.</span></p>
<span><span>
<p>There are no full retail versions of Windows 8. If you need a full version, you will need to purchase the Windows 8 Pro OEM from New Egg. This requires a custom clean install.</p>

            Well I know by now that is an upgrade version, but im upset because the only thing you can read in the box is "windows 8 pro" you cant find that the product is an upgrade instead a stand alone version, so for me that is a misleading publicity, because
 I never would got it knowing that is an upgrade version when you can get one online for half the price, In fact I&nbsp;<span>bought too a touch mouse and an office package to get all in order... but tuns out that i cant activate my windows 8, and I
 wont install it over my vista system until I know if everything works on w8, so I want to have running the 2 OS's.</span>

            In my opinion, you would be wrong.&nbsp; Explain to me when I asked Best Buy, Target, Walmart, Office Depot, and Office Max about the $69.99 being a full version or an upgrade version; they swore up and down that this version would allow me to do a clean install
 without having an prior version of Windows and be able to activate it.&nbsp; Several sale persons got very angry when I told them that I thought they were wrong about the package and again they swore up and down to point of cursing me to prove me wrong. Including
 one saying he had already built and loaded three new systems from scratch.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, these companies telling me that they were selling FULL VERSIONS and telling I am a FOOL for not buying the $69.99 software.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In my opinion, are you saying the Large Chain Stores are telling a LIE? OR Is Microsoft pushing VAPORWARE again.<br />

            <p>Microsoft cannot be held responsible for the ignorance or deceit of any Retail Salespersons. Microsoft clearly states on their Windows 8 install instructions that Windows 8 must be installed over an existing qualifying OS (XP (sp3), Vista, Windows 7). As
 Stated elsewhere in this postings&nbsp;Microsoft did not release a Full retail version of&nbsp; Windows 8. In order to do the Clean install the way you wish you have to buy Windows 8 OEM from an online store such as New Egg or Amazon ( Retail around 125.00 US, less
 on sale). Remember that OEM Versions do not come with any support.&nbsp; The other way is to install Windows 8 over a qualifying OS and when asked choose custom install, and then choose save nothing, this will give you your clean install. To summarize, unless you
 buy OEM version , Windows 8 must be installed over an existing OS. Hope this helps to clear things up. Again this is not a Microsoft problem, deceit, or anything else, but is strictly a question of Retail Establishment Ethics.

<p>Jumping in here, but clearly Microsoft must have SOME influence over how these big box stores misled consumers early on. &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it was an error on their part, but we have no real proof, since they deny our receipts are for anything other than an upgrade.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Their words but it was OUR mistake?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I &nbsp;too was SERIOUSLY misled. &nbsp; I pre-purchased a Win8 Pro package online from BestBuy. &nbsp; No where in the advertising back in early October did BB list the product as an upgrade. &nbsp; I made the purchase 10/22/2012, before Win8 was released in this special offer
 from &nbsp;BestBuy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I received the package back on Oct 27, 2012, and am just now installing it as a VM under Oracle Virtual Box. &nbsp; When I enter my key it pops up and says its valid, but only as an upgrade. &nbsp; The Microsoft hologram bar code on the side of the box says VUP....
 &nbsp; which is NOT the way BestBuy advertised it THEN. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I look at the same SKU on BestBuy's site TODAY &nbsp;12-13-2012, it clearly says Windows 8 Professional Upgrade. &nbsp; &nbsp;If I look at my receipt, it does not say Upgrade. &nbsp;My confirmation email from Oct 22 does not say Upgrade.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BB messed up, I am not imagining this, but they now have the same sku number CLEARLY marked on their website as UPGRADE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Certainly Microsoft has some influence over who they allow to sell their product, and at the very least should have some influence with BB. &nbsp; &nbsp;Consumers have been misled and their is very little of a an audit trail for us to pursue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>burning a data cd using windows media player 12 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thinskin  say:</h3>
<h2>            burning a data cd using windows media player 12</h2>
                    when I burn a cd using the media player version 12 on windows 8, the songs are copied to the cd in mp3 format. when I insert the cd into my computers disc drive to play the songs on the disc using the media player the songs come up in the order they were
 copied to the cd, however when I place the cd into a different cd player such as a home theatre or automobile or stand alone boom box the songs are displayed in a completely different order, there is one order for the media player and one order for all other
 cd players. this is very frustrating because I burn the songs to the disc in a specific order and then i make a cd insert that labels the songs and the order the songs are in so that if I want to go to a specific song say song # 9 then I would just advance
 the disc to track # 9 and the correct song plays, however in all other cd players outside of the windows media player this is not the case, track # 9 may not be track # 9 it may be a completely different track like # 11 or some ot

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are just complicating this. You will not be able to create a data disc using Windows Media Player on Windows 8. In Windows 7 also we will not be able to create a data disc using Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>Check this: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/burn-cd-dvd-media-player#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I can't speak for windows 7, however with windows 8 and the version 12 windows media player that comes on windows 8 you can make a data cd using the media player. If you have the version 12 on windows 8 try these steps and you will see that it is possible.
 when you choose the data option and the content is audio the media player burns the disc in mp3 format therefore the songs are in mp3 format. this is the only windows media player that I no of that will do this, all other previous versions did not have the
 capability to burn a cd in mp3 format. however here are the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Place a blank cd into the cd drive</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; select the burn tab in the media player</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;select the burn options arrow at the top of the burn list window</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; select data cd or dvd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then select the songs you would like to burn to cd and place them into the burn list and then select start burn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when the cd is finished burning open the cd and you will see the songs are in mp3 format</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can you help me with my original question of the tracks being misaligned on the cd depending on whether your using the media player or another cd player to play the cd?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I would like to add that the songs that I'm burning to cd are already in mp3 format, so the media player realistically only needs to just copy the songs to the cd, I'm not sure if the media player 12 on windows 8 will convert non mp3 files to mp3, however
 the burn option to select data cd or dvd on this version of the media player has never been on any previous version of the media player, and if you had songs in the media player on the older media player versions and these songs were in mp3 format the media
 player would not burn them to cd in mp3 format, the media player would convert the songs to standard audio format or wmp format and as with this newer version it will copy the songs to the cd in mp3 format, whether it's converting them or just keeping them
 in mp3 format im not sure.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book screen gets yellow discoloration if it gets warm</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>if my Surface Book CR7-00010 does some a little more intensive tasks, some areas of the screen get a yellow and green discoloration. It also happens if I'm reading an ebook for example and is quite annoying. Is there anything I can do about it?</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Boot and System Restore Errors - 0x80070002</h2>
                    <p>Original title:&nbsp;Windows 7 Boot and System Restore Errors&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer froze and I was forced to attempt a hard reboot (that is the power switch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon reboot, the automatic system repair failed&nbsp;with the following error codes</p>
<p>
</p><p>EventName: StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Sig 1 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Sig 2 6.1.7600.16385</p>
<p>Sig 3 unknown</p>
<p>Sig 4 212 00159</p>
<p>Sig 5 AutoFailover</p>
<p>Sig 6 5</p>
<p>Sig 7 No Root Cause</p>
<p>OS 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1</p>
<p>Local ID 1033</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs every time after reboot. It has not offered to boot up in safe mode since the first reboot, always going right into automatic repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then, after booting from the Windows OS 7 install CD, tried a System Restore from multiple previous points. All failed with the error 0x80070002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can, after booting from the OS CD, get into a&nbsp;DOS prompt. Has anyone seen this before and found a solution?</p>

            <p>I should add, when I did an sfc /scannow it stopped saying that it couldn't as some startup repairs were pending and that I should reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reboot simply gets me back to the original error. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have issues while, booting to the computer and performing System Restore in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Disconnect all external devices and then try to restart the computer and check if you are able to log on to your computer. From the problem signatures that you have given it seems that at start up it is trying to load any device whose drivers
 are not loaded properly.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>I tried Bootrec with, in succession, /FixMbr, /FixBoot and/RebuildBcd (rebooting after each one).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response to each command was almost instantaneous. When running the last one, it came back with 0 Windows (something) found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first two reboots came back with the original problem with Startup Repair failing. The third reboot got me a blue screen of death saying it stopped windows from starting with a Bad_Pool_Error.</p>
<p>

 libraries. &nbsp;This morning I discover they are now completely gone from the computer. &nbsp;

            All of my personal files are gone. Pictures of my late son, court docs, other records. When I click "Quick Access" the most recently accessed files are displayed, but the directory (C:\Windows.old\Users\Max\Downloads) is gone. The entire directory has
 been wiped. This is crushingly sad.

</p><blockquote>All of my personal files are gone. Pictures of my late son, court docs, other records. When I click "Quick Access" the most recently accessed files are displayed, but the directory (C:\Windows.old\Users\Max\Downloads) is gone.
 The entire directory has been wiped. This is crushingly sad. </blockquote>
<p>My losses were as bad as yours. I cannot believe MS can get away with such a crappy roll out. The installation up grade said that my files were safe. This web site said they were safe. Guess what they were not. I lost so many old pictures that I could just
 cry. hours of work and MS could just not care. I can not get through to talk to anyone and the answers I get as to what happened are useless. Days after the install I suddenly have issues with and external ESATA drive I used for back up of somethings. It will
 not initalize on any computer after being attached to the win 10 upgrade. It appears that the win 10 system did something to the mbr and I am told it may not be recoverable. Even if it is it may cost several hundred to get some of those files back. Thank you
 MS, you &amp;8#!.<br />

            <p>I had my hard drive partitioned into 2 drives. I backed everything up to my "D" drive which was used for pictures, home videos, and music. This partition was 400GB. Drive "C" (Windows drive) is 100GB. Updated to Win10. No issues. Reset PC to have clean pc
 after moving everything to drive "D" and a 2nd internal hard drive (drive "F"). After clean install of Win10, my drive "D" is 186GB instead of 400GB. The 2nd internal drive isn't being recognized. It's not there. Half the music is gone - don't care about that.
 The 200+ GB of pictures and home videos are gone. Had some backed up to other means, but not all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW CAN I RECOVER THESE FILES? WHERE DID THEY GO? Windows 10 was only supposed to use the "C" drive. That's what I specified when doing the Reset My PC option under settings.&nbsp; ERRRRGGGGGHHHH!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MS SUPPORT ON HOLD FOR 1 HR. MS. ANNE WITH A HEAVY INDIAN ACCENT HUNG UP ON ME AFTER ABOUT 7 MINS. I was nice and told her I was having a tough time understanding her accent after she repeated everything I said to her. What a
 waste of 1 hour and 5 mins. </p>

            <p>I took the plunge and updated to Windows 10 last night - overnight actually, since it took so long. This morning I realized that none of my personal data (files, documents, folders, desktop stuff, certain programs and apps) was visible or readily available
 by looking in the File Explorer or by asking Cortana (Ask Me Anything) to find them for me. I had
<em>not</em> been asked if I wanted to save personal files before making the leap - in spite of what some of the help articles proclaim, nor were there any other warnings about potential loss or rearrangement of personal files and programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refusing to panic I scoured the internet and found that dozens of folks have had the same problem - most of them found their files simply by poking around.
<em>They are supposed to be located in a folder called Windows.old but mine were not. My Windows.old folder was completely empty.&nbsp;</em>If this is also true for you, then try looking inside the File Explorer and dig down to
</p>
<p>This PC/OS (C:) / Users/ your-user-name/Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffbe6e51-7b2b-4f23-a099-ea344ba3f773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffbe6e51-7b2b-4f23-a099-ea344ba3f773" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I found all of my folders dumped here and was able to load them quickly into an external hard drive for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that from now on I will save all important docs to DropBox, iCloud and my other could-based storage. Nothing seems to be as it appears when using Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to everyone working through this problem.</p>

            I find it curious that a Google search of your error code come back with zero hits.<br />
<br />
Since MS Answers <span style="font-weight: bold">still</span> does not prompt for any information when a new question is asked, the best reply to new questions is a wasted message cycle and time to acquire additional information.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Maybe you should tell us a little about your system:<br />
<br />
<div>What is your system make and model?</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown? &nbsp;(this includes plug pulling,&nbsp;power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</div>
<div><br />
Does your system seem to boot okay and then crash or does it not boot at all?
<div><br />
<div>If your system was working okay, what do you think might have changed since the last time it worked properly?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your system used to work properly, what do you think has changed sine the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<div>The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>

<h2>            Unable to download files in windows 7</h2>
                    I currently am unable to download any files in windows 7 with either explorer 9 or firefox. Internet explorer says the file,a pdf, contains a virus and was deleted. The same file on my XP downloads with no problems. I have uninstalled AVG from the windows
 7 and rebooted. I did the normal uninstall and also ran avg special removal program to be sure. I am still getting the same error and windows says that I have no anti-virus program installed. Is there some other setting within windows 7 that will cause this?<br />

                    <p>I'd be pleased but a bit surprised if anyone can offer a solution to my issue, but it is worth reporting in case it is useful feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine is a Lenovo W500 with Intel Core 2 Duo T9400 processor. Its 4 year extended warranty expired 5 years ago. Running W10 Pro (upgrade from Vista/Win8/Win8.1). BIOS upgrade support from Lenovo seems unlikely! ESET End Point Protection which was fine
 on other machines with the update (the registry compatibility entry had been set.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB4054517 installed fine on 13 Dec 17</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB4056892 did not appear to install early Jan but by 6 Jan18 Windows Update was reporting&nbsp;KB4054517 failing with error&nbsp;0x80240034 (not&nbsp;<span>0x80070643
 as per the KB4056892 documentation)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>WindowsUpdateDiagnostic failed with&nbsp;0x803C0103</p>
<p>
</p><p>PSWindowsUpdate failed to report any updates including the printers I had excluded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a System Restore to before the KB4054517 point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WindowsUpdateDiagnostic now worked and I could see the hidden updates in PSWindowsUpdate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allowed&nbsp;KB4056892 to run. It appeared to work, but then went into the failed loop mode with KB4056892.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update now broken again - PSWindowsUpdate and WindowsUpdateDiagnostic not functional.</p>

<p>I did that without any luck on my poorly machine - it found nothing wrong.</p>

<p>I seem to have windows update back working:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore to a post-<span>KB4054517 point.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KB4056892 did not successfully install from windows update and I was stuck on b125</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I cleared the windows update cache but still&nbsp;</span><span>KB4056892 did not install. I think WU was dead.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I installed&nbsp;</span><span>KB4056892 from a download which seemed to go OK, but windows update was still not happy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed KB4058258 from a download. Now I think I have a working windows update system. (ESET AV was able to tell me of some printer drivers that I had originally hidden, and I could hide them again using power shell.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't have&nbsp;CVE-2017-5715 protection - I did not have the hardware, and I had disabled it in the registry.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Center &#40;7 x64&#41; starting recordings late.</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Windows Media Center on two different Win 7 x64 machines.&nbsp; I'm having multiple problems with both, but here I'd like to address just one of them:&nbsp; About 2 weeks ago, one of the machines began recording things late.&nbsp; I had the recorder set to begin
 3 minutes early and end 3 minutes late.&nbsp; The recorder was starting recordings 3 minutes late and ending them 3 minutes late, then declaring the recording had taken place "as scheduled."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked all my settings and rebooted.&nbsp; The next recording was correct, but the next one (and subsequent ones) were 3 minutes late.&nbsp; I took to babysitting the recordings and starting them manually when they didn't start on time.&nbsp; After doing this for a
 couple of days, I started getting recordings that were 20 minutes late! The only information I found online about this problem was about a Microsoft fix that was issued back in October and which I had applied back in October.</p>
<p>I finally decided to completely reinstall Windows 7.&nbsp; It took me 2 days to get Windows to list the correct channels for digital cable. (The scan stuck at 0%).&nbsp; Once I got over that hurdle, I got a couple of recordings that started on time.&nbsp; I still have
 multiple problems with this installation, but I have another machine still working fine...</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Now that machine has begun consistently starting recordings 3 minutes late.&nbsp; Can total failure be far behind?</p>
<p>I'm beyond frustration because of constant "recorder failures," "Media Center stopped responding" and "unknown errors."&nbsp; If somebody could just explain how to get recordings to start and end when I've scheduled them, it would help me immeasurably in regaining
 the patience I need to tackle all the other problems and errors.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you can give!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, i recently had similar issues with scheduled recordings, eventually i had as you mentioned total failure of scheduled recordings. It got to a point where i could not schedule a program if it was due to start in anything over 15mins as i knew it would
 fail.</p>
<p>After trying various fixes ie, remove WMC and reinstall rerun tvsetup, the problem persisted, i was on the verge of reinstalling windows, which would have been a pain and should not be neccassary.</p>
<p>But before i did i decided to ferret around in the registry to find a possible cause to the problem, and eventually i found the offending entries.</p>
<p>Uninstalling WMC and reinstalling should fix the issue but there are 3 keys left which are not removed from the registry, these were the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>These entries were:</p>
<p>mcupdate_scheduled</p>
<p>StartRecording</p>
<p>PvrScheduleTask</p>
<p>So to fix it, i did the following:</p>
<p>Go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft and delete the ehome folder, you may need to stop, ehrcvr and mcglidhost.</p>
<p>Run "Turn Windows Features On or Off" and uncheck "Media Features" click OK and reboot.</p>
<p>Once rebooted open regedit and go to:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\Microsoft\Windows, find the key "Media Center" and delete. Now run "Turn Windows Features On or Off" and check the box "Media Features" to reinstall WMC. Open WMC and
 rerun TVSetup, this will generate the new keys for the registry.</p>
<p>Once complete all scheduled recordings should return to normal operation. Since doing this i have had no isuues with scheduled recordings.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to always back up the registry or create a restore point, before attempting to edit the registry.</strong></p>

            Hi Jerry,
<br />
<br />You shouldn't pay for Windows Media Player. That should come with Windows 10. If you do not see Windows Media Player (if you say, search for it in the Start menu), you can try the following.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together and enter the following: optionalfeatures
<br />
<br />Be sure in the new window that under Media Features, Windows Media Player is checked and click OK.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't seem to work and you still don't see Windows Media Player whenever you look for it in the Start menu or hit Windows key + R then enter: wmplayer
<br />
<br />...then please let me know, I'm willing to help you on this. Good luck.       
        </p>

<h3> edwin y.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7&#58; explorer.exe crashes with error 0xc0000022</h2>
                    I've recently started getting this error on my laptop after it lost power while shutting down. To clarify, when I start normally, I immediately get this error message after logging in.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At first, I tried booting into Safe Mode (which works), then restarting it, but I still got the same error. After some quick Googling, I found out what the error code meant, and have been trying to run the following commands from an administrator shell
 in Safe Mode:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>&gt; CACLS %systemroot%\System32\*.dll /E /G BUILTIN\Users:R</b></div>
<div><b>&gt; CACLS %systemroot%\System32\*.ocx /E /G BUILTIN\Users:R</b> </div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>However, entering in either of these commands results in the following message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Access is denied.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I assume that means that the admin somehow should be getting the "lack of permissions" error, too; if so, how do I fix it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it helps, here's what I have access to:</div>
<div>Safe Mode</div>
<div>Safe Mode with Networking</div>
<div>Safe Mode with Command Prompt</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Normal Mode with no explorer.exe based GUI (i.e., programs need to be started manually from the Task Manager; startup bar not present)</div>
<div>Task Manager</div>
                </div>

            Thanks for the response, but I managed to fix the problem using System Restore. I'll remember Method 1 in the future, but booting into the "Last Known Good Configuration" was, for some reason, unavailable as a boot option.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>DVD movies have their own type of file system....</p>
<p>I don't think Media Player will burn them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet would be a 3rd party program of some kind....</p>
<p>Normally the program doing the burning does everything you need...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not a DVD Movie, what type of file are you trying to burn ?</p>
<p>A DVD player in your van most likely won't play .mp4 of any kind... but some have more advanced features...</p>

            perhaps you could read the owner's manual or check the manufacturer's website to see what is or isn't supported.

<p>What is the make and model of the DVD player in question?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>It may only play *actual* video DVDs.&nbsp; The MP4, etc. files your media player/etc. plays will not play in standard DVD players.</p>

            Hello Karthik.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the&nbsp;information you have provided, it looks&nbsp;like you are&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;create dual boot, by installing Windows xp on second partition.
<div>
<p>A&nbsp;Windows 7 System Reserved Partition is a partition that is created while installing&nbsp;Windows 7 on a
<span><span>n</span>ew hard</span> disk or a formatted hard disk. Usually, it’s a 100MB NTFS partition. If you have a look at it in Disk Management, you’ll notice that it has no Drive letter.&nbsp; It is used primarily as BitLocker partition for BitLocker encryption.&nbsp;
 In addition to this it also holds the Windows Recovery&nbsp;Environment (WinRE) and boot files with boot manager. This is used to boot the computer whenever it has boot problems and there is no Windows 7 installation disc with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can install Windows XP on 32GB Unallocated&nbsp;space.</p>

<p>No, but if you want a small Window in the corner, the other larger one<br />
can cover <strong>most</strong> of the screen.</p>
<p>So, to use numbers as an example, if the screen is 16x20, and the<br />
small window in the corner is 2x4, the large one can be 14x16.</p>

<p>You mean that it disappears behind the large one; it doesn't really<br />
minimize. You need to size and position the two Windows so that they<br />
don't use any identical parts of the screen. </p>

    <title>Why are my virginmedia messages missing from outlook in the modern UI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nodrog33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are my virginmedia messages missing from outlook in the modern UI mail app even though I can see them in outlook in the desktop browser&#63;</h2>
                    I have&nbsp; one Virginmedia and two Gmail accounts added to my Outlook.com account for the purposes of POP/SMTP access and, prior to renaming my Microsoft account around ten days ago, I could see messages from all these under my outlook account in both the
 Modern UI mail app and in the browser. However since then messages from the virginmedia account no longer appear in the modern UI app, either in the inbox or deleted items folders, but are there when I access outlook in the desktop browser.<br />
<br />
Immediately after I renamed the MS account only messages from one of the gmail accounts were getting through and when I checked in the outlook settings there were error messages for the other two, to the effect that outlook was unable to retrieve messages from
 these accounts. Removing and adding the gmail account back on restored functionality for that one first time, but it took four attempts for the virginmedia one. The last but one time I tried to add it back on I got a message saying something like "it appears
 you have already added this account - if you have recently removed it and want to add it again wait a while and try again later" I left it 24 hours and tried again when it worked and I have been able to see mail from this account since, but only in the browser
 and not in the modern UI app. Messages from the two gmail accounts appear in the mail app as normal, and the virginmedia address is available for sending mail from there.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that somehow there are now two versions of my outlook account, or at least the settings for it, one with the virginmedia account and one without? Is it significant that the logo displayed for the outlook account in the modern UI mail app settings
 screen is the Hotmail one?<br />
<br />

            <p>A Pop mail account by default downloads all mail from the server, it doesn't matter who your mail provider is.</p>
<p>You have to amend the pop mail account settings to 'leave a copy on the server'</p>
<p>NB Mail sent from a device will only be seen on the device it was sent from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>an IMAP mail account retains all mail on the server, so that any device sees all mail, both sent &amp; received</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium limited to 4 cores&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djsubterrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium limited to 4 cores&#63;</h2>
                    I have a skulltrail system which has dual quad core processors (so 8 cores in total), it's used as a home computer (overkill you say, maybe but I have had it for a couple of years now and it continues to impress), I had been running Windows 7 Ultimate
 RC and betas and installed the final iso without a serial number and all was well.<br />
<br />
As I had pre-ordered Home Premium thinking it would suffice for my purposes I decided to try installing using one of the isos floating about on the web but with no serial number, planning to add my legitimate serial when I received the pack.
<br />
<br />
Now in device manager all 8 cores are recognised :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/mbo32q.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager Screenshot</a>
<br />
<br />
Although in HWMonitor only 4 of the cores are listed/recognised :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://i33.tinypic.com/ercwhj.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HWMonitor Gadget Screenshot</a> (The gadget with the temperatures is using HWMonitor to read the temperatures)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if there is a limit in Home Premium of the number of cores? Would I need to buy the upgrade to Professional or Ultimate just to use my other processor?<br />
<br />
I was very impressed with Windows 7 so far but if this is true, forcing a home user to buy a professional product just to use their computer properly smacks of racketeering to me.<br />
<br />
(I know some people will frown on me using an iso obtained from the web but as I have pre-ordered the product I don't see any problem with using the software in a preview fashion until I receive the serial and enter it to legitimize the install)

<h2>            Can I sell retail versions of Windows XP Pro&#63;</h2>
                    So recently I went to an auction and won a pallet full of computer office equipment. One of the items was a CD sleeve full of software, most of them Microsoft Windows XP Professional upgrades with CD keys (all legit). Can I sell or use these even though
 there were computers sold at the auction with that software possibly installed on them? Thanks in advance!

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which version of Olympus Master program is installed on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Was it working fine before?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if the software is compatible with Windows7, here is the link to check compatibility:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s</a>= Olympus Master</span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
</span>
<p><span>If not, then I’d suggest you to install the software in Compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a. To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the program icon, click Properties, and then click the Compatibility tab.
<br />
b. From the Compatibility tab, select Windows Vista SP1 or Vista SP2 and click ‘Apply’ and ‘OK’.<br />
c. Proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details on Compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows:</span></strong><b><span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>T<span>ry to set your computer in </span>Clean Boot state and check if the same issue occurs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
