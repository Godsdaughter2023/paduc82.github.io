            As long as they are administrators, they will be able to change any restrictions placed on files and folders so they will have access.

</p><p>The mouse left-click, of the start button, fails to bring up the appropriate menu. The right click works ok. As a result of the issue the settings are not available , along with other features. I can get most things through longer routes but it is a nuisance
 and I have had three `Microsoft Techs' coming onto my PC and trying recovery methods without success. (The last one disappeared half way through). Has anybody out there had this snag ? I would be grateful for any ideas.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. As three technicians has already done many of the troubleshooting steps without any success. I would suggest you to install all the Windows update. Most of the issues are fixed by installing Windows Updates
 make sure that your system is up-to-date. Type Windows Updates in search bar and select Check for updates from the results. If updates are available, try installing them and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Secondly, perform System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any system files corruption in the system. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin</strong>).</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>
ENTER</strong>: <br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ul>
<p><span>Also run <strong>DISM</strong> scan to check and restore system file corruption:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check.</span></p>
<p><span>To start the Windows Installer service in Windows 7 checks the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Click on start.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type Services.msc in the start search bar and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Scroll down and Double-click on the service named "Windows Installer".</span></p>
<p><span>d) Check the value in the 'Startup type:' field.</span></p>
<p><span>e) If it's currently set to "Disabled", then this could cause the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Change it by selecting "Manual" from the drop-down box.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span> Make sure
<b>Volume Shadow Copy Service</b> is set to automatic and started. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Click on Start-Run, type
<b>services.msc</b>, the click on OK. </span></p>
<p><span>b) When the Services window loads, navigate to the
<b>“Volume Shadow Copy Service ",</b> the double click on it to open it,</span></p>
<p><span>c) Make sure the "<b>Startup Type" says "Automatic</b>" and
<b>started</b>. If it doesn't, use the drop down menu to change it.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If it already says: "Automatic", then click on the
<b>"Recovery"</b> tab at the top, and change the "First Failure" line to "Restart the Service", then click on "<b>apply", then OK.</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> Run Check disk
 to fix any bad sectors on the hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on start and in the start search bar type CMD, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and
 then click on run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>b. At the command prompt type
<b>chkdsk /f </b>and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, type in
<b>chkdsk /r </b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>CHKDSK would try to recover bad sectors on the hard disk, during this process there are chances of DATA loss from that particular sector.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b><span> Disable the
 security software and then start the backup; follow the steps mentioned in the link below</span></p>

    <title>Problems with SystemRestore and defrag using Task Scheduler - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerryee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with SystemRestore and defrag using Task Scheduler</h2>
                    I have Vista Ultimate X64.&nbsp; <br />
My biggest problem is getting daily system restore points.&nbsp; I found where they were being created in&nbsp;task scheduler afer noticing I did not have very many restore points like i did in XP.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I noticed that the restore points at login were working ok but the&nbsp;scheduled task was not working regularly.&nbsp; I was shutting down my machine daily and it would&nbsp;then wait for the next chance but failed often based on the history tab in task scheduler.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So&nbsp;I disabled the task&nbsp;that ran at login,&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;it should only create one at night, and changed the scheduled restore point to run at 1:30am&nbsp; and turned on "wake computer to run".&nbsp; I then started shutting down by clicking the low power state button option
 under the start button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It started working fine and i was getting one every night and they were building up.&nbsp; (The only way I found to see restore points is to actually start the restore process, isn't there a better way? )&nbsp; I have 3 volumes and only the c: volume was turned on.&nbsp;
 I decided to turn on the other 2 volumes.&nbsp; It wiped out all restore points I had.&nbsp; I guess I can see that.
<br />
But then&nbsp; after that it would act sporadically.&nbsp; Task scheduler was telling me it ran successfully every night via the history tab, yet certain nights were not available in the restore process. And I'm not talking about the oldest ones, i'm talking about the
 second newest restore point in one case.&nbsp; It was all over the board.&nbsp; Then i noticed it would not go above 12 restore points, which is ok but i used VSSADMIN list ShadowStorage at the command line as administrator and, for example, my C:&nbsp; volume was building
 in size every night but restore points were dropping off.&nbsp; I was not even close to the MAX amount of disc for shadow storage.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
THEN, this morning i discovered that system restore ran ok at 1:30:00am as usual and got "task completed" and "action completed" both at 1:30:07am:, but then&nbsp;9 minutes later at 1:39:34 there is another entry:&nbsp;&nbsp;Task Engine received message to start task.&nbsp;&nbsp; event
 319&nbsp;&nbsp;(Same entry it has at 1:30:00 every night) then the next entry in history is event 101, Task Start Failed.&nbsp; And that is the last entry to this point in time.&nbsp; I have no idea what&nbsp; sent it a message to start at 1:39:34 after it had just finished successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The result or error code it got when it errored at "Task Start Failed"&nbsp; was&nbsp;2147750689.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After seeing this (I've been monitoring both SystemRestore and defrag after changing them to run in the a.m.&nbsp; by "waking the computer")&nbsp; i went to system properties,&nbsp; system protection and it showed for all 3 volumes the last restore point was the one from
 yesterday 1/18 at 1:30:00, even though technically it finished just fine on 1/19 but triggered again for some strange reason.&nbsp; I then went to sysetm restore, choose restore point, clicked next&nbsp; (like i always do to see all restore points) and there was only
 TWO restore points available.&nbsp; The two most current for 1/18 and&nbsp; 1/17.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "see more than 5"&nbsp; check box was not there.&nbsp; They were the ONLY TWO.
<br />
And right now the task is sitting at "Ready"&nbsp; for status but the "Last run result is&nbsp; "The task is currently running (0x41301).&nbsp; Strange indeed considering the status is "Ready".
<br />
And also because the last entry as noted was failed with event code code above.&nbsp; does that make any sense?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
THEN, I used VSSADMIN list shadowstorage and it is showing more growth since YESTERDAY on all 3 volumes???&nbsp;&nbsp; The C: volume has about 15GB of USED disc space showing there, with a MAX of 20GB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could i be losing restore points like this?&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the disc
 showing that the space is used and keeps climbing every night?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
These are just the most recent and bizarre occurances.&nbsp; I've had it reduce to 3 restore points one other time earlier on after I had started it running nightly by "waking the computer" when there had been 6 or 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is happening to my restore points and
 why is the task scheduler acting freaky&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Same with Defrag.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday i manually defragged the machine cause it had failed the time before.&nbsp;&nbsp; It kicked off at 2:45am and when it's successful it only takes around 45 minutest at most to run.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not deleting and adding new files all of the time.&nbsp;
 My usage is very consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp; last night it kicked off but as it does sometimes, never finished in the time between 2:45am and the time I logged on.&nbsp; Usually i don't logon again until the next evening, then there are entries for the time i logged in, in the
 task scheduler history entries.&nbsp; I refresh them every time i look at them too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well since i manually defragged last night, and i changed the manual task from&nbsp; defrag.exe -c&nbsp; to defrag.exe -c -w&nbsp; so it would defrag every fragment.&nbsp; Otherwise the default is
 only fragments smaller than 64 MB.&nbsp; Maybe that is what I should always do?&nbsp; HELP on that one please.
<br />
But considering it was just run,&nbsp; this morning task scheduler showed it kicked off and action started just fine at 2:45am but had not finished.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I just totally defraged all volumes last night and didn't use the machine after that.&nbsp; (the -c switch is to
 defrag all volumes by the way, so the setting for manual defrag was to do all volumes with default defragging before i added the -w in to totally defrag all volumes.&nbsp; I changed it back. )&nbsp; But anyway, when I logged onto the machine this morning the defrag
 finished.&nbsp; I hace a feeling something happened after the task woke the machine and it started at 2:45.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what, but it was stalled until I logged on cause it's set to finish at the next available time like most all tasks.&nbsp;It was set to finish only
 when the machine was idle but uncheckec that cause it was never finishing in the past.&nbsp; It would error out instead before it ever finished, at least most of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is set to try for like 3 days or run that long before it's stopped, but i think the day
 to day runs were bumping into each other cause it never finished, at least not timely and that somehow was killing it.&nbsp;
<br />
Anyway,&nbsp; I don't know why it won't finish when the drives were completely defragged.&nbsp; It does work the way i have it setup for waking the machine at 2:45 and has successfully finished in under an hour.&nbsp; (I had to defrag all volumes manually back when i set
 it up for this nightly run so it was caught up and could finish.&nbsp; I let it run weekly but set it for 4 out of the 7 days so ti should finish easily but does only sometimes.&nbsp; Others it does when i logon the next time or it still fails sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; These tasks
 are so fragile and messed up. <br />
<br />
Sorry for being so very very wordy on this.&nbsp; I tried to explain and i'm sure i repeated myself.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The systemrestore points disappearing are what is troubling me the most.&nbsp; I&nbsp; relied on that a lot on my XP machine and it worked flawlessly.&nbsp; I'm thinking i should not have all volumes turned on.&nbsp; My D: drive is the second internal drive and right now i only
 store downloads and installation files on it, so if I ever have to wipe Vista and reload it,&nbsp; most of my software is on that drive to start the process of resinstalling my software.&nbsp; The F: volume is a large 500GB external (it only has 100GB used on it and
 it's restore file is very small) and it has my photos and music and stuff like that.&nbsp; I don't think i need to have restore points on those drives.&nbsp; Any advice?&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, sometimes I'll install a program but make the F: drive the data drive for the program.&nbsp;
 Still not sure i need restore points on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someday i might start installing programs on the d: drive when i run out&nbsp; of space on c:, but until then.........what do you think?&nbsp;&nbsp; XP used to take away files that weren't there at teh restore point, and I lliked
 that in som cases and likewise it would bring back files that were deleted before i ran the restore.&nbsp; Now files are untouched I believe....those that aren't system files I mean of course.
<br />
<br />
Please help me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my sleep set for 2 hours, so after the machine is woken to run these jobs, it has 2 hours before the machine goes to sleep again and i'm not sure it does if they are running.&nbsp; I believe it would since it goes by user input??&nbsp; But 2
 hours is plenty of time for these to finish.&nbsp; Esp. the restore points. <br />
<br />
<br />
thanks SO much,<br />
Jerry<br />

            The question should not be "can I use Windows 10 home for business".&nbsp; The question should be&nbsp;"does the functionality of Windows 10 home meet my business needs".&nbsp; So you need to consider what you need and from this you can establish what version is appropriate.&nbsp;
 Same with Office 365 and it's various packages.

<p>The word "home" doesn't mean that its use is limited to home users. It simply means that it doesn't have all the features of the Pro version. And the Pro version's use is not limited to professionals either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes you can use it. Anybody can use either version. The difference between them has to do with what features they contain, not with who can use them.</p>

<h2>            Edit executable shortcuts using notepad on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to edit executable shortcuts. On previous versions of windows, I used to be able to simply open the shortcuts with notepad and edit them, but every time I open these shortcuts with notepad the .exe file is opened instead (binary contents are
 displayed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I edit shortcuts on Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows 10 pro. I can provide the exact version if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            I have not heard of editing shortcuts using Notepad. 
<br />PS: I tried it and recreated your problem, kinda. Win tried to load a spreadsheet into Notepad ... (it was not happy with the file format).
<br />
<br />What sort of editing do you do on these shortcuts? Exactly what are you changing? 
<br />
<br />I have always right clicked on the shortcut, selected properties and then modified options displayed there.

<p>The purpose of editing shortcuts is to add command line arguments to executables. It should be a pretty standard windows function.</p>

            That's true if it's just adding command line argument. But if you would like to add other scripting, that's probably not possible through the properties. For example if you want to set/assign an environment variable before running the executable you can't
 do so. I suppose you could just create a new batch file, but old versions of windows allowed me to edit the shortcut directly so I don't have to create a new file.&nbsp;

            Interesting. You are right. I am old school. If I needed to set env variables I did use batch files associated to the shortcut.

            <p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank youf or your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good to note that your Windows is activated. It might be possible that the concerned file got corrupted and repaired while in the process of activation. As long as you do not get the error message "Windows is not Genuine",&nbsp; your computer status will
 be Windows activated and you won't face any issues with activation. However, if you get the message back again,&nbsp;I would suggest you to try the steps in Method 3 to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, please feel free to reply, in case you face any other issues with Windows in future. We'll be more than happy to assist you again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for sharing!</p>

            <p>What puzzles me is my computer isn't brand new. I purchased it almost 2 years ago and activated Windows at the time.</p>
<p>The alert saying this computer is not running genuine Windows just began popping up in the past 10 - 14 days. Any thoughts why?</p>

            <p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for further concerns on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation helps verify that Windows on your computer is genuine and hasn't been used on more computers than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. In this way, activation helps prevent software counterfeiting. Thus, there are many system files that
 are responsible for carrying out the activation operation. When you boot your computer there are many functions that are invoked to check the activation status of your Windows. If any of the major files is corrupted due to any reason, the activation needs
 to be done again in order to clear the non-genuine status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The concerned file may be corrupted due to various reasons, including any third party software intervention, virus infection or any corrupted update installed related to activation operation etc. Therefore, it is good to note that your issue is resolved.
 However, if you get any activation errors in future, do write back to us stating the exact error message for&nbsp;swift and to-the-point&nbsp;troubleshooting. We'll be glad to help you again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this infomation is helpful. In addition to that, please feel free to post for any of your other reccurring issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

Hi, please start a new thread with your results, and one of the experts here can tell you what to do. This old thread was about a specific HP OEM installation at a remaining rearm count 0, and most likely your situation will be different.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're playing the game online while you're signed in with your Microsoft account, the game progress should automatically save to the cloud. Otherwise, there may be an interruption with the game server or an incorrect account configuration preventing
 the game progress from syncing. To gain more clarity of your concern, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to play the game online or offline?</li><li>Is your device connected to a wired or a wireless network?</li><li>Were you able to save your game progress before?</li><li>Are you using the same Microsoft account to sign in to the Xbox app and the game?</li><li>Have you tried playing other games to check if you can save the progress?</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, kindly perform the following steps to make sure that your device is connected to the Internet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> then select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Network &amp; Interne</strong><strong>t</strong>. </li><li>Check if you can see <strong>You're connected to the Internet</strong> under <strong>
Network status</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 1903 Update - How do I turn off the date grouping for my downloads folder&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Updated to 1903 this morning.&nbsp; I just noticed my downloads folder now has all the files categorized by dates in collapsible groups.&nbsp; I can find no where to turn off this option.&nbsp; For me, this has to be the dumbest change I have ever seen... talk about making
 it MUCH harder to find and use files in this folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>today, earlier this week, last week, last month, etc... stupid... I just want to see the files as I always have... list view by name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me there is a way to turn this off and go back to regular view options without these collapsible groups.&nbsp; If not, I will be making my own folder for now and this one will become absolutely useless to me.</p>

<h2>            Unable to paste images into RTF document&#47;editor like wordpad or PolyEdit</h2>
                    I am a big fan of RTF documents as text formatting &amp; image support is all I need in a document. I don't go for word or open office document as they are bulky compared to RTF and I don't use any of their features<br />
wordpad &amp; free editors like PolyEdit strongly support RTF documents having images. But when I copy paste from other apps/web browser the paste happens as plain text in both wordpad and Polyedit.<br />
I even tried AbiWord another editor. I checked all options including "Paste Special" and others<br />
Now i'm doing a hard workaround of opening microsoft word 2003 and pasting the content, saving it as RTF insted of .doc

            thanks for your response. the image is JPEG. the workaround for pasting image defeats the purpose of simply copying and pasting a chunk of text that has multiple images located in many places. also the text formatting is lost during pasting

<h3> imasquirtl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Borderless Fullscreen</h2>
                    I recently switched from Windows 7 to 10 and have found out that with multiple monitors, borderless fullscreen doesn't work as it did on Windows 7. I usually play games in borderless fullscreen so that I can easily do other things on my second monitor.
 Whenver I would click on something on my second monitor, the taskbar would appear on my main monitor. However, with Windows 10, this is not the case and the taskbar would not appear. Is there any way to make it so that if I alt tab to my second monitor my
 taskbar will popup on my main monitor?

<h2>            Cannot Copy Files Over Network &#40;Permission from computer&#39;s Administrator issue&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have researched this problem and I am posting here as a last resort.</p>
<p>I am having the "you require permission from the computer's administrator to make changes to this file" when attempting to copy/paste files FROM an XP machine TO a windows 7 home macine.</p>
<p>I have the following set:</p>
<p>UAC notifications disabled</p>
<p>Main user/owner/administrator set as "owner" (of all drives and all folders pertinant)&nbsp;with all subdirectories and "children" folders set with the same controls</p>
<p>Firewall disabled</p>
<p>All drives are shared (on both the XP and W7 machines) with full access enabled for "everyone" "myuser/administrator" "administrator" and "Network" (on both the XP machine, and the windows 7 machine)</p>
<p>I have tried copying the files directly to a "my documents" folder (same problem:&nbsp; you must have permission from this computer's adminstrator)</p>
<p>I have tried pasting the files directly into a blank partition (eg no folders), having set the permissions/ownership of the drive</p>
<p>I have tried creating folders within the blank partition and set the permissions/ownership of these folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all cases, I get the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure I have missed something, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Everyone does Not mean Everyone that wants to logon.<br />
<br />
If accounts are set only for John, Jill, and Jack, using the Everyone setting in the Folder Permissions saves the effort of setting Permission separately for John, Jill, and Jack.<br />
<br />
Everyone else is Not in the Everyone group, only John, Jill, and Jack.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe this can Help.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>---------------------<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story<strong> (it is only 600 words)</strong></strong></em>.<em><strong> I do not know what the user's overall knowledge is, and what exactly was already done. Thus the info goes through the motions
 of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

<p><strong>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</strong></p>

<p>After configuring the Homegroup scroll down to the <strong>Permission/Security section.</strong></p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>

<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p><strong>***Note.</strong> Some of the processes described above are done Not for Windows sake but to compensate for different Routers and the way their firmware works and stores the info about the computers that are Networked.</p>

    <title>Applications hang until SPLWOW64 process is killed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericqc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applications hang until SPLWOW64 process is killed</h2>
                    I have been frustrated by this problem for some time, and apparently am not alone. In another thread (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/photoshop-hangs-waiting-for-resources-used-by/086d3251-2c1e-4196-844a-878b708e7e44">here</a>)
 it was suggested that I start my own thread rather than add my experience to the OP's thread.<br />
<br />
After starting my Win7 Ultimate 64-bit system, many applications stop responding if anything to do with the printer is invoked. Most commonly, I see it in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span> Office apps: Word will hang if I try to print, but also if I try to make a change to the page layout or change the base font while in print layout view. It also hangs if I
<em>exit </em>Word -- and if I click the "x" button, it restarts Word and is able to exit normally.<br />
<br />
Invariably, if I open Task Manager and kill the <strong>splwow64.exe</strong> process, the hung application immediately responds. Even more puzzling, the process that was using ~7KB seems to be automatically restarted and I can continue without problems — until
 I next restart Windows. I do notice that the new process starts with TM reporting ~3KB memory and changes after use.<br />
<br />
Other applications have similar symptoms: Photoshop, Firefox (if I try to print), and Inkscape are but a few examples. The problem has been going on for several months now, so I just grit my teeth and kill the process so I can at least get work done.<br />
<ul>
<li>I have Windows Update on and keep things up-to-date. (Win7 Ultimate with Service Pack 1; 64-bit)</li><li>My HP LaserJet 2420d is attached to my system via USB, and there was no change after updating to the most recent printer drivers from HP.</li><li>An Epson Artisan 830 is connected over an internal network; and like the HP, has the most recent drivers yet gets the same results if I attempt to use it.</li><li>I am running IE9 (and have not knowingly downloaded or installed IE10), but seldom use it.</li></ul>
<strong>Question:</strong> Is there a new and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
working</span> version of this SPLWOW64 process — and if so, how do I acquire it?<br />

My main problem is with Office documents. The KB you point to doesn't seem to apply because it is dated more than a year ago (and the problem started for me just a few months ago). Moreover, the KB article is way over my head with jargon and references like
 this "cause" that will mean nothing to a typical user:<br />
<br />
<b>This issue is caused by an error in MXDW that occurs when MXDW reverses Format 4 cmap tables.<br />
</b><br />
Huh? <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />

Okay, but what is an "XPS-based driver"? I don't use XPS, XPS Document Writer, or Terminal Services Easy Printer Driver (and in fact have no idea what they are), so I'm not sure how this hotfix could be of use.<br />
<br />
The problem with the KB articles like the one you pointed to is that they assume a much deeper knowledge of the OS than most users care about, and as such are almost useless as help. I'm no newbie to Windows but I have no interest in fussing around with registry
 settings and obscure processes. I'm not willing to just try one thing after another in the hopes that something will end up fixing the problem. Surely that is up to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
In this instance, a change made by Windows Update made hitherto fully functional software STOP working as it did before. Moreover, it is not just Microsoft SW that is affected.<br />

1. I do know what XPS is, but don't use it; nothing about the others. MS XPS Document Writer is in the Printers list but I've never used it. Why would they have any effect on this problem though?<br />
<br />
2. Yes, as noted earlier, Photoshop is installed. How would I know if it "hijacked" the print engine for, say, Office? I use Office daily; Photoshop rarely -- but the problem happens once with
<i>every </i>start of Win7 (as originally described).<br />
<br />
3. All recommended and important Windows updates get installed. The only ones I don't bother with are the language packs for languages I don't use. My update history has hundred of listings going back to 2009-12-16; most seem to be definition updates for MSE.<br />
<br />
4. I haven't ever used (or even installed) Norton or McAfee on this system. Only MSE.<br />
<br />
5. I have CCleaner but use it only for managing apps and cleanup for browsers; never for registry stuff.<br />
<br />
No games; no bootleg SW; system is turned off daily...<br />

            <p>In recent months I started having this issue with MS Office products (only). I am not going to speculate about the cause or refer to any other articles. What does work is killing the splwow64.exe process.</p>
<p>Here is the workaround I'm using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open notepad, copy the command below into it and save as a ".bat" file. </p>
<p>TASKKILL /F /im splwow64.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine for instance mine is called "Killspl.bat" and saved on the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then copy the script below into a new notepad file and save it with the ".vbs" extension.</p>
<p>Dim WinScriptHost<br />
Set WinScriptHost = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")<br />
WinScriptHost.Run Chr(34) &amp; "C:\KillWOW.bat" &amp; Chr(34), 0<br />
Set WinScriptHost = Nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating these two files go to "Task Scheduler" and set it to run&nbsp; the second file you made saved as ".vbs" every 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This not only kills the process, but also does not show the annoying shell pop up window every time it runs. This was done after trying the hotfix, and all other methods and solutions I could find.</p>

<h2>            Cannot add a printer to network</h2>
                    <p>Here is my dilemma. I am trying to install a wireless printer adapter and I am running into problems.</p>
<p>I recently changed routers for my network because I changed service providers. I didn't have any</p>
<p>problems installing my printer using my Westell router (Verizon). I configured my printer no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched my service provider to Optimum, They gave me a NETGEAR router and I had to configure my</p>
<p>printer to a new network (ssid). I followed the instructions just like before but never got to the step where</p>
<p>I had to put in the network name and passphrase. Instead I received a message stating: "INSTALLATION OF</p>
<p>OS USE&nbsp;CANNOT BE PERFORMED". I CAN print if I hard wire my printer to my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions anyone might have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer operating system is Windows 7. My computer is a Dell Laptop Studio 1759. My printer is a Dell 2130cn laser printer and my router is a</p>
<p>Netgear N600 (WNDR3400). My first router was a Westell D90-327W18, which as I stated before worked without</p>
<p>a hitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Michael</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using a computer connected to a "workgroup", click the arrow button next to Password protected sharing to expand this section.
</p>
<p><br />
Check to see if password-protected sharing is turned on or off. <br />
<br />
If password protected sharing is turned on, only people with a user account and password for this computer will be able to access your printer. Turn this off if you want anyone on the network to be able to access the printer you are sharing unless you give
 then a user account and password.<br />
</p>
<p>Set your printer as the default printer and see if it resets it to online status.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My power supply died, i replaced it but now windows wont work at all</h2>
                    on Friday night my power supply crashed and it turns out that it died. thats fine i bought a new one and the computer can go on now. Except windows is all messed up. when it boots up it brings you to a screen that says either launch startup repair or start
 windows normaly. Starting windows brings it to a black screen that only says "Starting Windows" the logo never comes up and it only stays on that screen for about 2 seconds before rebooting itself. if you do startup repair it gives you the instructions on
 how to repair the computer then under that it says <br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000f<br />
<br />
info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.<br />
<br />
putting in the disc doesnt do anything, when you reboot it just brings you back to that screen.<br />
<br />
I have also tried booting into all available safe modes, each one hangs when it starts loading AtiPcie.sys and tehn most of the time just reboots after that, or sometimes will go to starting windows and then reboot. i have tried booting into all other options
 in the advanced boot menu. I have also tried booting into my windows 7 disc, but as soon as it loads the windows files the second time it goes the starting windows and reboots itself. So i cant get into the disc to do a repair or system restore. i have tried
 using ultimate boot cd, but that doesnt work either. .<br />
<br />
the only thing i can think of at this point that could be causing this is my GPU or motherboard itself, but since i dont have on board graphics and i dont have a spare graphics card or spare mobo for that matter i cant test either of those.&nbsp; by the way this
 is also a custom built PC so i cant really call a manufacturer. <br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
the power supply i have now is a corsair gs700, my old one was OCZ Mod xstream-pro 700w. both are 700w.<br />
i have&nbsp; a msi 870a-g54 motherboard<br />
ATI Radeon 5770 GPU<br />
1.5 TB hitachi intternal HDD<br />
500GB Samsun Internal HDD(this one has windows on it)<br />
AMD Phenom II x4 CPU (or something like that, i dont remember the exact name of it i just know its AMD and has 4 cores)<br />
and a ASUS DVD/CD drive<br />

    <title>Netflix Troubles - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Netflix Troubles</h2>
                    
<p><span>I just recently signed up for Netflix and last night on my Xbox 360 I was having issues while viewing with someone from my friends list. We watched a selection that they suggested from their instant queue. After that we were
 trying to pick out another movie to watch. This is where the issues started. Netflix would not allow us to suggest movies to each other. Movies in my friends queue or even movies from different categories, the option wasn't there to suggest these... So we
 both looked at random movies to see if we could figure it out. Some movies it would allow you to suggest and others it wouldn't. I know it not due to what the movie was rated because certain movies it would allow us to watch. So basically I am trying to figure
 out why certain movies and movies we</span> <span>have in our instant queue were not available to suggest to each other or watch...</span></p>

            <p>I don't know how anyone would discover this on their own, but:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding down the "windows" button below the screen and simultaneously pressing the "volume down" rocker on the side of the Surface will take a picture of the full screen, and store it in a gallery called "Screen Shots" in the Photo app.</p>
