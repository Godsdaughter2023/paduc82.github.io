 I know i use able to use stuff such as Vagrant or Docker before, but now i cant and it looks like its because of this being disabled. I assume some firmware update has disabled this, has anyone been able to enable this in any way, opened a support ticket or
 similar?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I also have Surface Book i7 and been facing this issue since Windows 10 Anniversary&nbsp;Update got applied.
</p>
<p>Was getting VT-x not available/ enabled error for my existing 64bit VMs. Also was not getting 64bit OS option to create new VMs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I am able to resolve this issue after 2 months. Virtualization Based Security Setting in Group Policy had to be updated to get Virtualbox working for 64 bit option VMs.

<p>
</p><p>I have done all of the regular steps. Run the update troubleshooter, done this:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1); margin-left: 30px">

<p>That did not do anything but waste my time. I also deleted the old update files to refresh the system. No change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I manually do an update it says: <strong>this update is not applicable to your computer.&nbsp;</strong>It has not had an update since 2016 so the important January update pack should be required by now.
<br />
Optional updates do pop up but again, no updates past November of 2016. When I check for updates it just says that all updates have been done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I almost never ask questions. The internet is usually full of answers but I cannot find anyone who has run across an issue like this. Please advise.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, that is one of MS updates that I attempted to install. I received the error that I mentioned above when trying it. Updates earlier than November would give the error saying I already had them installed. Again, this is a very strange error.&nbsp;

            It'll only occur with one of the later Security Updates installed. One way or another your installation must be at least as current as March, if not May already. :)

<p>That is the problem. No updates more recent thank November of 2016. The computer had not been on since then. I have tried every trick I can think of to get it to update. None of the optional updates were more recent than November of 2016 either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I said above. All updates after December of 2016 receive that error when trying to manually install them. Any update previous to December gets the error of already being installed. Because that january update has taken over almost all other updates, it
 was hard to find others, but I did track down and try 3 windows 7 for x64 updates and all of them gave me the same result of not being for the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is a bizarre issue. I have been doing tech support for almost 20 years and I have never run across anything like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I checked both the other day but I have closed the case with the client because it was simply not worth the man hours to fix it. The system had not a single update installed from November 16th 2016 to May 2017 due to being out of town and offline. When it
 would check for updates, first it took forever, over 45 minutes and so we started troubleshooting as mentioned above. It never found a recent update, either optional or important. I have tried every solution I could find online without success and because
 this client simply does not use his computer enough, it was not worth the cost of us to continue troubleshooting. He does understand the risk of using the system but he only uses it for light web use and email. He will be replacing the system in a short while.
 So, no solution but I am not going to work on it any further. I wanted to just share my experience because it seemed that no one else has ever had a problem like it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Transferring Outlook Express messages to Outlook after Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foolsfortune  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Outlook Express messages to Outlook after Windows 7 &#34;upgrade&#34;</h2>
                    I had backed up my Outlook express messages and .iaf file thinking I'd be diligent and be able to restore after formating and erasing XP and installing Windows 7 only to find out Outlook exppress was history and Outlook won't read .dbx files.<br />
<br />
Now what to do?

            Well, you are in a little bit of a pickle.&nbsp; You are correct that Outlook cannot read .dbx files, and it can only import them from a working Outlook Express environment.&nbsp; Your best bet at this point, since you formatted the XP environment, is to copy the
 .dbx files to a working Windows XP computer, then import them into that computer's Outlook Express.&nbsp; When doing the Import, you must specify that you want to import from&nbsp;an "OE6 Direcotry Store" and then point&nbsp;it to your saved OE6 data.&nbsp; You may want to create
 a new Windows user login for yourself before doing this.<br />
<br />
With the e-mail imported into that Outlook Express environment, if your e-mail takes up less than 2GB you can use Outlook Express' Export function to dump all your e-mail into an Outlook .pst file.&nbsp; You can then copy that .pst file to the Windows 7 PC and start
 Outlook, the do File-Open-Outlook Data File and open it.&nbsp; Do NOT do an Import with Outlook.<br />
<br />
If your Outlook Express e-mail is over 2GB, you will not be able to export to a .pst from Outlook Express because it can only do so using Outlook's older .pst format, which has a 2GB file size limit.&nbsp; In that case, you will need to install Outlook 2003 or 2007&nbsp;on
 the computer and tell it to Import the Outlook Express data.&nbsp; It will pull it all into a .pst file that can grow to over 25GB.&nbsp; When it finishes, copy that .pst file to your Windows 7 PC, then start Outlook and do the File-Open-Outlook Data File thing.&nbsp; Do
 NOT import the .pst file.

<p>Does the OLXP Export function require that Outlook be installed on that WinXP PC (for the MAPI) ?</p>

            Does this same process work for migrating saved e-mails from Outlook Express on Win XP to a new computer running Outlook 2010 on Win 8?

<p>During a panel at PAX East today, Gearbox revealed that <a href="http://pc.ign.com/objects/094/094190.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Borderlands 2</a>’s level cap will be raised on April 2nd for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC players. The cap will add 11 new levels (bringing the total to 61) and will be free to Season Pass holders (or $4.99 for everyone else).</p>
<p>Along with the level raise, Gearbox will also be adding a new weapon tier: Pearlescent. Pearlescent weapons were previously seen in the original Borderlands and will be the rarest loot in
<a href="http://ps3.ign.com/objects/094/094189.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Borderlands 2</a>.</p>
<p>On April 2nd, Gearbox will also offer a new mode called Ultimate Vault Hunter’s Mode as a free update to all players regardless of whether they’ve purchased the level cap raise. The mode will be available to anyone who has beaten True Vault Hunter Mode and
 reached level 50 and will have enemies scaled to the highest level in your party.</p>
<p>Gearbox emphasized that the level cap upgrade is not the final piece of the <a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/094/094188.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Borderlands 2</a> season pass and that a fourth campaign is still set to arrive before the end of June. More information on the level cap increase will be announced before its release next week.</p>

<p>They should have added a level increase by the second campaign add-on I don't understand why they waited so long and why its such a small increase. I mean if they keep the point system the same I'm pretty sure you will be able to go from level 50 to 61 fairly
 fast since you will be fighting enemy's that are least 4-5 levels higher then you. they should have added like 5 level increases with each campaign add-on and give like a increase of 15-20 levels for the Ultimate Vault hunters mode. I haven't even played BL2
 for a month or so now because i lack the motivation to play but not level up.</p>

<p>03.29.13 - Chris Faylor</p>
<p>Among the level cap increase and various other changes coming to Borderlands 2 on April 2, 2013</p>
<p>is a new playthrough -- Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode -- built for challenging high-level play.</p>
<p>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode differs quite a bit from Normal Mode and True Vault Hunter
</p>
<p>Mode -- here's a quick rundown of the major changes:</p>
<p>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode Details• Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is unlocked for a character once they
</p>
<p>have completed the main story missions in True Vault Hunter Mode and reached level 50.</p>
<p>• Unlike other playthroughs, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode can be replayed multiple times with players
</p>
<p>able to reset their overall mission progress at any time from the Main Menu.</p>
<p>• No more tutorial missions -- characters in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode begin in Southern Shelf with the
</p>
<p>"Cleaning Up the Berg" mission.</p>
<p>• While playing in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, enemies and bosses will scale according to the player's
</p>
<p>current level or, if playing with others, the highest-level player in that party.</p>
<p>• Gameplay changes in UVHM: • Enemy health generally increased 4x.</p>
<p>• Enemies now have a moderate amount of health regeneration.</p>
<p>• Increased duration of slag damage multiplier effect.</p>
<p>• Upped the damage that slagged enemies take from 2x to 3x.</p>
<p>• Weapon swap speed increased to better facilitate slag use.</p>
<p>• Enemies now more likely to drop ammo.</p>
<p>• Loot Midgets are now "Legendary Loot Midgets" that can drop Legendary and other top-tier gear.</p>
<p>Check back Monday for details on the various bug fixes in Tuesday's update, and don't forget there's
</p>
<p>more to come for Borderlands 2: Krieg the Psycho, a new playable character, arrives in May with the
</p>
<p>fourth campaign add-on (included in the Season Pass) hitting by the end of June!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 - i5 256gb - High CPU usage during idle. Corrupted audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stashco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - i5 256gb - High CPU usage during idle. Corrupted audio driver. Choppy audio sound. Noticeable lag delay. Fan constantly running. Major heating.</h2>
                    <p>(I purchased the device August 1, 2014. Up until now it has performed flawlessly). I started having problems yesterday.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I woke my device from sleep like I do every morning. The fan turned on about two minutes later while the device was idle. This was strange, as no programs were running (updates, antimalware scans, etc). In fact, I have noticed that the fan rarely turns on
 unless I have many different programs running at the same time. In the next several minutes, the fan became even louder and started working even faster. I tried to open Word, and some other basic programs, but everything became very slow and there was a noticeable
 delay in opening basic applications. The entire device felt very unresponsive. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I looked through the task manager to see what was causing this. These two processes were exceptionally active:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. <strong>System</strong> (~14% CPU Usage) which is ntoskrnl.exe<br />
</p>
<p>2. <strong>System Interrupts</strong> (~5% CPU Usage) <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>These two processes have never consumed this much CPU during the time I have owned this device. This was new to me.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While trying to watch YouTube videos, I noticed the audio became very choppy/broken. At times, the audio was out of sync with the video. So I decided to look through the drivers to make sure there were no problems. You will see below that for some reason,
 there are two High Definition Audio Controller drivers listed. One is corrupted. The other one is not.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1442b949-ec15-4d7f-8540-882754015254" /><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked for the latest driver updates: they are up to date. When I manually uninstall both drivers and reinstall the audio driver from Microsoft's website, the driver functions. After several minutes, the driver is listed twice again as you can see
 in the picture above, with one functioning and one corrupted driver. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have kept my Surface Pro 3 up to date by installing Windows Updates when they are released. I have run anti-malware/rootkit software; my system is clean. I have cleaned the registry. Nothing has helped so far.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have restarted the device multiple times, but the problem persists. I have shut it down for several hours, only to boot to the same issue.&nbsp; I have not installed any new software recently. I have been using the device the same way since day one.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Here are the issues summarized below:</span><br />
</p>
<p>1. The processes <strong>System </strong>and <strong>System Interrupts</strong> are using a significant portion of the CPU. This can occur anywhere from several minutes to an hour or two. The fan works exceptionally fast, and the device gets very hot. Using
 the device to actually edit documents, watch videos, etc. becomes difficult. The entire device begins to lag while performing basic functions, and is severely slowed down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. A High Definition Audio Controller Driver is corrupted. I imagine this is causing the audio to be choppy when listening to music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The device takes much longer to reboot. And while trying to reboot, the reboot is sometimes interrupted by a "programs still running" message, indicating that program
<strong>System</strong> is still running. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. While watching a YouTube video, the processes <strong>System</strong> jumps to 20% CPU usage and the fan immediately turns on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>====================Update (next day): </strong><strong>=====================</strong><strong>===========</strong></p>
<p>Decided to chat with support. I was supposed to get a call after restarting my computer because the Windows Update Troubleshooter "fixed" some errors, but they never called back to confirm if the issue was fixed.<strong> It is not.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is a screen shot of the audio issue:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c528e09-c8fe-41e3-b1bf-d2a3dcf5025b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I also noticed something interesting in my update history (marked in Red):</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56ece38d-6188-4282-ae78-81dcc14573d9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see that some of the 9/9/2014 updates are "pending restart from installation". I have restarted my device many times since then, so I assume this is some type of update problem because the updates are not installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter found here: </p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the results(2 pages):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d3ff0a5-bcba-4b4c-9a37-f94f3c54e74f" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a781917-238e-4f2d-b034-7be549c8ebaa" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update Trouble Shooter said the issues were fixed. So I restarted my computer to see if the updates would install properly. All but one of the updates are now listed as installed. No matter how many times I restart my computer, the "9.9.2014
 system hardware update" is still pending restart from installation. In addition, if I run the Windows Update Trouble Shooter again, It finds the same issues and tells me that they have been fixed. So I don't think they are being fixed. If they are, I guess
 restarting the device reintroduces these problems somehow. </p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>The device got so warm today I decided to shut it down. The fan came on for a while after I shut the device down. Then I heard a quick and quiet clicking noise near the top vent area, which disappeared when I turned the device on again. I really think this
 issue is affecting not only the software, but the hardware components itself; the device cannot continue to operate while it is overheating randomly throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using any SD cards. I do not have any external storage devices connected to my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am extremely frustrated. The device is unresponsive and slow most of the time I try to use it. Where is support when you need it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Just as I was about to</strong> submit this update, I noticed that fan speed slowed down significantly. The device has "normalized" and feels more responsive. Also, the audio driver is now functional? What is going on???
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device still lags significantly while playing YouTube videos. The audio is still choppy.
</p>

After reviewing your case, I have determined that that there are no hardware defects on the Surface. I am moving your case from the Surface to the Windows Community Forums so that the issues you are experiencing would be better addressed.</p>

            <p>Hey mate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad I stumbled across this as your not the only one. I have the sp3 i7 and since I updated to the latest hardware update my fan has been running hot. I never had an issue prior to the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran that trouble-shooter and I also got the same issues. Clearly there is an issue with the most recent firmware update and I would strongly suggest that no one updates to it if they are not experiencing any issues until MS fix it.</p>

            <p>An update:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. My battery life has been reduced noticeably. The fan is still noisy, but not operating at its maximum like it used to.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. The audio is still choppy/interrupted. I have recorded a <a href="http://bayareasocial.com/Audio.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>short audio clip</strong></a> from a random YouTube video. You can hear the distortion in the sound as it is played directly from the surface pro speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. There was a System Hardware Update released today. I downloaded it and installed it. This update did not fix the audio issue (increased fan speed and disrupted audio while playing YouTube videos). However, the fan seems to be quiet now when I'm not doing
 anything on the device. The processes system and system interruption aren't hogging as much CPU anymore.

</p><p>You will see below that the System Hardware Update from 9/9/2014 is still "pending restart" After running the windows trouble shooter and restarting multiple times, I've given up trying to figure out how to install the update. Resetting/Restoring my device
 is not an option at this point and time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/input from the Microsoft Support Team would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is becoming<strong> very</strong> bothersome. It comes when I actually use the device, and goes when I'm not using it. Today I only got about 2 hours of good, uninterrupted use from the device with a quiet fan. The other 8 hours, including right
 now, make it seem like the device is ready to explode with how fast the fan is running, how slow the device is, and how unresponsive it is. The "System" Process is back! Along with System Interrupts. I cannot multitask at all when the System processing is
 using ~30% of my CPU. I have noticed that it starts using a lot of CPU when I browse, use programs such as Bitlord, Adobe, etc. This is not normal, and never occurred before.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>I ran the windows update trouble shooter again just to reinforce that my problems are NOT being fixed. What's the point of having a troubleshooter that keeps identifying the same issues, marking them as fixed, but not really fixing them??</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b466096f-b765-4bb9-bf77-d18d901e23b6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have turned off the TPM module/Bitlocker encryption. That didn't help. I have uninstalled my antimalware program just in case that was causing the issue. That didn't help. I uninstalled the Skype Tile App, as it was randomly using a large amount of CPU
 when I wasn't using it, but that didn't help either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to add that my WiFi strength has dropped by half. Nothing has changed on my end (router settings, distance to router, provider settings etc). WiFi connectivity always used to displayed as full 5 bar strength, now only 3 bars.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>What is the point of me updating this post if I am getting no feedback from support at all? If things continue this way, I will be requesting a full refund. The device is clearly malfunctioning.

            <p><strong>Final Update:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the latest series of updates that were released yesterday, as can be seen below:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/750a7358-5019-4ccb-b603-70b6e2e5e5ab" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I</strong> restarted the device several times after updating to ensure that the updates were installed properly. It seems like the processes
<em>System</em> and <em>System Interrupts</em> aren't hogging my cpu anymore, so that's nice. The fan has become noticeably quiet, but there at still random times ( 2-3 times a day) when the fan operates really fast for 30 minutes to an hour (when I'm not doing
 anything intensive at all - simply looking at PDF slides, for example). I will include a video link below so you can actually see the CPU usage and hear how fast the fan is running. I also want to make it clear that the fan never ran this fast before under
 these conditions. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Overall,</strong> I have noticed that when waking the device from sleep, it is very slow and sluggish. Only a restart clears this issue. I don't know how to describe it other than the device simply lags in performing basic tasks, such as opening
 programs, using the windows built in search feature, and performing basic tasks in general. Infrequently, the WiFi drops. Simply put, the device does not operate and respond like it used to before all of this started, which leads me to believe that there is
 still a problem somewhere in the software, or software-hardware compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also included a video showing a Windows Error reporting screen that came up yesterday (reporting multiple hardware errors). Hopefully it helps Microsoft figure out what's wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ultimately</strong>, I have decided that I will be returning this device sometime later this month, when my schedule permits me to make the necessary arrangements to go back to the store. Microsoft is definitely onto something with the Surface Pro
 3, but I feel like that time isn't here yet, especially when <em>Microsoft Support continually ignores my repeated attempts to get help</em>. What I thought was one of my best purchases this year, has slowly turned into a disappointing experience; hopefully
 the Surface Pro 4 can rekindle my interest in this device. </p>

            <p>In my previous post, I mentioned that it would be my final update - however things just keep getting worse, so I've continued to document the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Another Blue Screen of Death. Great.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. After shutting down the device completely today, it would not boot up for a good 3 minutes no matter how many times I pressed the power button/ or how long I held it down for. Not good at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have noticed that the new updates from 10/14/14 have made the device even worse in terms of actual usability. The only time the device is responsive is when it is restarted and has not been in sleep mode. If you wake the device from sleep it is nearly
 impossible to use. Significant lag. Everything is so slow, it's really sad -&nbsp; no idea what's going on. Frustrating.</p>

<h2>            Logon script run at system resume or &#34;switch user&#34; event</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to introduce some automation into my home computer environment. &nbsp;I've setup logon scripts using local group policy, but that only works if people actually log on and off.... &nbsp;mostly the computers just go to sleep, so when someone wants to use
 one they resume if from sleep, or hibernation, and reconnect to their existing logged on session. &nbsp;Is there a way trigger a script at that time? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried using Task Scheduler with a trigger of "on connection to user session" but I can't figure out a way to run the scheduled job as the user who just reconnected to their session (I guess short of defining the same job for each member of the family
 on every computer, which would be tedious).</p>
<p>Anyone got any bright ideas? &nbsp;For starters, my main aim is to record when the kids connect or disconnect from the computers.</p>
<p>R.</p>

            <p>You have 30 days to rollback to your previous version:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens to my previous operating system when I upgrade to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 replaces your previous version of Windows by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Windows 10 becomes the default operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall Windows 10 if I do not like it or something goes wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can see the following: <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back t

<h2>            Genuine&#47;fake windows verification &#38; past licese recovery without receipt</h2>
                    <p>My brother bought me a brand new HP last year. I received it with receipt &amp; box. It was brand new. I had a pre installed windows 9 from manufacturer, along with genuine office suite, adobe suite, and several other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few months ago I accidentally drop my pc. Obviously, my hard drive died, during my final exams period. I freaked out and went directly to an independent repair shop. The guy tried everything he could to recover my data, but couldn't do 100%. He said he could
 reinstall windows but not the same as i had before. That for that i would need to make the repairs directly at a HP service center, following confirmation of my laptop origin.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find my PC's receipt so I agreed, thinking I would get in touch with HP later to get my original license back. I was still on the warranty, but here in Thailand repair shop are really cheap so it didn't really bothered me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally forgot to contact HP &amp; really&nbsp; cannot think of a way to recover my previous program keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The guy told me to not update or enable windows update, which is in my opinion because it might be a copy...</p>
<p>However, I've often used in the past, pc with fake copy, and there were significant differences. This time, i really cannot tell. I'm able to download and install everything I need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to upgrade to newer version of windows. I also feel that i would soon be in need of a formatting, new drive or new pc. Or at least a good maintenance, cleanup and security update. (I know, but i use it a lot for work, school, etcc and i tend
 to be rough with my laptops)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, i need to know if my key is valid before initiating any of these actions. I don't want to run windows updates and then be blocked/flagued. It would really not be convenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats bugging me is that I look at the system info and everything looks normal&nbsp;</p>
<p>System info i see:</p>
<p>8.1 pro 2013 Microsoft corporation.. All right reserved.</p>
<p>operating system 64bits</p>
<p>Windows activation - windows is activated - Product ID : 00261-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have then run a tools to find the system info and it confirm what is shown in control panel. See below:</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 Pro<br />
Product Part No.: [Blue]X18<br />
Installed from 'Volume' media.<br />
Product ID: 00261-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX&nbsp; match to CD Key data<br />
CD Key: GCRJD-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX<br />
Computer Name: U&nbsp; / Registered Owner: Pro / Registered Organization:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to be able to plan if I need another PC, solve this one or if I switch to MAC here are my questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Is there a way i can verify the status of my actual key?</p>
<p>2 - Should I run the windows update anyway, trusting the system info?</p>
<p>3 - How can I recover my previous license after that long, without a receipt &amp; the shop where it was bought?
</p>
<p>4 - Is there a way to find it using my Microsoft ID used as admin and for all pc settup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks you for a any answers</p>

</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Run as administrator&#34; not working with SP1.</h2>
                    I have upgraded several of my laptops to SP1.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The users on these laptops are set as standard users, in the past when they want to install something and I was on their laptop I just ran the application by using "Run as administrator". This allowed me to run the install file and install the application
 no problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I have SP1 the "Run as administrator" does nothing apart from tell me that I need to be logged on as an administrator.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anything I can do to get the "Run as administrator" working again??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

    <title>BSOD when playing video games - After Fall creator Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolas-andr&#233;lefebvre  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD when playing video games - After Fall creator Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm currently having major issues while playing games on my HP Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop as an integrated IntelHd Graphic and a Nvidia 840m, and since i've updated to the Fall creator Update, i'm having issues on varied video games after 20-30 min of playing or earlier and always at random,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's what i've done / found so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The BSOD doesnt come from the games, i've tried 4 différent of them, but it only appears with 3d games that have sometimes small tearing, still having it;</p>
<p>-The BSOD usually comes after a small video tearing, the screen freezes, the sound and the rest of the computer runs fine for 5 sec before crashing entirely, i was doing a skype call and i could still hear the voice from my speaker.</p>
<p>-The BSOD appears only in 3d rendering, i'm not having the issue with the intel</p>
<p>-Updating or changing nvidia display driver doesnt change anything so far</p>
<p>-Rolling back the update solved the solution but the update reinstalled itself and the problem was here again, so not really a solution especially when it deletes everything you installed after the update.</p>
<p>-I'm having the issue even when AVG antivirus is deactivated</p>
<p>-I uninstalled Daemon Tools Pro, didnt changed&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The BSOD appears 1 time out of 4, and only in-game, in most of the case once the computer as been rebooted the problem is gone temporarly</p>
<p>-No result after an Sfc Scannow</p>
<p>-Not related to internal temperature, did a stress test for 1h30 and the laptop stayed at the same temperature but not over ~72°C</p>
<p>-The BSOD has only two or three different title "Video_Tdr_Failure" or "Unexpected_Kernel_Mode_Trap"</p>
<p>-After a Blue screen log file check here's what i have:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Bug Check Code:&nbsp;0x00000116</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Bug Check String: Video_TDR_Error</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Parameter 1-2-3-4:&nbsp;0xFFFFD4065C9F0440&nbsp; - &nbsp;0xFFFFF804F468A084&nbsp; - &nbsp;0xFFFFFFFFC000009A&nbsp; - &nbsp;0x0000000000000004</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Crash Source:&nbsp;dxgkrnl.sys+1ACBA0&nbsp; Path:&nbsp;C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\dxgkrnl.sys&nbsp; Version:&nbsp;10.0.16299.98</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I havent try to reinstall Direct X 10 but i dont think we can...,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first conclusion so far is that there is a problem between Nvidia Driver and the latest Direct X and it needs to be updated but i'm not sure, might also be related to different new programs like the "Xbox game boost thing" or some other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know what to do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw dont ask me to do any kind of Reset on my laptop because i have way too many data and programs for my work so this wont be an option, and it wont solve anything it will (probably) just erase the problem not solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: Checked on DXdiag and usually both the Nvidia and the Intel are here, and now there is only the Intel Hd Graphic, might be related?</p>
<p>Edit 2: Nevermind in the "render" section the Nvidia 840m is here</p>

            Hi Nicolas,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the display driver after the update is one of the possible reasons why you are having a blue screen error with the bug check code: 0x00000116. Since you have tried to rollback the driver and it resolved the issue, we suggest that you to temporarily
 prevent a driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10. To do this, you will need to download the
<strong>"Show or hide updates" troubleshooter </strong>that can be found in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, and follow the instruction to hide the problematic driver update.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.

<p>Hi, apparently the problem as become more important because even when i roll back to previous nvidia drivers it still cause a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried recently again removing the display driver and reinstalling different version like a dozen time and it still doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it mostly happend after a 3d game had been played once, like i can play one game of war thunder for example and then play an other game and it will crash in the following minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the power config to high perfomance on windows and in the nvidia control panel "only" causes the games to crash and not the whole computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it's really annoying.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So after 2 weeks i thought that this story would be over, but apparently not,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after you replied to me i tried to use DDU (display driver uninstaller) which removes and clean the driver...</p>
<p>It worked "fine" for the following weeks, and by "fine" i mean that i could play 30 min to an hour and a half without crashing or having a BSOD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that i'm also working i didnt played with my laptop this week, but since yesterday my case is worse than before, some games doesnt even start up, they just load then crash the whole pc entirely, some are working fine for 20-30 seconds then randomly
 crashes as soon as i click somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After further analysis the dump file says that it's either related to the nvidia driver (<span>nvlddmkm.sys)
</span><span>or to the direct X kernel (</span><span>dxgkrnl.sys+1ACBA0)
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to admit that this problem doesnt occur on 3d rendering program that dont work with direct X.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Still dunno what to do..., on the other hand the pc runs fine no problem with Edge, Ableton Live, Photoshop, After Effect, etc...</span></p>
<p><span>But as soon as i start up a video game i get a BSOD.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Might also be related to the Intel Graphic card making conflict with the Nvidia...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>After a series of test i finally managed to get closer to the source of the problem:</p>
<p>Using Memory stress test there isnt any result but using Uniengine benchmark i've managed to switch between DX 9/10/11/ Open Gl and between the Intel and Nvidia Gpu, the crash always after around 30sec with the Nvidia Graphic Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will continue to work on this idea ^^</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far i'm still using an HP 17-067nf</p>
<p>I tried to install the manufacturer driver, it didnt worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>after 4 hours i managed to try a dozen of previous version of the nvidia display driver and running some tests, i rolled it back to the 3.78.32 which (so far) and it hasnt resulted in blue screen, the only issue is some freezing after 3-4 hours of run with
 a benchmarking software, considering that i'm not playing that long i'm considering this problem as solved for the moment.</p>
<p>It would be nice if in the near future i didnt get new bsod ^^</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Allen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But unfortunately I had already tried all of the solutions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps coming back to send code option, when I put my number in, it states "Usage limit exceeded. Try again tomorrow."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account recovery option failed as it claimed the skype name was invalid (not sure on that one!) it's the same format we have used with other users.</p>

</p><p>So I'm still stuck, plus one annoyed manager who wants their team members account unlocked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

    <title>Bad Image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakeb208  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad Image</h2>
                    I am currently in a crisis, yesterday my computer crashed. After rebooting it I was met with a "bad image" error (error code 0xc0000020).<br />
<br />
The Problem: From what I've read, it looks like most people that experience a Bad Image are able to still operate their computers, I am unable to do anything at all, aside from using my keyboard to hit enter on the "ok" option of the error at which point I
 seen another error behind that about my Samsung Wizard program being unable to launch. The whole screen is gray and occasionally it will flicker back to my actual desktop(I can see my desktop background and all programs) for about 2-5 sec and it goes back
 to gray for a while and repeats. I am still unable to do anything at all, aside from hitting "ok" on the Bad image message that keeps presenting itself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
About 20% of the time after a reboot it launches the troubleshooting environment with a message: "it looks like windows didn't load correctly." With the option to "restart" or "see advanced repair options." I proceed to the advanced options within trouble shoot
 and have tried various actions but nothing works. I've even tried to reinstall the last windows update from a flash drive but that does nothing, unless I am performing that wrong.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried to reset this pc with keeping my files, but no luck yet again. The only thing I haven't tried is to fully reset the pc which I really don't want to lose all of my files on that hard drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do, please help I need to solve this as fast as possible.<br />

            <p>Guessing you have no backups?</p>
<p>(May want to correct that if/when you get everything working again. &nbsp;It's less expensive than you might think to get an external drive large enough and far less stressful than being in a situation like... you are in now.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might be able to utilize a Linux Live CD / USB Stick to copy your files off your computer if you cannot boot into any modes and copy things off otherwise. &nbsp;You might, as an alternative to learning how to make a Linux Live boot media, use a WIndows installation
 media to do something similar:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need an external USB drive connected to the system (other than the one you are booting from, unless that one happens to be large enough to get all the stuff important to you off the hard drive) to copy to...</p>

            <p>Hey there CookedGiraffe54,</p><p><br /></p><p>The quickest way would be to exchange it with the retailer, but if that's not an option you can setup a repair online through the online service center <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>. After you register the console, you'll be able to setup an accessory for repair.</p>

            <p>yeah, you can call m$, they get it all set up for you to get the controller replaced.....and notify you that You are responsible for the shipping cost. Unacceptable. Period.</p>
