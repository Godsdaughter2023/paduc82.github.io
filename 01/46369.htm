            The most recent (June 2013) Java update has caused this problem to begin occurring again in my Internet Explorer 9. When I encountered this problem during a previous Java update earlier this year, I managed to solve it by disabling Java add-ons, as others
 have suggested. <br />
<br />
I just tried the same solution again and it solved the problem again. Here is the solution I used:
<br />
<br />
Follow Tadasha Mithra's instructions (see above) under 'Method 2' through stages a-c, but instead of stages d-e, I had to do the following instead:
<br />
<br />
d: <span>In Internet Explorer, go to <b>Tools</b>, select
<b>Manage Add-ons</b>. A window should pop up listing your add-ons. In the 'Show' drop-down box, select 'all add-ons'. The list of add-ons in the right-hand pane will reload.&nbsp;
<br />
e: Scroll down the list until you get to the items listed under 'Oracle, America, Inc.'.
<b>Right-click</b> on each of the items there and select <b>'Disable'</b>.<br />
<br />
The only way I could fix this in my IE9 was by disabling <i>all </i>Java-related add-ons (i.e. by setting everything that was listed under 'Oracle, America, Inc.' to 'disabled'). But I am not very teccy so you may be able to solve the problem by only disabling
 some of them. </span><br />
<br />
If you're concerned about whether to disable this, you might want to see these two pages which discuss what Java SSV helper does and whether it is needed:

<p><span>Hi Tusitha,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for joining us again with your response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the particular problem I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you go through the link to disable add ons and check. Here is the link for your reference.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click <b>Start</b>, select
<b>All Programs</b>, and right-click <b>Internet Explorer</b>.</span></p>

<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click Allow in the
<b>User Account Dialog</b> box</span></p>

<b>Tools</b>, select <b>Manage Add-ons</b>, and then select <b>Enable or</b> <b>Disable Add-ons</b>.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might be facing the above issue due to incompatibility of the game with Windows 10 operating system on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist, did you try installing the game in compatibility mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the manufacturer has confirmed that the game is incompatible with Windows 10 OS, check if installing the game in
<strong>Compatibility mode</strong> works on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Compatibility mode</span></strong><span> runs the program in the current version of Windows using the settings from previous version
 of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Install the device drivers manually in
<strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Locate and <strong>
right-click</strong> on the game setup file downloaded/saved on the computer and select
<strong>Properties</strong><span> from the context menu</span>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>
compatibility </strong>tab, check the box <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>, select
<strong>Windows&nbsp;8.1/7</strong> operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.
</span></li><li><span>After the installation is complete,
<strong>restart</strong> the computer and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You can also follow the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard and type <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the top most search result and follow from
<strong>step 2</strong> from the article </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Make older

<h2>            Intel HD Graphics Drivers 10.18.15.4256</h2>
                    Every since installing Windows 10, my display driver is shut down with a message that Windows has discovered a problem with this device. &nbsp;I have to manually go to Intel HD graphics Installer and download the proper driver. &nbsp;Then it works until the next
 up date and I have to do it all over again. &nbsp;I can not install a newer driver--nor update it. &nbsp;Is there a way just to keep the driver that is working without it constantly updating or does Windows 10 have a solution? &nbsp;Overall I like Windows 10 and do not desire
 to resort back to Windows 8. &nbsp;Very frustrated! &nbsp;HELP!

<p>Hello Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having run into some similar issues myself I may have a possible work around.</p>
<p>If I understand you correctly you have a working Windows 8/8.1 Intel graphics driver.</p>
<p>To "pin" or "freeze" your device driver you can tell Windows to not update device drivers.</p>
<p>By default Windows 10 will search Windows updates for device driver patches which it sounds like is happening to you and the Windows 10 driver is running into trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try this out you can do so by going here: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00ac6566-e165-4ec1-a27d-16da12f87248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00ac6566-e165-4ec1-a27d-16da12f87248" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do that you should see the following window appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c30f189-f9ac-47f3-8beb-5e602ac20458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c30f189-f9ac-47f3-8beb-5e602ac20458" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will want to change the "yes" to a "no" and click "save changes".</p>
<p>If you are able to do this it will change Windows update's behavior such that it will no longer download and install device driver updates.</p>
<p>After doing that go ahead and install the legacy driver again and now it shouldn't be replaced by Windows update any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar issue in that an older Intel graphics driver works but the "Windows 10 version" has problems.</p>
<p>I was forced to "pin" the driver to a legacy version at least until a fix is deployed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Timothy Thomasson</p>

<h2>            Playing AIFF files in windows media player</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to play some AIFF files in windows media player. I get the following error mesage " Windows media player cannot play file. The player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file".</p>
<p>As WMP supports AIFF files i am assuming it is an issue with the codec.</p>
<p>Is there a solution out there&nbsp;so i can play the files ?</p>
<p>cheers, Matt.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, it should be an issue with the codec’s.<span>Search for appropriate audio codec’s using your preferred search engine and

<p>Where do the files come from? Are you sure that they're in the AIFF format?</p>
<p>You can try installing&nbsp; <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/ffdshow.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FFDShow</a> . If that doesn't help, please open a few of the files in&nbsp; <a href="http://www.headbands.com/gspot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
GSpot</a> , this program will report the audio codec that's used in the file. Then, you can report that codec back here.</p>

If you reinstalled Windows without entering a product key - a keyfinder will not find a usable key.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
<span>If you have a lost or unreadable product key for Microsoft software that came with your computer, please contact the manufacturer of your computer to obtain a replacement. Contact information for the manufacturer
 of your computer can be found here: </span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemphone/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
If you have lost a product key for software that you purchased separately from your computer, or if your product key is not working, please call Microsoft.
</span><span>To locate the appropriate telephone number, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS</span></a></p>

<span>If you bought a computer with Windows preinstalled there should be a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer, on some laptops it’s in the battery bay. It will
 have a 25 character alphanumeric code on it - that is your product key. If it's not on your computer look in your paperwork or on any CD/DVD cases that were included with the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought a retail copy of Windows 7 the key should be included in the box.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought Windows 7 online and downloaded it the key should have been sent to you through email. If you bought from the MS Store you can log in to your account to view your key.</span></p>

            Hi VinodKumar321 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Reset PC doesn't affect files in other drives. You will be given the option to keep your files which will keep the files in current drive if you select.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Vinod
<br />
<br />Rest assured a Windows Reset will not affect files on another drive . .. 
<br />
<br />It is only a manufacturers factory reset that affects all drives . . 
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            The best place to get the answer to this question would be MSDN forum for Windows Desktop Development. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to MSDN forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and MSDN. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrader language issue &#40;Machine bricked&#63;&#41; HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My windows 8.1 tablet have been bugging me to upgrade to win10 so I followed the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows was set up as US English in the different language settings but I also installed a Danish keyboard since I write in Danish sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it reboots the upgrader comes up. The touch screen is completely random and useless and it looks like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am about ready to put my tablet in the bin. But before I trash it. Is there any way to salvage the tablet? .. or at least salvage something from it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only had the tablet for 2 weeks before I agreed to the ruin your tablet popup window.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much Greg for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that the up-grader is working as it should. And I am guessing that it is requiring me to make some kind of choices or give some kind of input to complete the install/upgrade. I might be wrong.</p>
<p>But in any case. Even if it is the case I am clearly not qualified or even able to do those things.</p>
<p>First I got it to show another screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f953a95e-2a67-4486-9774-117d0dc3e7c4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But now it will only show this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/496f0d81-7117-43ed-8087-d18b2d5d08a2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone who have tried the windows 10 up-grader before might be able to recognize the screens but I have no experience with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess that is what I get for choosing the cheaper tablet. But it had the better, sharp and natural looking IPS screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>-Jack</p>

            <p>Yea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a mouse and keyboard I did of course use the ENG button which opens up what seems to be a an input language selection. I can switch between ENG (English US) and DAN (Danish) .. No effect whatever I chose.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Figured out it was Chinese So I enlisted the help of a Chinese guy. We finished the upgrade and got windows 10.</p>
<p>In Windows 10 he explained clearly what he was doing. Going into settings &gt; Language &gt; English US &gt; Had to download language pack (which took a LONG time) &gt; Setting the English US language pack to default &gt; logging out and in &gt; Trying restarting computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing. There was no Chinese language pack installed and no Chinese anything selected anywhere. We have no idea where windows 10 got this idea about Chinese from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways all this fiddling about we only managed to get a half English half Chinese windows which I can't really live with. So we downgraded to windows 8.1 again. It went okay even though basically ALL touch interface apps were gone. all the icons on the
 touch interface are now empty squares. I was warned that some apps might be gone however :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 8.1 I checked and changed every tiny language setting I could find to English.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ff3011d-b399-4407-b301-e68170c8b892" /></p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55e2fd43-fc4d-499d-bb21-fb8b48bacbda" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually the Welcome screen input language was set to Chinese simplified. I thought that might have been the reason why the windows 10 update would be Chinese. So after double checking everything .. Disk cleanup .. deleting all temporary files, Downloads,
 Backups and installed apps .. I chose to try to upgrade to windows 10 again. This time it took all night to download.</p>
<p>Next day I upgraded. Same result. All Chinese. I hired the Chinese guy again. But this time doing the whole Going into settings &gt; Language &gt; English US &gt; Had to download language pack (which took a LONG time) &gt; Setting the English US language pack to default
 &gt; logging out and in &gt; Trying restarting computer. Did not do anything.</p>
<p>We tried other languages .. English UK .. Danish ... All kinds of other languages. Guess windows 10 is just a stubborn old Chinese guy that refuses to learn new ways :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways. Doubt I can blame the hardware for any of this :P</p>

</p><p>Your hardware is not all that's covered by warranty.&nbsp; You should have unlimited tech support for the first year to resolve problems like this.&nbsp; I would call them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way Chinese should be on a tablet bought in the US or Denmark.&nbsp; It has made your Upgrade useless so I would ask them to reimage the tablet with the correct language version or help you correctly Upgrade.</p>

                    <p>Hi I know this is seemingly a no-brainer, idiotic question with an obvious solution but wait-I am not a</p>
<p>complete moron. I have already done all the change screen resolution troubleshooters, and checked settings
</p>
<p>for&nbsp;the "Display".&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;have updated all drivers, checked compatibility, etc. Basically, I have tried everything I can think of&nbsp;</p>
<p>and still the image of my desktop extended onto my 37" Sceptre flat screen tv is&nbsp;not placed correctly/sized right.&nbsp; I can't</p>
<p>see the entire desktop (as&nbsp;it appearson my laptop screen).&nbsp; The entire image is set over too far to the right (facing&nbsp;tv),
</p>
<p>leaving a 3' black&nbsp;area to the left side&nbsp;that is unaccessable to my curser.&nbsp; Window&nbsp;size when on internet is too big so</p>
<p>as to access&nbsp;menu items. Window is stretched too&nbsp;long in width and too short&nbsp;in length;&nbsp;content is not distorted.&nbsp;&nbsp;One</p>
<p>monitor only-when identified, the&nbsp;1 appears on both screens.&nbsp;1 is the primary monitor. Its driving me crazy-this is
</p>
<p>something I should have been able to adjust myself, but I give&nbsp;up. Any help would be appreciated much.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Latest stable build of Windows 10 64bit</h2>
                    <p>Hey dear all,</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 64 bit installed on my PC. I am an Insider (Windows insider). The installed version is Windows 10 Creators Update 15063. I am not interested anymore to be a part of the Insider Program, not at least for a while. I want the most stable and
 the latest build of Windows 10. Please lead me to it.</p>

<p>The current version of the 64 bit build is 15063.332.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, other than possibly the most recent update (2017-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4020102)), that I got on 25 May, you're there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that's left for you to do is to set your system to stop looking for insider builds if you haven't already done so.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t take screenshot with print screen anymore</h2>
                    Hi, I used to always take screenshots with the shortcut windows+PrtScn but now the shortcut isn't working. I tried also using windows+shift+s to take a screenshot of part of the screen it worked like normal except when I selected an area it didn't take
 a screenshot. I have also tried using fn+windows+PrtScn but it turns my computer on airplane mode and when I press it again it turns it off airplane mode and my screen goes black, and only turns back on when I shut the lid of my computer and reopen it or press
 the power button twice. All the websites say if your on a laptop to use fn+windows+PrtScn, but before windows+PrtScn worked just fine, and the other one would just turn it on airplane mode. I also have seen that having certain photo apps open interferes with
 it, and I have none open and have uninstalled onedrive and it still won't work. Is there any way to fix it so I can use the shortcut again?

</p><p>Windows current editions have a newish app 'Snip &amp; Sketch'</p>
<p>On my laptop I simply press the&nbsp; Print/Screen key, then I can stretch to size or do full screen with a click to the menu bar.&nbsp; Then a little procedure to save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My various other key combo's to print/screen seem to do nothing now, only the single prn/scrn key press works with that Snip &amp; Sketch app, or so it seems - may have other tricks but I've not discovered them as of yet</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Microsoft Solitaire Collection - Buggy, Crashes, and Resets Stats and Challenges</p>
<p>I'm having a terrible time with the Solitaire Collection for Windows 8. It frequently crashes, and now, for the second time THIS MONTH, it has reset my "Daily Challenges" to zero and wiped out all my achievements and coins. Oddly, when I go back to try to
 do them over, it says I've already done the challenge once, so I can't even re-earn the coins I lost!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but it hasn't helped... nothing changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, if I click on a game or challenge, the app will just shut down and take me to my Windows Start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm <strong>very</strong> disappointed with this buggy card game collection. I wish I could just have my Windows 7 card games back. :(</p>

            <p>1. The issue is <em>only</em> with this app. I also have Microsoft's Minesweeper and Microsoft Mahjong, both of which are similar programs, but neither of which have these same issues.</p>
<p>2. No, the only change I've made recently is to upgrade Win 7 to Win 8. This was one of the first apps I installed. I haven't had any other problems other than this program being glitch. To be fair, all you have to do is read the reviews on the app store
 to see I'm not the only one with these issues, so to imply it's my fault is a little silly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>METHOD 1:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1 - didn't tell me anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 - I ran the SFC program, and it did seem to make some changes. I got a notice afterwards that read:
<em>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log.
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to this log file, and it was VERY long and full of stuff I didn't quite understand. I can provide the entire thing, but I didn't like to paste it here simply because of the length. The file contained things like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>METHOD 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through the troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Update the app&nbsp; - it was up to date</p>
<p>2. Sync the license - I went through the steps and not sure if anything changed. But considering this is a free app, I'm not sure this would be an issue. Doesn't quite makes sense.</p>
<p>3. Contact the developer - Um, that's what I'm trying to do here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing all of the things above, I restarted the app, and interestingly, my "second attempt" results had been restored. (My first attempt to use the Daily Challenges had been wiped out, so I tried again. When those "second attempt" results were lost,
 I didn't really make a "third attempt", but everything was reset to zero. The "second attempt" results are still messed up, because like the other poster in this thread, I have days in the&nbsp;Daily Challenge&nbsp;where I've solved 7/5 games or 9/5 games, or even where
 I've solved all games, but it shows up as 0/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tells me something I did above did help, but I was only able to go back one step, to my "second attempt" games.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an image: <a href="http://www.indiadrummond.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/microsoft-solitaire.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.indiadrummond.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/microsoft-solitaire.jpg</a>&nbsp;If I click on each day in the calendar, I see that I have blue ribbons on every game on the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th of the month, but they show up on the main screen as unsolved,
 I lost my coins for them, and I can't regain the coins because if I try to replay them, it shows up as "Already Solved".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to completely wipe this game from my computer, so I can start with a fresh install? I tried to delete the app, but it remembered my past results when I reinstalled, so it didn't give me a fresh start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not an ideal solution, but I'm not getting the impression you guys can actually fix my corrupt files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said above, I'm not the only one with this problem by far, so it's really not anything I've done wrong. Frankly, the game is just buggy. It's a shame Microsoft got something this basic so wrong with Windows 8. I imagine a LOT of people are going to
 be unhappy about this, especially since the old versions of card games&nbsp;aren't available on the new OS.</p>

            Happened to me too. Seems to be just the Solitaire app. <br />
<br />
I had all days in Nov completed and they have all been reset. Plus I have completed today's events twice now and when i quit and go back in, it says i'm 3/5 every time.<br />
<br />
Looks like Windows had downloaded an update and was waiting for me to reboot. Not sure if that has anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
Ran the App Troubleshooter. Results:<br />
1. Some security settings are missing or have been changed. - Detected<br />
2. Windows Resources Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Well, on top of this, I also had a problem where I couldn't install/download any Win 8 updates (according to the forums, there are many, many people with this problem, all of whom seemed to be upgraders from Win 7 to Win 8, and because my ATI HD video driver
 no longer supported OpenGL (something some of my favourite games require) after the "upgrade", I had to do a clean install of Win 7. So I don't even have this game collection anymore anyway. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm going to miss Win 8 and some of the games and features (Minesweeper Adventure Mode!!!), but frankly, it just wasn't ready for prime time. Now I've lost several days of my time to messing with buggy software, hunting for solutions, trying suggestions
 from MS people who just seem to be throwing them out by rote with no regard to follow-up and not really caring that they put out incredibly unstable or unusable software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very disappointed in my whole Win 8 experience. WIll try again maybe in a couple of years when I buy a new laptop. Going to be a while, though... this one is only 18 months old!</p>

            I have tried your suggestions -- several times, in fact -- and nothing seems to resolve the issue. I also have reinstalled Microsoft Solitaire Collection several times. I am only speculating here, but perhaps there is nothing actually "wrong" with the
 app. Could there possibly be some sort of compatibility issue with the Internet connection. Whatever the problem exists, I am disappointed Microsoft has not resolved this issue, or even noticed there was a problem during beta testing for Windows 8.

            For me, the problem is the Solitaire program cannot sign into Xbox Live.&nbsp; It continues to attempt to login.&nbsp; If I exit out of Solitaire and go to the Xbox app it logs in fine.&nbsp; If you can't log into Xbox Live in the Solitaire app it fails.&nbsp; I wish it didn't
 REQUIRE you to log into Xbox live.&nbsp; VERY disappointed with Windows 8.

            <p>Problems with lost progress on Daily Challenges, etc.&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp; known problem that Microsoft are working on&nbsp;some of the Microsoft game apps. Take a look at the relevant Xbox forums here:</p>

            <p>Same problem here with the Solitaire Collection. It started crashing on May 1st. Before that it was the Ultimate Word Games that quit working for almost two weeks. </p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Solitaire with no success as yet.

            <p>Same here ... After the current Win 10 Home update (1804) I am getting the same error message or 121010. When this happens the computer almost completely locks up (in reality it slows to a crawl). I tried uninstalling and reinstalling with the same results. Like you, it says I have no Internet connection, which is totally false.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I checked my FW and AV … even let Microsoft Solitaire pass uninhibited with the same results.</p><p><br /></p><p>Frustrating as MS says that the error codes are not valid yet they are produced as the example in this thread.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope that MS gets back to us</p>

            <p>When is Microsoft going to address this fault?&nbsp; I've been reading loads of complaints regarding this issue and some date back quite some time.&nbsp; This happens every time there's a Windows 10 update.&nbsp; For me, there is no error code - nothing.&nbsp; The blue start screen shows for a few seconds then it turns white (sometimes black) and then it just stays like that.&nbsp; I've uninstalled and reinstalled, reset the app and tried to see if there are other ways to access it, but to no avail.&nbsp; On the odd occasion&nbsp;that some geezer from the Microsoft helpdesk does decide to answer, the advice he or she gives is useless.&nbsp; When is Microsoft going to actually do something about this?&nbsp; Surely they must know how annoying this is to all of us who it has affected!&nbsp; It may be no big deal for them, but it is to us.&nbsp; Get your finger out Microsoft&nbsp;and fix this problem once and for all.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

It worked for a few days than another update that automatically updated on my computer made my game stop again. But after the April update it didn't play right.

<h2>            Windows Live Mail messages completely gone from all accounts and folders</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I apologize for any redundancy, but I've been searching the forum for a long time, and the info I found seems to apply to all kinds of different scenarios, but none with the same parameters as mine. &nbsp;So I'm posting my request for help for my specific situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue concerns Windows Live Mail on my desktop. (ISP is Earthlink, in case relevant) &nbsp;WLM has been working just fine. &nbsp;My husband, who is not computer savvy, was working on the computer earlier today. &nbsp;The WLM program was open but was minimized. He was
 looking at various websites on Chrome. &nbsp;When he was on my desktop after closing a site, a message window popped up saying something about 'unused disk space being recovered'. &nbsp;It seemed to occur automatically, i.e. he didn't activate it because he's afraid
 to do anything he doesn't know about. &nbsp;So he got off the computer at that point. &nbsp;A bit later, he opened WLM to check emails, and ALL (I mean, EVERY SINGLE ONE) of the messages that had been in the folders of our 4 accounts were GONE! &nbsp;All folders were still
 there, but they were all empty. It shows "there are no items in this view." &nbsp;However, my views are set for "all messages", and I hadn't changed any settings. &nbsp;I'm trying to figure out what happened, but I'm MAINLY trying to find where all of those emails went.
 &nbsp;I know that he could not have deleted the emails, because it would have meant deliberately deleting messages from multiple folders for 4 accounts. &nbsp;All of the folders are still intact and now have newer emails downloaded in them. &nbsp;Any suggestions as to what
 might have happened?. &nbsp;At this point, I'm hoping that the messages weren't DELETED by the program, but were moved to some other storage location in conjunction with the "unused disk space recovery" activity, and still exist somewhere for restoring to the active
 folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other issues:: &nbsp;My email was hacked a few weeks ago, but I changed my password prior to the disappearance of these emails, so I think this shouldn't be related to that. &nbsp;Also, I wondered if I might have gone over a message limit maximum, but even so, I can't
 believe that would wipe out all messages in all accounts across the board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any feedback or suggestions that you BRILLIANT experienced users can provide!</p>

<p>Windows Live Mail messages completely gone ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you&nbsp;confirmed that the missing folders or messages that were in them are no longer visible in Windows Live Mail? Make sure that
<em>Storage folders</em> is selected (highlighted) on the <em>View</em> tab.</p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Y to reveal the entire folder tree. Look for your missing folders and messages, possibly several layers deep under
<em>Recovered items </em>or inside another folder.</li><li>Use the <em>Search for a message</em> box to look for one of the missing messages. Use a search term in the
<em>Subject</em> or <em>From </em>fields for quickest results.</li></ul>
<p>When you've found them, leave the program running for an hour or two to see whether any of the messages find their way back into their proper folders. If they don't you can do it manually - select a batch of messages, then right-click on the selection and
 choose <em>Move to folder</em>. Take it gently to allow the program to index the moved messages before moving another batch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>Recovering unused disk space</em> message will only appear if the program has been closed down, so this must have happened inadvertently.&nbsp;It doesn't work very well, so it would be as well to disable it once you've recovered your messages.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your reply. &nbsp;I have now looked thoroughly in the storage folders and checked every layer there is. &nbsp;I did find a bunch of the missing messages for 2 of our 4 user accounts, but spread out among several storage folders. &nbsp;But I still have
 found none for my account. &nbsp;It now appears that most of my contacts are missing too. &nbsp; I've been researching and learning a lot throughout the day, so now have a little bit better idea of what I'm looking for. &nbsp;I followed one suggestion I found about going
 to the Windows Live Mail folder and choosing "restore previous version". &nbsp;I chose the 2nd most recent version which was from last week prior to having this trouble. &nbsp;I followed the steps on the screen, and even tried several times, but this has not worked
 because WLM still shows only current activity since the problem occurred. &nbsp;Any other thoughts you could share?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry, but another question. &nbsp;I have continued searching for messages, and have found some of mine which I swear weren't there earlier when I was looking. &nbsp;However, I'm not finding them in the folders within WLM when it is open, only in my C drive files.
 &nbsp;In trying to move them from there, I do not have the option of "move to folder" like I do when inside the open WLM program. I can send them to the desktop, but don't know how I would then move them into my WLM inbox. &nbsp;Any tips on how I could achieve that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again very, very much!</p>

<p>&nbsp;If the messages went missing as a result of the unusual shut-down and database compaction you described in your original question, then any recovered folders and messages will be in a folder named with the date and time of the incident that caused the recovery.
 Here's a typical set of recovered items:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic-dm2306.files.1drv.com%2fy2p1IpLxTWH8raM30m9jXSW7fSDHoj1mMyAGOqnXiPxQX3Y3mSbfliRC84_M1xbEvLUvnwOXkCo_8oIKcb7OE7ZTXs03UJNUB_xwG2feJqNkhk%2fWLMail-recovered-items.png%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>Is this what you mean by <em>spread out among several storage folders</em>?</p>

</p><p>If you have a previous version of the store folder (the one called by default Windows Live Mail) with the account folders and their messages in them, then you can recover the folders and messages. What procedure did you follow to recover the folders? The
 last stage would have been to <em>import</em> folders from a temporary location; the results will then be in a folder called
<em>Imported folders </em>under Storage folders in Windows Live Mail. Have you looked there?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is unrelated to the problem with missing messages and folders, but it might be related to the unusual shut-down. Are you normally signed in in Windows Live Mail, with a display name and possibly a profile picture showing at the right-hand end of the
<em>Home</em> tab of the ribbon?</p>

                    When will Cortana be available on Desktop and RT OS’s? I am confused as to why this was not adopted into all versions at the start and promptly advertised(i.e. promotion video showcasing Cortana with a synced notebook, the capability to use on all&nbsp;capable
 Windows&nbsp;devices and a special emphasis on tablet use)

            <p>It's not even generally available for Windows Phones yet, since 8.1 has only been released as a Developer's Preview, albeit an easily-obtained one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure that once it's gotten some use in the field and gets some tweaking it'll be added to RT and full Win 8.1. At least I hope it will be - it's a useful feature.</p>

<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I understand you frustration, the same happened to me too. I now have "live" before the user name I had chosen (which is probably over 10 years old).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, as per Microsoft, it is not currently possible: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/removing-the-live-from-skype-username/5891f256-e654-4c73-9404-27770940bd8c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>

<br />I understand it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you'll at least clarify it.
<br />If you have any further questions, I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

                    <p>I have a Surface RT, I know it is not the top of the line of the Surface tablets but has worked great for a few years now for what i need it for. &nbsp;I use Citrix Receiver to log in from Home (or out of town) to my work computer desk top. &nbsp;Suddenly the week
 of August 7th Citrix quit working, it would not let me login, and I believe there was an update on my Surface tablet that week (i don't know what was updated). &nbsp;I had one of the office tech guys look at it and he could not figure it out and said it was because
 I have an older Surface RT and Microsoft does not service this older version with Citrix. &nbsp;I find that hard to believe. &nbsp;I need this to work from home more than occasionally and now I am told sorry Charlie and I have to buy a new laptop computer so that I
 can work away from my office</p>

<p>Hello Mary Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Michelle was referring to is the developer of Citrix. Citrix support is more capable with handling concerns regarding their product. Even if you bring your device to a brick and mortar Microsoft store, they won't be able to assist you as this is not
 a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have further questions.</p>
