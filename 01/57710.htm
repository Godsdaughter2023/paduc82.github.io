<h2>            Skype for MS Surface</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so basically you are saying that in order for people with MS Surface to use Skype, they need to buy a different device????? Are you freaking serious???? How would you like to do that? To buy another device to use an app that used to work on this device?
 Not to mention that you most recent version of the Skype doesn't allow to create a video message and attached it right from the Skype like it used to do it on older versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well ,I'll tell you this: I will look for Skype alternative and if I find it and even if I have to buy another device, I will not use Skype. What you did is absolutely ridiculous and the only reason is a greed. Well ,greed will not get you far, this is a
 free market society, remember?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/22d15210-276e-4c3f-bb02-80c75c01906f" title="IgorSandler">

</p><p>The web version of Skype is still available for Microsoft Edge browser and the latest version of google chrome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices.
 Unsupported Skype enabled devices, and platforms may experience problems with calls and chats, lost or dropped calls and instant messages, or could stop working completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK, I know this is a useless conversation but you can ask users to get rid of devices the spent hundred's of dolls on specifically to use Skype because Microsoft has decided simply uninstall Skype from those devices. This is not a new OS or something like
 that. Do you know that there are some of the devices that don't work with Windows 10? But those devices perfectly work on Windows 7. Now people have a software that cannot work on mobile devices at all!!!! Yes, you can use new version of Skype online, which
 is missing few key features vs older version so it's just not the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, personally, I am done with Surface and all my friends will. good luck with Team stuff</p>

<h2>            cant start windows firewall. Error 1068&#58; The dependency service or group failed to start.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: cant start windows firewall</p>
<p>OS: Vista86x<br />
<br />
While browsing on firefox, I randomly got a nasty trojan worm that AVG got rid of, though it needed a full reboot to get rid of it and the results showed getting rid of 10 files and 4 registry entries. Its competely gone now, but there is a residual problem
 that I cannot start the windows firewall. In order here is the list of errors:<br />
<br />
Through windows security center: Security center cant turn on windows firewall.<br />
Click on the option to turn it on manually:&nbsp; Windows Firewall settings cannot be displayed because the associated service is not running. Do you want to start the Windows Firewall service?<br />
Click yes: Windows cannot start the Windows Firewall service.<br />
<br />
So then I go through task manager -&gt; services -&gt; services<br />
<br />
Brings up the services window, I tell that to start the Windows Firewall service:
<br />
<br />
error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start.<br />
<br />
<br />
From other answers I have seen, this looks like the virus corrupted my copy of secdrv.sys, but I cannot find anywhere to download a correct copy of this file, and I do not have an install disc because my windows came preinstalled on my laptop. I need to know
 where to get this file, or if this is not actually the answer, then what is actually wrong and how to fix it.<br />

            <p>Hi Flamewolf393,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try the following mentioned methods to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Enable the disabled services and start the services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable the disabled services and start the services:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>services.msc</b> in the Start Search box. </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select <b>Services</b> in the
<b>Programs</b> list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b>Telephony</b> and then click
<b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>General</b> tab, click
<b>Manual</b> next to Startup type.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>General</b> tab, click
<b>Start</b> under <b>Service</b> status, and then click <b>
OK</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Repeat steps 3 - 5 for the Remote Access Connection Manager service and for the Remote Access Auto Connection Manager service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Remove the unwanted EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) entries from registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>REGISTRY DISCLAIMERS:
</b></p>
<p>Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating
 system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>regedit</b> in the Start Search box. </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select <b>regedit</b> in the Programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Browse to the location
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\EAP</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Identify the subkey used by your modem.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Delete the other subkeys other than the default (13, 25 and 26 are default).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> If the above methods does not help then I would suggest that you perform system restore to the point when the service was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'd be glad to&nbsp;explain to you how Skype group video calling works.
</span>Skype group video calling allows users to participate in video chats with up to 10 people including yourself. Once you're logged in to Skype on your device, select a contact and press the video icon to start a call with them. Then Select (+) icon to
 add more people to your call.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, t</span>he computer or device that’s hosting the group call needs to have enough processing power and network bandwidth for the call. Having a large number
 of people on the call can sometimes put too much strain on the host device and cause call quality problems. To improve group call quality, make sure the host has a strong network and powerful processor, or reduce the number of people on the call.</p>

<p>Hi denmarfl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Netzero is an Internet service provider. May we know if they have an email service provider? If yes, you can contact them and ask for their
<strong>POP </strong>or <strong>IMAP </strong>settings to help you add your email account in
<strong>Windows 10 Mail </strong>app.</p>

<p>Netzero is both an Internet Provider, and, Email provider.&nbsp; I have had a netzero email since 1986....Netzero provides and supports this POP email service.&nbsp; I have been using Outlook, Windows Live Mail, Windows mail....to Fetch\Send my netzero mail.....but
 now I am using, hoping to use, the Windows10 Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Auto setup, entering ID and Password, the Netzero acct does get created....in Win App...but it does not fetch/Send messages...so for Netzero that feature of Win10 App is flawed.&nbsp; When I try to create my Netzero mail acct using the Manual process....the
 conflagration windows presented are not at all the same as in Outlook, Win Live Mail, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, past Outlook, Live Mail...etc, you had the&nbsp;More Setting which provided tabs, (General\Outgoing Server\Advanced)...especially the Advanced tabs required Port numbers, checking or unchecking security requirements , etc.....&nbsp; the Win10 APP has
 nothing similar...for the mostpart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use NetZero with Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; The configuration is strait forward.</p>
<p>For adding a Net Zero email you have to configure your settings in NetZero under the webmail webpage Options to allow POP email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to configure Windows 10 mail add a email account with the following settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Choose advanced setup.&nbsp; That is the last option under email account to configure.</p>
<p>2. Next page choose. Internet account for POP3 or IMAP.</p>
<p>3. Net fill in the boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Email address and username is your NetZero email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Your password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Account Name, I use NetZero</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Under send messages with this name. &nbsp; Your actual birth name or display name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Incoming mail server pop.netzero.com:995</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Account type choose POP3</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Outgoing mail server smtp.netzero.com:465</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; click save and you should be all set.</p>

<h2>            XP 64bit 32bit performance differences&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using a Core 2 Duo Intel e4300 1.8ghz CPU at stock speed, 2gb 800mhz DDR-2 ram, 256mb AX600 Asus video card. &nbsp;No plans to overclock. &nbsp;Presently using XP 64bit but several hardware items don't have drivers for it. &nbsp;I never tested 32bit so I can't compare
 now. &nbsp;I don't notice any obvious differences except some HD videos MIGHT play better now, not sure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondering if I should be experiencing better performance being that my hardware isn't exactly high end. &nbsp;If not, I could happily go back to XP 32 bit. &nbsp;I don't like Win7 at all so that is not an option. &nbsp;Also, any tests anybody could recommend would
 be most appreciated so if I go back to 32 bit I could really see the difference theoretically.</p>
<p>I plan on upgrading to a Socket 775 motherboard with built on DVI that can deal with 1080p comfortably, don't mind upping the ram to 4 or 8gb as its so cheap now, ram type should be DDR-3 1600mhz. &nbsp;I don't want to get a video card as it uses too much power
 and if I can get built on video that can do HD, that''ll make me very content. &nbsp;I don't game. &nbsp;Oh-oh....I just realized I won't be able to access more than 3gb of ram if I stick with 32bit! &nbsp;Yikes. &nbsp;Maybe if I get a faster CPU that would help a bit? &nbsp;I could
 put the paging file on a different hard drive as well to help the memory situation. &nbsp;If i used DDR-3 1600mhz maybe that would help too so 3gb would be enough. &nbsp;I'd probably get 4gb so it could run in dual channel. &nbsp;Ram is cheap. &nbsp;Too many options!</p>

<p>You will not be able to downgrade from Windows XP 64 bit to Windows XP 32 bit, you may have to perform a clean install to install Windows XP 32 bit on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong></p>
<p>A clean install can result in data loss; we recommend that you backup all the necessary data on a hard drive before performing a clean install.</p>

            <p>Would you expect Ford to write an unbiased expose on a Ford product? &nbsp;Please. &nbsp;If you're going to provide a link, have the sensibility of using one that is not from Microsoft. &nbsp;Most of their stuff is utterly incomprehensible for non-hardcore computer users
 anyway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think most anyone that has read anything on OS's knows that the clean install is the only way to do unless of course you want to bring all the accumulated rubbish from that last install to the next one. &nbsp;I think, for most us, the reason for the install
 is to NOT bring all that stuff from the past. &nbsp;Now if only we could do relationships so easily! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>The advantage of running a 64-bit version of Windows mostly exists only if you also run 64-bit applications under it. Bear in mind that there are very few such applications available yet. If you are presently
 running 32-bit Windows, you don't have any 64-bit applications, so to achieve any significant advantage, you not only have to replace Windows, but also your applications, *if* (and that's a big "if") 64-bit versions exist.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also note that you will need 64-bit drivers for all your hardware.
</p>
<p>Those drivers may not all be available, especially if some of your
</p>
<p>hardware is a few years old. So it's possible that you might also have
</p>
<p>to replace things like your printer, scanner, etc.

            <p>Non-Microsoft links please! &nbsp;Microsoft is never going to admit any deficiencies in any of their products. &nbsp;I should mention something typical of Microsoft and the above statement: &nbsp;The main reason I am ditching XP 64bit is the lack of hardware support (I
 realize Win7 64bit is better in that area but I don't like the dumbed down approach of Win7). &nbsp;Of course they don't hardware support issue on that page you recommended. &nbsp;So not only do they give not enough information (the negative) they don't even mention
 the most important stuff! &nbsp;Its worse than nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>James, I appreciate your effort but if you want to be taken seriously, look at bias in people's writing. &nbsp;If I want an opinion or review on Gmail I'm sure not going to read something from Google.com. &nbsp;Its not anti-Microsoft. &nbsp;Its common sense. &nbsp;Also I'm
 not going to read an opinion from a competitor for the opposite reason. &nbsp;Find a reviewer that doesn't profit from the advertising of the product they are reviewing and is not selling that item and you have a better chance of a neutral writing slant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like I'll dual boot: &nbsp;Win7 64 for performance and Win XP 32 for compatibility. &nbsp;That should give me the best of both worlds. &nbsp;Maybe Win8 won't look like its been designed for brain damaged users like Win7. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Search Engine? &nbsp;Is that not the ultimate in redundancy even suggesting such a thing? &nbsp;Obviously the reason people post here is because the search engine didn't work! &nbsp;Its a lot quicker using Google if you can actually find something than formulating your
 question, posting it, then waiting patiently for a response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully people here learn to never post Microsoft links to Microsoft problems as they will be hopelessly biased. &nbsp;You don't ask a Ford salesman his opinion on Ford cars hopefully? &nbsp;5 minutes on the internet will prove my words. &nbsp;Remove the economic incentive
 and you just MIGHT get good information. &nbsp;Its insulting to someone's intelligence to even insinuate otherwise.</p>
<p>I realize there are some beginners on here but it should be obvious by someone's initial question and how its written as to whether they are hopelessly naive on their computer quest or not. &nbsp;We were all beginners once. &nbsp;I'm by no means an expert but I try
 to be comprehensive in my search for answers. &nbsp;Anything less and its kind of a waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>What archive file?</strong></p>
<p>The two most common reasons for what you describe is disruption of the compacting process, (never touch anything until it's finished), or bloated folders. More on that below.</p>
<p>Why does OE insist on compacting folders when I close it?:<br />

<p>Recovery tools:</p>
<p>If you are running XP/SP2, or SP3, and are fully patched, then you should have a backup of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, (or possibly the message store), copied as bak files.</p>
<p>To restore a bak folder to the message store folder, first find the location of the Message Store.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, the .dbx files are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>Close OE and then in Windows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the missing, or empty, folder and drag it to the Desktop. It can be deleted later once you have successfully restored the bak file. Minimize the Message Store.</p>
<p>Open OE and, if the folder is missing, create a folder with the *exact* same name as the bak file you want to restore but without the .bak. Eg: If the file is Saved.bak, the new folder should be named Saved. Open the new folder and then close OE. If the
 folder is there, but just empty, continue on to the next step.</p>
<p>First, check if there is a bak file already in the message store. If there is, and you removed the dbx file, go ahead and rename it to dbx.</p>
<p>If it isn't already in the message store, open the Recycle bin and right click on the bak file for the folder in question and click Restore. Open the message store back up and change the file extension from .bak to .dbx. Close the message store and open
 OE. The messages should now be back in the folder.</p>
<p>If the messages are successfully restored, you can go ahead and delete the old dbx file that you moved to the Desktop.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you do not have bak copies of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, then:</p>
<p>DBXpress run in Extract From Disk Mode is the best chance to recover messages:<br />

<p>And see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4</a></p>
<p>A general warning to help avoid this in the future:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in default OE folders. They will eventually become corrupted. Create your own user defined folders for storing mail and move your mail to them. Empty Deleted Items folder regularly. Keep user created folders under 300MB, and Default folders
 as empty as is feasible.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for
 lose of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Random startup BSOD&#39;s after system is off for hours... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpiana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random startup BSOD&#39;s after system is off for hours...</h2>
                    
<p>First off here are my system specs:<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit<br />
MSI NF980-G65&nbsp; Nvidia 980a Chipset w/ 15.49 drivers installed<br />
AMD Phenom II X4 965 BE 3.4 ghz<br />
GeIL Black Dragon 4 x 2gb 1600<br />
GTX 295<br />
GTS 250 dedicated PhysX (196.21 drivers installed on both cards)<br />
2 X Western Digital 500gb 3 gb/s <br />
Kingwin Mach 1 1220W PSU (150 Amps total on 12v rails)<br />
<br />
When I built this system last month I immediately had issues where the bios would not post off the primary card (GTX 295), but would post off the GTS 250, I had the 295 installed in the PCIe - 2 slot, and the 250 in the PCIe-4 slot. MSI lists the primary slot
 as the -2, but no matter how I set up the cards in Nvidia Control panel, the bios would only post on the 250. After reading the pec sheet, the slots are set up X16 x 16 x0 or x16 x8 x8, im assuming this follows the -2 -4 -5 order. I switched the cards and
 placed the 295 in the -4 slot, and the 250 in the -2 slot and now the bios posts off the 295. However, I am unsure if I am throttling my performance or not, so if anybody has any input let me know please.<br />
<br />
Now the main issue, the BSOD's. When I have a clean install of Win 7 the system runs fine except that there is a error in the devce manager for the coprocesor, which I found to be the SMU driver, so I update to the Nforce 15.49 drivers and restart and everything
 is fine, run the computer all day and night, then shutdown, and when I get home the next day and restart, I get 2-4 BSODs. The system continues to restart after each, and then will boot up fine. I can again run the computer with no issues, restart as much
 as I want and its fine, but when I shutdown for the night and start up the next day, the BSOD's return. I have updated the BIOS to v1.2 from MSI. I have tried only using the MSI certified chipset drivers from their website, but the same issue continues to
 happen. I have checked to make sure my ram sticks are seated properly and they are, each stick also has 2 LED's they are lit, so I know they have power. Honestly, I discount it being hardware, as when its a clean Win 7 instal the system is fine excpet its
 missing the SMU driver... which is suppose to cause system instability but does not O.o My wifes computer, also recently built, is almost a replica of mine, except she has an ASUS M3N72-D, she also has the error in device manager for the coprocessor, but we
 have NOT updated her chipset drivers and her system continues to run beautifully, which is extremly perplexing since every person I have talked to says the same; the system will be very unstable with the SMU driver error.
<br />
<br />
The BSOD that I seem to have the most of is the nvlddmkm.sys although it seems I have every BSOD error that there is.
<br />
<br />
Here are the latest DMP files since the last Win7 reinstall: <a href="http://cid-b7c5158e97f0764a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://cid-b7c5158e97f0764a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public</a><br />
<br />
Need help with this problem as the squishy sound I hear when my head hits the wall is starting to become troublesome :)<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The possible causes of ALL these are possible power problems including card, memory, and cable<br />
seating - memory - and drivers are also suspect. AVG could also be playing a role as both 8.x and<br />
9.x have been causing some strange issues though I suspect it is not the root cause though possibly<br />
contributory.<br />
<br />
If you solve 1a, 3b and 0A the others will probably also be solved.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 1a&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001a&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The MEMORY_MANAGEMENT bug check has a value of 0x0000001A. This indicates <br />
that a severe memory management error occurred.<br />
<br />
BCCode: 1a&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001a&nbsp;&lt;- read this&nbsp;</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/MEMORY-MANAGEMENT-0x0000001A-*1041.html?order=date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/MEMORY-MANAGEMENT-0x0000001A-*1041.html?order=date</span></a><br />
<br />
Unfortunately&nbsp;memory tests do not catch everything such as mismatched memory, when
<br />
slower memory is placed in front of faster memory, and other issues.<br />
<br />
You can try Powering Off all power and removing and reseating the memory. One or two
<br />
stick(s) at a time if possible to see if the system bluescreens and if so on which sticks.<br />
<br />
Other possibilities are BIOS and <strong>antivirus/antispyware/security</strong> programs and even motherboard problems.<br />
<br />
Drivers are possible however that would be unusual - maybe chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
Generally this error is caused by video drivers so use the methods in the driver section below to<br />
update your drivers manually. Using the Device Manager Update Drivers alone or even a scanner<br />
at the Device Maker's site will not get the job done properly. Other possible influences are antivirus/<br />
antispyware/security programs including 3rd party firewall - which of those do you use and which<br />
have EVER been on the computer?<br />
<br />
Also update the BIOS if available.<br />
<br />
If needed use the BlueScreenViewer to post the information into a message here which will allow<br />
all to see the info without you having to upload it and for them to download it. Its a small and very<br />
easy to use utility which is free.<br />

<br />
<strong>Could be a driver related issue though less likely than memory.</strong> Update your drivers
<br />
manually by looking at System maker and Device maker's sites.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I would put the problem with your findings to the motherboard maker as there<br />
could be known issues and if not they need to come up with a solution. They <br />
either need to solve the problem or furnish you with equal or better equipment<br />
that will operate properly.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have the latest and correct chipset drivers.<br />
<br />

            I will assume that since your posts here are not all in caps, this is only affecting paint.<br />
<br />
Try changing the font being used when adding text in paint - some fonts always show capitals.<br />

    <title>Black screen with HDMI cable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thetrent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen with HDMI cable</h2>
                    So i recently built a computer, and decided to go with windows 7. I plug in the VGA cable to my computer and monitor, and it works awesomely. I plug the HDMI cable into the computer and then into my TV, and the TV is showing a black screen. Even if i try
 to drag items onto it, duplicate the desktop, or even set the TV as my main screen, nothing seems to show up on the TV. looking through the FAQ, it says that only movies and games would show up on the HDTV, but that hasnt worked either.&nbsp; does anyone know what
 i can do to fix this?

            Ciao StarryShark05, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, provided that you can do what you ask at your own risk of paying an high internet bill, you have 2 options:
<br />
<br />1) Set connection as unmetered
<br />
<br />SET METERED INTERNET CONNECTION (swipe Set as metered connection to off)
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/226722/how-when-and-why-to-set-a-connection-as-metered-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/226722/how-when-and-w...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Manually download updates from the catalog

            Hello,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />If you have set connection as metered, Windows would first ask your permission to download the updates. When the updates would be checked, you would be asked if you want to install or not.
<br />Otherwise, you always have the option of installing the latest updates manually:

            If you want to install updates over a metered connection, you will need to either do so manually:

<br />
<br />or disable metered connection in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi or Ethernet &gt; your connection name then toggle Toggle on Set as metered connection.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; check for updates.

            No, MS does not know that the Settings are worse than the control panel. They, MS, think that Settings are better.
<br />
<br />Please do take the time to let MS know you are not happy with the move to settings by submitting "Feedback" to them.

 is obvious I&nbsp;use&nbsp;a Goddamn Cellular connection&nbsp;😒&nbsp;Anyway I am sure I disabled the option of setting network type as metered in Ethernet section&nbsp;before&nbsp;which&nbsp;did not solve my problem.</li><li>Downloading updates <strong>manually is the idea I prefer</strong>; thank you Ugo for the Catalog's link 🙂</li></ol>

    <title>Video hardware error message appears when an external monitor is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scipio_africanus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video hardware error message appears when an external monitor is connected to the laptop and I move the mouse after Windows 7 has turned off the display &#40;after 10 minutes according to &#34;balanced&#34; power plan&#41;.</h2>
                    I run Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on my Dell XPS M1530 laptop and also use an Acer V223w external monitor connected through HDMI/DVI cable. The graphics card is a NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT with 256MB. I have the latest graphics card driver (version 8.16.11.8681)&nbsp;and
 monitor driver installed.<br />
<br />
Everything works fine, except that I always get a video hardware error when I move my mouse to get the display back after Windows 7 has turned it off (after 10 minutes according to "balanced" power plan). Sometimes the whole system crashes and I get a blue
 screen. I didn't have this problem two weeks ago when I was still running Vista 32-bit.<br />
<br />
What should I try to solve this problem, other than disabling the "screen turn off" option in the power plan?<br />

<p>
<span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Change hardware resolution to different levels and see if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method II:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may run SFC scan to see if any third party services is causing the problem the following
 are the steps to run SFC Scan.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> <span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, and then type
<strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box. </span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Right-click

<p><span><span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method III:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>I suggest that you boot the computer in safe mode and check if you are able to login without any issues, safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.
 Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer if it is powered on.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Safe Mode and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></p>

            Just to update anybody interested in this issue:<br />
<br />
I installed the latest NVIDIA graphics card driver (version 195.62, <a href="http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/notebook_winvista_win7_x64_195.62_whql_uk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/notebook_winvista_win7_x64_195.62_whql_uk.html</a>) that came out a few days ago, and this seems to have solved the problem for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your support,<br />

    <title>Issue about Supreme Commander 2 that needs to be known. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> demonic5andwich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue about Supreme Commander 2 that needs to be known.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I have been streaming Supreme Commander 2 on my Xbox One a few times this past week, as much as it was fun, me and a few players who I was talking to on the 360 found an issue that needs to be looked into and possibly fixed.</p>
<p>Apparently, according to the 360 players who I have been playing with, we found out that we go into our own game servers. The 360 players will get an indication saying that they won the game, however on my side the Xbox one, I would still be playing and
 I would get the notification of either winning by disconnection or I would continuing playing until they have lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be quite the issue that needs to be attended if you guys want to keep on letting 360 players play with the One players.</p>

<p>There is no troubleshooting it. It's been like this for over a year. I have contacted Xbox multiple times and was informed "there was a translation issue" between the 1 and 360 for this game. There is NO COMPATIBILITY at all for SC2 between the xbox1 and
 360. Yeah, you can get in the same lobby, even the same game, but the person on the 1 will see totally different in-game play then the person on the 360. I know this FOR A FACT, we tested it, 2v2, 3 of us on 360s and one of us on a 1. HE DID NOT SEE THE SAME
 GAME WE WERE SEEING. Now, every lobby you get in is with 1 players and even after I win the game, I message them and ask them how the game turned out on their end. "IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME ANSWER." They all say THEY WON or I LEFT THE GAME, When on my screen(360)
 I won the game or they sat there doing nothing. Seriously, you SHOULD NOT claim there is backwards compatibility for SC2 between the xbox1 and 360, because it 100% is not. A classic RTS game has been ruined because of this. NO SENSE IN EVEN PLAYING THIS GAME
 IF 360 PLAYERS AND "1" PLAYERS ARE PUT INTO THE SAME LOBBY, YOU WONT EVEN SEE THE SAME GAME, even though your in the same game.

<p>Since backwards comparability is for the 360 is emulated, things may not work as intended in the games. This also holds true to older PC games, when run in an emulator they don't always act as the original intended it to act. Bugs/Glitches happen, some of
 them are easy to fix, others require extensive coding to flush through and find were it can be fixed to properly function as intended. Because the coding of the systems is 2 vastly different forms of coding, you may never be able to play X1 to 360, unless
 they can figure out the compatibility issue between them. </p>

<p><span>This is an HP software conflict with Windows 7. Log on to the HP home page and go to their Support and drivers page. Select download drivers and software.
 Enter your PC name and from the list scroll down to the software solution Wallpaper Picture Position Enabler. Download that file and install. You should be good to go.</span></p>

<p>I have checked and can confirm the incorrect address has been removed from <strong>
People.Live.com. </strong></p>
<p>However,&nbsp;it is still available to reinstate. This surely implies that it is still lurking in a cache somewhere?</p>
<p>The email account is not synchronised to any other devices.Accessing e-mail via web browser does not have the problem</p>

            <p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to inform you that its a Mail app behavior. When you have first typed the incorrect e-mail address, Mail app have stored and remembered that incorrect e-mail address. There is no way to remove the incorrect e-mail address from Mail app. This
 is by design and there is no such option to remove that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

I could understand the Mail app behaviour if I had later added the correct email address. Logically it would then keep both. However, I edited the incorrect address and then saved it which to my simple brain says that the incorrect address would no longer exist.
