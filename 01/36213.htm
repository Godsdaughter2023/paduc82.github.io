    <title>Ctrl, Alt and Shift modifier bubble next to the pen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ctrl, Alt and Shift modifier bubble next to the pen</h2>
                    <p>Every time I press a modifier like ctrl, alt and shift, a bubble with a text showing the pressed key appears close to the pen.</p>
<p>I noted that there are other discussions about this, but they came mainly from wacom users, or older versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was previously possible to disable this behavior in the Pointer Options tab of the Pen and Input Devices settings, but it looks to not be available in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already disabled both Flicks, and "Show Visual Effects" (note that these options are in two totally different areas. Why Windows doesn't collect all the available options in one place?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please solve this issue with pen visual feedbacks in a future upgrade.</p>
<p>Another annoying feedback for example is the ring that appears when you press the pen side button.</p>
<p>Note that every of these feedbacks causes a small lag, that renders the experience of drawing on the surface either distracting or painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Win10, display too wide font and color mess-up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win10, display too wide font and color mess-up</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop was using Win7, but the hard disk crushed one day. &nbsp;We bought a new hard disk and microsoft store installed Win10 on our new hard disk. At the store, it was using the store's monitor for installation. &nbsp;When we brought the computer back home and
 use our home monitor, the color and resolution were not right. &nbsp;We did the color calibration, adjusted the resolution, and even installed the monitor driver. By now, there are still two issues we'd like to fix.</p>
<p>1. The color is correct after computer is powered up. Since we set the power option as "turning monitor off after 30min", so the monitor goes blank after 30min's no-activity. &nbsp;Once we wake it up, the color is just mess up. &nbsp;It looks too bright and certain
 areas on screen just could not be seen. &nbsp;We have to restart the computer in order to get correct color again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Second issue is that the characters displayed are just too fat. &nbsp;It is like a perfect picture is stretched on the horizontal direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, we have to verify if the graphics card you have is within the required specification of the Operating System. Can you tell us the graphics card you are using and what is the specification? Also, when
 you said that you have installed the monitor’s driver, are you using the updated monitor driver?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about the system requirements, you can check the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#sysreqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Specification</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

            <p>Since we cannot verify the graphics card that you have on your end, we recommend that you try the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the monitor, can you check the setting on it and try to set it up to default. There should be buttons either in the front of the monitor, or the sides of the back part. Once you have reverted it back to default, check if the issue still persist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, we recommend that you try to start your Windows 10 in safe mode. <span>
Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing
 the issue and a possibility of a hardware issue. To know more on how to perform safe mode, you can check the article below:</span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft memory clear</h2>
                    Recently I had to clear my cache to fix my corrupted profile- and it was fine. But minecraft wouldn't start when I tried to play it I think the issue is I had worlds with The new update, but when the cache was cleared they were corrupted. Any suggestions
 on how I can fix it? (Hopefully without getting rid of my hours of work)

<p>Perhaps you could try to delete the latest Minecraft update and see if that will make it work, but as suggested above, if the data is corrupted then it is hard to fix.

            Hi Jim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to the Printer maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model and download the full software package for the printer.  
<br />
<br />While there check if there is newer firmware to install directly to the printer which makes it work properly and needs to be current.  Follow the instructions on the downloads page to install it.
<br />
<br />Then with the printer USB unplugged (if applicable) follow the prompts to install the software.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Mr. Jim,<br /><br />It's very easy to connect you laptop to your printer, the easiest method is to simply plug the USB into laptop and also to the printer ensure the printer is properly energized and windows should do the rest.  However if it's a more complex or older printer there may be more steps involved.  If you are connecting wireless you'd use the screen the on the printer. Find the setting and add the appropriate information from you network.  <br /><br />If you'd like please give me the model of the printer you are using and I'll be able to either A. walk you through the process or B. Give you adequate information so that you can set the printer up correctly.<br /><br />I look forward to helping, <br />Yomi Thomas

    <title>Question in regards to the rechargeable battery in controls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khromg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question in regards to the rechargeable battery in controls</h2>
                    
<p>I had an Xbox 360 when the console initially came out but ditched it because of various issues I was having after I finished Halo 3 (redring, etc. got tired of having it repaired). Halo 4 came out and I wanted to pick up a fresh new console to play what
 I've missed out on in the time I didn't have an Xbox and to experience the new Halo. When I had my first Xbox I had a play and charge kit for the wireless controller I had with it. The thing worked really well and I enjoyed it. But Now I'm having some issues.</p>
<p>The console I picked up was actually the collectors edition Halo 4 console with the 2 controllers. For one of the controllers I went ahead and purchased another play and charge kit to use because I had gotten rid of the old one when i ditched the old console.
 The old battery I had way back when lasted my a good amount of time before I ever had to recharge it, sometimes would go for days before it needed a recharge. I never had to replace it in the 2-3 years I had an Xbox.</p>
<p>The NEW battery/batteries however only last me like 10 minutes and sometimes is only playable when I have the charge cable plugged in, otherwise the whole thing just drops and I cant use it at all. I thought I had a faulty battery and this is the FOURTH
 rechargeable that I've gone through (mind you this is the official charge kits not some off brand one) with the same/similar issue. I'm beginning to think that it may be the controller? Any input would be great</p>
<p>p.s. It happens on both controllers and regular AA batteries work fine.</p>

<p>Is this an aftermarket play-and-charge kit/batteries or the official Microsoft unit? &nbsp;I ask because about 4-5 years ago (between Halo 3 and now) Microsoft actually changed the controller a bit in the way the battery functions and batteries for the older
 connection setup will act exactly as you describe. &nbsp;I must admit though that I find it hard to believe those would still be on the market.</p>

<p>It is possible that while the batteries/charge kits are new and unopened, they may be older stock which has set on the shelf and no longer properly holds a charge. Just the other day I pulled out some of my controllers from my launch 360 and pulled the battery
 packs to charge only to find they would no longer charge after having set for too long with no use. And if you bought them all from the same retailer, that would fit as well since they are all probably from the same lot. I doubt it is the controller as I have
 both the Star Wars and Gears of War 3 consoles and neither of their controllers (nor the newer limited edition Chrome series models) have issues with the Play and Charge kits (though one of the ones I did buy fairly recently doesn't seem to hold a charge as
 long as the others). </p>

<p>I agree with what dlCHIEF58 said 'possible that while the batteries/charge kits are new and unopened, they may be older stock which has set on the shelf and no longer properly holds a charge' since some retail companies don't like to get ride of what they
 account as working products since they will be losing money in the process of doing that.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>My Advice:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>If you have a return policy linked to item =</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>- Can return it then do so and try get money back and try a different retailer for same item</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>If you don't have a return policy linked to item =</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>- Buy same item from different retailer</p>
<p>- Keep using AA Battery's</p>
<p>- Keep controller constantly plugged in while in use</p>

<p>There have been issues with play and charge kits for a couple years now.</p>
<p>I don't know the exacts, but it happened around the 2011 fall update.</p>
<p>My guess (not an official MS statement at all) is that the update refined the console's system to regulate power a little better, and it doesn't interact with how things recharge by USB properly.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I know from my own personal kits that they wont charge unless the console is on and they are charging without being used.</p>
<p>My iPod charge cable is effected as well, and wont charge if the console is off.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I personally dealt with the problem by getting a charge station for my batteries.</p>

<h2>            Unable to start Windows Defender</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I start up the machine, an error message is displayed with an error "Application failed to initialize: 0x800106ba". It looked like there was an issue with the Windows Defender, so I changed its setting to "automatic", I tried "start" the "Windows
 Defender" but get an error message "Windows could not start the Windows Defender service on Local Computer. Error 0x800b0109..."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am unable to run the Microsoft Updates.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also tried running the Microsoft Fix it software, but another error message is displayed "We're sorry, but the program encountered a runtime error. Please try again later" [Code 80040402].</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These issues mean I am unable to install IE9.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please could someone advice me as to how I can resolve this issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using one of the above AntiVirus Programs, this Information from
<strong><em>David O - Support Engineer</em></strong>&nbsp;shows you how to&nbsp;manually enable&nbsp;Windows Defender (<strong><em>disregard Uninstall Information; not possible in Vista</em></strong>):</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b"><font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b</font></a></p>
<p><span>"Go to Start, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>,
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Services</strong>. Locate Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> and ensure that the Start-Up Type is
<strong>Automatic. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once changed, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit and Restart your computer. Check back taking the same route to confirm Windows Defender has started"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to now&nbsp;change Startup Programs in Vista without using Defender, use either of these Methods:</p>

 I've tried so far with no luck:</p>

            Hi NickRay1,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be clean Install. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 after using the media creation tool to download windows 10. I done a 'Clean Install' deleting everything. After&nbsp;a&nbsp;week I got fed up of Windows 10 and didn't like it. Windows 8.1 was much better and had
 an easier layout. I wanted to go back to Windows 8.1 and found out that Microsoft included an option to go back to Windows 8.1 using a simple go back to Windows 8.1 option in recovery. However I go to Recovery and the option is not there!!!. Every video or

            This option is available in Update &amp; Security under recovery where you could do refresh. This option is only available for one month and if you did upgrade to Windows 10. If you did a clean install, this option won't be available.

            <p>Open the driver which Windows has been installed , are you seeing a folder call Windows.old? Is there any files there?</p>
<p>If it is not there, then you either did a clean install (not upgrade) or remove the files (using disk clean up) or it has been more than a month which it has been removed automatically.</p>
<p>If you want to install Windows 8.1, you should do clean install let say using recovery partition or recovery setting.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Mail Migration&#34; add-on upload problems</h2>
                    <p>I used "Mail Migration" add-on to upload my Outlook Express 6 messages/contacts from my old Windows XP to Outlook.com on my new Windows 8, but it only uploaded my Outlook Express email
<strong>folders</strong> . .&nbsp; but<u> not</u> any of the email messages&nbsp;in each of the folders?&nbsp; The uploaded folders were completely empty!&nbsp; Also, it did not upload&nbsp;my contacts.</p>
<p>I received an &nbsp;email message from "Outlook Team" (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) stating:&nbsp; Your email account has been added to the cloud.&nbsp; Its done, but there were a few errors:&nbsp; here is what was uploaded:&nbsp;&nbsp; Your email account
 settings.&nbsp; These things were not uploaded:&nbsp; All contacts.&nbsp; Try again."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried again several times w/o success, each time getting the following website message:&nbsp; "There is a problem adding your account right now.&nbsp; Please try again later."&nbsp; Exhausted!!!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having same issues.&nbsp; Imported file names, etc.&nbsp; but none of the POP emails transferred.&nbsp; Even though it said it would transfer the 12,000 items.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it is just taking time to synch up?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI - I am going from Vista Windows Mail to Windows 8&nbsp; and a new computer.&nbsp; I know exporting and importing POP emails (just on my local computer and not anywhere on a server or cloud) has been a MAJOR Microsoft problem in the past.&nbsp; I actually upgraded to
 Windows 8 when I saw that this issue seemed to be worked out with windows migration tool.&nbsp; I am very frustrated that it seemingly has not been resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI - to author, I did export contact but NOT using this migration as I was having same errors, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried exporting emails to a flash drive and importing but this is not working either :(&nbsp; Many hours spent already&nbsp; :(</p>

            <p>The same problem.</p>
<p>I've solved it in&nbsp;following manner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Export address book in *.csv file. Open "Address book"&nbsp;in "Outlook Express 6.0".&nbsp;"File" &gt; "Export..."&nbsp;&gt; "Other file...". When you choose fields, choose only filled ones in order to make *.csv file most simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is specialy frustrating that "MS People" didn't take my *.csv file&nbsp;during "Importing contacts" oreration:
<em>"The file is empty, or not in the correct format". </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If so, I've &nbsp;opened my Gmail account and - Hallelujah!!! - it took my *.csv file&nbsp;in "Importing contacts" oreration. Details are here
<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14024?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14024?hl=en</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is specialy interesting - in this case we can see real results of competition between 2 IT-monsters :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In "MS People" choose "Add people to your contact list" and then &gt; "Google".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done all this complicated operations in order to set my old contacts on my Windows Phone 7.8.
</p>
<p>It's&nbsp;a pity that MS cann't tune up it's products - Outlook Express together with Outlook.com&nbsp;&amp; People. Only Google&nbsp;was able to help.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I don't have time to be screwing around with all the glitchy, crashy apps on Windows 10 and I want Windows 7 back. I was going to get it off Amazon, but I saw another thread on Microsoft Community that said the "<span>Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit, System
 Builder OEM DVD 1 Pack" wasn't what I was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span>Is that true? If so, can someone recommend a way to get Windows 7 on my laptop that currently runs Windows 10? I'm happy to pay, and it must be legal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks all!</span></p>

<p>BAD IMAGE-</p>
<p>" C:\ windows\ system 32\ dssenh.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the orginal installation media or contact your administrator or software vendor for support."</p>

<p>The last successful update was in mid-June 2012.</p>
<p>I have Norton security. I think that is what you asked.</p>

<h2>            Notes written onto PDF document jump to different position in pdf</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
I've got a problem with using my stylus annotate PDF documents. I got my Surface Pro 2 primarily for the utility of being able to 'write' on/annotate pdf documents. I'm a PhD candidate and I download hundreds of journal articles in pdf form from academic providers.
 I've noticed that in a significant number of the documents I download, when I try to write at a specific place on the document, such as when I want to underline a particular line or write a note adjacent to specific text, whatever I write "jumps" approximately
 two lines below the point of where the stylus nib contacted the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Note: The stylus isn't writing in a position different to where I touch the stylus on the screen. It writes where I put the nib but then what I've written visibly 'jumps' to a different position when I lift the stylus from the screen. i.e., this isn't a straight
 calibration problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
This problem makes using the feature extremely difficult. I have to attempt to 'underline' starting a couple of lines above the text I actually want underlined. I can't write in print form at all because each time I write a letter and lift the nib the letter
 immediately jumps below the point where I write and then I have to estimate where to put the next letter. Usually, what I've written is indecipherable, and if I try to write entirely in running writing with the stylus the result is equally indecipherable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
I spent several hours in a chat session with a Microsoft support person to no avail. We downloaded a new driver for the stylus but it made no difference.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
I tend to think the problem is specific to certain PDF documents - possibly something to do with how some are formatted compared to others. I have nowhere near enough understanding of such matters to be able to go any further without help to resolve this problem.
 I hope it is resolvable, because the only alternative I have if it's not is to start printing journal articles out and marking them manually, which I hoped to stop doing by getting the Surface, because of the enormous cost and amount of paper used.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Any smart geeks got any ideas?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm that documents that you get from specific sources are affected, as if due to how the PDF files are created/formatted?&nbsp; Is your experience fairly consistent from these sources, or does it appear random?&nbsp; It sounds like you are pulling in documents

            <p>Hey, thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't confirm for sure that the problem is consistent as regards particular providers, although I think it may be the case. I'll go and look at a selection of documents to see if I can firm up my view on that point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't know if it might help, but I have a video of what is happening that I took with my windows phone, but I couldn't find a way of uploading it to your site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'll check out some documents and get back to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let's take a step back for a moment.&nbsp; When you experience this behavior in inking PDF files, is this happening through a single app or do you have the same results across all apps that are available through the store for inking / annotating PDF files?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the tardy response, I've had a couple of trips interstate through the last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm interpreting your question correctly, I'm not aware of what app I'm using when I use the stylus to write on pdf documents. I'm using whatever app was driving the stylus when I first bought the Surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I contacted Microsoft support via their chat facility, the help person got me to download a whole lot of updates. I'm not sure what any of those were for exactly, but the problem wasn't fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of other points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. As I'm sure you know, the pdf documents have their own highlighting/underlining capability. In some documents, when you underline certain parts of text, say a paragraph, the underline will often be broken along the line of the text at various points,
 and the different parts of the underline will often sit at different heights in relation to the line that has been underlined. In those same pdf documents,the highlighting will often be broken and uneven along a line of text that has been highlighted. On other
 pdf documents, the underline (or highlighting) is never broken, but just runs as one entire line under the text. I'm pretty sure I've noticed some level of correlation between documents where the underline is broken and documents where the stylus marks jump
 - although I couldn't say it's a perfect correlation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't know if it would help at all, but I've got a 10 second video of what's happening that I took with my phone. I can't imagine it would make that much difference in terms of assisting you, but it's there if you think it would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just further to my paragraph #1 in my previous email dated 12 March,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a pdf document at the moment where the 'jump' is about 8 lines and slightly diagonal, which makes using the stylus impossible, so I've reverted to using the underline/highlight/comment tools in the pdf document. The underline and highlight
 tools do not create breaks along the lines of text, which is not consistent with the correlation I thought I might have noticed in other pdfs. I don't know whether it was ever a point of significance from your point of view, but I thought I'd mention this
 latest observation in any event.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is certainly possible&nbsp;that&nbsp;Win 8\8.1 is somehow preventing opening the CD...</p>
<p>I think it's Digital Rights Management may be a bit different....</p>
<p>
</p><p>For lack of a better description, Ripping might be somewhat comparable to EXTRACTING a .zip or .rar file.</p>
<p>Until it is extracted, it is unreadable by most processes....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something that needs to be done for CD Audio, as well as copy protected DVD's and Blu-Ray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Media Player can do this, but I've not played around with audio files in a number of years...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link I found that explains this better than I can...</p>

<p>
</p><p>From what I read here, it would seem that the files never were converted... </p>
<p>Another possibility is that there is something in their attributes that identify them as CD Audio...</p>

            Hi Diane.  
<br />
<br />Check for any Updates in the Microsoft Store app from the Settings ... elipsis at top right.  
<br />
<br />You can reset the App in Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Solitaire &gt; Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then you can re-register the app from option two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>

    <title>Keyboard layouts and language settings appearing out of nowhere - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bastian weber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard layouts and language settings appearing out of nowhere</h2>
                    <p>This problem is one I alread had on Windows 8.1, and I posted it in this forum at that time. Unfortunately, a solution could never be found. Here is the old thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-desktop/windows-8-english-keyboard-layout-keeps-appearing/82d5a2ee-c20d-4722-878a-3fe4e55442b2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-desktop/windows-8-english-keyboard-layout-keeps-appearing/82d5a2ee-c20d-4722-878a-3fe4e55442b2</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem basically persists on Windows 10. I today have two language options set up for my system:</p>
<ul>
<li>English UK with German keyboard</li><li>German with German keyboard</li></ul>
<p>This is what my language settings look like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e0759a8-c7fd-48fd-abf5-402656ef3c4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e0759a8-c7fd-48fd-abf5-402656ef3c4f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So one would assume there were two options to choose from when switching language (using the shortcut Windows + Space). However, there are four:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f0faabd-3156-4052-b2ed-eb3b55298661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f0faabd-3156-4052-b2ed-eb3b55298661" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Two of them were neither set up my myself, nor do they show up in the language preferences, as shown above. Those are
<strong>English (US) with US keyboard</strong> and <strong>English (US) with German keyboard</strong>. I don't need these two settings; they just start showing up randomly. Usually, after I rebooted my computer, they are gone but show up again shortly after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying and confusing when switching between languages. I have no idea what causes the problem, and as it seems there are also other people who encounter it (see the aforementioned thread on Windows 8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Something is different.&nbsp; Now I have no languages (so Win-Spacebar does nothing) but my keyboard is somehow International EN-US which is an irritating nuisance to use, especially for the quote characters.&nbsp; It happened recently but I'm not sure why.&nbsp; I suspect
 it may be due to declaring Country or region not to be US when I have Windows set to be En-US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK.&nbsp; I fixed that.&nbsp; I went into </p>
<p>Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region\Language\Language options </p>
<p>
</p><p>Added a Touch keyboard for Dvorak.&nbsp; Removed the International one.&nbsp; Added another Touch one for En-US.&nbsp; So now Win-Spacebar works again and I don't have any annoying&nbsp;"no double-quote, then double-double-quote" symptom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for making me do this.</p>

            I found that if I unplugged my Windows Mobile (6.5) from the PC, this error stopped occurring. Check your USB connections and remove any devices which may have legacy apps on them.

    <title>Sudden HIGH Ram usage &#40;70-80&#37;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean adamleni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sudden HIGH Ram usage &#40;70-80&#37;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering WHY it takes so much memory when Windows 7 is starting up? It takes about 70-80% of my RAM. Then sometimes it falls off to 20-30%. I don't know if this is because Windows is still loading some start-up items/programs, but sometimes, it STAYS
 in 70/80%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really have a lot of programs running on start-up (less than 10 actually (seen through MSCONFIG) ). And when I disable some services, I make sure that the "Hide all Microsoft services" box is UN-ticked, means I didn't mess up with my Windows services
 so that shouldn't be the problem. The services THAT I disabled are the ones that are unnecessary/ the ones that are NOT need to be automatically activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now typing this words, I have 40% of RAM consumed, with basic windows services running and some user defined ones (Avast, Advanced System Care, CCleaner, 7 services of Chrome running (total of 252MB for Chrome) ). Google Chrome isn't the problem cause
 we all know Chrome was supposed to be like this (*ugh), and Explorer.exe consuming 18MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So guys what I need to know is :</p>
<p>I know this isn't normal cause sometimes it falls of to 20% but sometimes it don't, so, WHAT could be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need to speed up my computer cause, it doesn't slow down with having a problem like this, but it worries me, so, HOW can reduce I the percentage of usage of my ram other than closing other unnecessary applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lot of maintenance programs like Avast, Advanced System Care, IObit Malware Fighter (not running on background and seldomly used) and CCleaner. And I still have my Windows Defender turned on, so, DO having alot of maintenance programs running on
 the background could be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some of my system Specs :</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 32-Bit</p>
<p>Intel Core 2 Quad 2.33 GHz</p>
<p>2 GB Ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some notes :</p>
<p>*Selective startup is selected with "Use original boot configuration" UN-ticked</p>
<p>*System Configuration Boot settings untouched/unchanged</p>
<p>*With Avast and ASC, I scan my system alot like 5-10 times a day, so NO virus. And with Windows Defender and IObit Malware Fighter, NO spywares, adwares or potentially unwanted softwares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any replies will be gladly appreciated :)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haha.. that's actually kinda funny.. sorry my mistake :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First:</p>
<p>Well, I don't really have a lot of programs activated on startup, to be exact they're only 5 programs and 4 of them are my maintenance programs. When I try to look them up at Task manager, they don't really consume too much memory, so I don't think they're
 the ones causing this. Unless if you are starting up a program, it really takes more memory than usual.. (Does it?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second:</p>
<p>You mean, if I have other antivirus/antimalware programs running, WDefender doesn't scan my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have other antivirus/antimalware programs running, I can't scan/use my WDefender?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>I just performed a clean reinstallation of ASC, IMF, and CCleaner, and somehow things went back to normal. I don't really know what happened. Now when I logon, only 20-50% of memory is being used :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I could still use some help if I'll come across with this again in the future :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>*Note : Sorry if you can't understand my grammar well. After all, it's MY grammar. I can't speak english well..</p>

                    Why are microsoft products so bad these days? Windows 8 seems to be disabling everything bit-by-bit- every time it updates itself I lose a program or functionality.&nbsp; Outlook 2010...&nbsp;Outlook 2013... these programs are laughable and yet you are forced to
 use them because Outlook 2003 is deliberately sabotaged by Windows 8!

            For real. Not to mention the surface tablets are pure garbage. My surface pro doesn't charge half the time. One chord only works for about 2 days and I have to get a different one. Wish I knew this was such a piece of sh*t before I bought it. And the windows
 people won't even do anything because it charges fine at the store.&nbsp;
