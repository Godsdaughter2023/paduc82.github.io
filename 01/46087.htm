<p><strong>Hello this is my first thread but I can not find a solution for this problem it seems no one really knows what to do, but firstly about last year my CD drive stopped working and I gave up on it, I have recently tried switching CD drives with one
 I had picked up and it as well does not solve the problem, so I thought it may be the motherboard that was causing this problem, but I had borrowed my roommates external hard drive which is connected to a USB port and the same error message occurs when I try
 using a cd through it, so I am guessing there is something else wrong, would any one be able to help me, if so that would be fantastic thank you!</strong></p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Did this computer originally have another version of Windows and did not come with Windows 7?<br />
If it did not come with Windows 7 did the drive ever function properly after the installation?<br />

<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Xbox wont display on my tv - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tenacious tubby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox wont display on my tv</h2>
                    
<p>So let me tell you a little story....a long time ago when xbox one was released I got one on black Friday. brought it home and played ryse on my old hd tv (sanyo)&nbsp;that I had for years and played my 360 on before. played great, initial set up was a breeze,
 a few days later I ordered a brand new shiny big hd tv (element). got my new console and my new tv and I was a happy man until about a month ago...</p>
<p>The backlight in my tv blew up so I had to go back my older hd tv. I thought, no big deal, at least I can still play. boy was I wrong. My xbox for some reason wont display on my old tv. I know it used to before and I don't know why it wont now.</p>
<p>so here are some details. on my older tv, the sanyo, I know the hdmi ports are working and the hdmi&nbsp;cable is working, I used them both the day before. the day my backlight went out in the new tv, I could still see the unlight image of my xbox in the screen
 playing netflix, so I know the xbox was still working after the tv blew up.</p>
<p>I talked to a lady from customer support that thought I didn't know how to hook up&nbsp;my hdmi cables. she was no help. I really don't know what to do at this point. I haven't been able to play for over a month. I read something about resetting the xbox to display
 on lower resolutions but I cant remember or find it now. hopefully someone can help me figure this out. im sure i'll get a new tv soon but I would still like to play my xbox until then.</p>

<p>Power the xbox off, press and hold.both the eject and xbox button on the xbox until you hear the power on tone and then let go of the buttons.</p>

<p>OutboundTuna73 to get the best support you would really be best off creating your own thread.</p>
<p>however just a couple of things to check.</p>
<p>The hdmi lead is in the output hdmi port on the xbox and not the input ? trust me this is easily done</p>
<p>Try this blind guide into the settings that I usually give to people who have changed the output resolution but I can't guarantee it will work for you.</p>
<p>Power the xbox on and the controller on but DO NOT touch any buttons or the dpad or thumbsticks.</p>
<p>Using the dpad only make the following movements and button presses</p>
<p>press the menu button on the controller</p>
<p>down twice on the dpad</p>
<p>press A</p>
<p>right three times on the dpad</p>
<p>down once on the dpad</p>
<p>press A</p>
<p>press A</p>
<p>down once on the dpad</p>
<p>press A</p>
<p>Let me know how that goes for you..</p>

<p>Ok. You have did all the things to try to avoid him. I would ask him why do you keep following and freezing me and if he tell you then try to sort it out. If he keeps following you i would contact the Enforcement Team again and see what they can do... Hope
 you get this taken care of ;)</p>

spoolsv.exe takes all power of one core from mu CPU (core 2 duo). I've got Windows 7 Professional x86 Polish. I attached some screenshoots that could be helpful. Sorry for my poor english.<br />

            Hey&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Yeah Spoolsv.exe is a service that Uses a lot of cache even when its not required.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a fix for that :-&gt;</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>
<ol>
<li>
Go to&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>
</li><li>
In the Control Panel window, first double-click on&nbsp;<strong>Administrative Tools</strong>&nbsp;and then on&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>.
</li><li>
In the right pane of the Services window locate and right-click on&nbsp;<strong>Print Spooler</strong>&nbsp;and then select&nbsp;<strong>Stop</strong>.
</li><li>
After you have stopped this process, leave the Service window open. Now open My Computer and navigate to the following folder.<br />
<strong>c:\windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS&nbsp;</strong>- in Windows Vista, XP, 98/95/ME
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
or</p>
<p>
<strong>c:\winnt\system32\spool\PRINTERS&nbsp;</strong>- in Windows NT\2000</p>
</li><li>
Delete all the files in the&nbsp;<strong>Printers</strong>&nbsp;folder. After deleting the files in this folder, go back to&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;window, right-click on&nbsp;<strong>Print
 Spooler</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>start</strong>to re-enable the service.
</li></ol>

            <p>I also need to do this.&nbsp; I would like instructions for manually restoring a corrupt Windows 10 installation back to a previous OS - in this case back to Windows 7.&nbsp; The machine will no longer boot into Windows 7 nor Windows 10 but is stuck in an endless
 bootup loop.&nbsp; I need to do this without any graphical interface from within Windows but manually by accessing the hard drive on a secondary machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize part of the instructions are to access the hard drive and rename the folders within the Windows.old folder to their former names and rename the current Windows folder (which is the corrupt Win10 in this case) to something else, however I need the
 correct information to restore the boot ini and boot sector so it will boot into Windows 7 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Sumit Dhiman2 noted, this article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971760</a> does not contain the correct information about the boot restoration for Windows
 7.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Fetching files from Hard disk</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>In W10 hard disks starts to turn every single time you fetch a file inside them. I think its harmful if you use your PC for many hours a day, specially when you have more than one hard disk. It will decrease hard disk's life time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I true?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this able to change? What you suggest?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you run PC for long time it ideally leads to hard drive crash. You have to turn computer
<strong>Off </strong>in a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will not decrease the life time of the hard disk, but it leads to crash. It again depends upon the what kind of files are stored and what are the Antivirus scanners you use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</div>
<div>If I hit numlock button, then press keypad, it dings and nothing happens (apparently off state)</div>

<div>If I press numlock key again numbers work. How do I leave numlock turned on and remain "ON" even if I hit the numlock key 1000 times. &nbsp;</div>

    <title>Unable to open video shortcut in maximized Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calvin-pc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open video shortcut in maximized Windows Media Player</h2>
                    I have a problem and can't seem to find the answer, I have a video shortcut on my desktop and the same video file in my documents folder, if I view this video via clicking on the desktop shortcut or the file in documents it is the same, windows media player
 is about 2x 2 1/2 in's in size I can click to maximize the viewer and view it and that is ok. But if I click and open the video it is small as I said 2x 2 1/2 inches in size, in windows in the past I could stretch the viewer making sure that it was not maximized,
 stretch it to almost full screen but not maxed, then view the video then click the close button top right corner, the next time I clicked on the video/WMP it open it, it&nbsp;would be the same size as I stretched it, now in 8.1 it will not I have tried it 10 times
 it will always open to small box. Is that only because I have a shortcut for the video on my desktop, I have 64 bit windows 8.1. I have never had this problem in 15 years of windows? Can you tell me why?

We have tried to reproduce the issue. The issue seems to be by design. How ever as a work around, you can try the following registry fix.<br />
</span><span><br />
1) click Start button.<br />
2) Type: regedit and press Enter.<br />
3) Find the following iterm:<br />
<br />
<b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\P references<br />
</b><br />
4) Right click VideoZoom and click modify.<br />
5) Set the value to 300 or above.<br />
6) If you don’t find VideoZoom right click on the empty space and create a new string value and name it as VideoZoom, then Set the value to 300 or above.<br />
7) Now launch Windows Media Player to see if it works.<br />

They also have a free support forum should you need any assistance with the player:

I changed the value from 64 to 320 and it did not work I still open it it is small on my desktop, I stretch it and then close it, then open it again and it is still small, did not work. I found the problem after I changed the value in regedit you just right
 click on the video while it is playing go to video, change video to player etc, 200%. It is still for some reason not doing the same as in past years but close enough you see I like to show people video's and if I click to open it on my desktop it starts to
 play and I miss the first part of the video because I have to stretch it or maximize it and I do not like to do all of that&nbsp;I like to stretch it to the size I want and then it opens to that size and plays. Problem solved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>The file you want was available through Windows update on 7 (but not on 8 or 10).&nbsp;&nbsp;You can download it from here:
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You have to use Internet explorer (not any other browser) and accept the add-in when prompted.&nbsp; It isn't clear but you want the Windows 7 version and the larger one if you are running 64 bit or the smaller if you are 32 bit.</p>

<h2>            Re-installing windows XP to a TINY &#40;OLD&#41; computer</h2>
                    
<p>I have eventually purchased a new PC, and wanted to re-build the old PC for web access,&nbsp;as over the years boot up went from 1 min to 20 mins. I had a XP system disk, so backed up my hard drive (nero), and reformattted. The disk could not be read, then the
 restore would not boot (no operating system). Having searched on the web, it appears I could use another XP install disk, so long as I supply the licence key. I obtained a XP home edition (sp2) install disk, that worked upto licence kiey entry, which was discarded
 at invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My licence key on the computer sticker states ????? ????? ????? ????? ?????, but this is displayed as invalid. How do I re-use this licence key, or do I need a different install disk? or do I throw away this PC, as I didn't purchase a recovery disk, from
 a company that is now out of business?</p>

<div><span><strong><span>Probably too late now but modify your post to eliminate the license key</span></strong>.&nbsp; Never post a license key on the internet.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Exactly what happened when you tried to use the original XP CD.&nbsp; Have you tried to just copy the files from the disk onto the hard drive of another computer to see if the disk is in fact bad (read errors on the disk.)&nbsp; I
 would assume that you attempted to boot from the XP disk and not try to install from within Windows.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>You need the same version of disk for the version of XP that was originally installed.&nbsp; The key may work with a generic OEM installation disk from Microsoft but you may also need the original XP "bios locked" version of
 the installation media.&nbsp; </span></div>

Damn, see how fast it can get out there.&nbsp; I forgot to dump it when I replied.&nbsp; Went back and removed it but the key has been propagated to almost all newsgroups by now.&nbsp;<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You say the drive does have a hidden partition, if so then you should also have a copy of the rebuild to factory specs on there.&nbsp; See whatever documentation you have to determine how to access it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also if you are using an OEM license key (the one on the bottom or back of the computer on the MS Sticker) then you will need an OEM version of XP as a retail version probably won't work.&nbsp; Any other generic OEM install disk should work
 but those labeled with Dell, Gateway, HP, etc. probably won't work with your key.</div>

<h3> jujugogo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to router via Wi-Fi</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 and can't connect to my router via Wi-Fi from my laptop. There is nothing wrong with the router as I can connect to it with any other device just fine. I'm currently connected to it via Ethernet and it works just fine, though I
 have a very short cord. The wireless connection says unidentified connection when I move my cursor over the internet logo (in addition to my wired connection) and when I look at from the list of wireless connections it says the name of my router and right
 under "No internet, secured.". Might I also add that it was working for a bit. It also shows the little ! in a yellow triangle in the corner of the wireless logo.

And if you do not have a Vista DVD to do a Startup Repair(most computers do not come with a Disk these days), here is how to make a Startup Repair disk:<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span>Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the
 Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Above link shows what the process looks like, and a how-to, as it loads to the Repair Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />
<br />
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Vista does not use ntldr, that is an XP (or prior) remnant. Boot the system with the Vista disk, run a startup repair to correct the error.

    <title>My administrator account has been downgraded to a guest account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My administrator account has been downgraded to a guest account</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
MS Vista Ultimate SP2 32-bit<br />
All latest updates and patches applied<br />
Intel Core2 Duo 2.4GHz<br />
4GB RAM<br />
<br />
I went to uninstall a program a couple of days ago and when presented with the UAC confirmation to enter&nbsp;a password, I could only click on cancel (OK was greyed out and there was nowhere to type a password). I reset the computer, same issue. I checked my user
 account under Control Panel &gt; User Accounts, and noticed that under my username, it said I was using a guest account (!). Problem is, this has always been an administrator account.<br />
<br />
I went into Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management &gt; Local Users and Groups &gt; Users to check what was going on with the account. Under the Member Of tab, it says that the only group I'm in is Debugger Users. If I check the Guests group membership,
 only the default Guest account is a member.<br />
<br />
I reset the computer, pressed F8 and went into the repair mode to system restore back a few days. This didn't fix anything, so I system restored back one week - the point when I can be absolutely sure I successfully confirmed an action with UAC as an administrator.
 Still no resolution.<br />
<br />
The default administrator and guest accounts were disabled when I purchased the computer and I never enabled them. As I was only in the Debugger Users group and not the Administrators group, I only ever created this one account - therefore even in repair mode,
 I can't log in as an administrator to change the user group setting for this account.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to get this account back to a point where User Accounts sees what the Computer Management snapin sees, ie., that I'm&nbsp;NOT a member of the guest group, but instead a member of Debugger Users (which I'm lead to believe is one step below a full-blown
 admin)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<p><span>Hi
<span>shehaal,<br />
</span><br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
The built-in Administrator account is disabled by default in Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if no other administrative accounts exist on the system it may be enabled.
</span></p>
<p><span>If it is, you will see an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen in Safe Mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Log in and then go to Control Panel&gt;User Accounts and change the type of account.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try creating a new user account with Administrative privileges as the user account might be corrupted and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the below link which talks about how to create a new user account:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Create a new user account:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start Button, and then click Control Panel.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Classic View in left panel.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Double-click User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Manage another use account.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click Create a new account, and type the name.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. Choose account type as Computer administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>7. Click Create Account.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>8. Log off and log on with the new account.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur, use this profile instead of the problematic one. Follow the steps below to transfer personal data.
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Transfer user profile:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. Log on as the new user account (make sure the new user account has administrator privilege).</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the Start menu, and click Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the Organize button on the left top corner and choose Folder and Search Options.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4. Under View tab, check the "Show hidden files and folders" box and click OK to save settings.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Navigate to the C:\Users\(old user name) folder.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: The "old user name" refers to the user name of your old account. For example, if the user name of your old account is "Larry", the folder should be C:\Users\Larry.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Copy all files and folders in the C:\Users\(old user name) folder to the C:\Users\(new user name) folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: To copy all files, we can press Ctrl+A, and then Ctrl+C in the C:\Users\(old user name) folder. After that, navigate to the C:\Users\(new user name) folder, click Ctrl+V. Replace
 them with the new files.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also try SFC scan:<br />
<br />
The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start and then type cmd in the Start Search box.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue
</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
4. Hit Enter.<br />
<br />
The SFC scan should replace the corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps you, Good Luck.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,
<br />
Manasa P-Microsoft Support.</span></p>

<h2>            I Don&#39;t Like Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I don't understand this new OS. Why does everything have to have an account? Why can't I just turn on my computer and have my games and programs on my computer and use them in the privacy of my own home without having to sign in to some stupid Xbox account
 to play a simple game of solitaire? I don't want a gamertag, I'm 47 years old and I use my computer mostly as a tool to do work and send emails. I don't want to be a part of some community that opens me up to a bigger threat of being hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did they remove the games from the computer? I used to just click on games and choose the one I want to play and play it. Now I can't even find the games except for the stupid xbox app which for the life of me I can't understand how an adult is even
 the slightest bit interested and why Microsoft assumes that a grown man with real world priorities and interest would need, want or enjoy having a childs distraction being a major part of their PERSONAL computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like new technology just as much as the next guy, but please stop forcing me to participate in the dumb down society that apparently is content with remaining in&nbsp;a childhood state&nbsp;and stop forcing me to participate in groups by forcing me to signup for
 an account to use programs on my computer. I want to be able to buy a product and then never having to need the company that said product was purchased from in order to use it. What's next I buy a house and I have to sign in to an account in order to open
 the door? Or buy a car and have to sign in to an account to start the engine? What is it with the world today that every wants to be controlled and coddled? No one wants to be in control of their own lives and it seems like everyone needs a babysitter to make
 it through the day. I wish I was born in the&nbsp;twenties because I don't like where things are headed. I wouldn't be able to experience the exciting advances of todays world but at least I'd be my own man and be surrounded by stronger people that&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;allow
 themselves to corralled like a heard of sheep.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I see what saying reality is you can have an older&nbsp;os or you can have 10 without an account no bells or whistles a retail copy of office plus any browsers and third party software you want. To make money ms offers services that require an account or money.
 Due to hacking all OS require updates which paid developers fix. All of the new services that use personal information can be turned off.

            I agree entirely with all the comments. I had ME and XP which were great, I suffered VISTA which was a disaster. I bought a laptop with 8.1 which was so appalling that I sold it on ebay within a week losing £100 but at least it got rid of it.&nbsp; I then bought
 a Windows&nbsp;7 downgrade for my Vista laptop which worked great until that laptop died.&nbsp; I thought that windows 10 could not be that bad so I bought another new laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; W R O N G !!!!!!! It is interfering, account driven, includes nothing of any value, just
 useless trial software and is no better protected. I even got hacked trying to install Windows office. I phoned for windows support ONLY AVAILABLE AT A PRICE.&nbsp; TESCO support was absolutely brilliant and helped me out of a hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will downgrade to Windows
 7 again and buy a MAC next time.&nbsp; DO MICROSOFT NEVER LEARN.
