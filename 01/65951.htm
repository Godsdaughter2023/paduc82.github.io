<h2>            Military and the Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I was going to purchase the Xbox one over the PS4, but when I started hearing that you at least have to be connected online once every 24 hours, that right there said I'm going to the PS4. I'm in the military and travel alot, and most of the time we don't
 get the joys of internet. To purchase a system for 500 dollars and not be able to enjoy it with my fellow soldiers (like we did with the Xbox 360........We played the hell out of it in Afghanistan) (lots of Deathmatches with Call Of Duty Black Ops, Halo ODST,and
 Modern Warfare 2.......Yes we played War games in a War zone) So now Xbox has lost my interest,,,,,, We want a gaming machine not a friggen TV box (already have one of those) I admit the games look awesome, but Xbox one not for me. I will continue using my
 360 until that becomes obsolete. Thanks Microsoft for warning me as to not buy your sytem. Also the other thing that helped me decide was the fact that if I bought a used game I would have to rebuy a new code to play the game. Hell No, what is this a friggen
 PC.......Microsoft lost another Fan over to the Dark side</p>

<p>[/quote]I agree.&nbsp; You know its one thing to miscalculate and realize, "Hey you know that wasn't such a great idea.&nbsp; Lets change things a bit here."&nbsp; But MS shows too much pride and conceitedness here lately to where the ONLY way that they will change anything
 is when it affects financials.&nbsp; Then They would&nbsp; come out and say, "We feel we are right with this approach, however due to customer feed back (as well as crappy sales figures) we decided to change some things."&nbsp; They always have to get in "Hey we are right
 you are wrong.&nbsp; But we'll do it your way since you won't buy our product."&nbsp; You watch, I am almost certain this is how it will go down.</p>

<p>Whereas we (I'm in the Navy) may be provided internet access, it will be heavily restricted for security reasons. They will grant access to such things as personal email and facebook or skype (rarely) but we won't have the ability to connect our personal
 laptops/game consoles to the pipe for personal unrestricted use. The military does care about our morale and as such tries to provide realistic solutions where possible but what the Xbox One is requiring isn't something that soldiers/sailors will be able to
 provide. It just won't happen. We can only use our consoles/laptops in an offline state unless someone is using an unsanctioned hook-up.. which is a big BIG no-no.</p>

<p>Mattrick just basically diss the crap out of our active duty men and women how nice of him to do that. Umm internet in the Middle East is not made for the military to use on gaming it's mad restricted for that. It was made for personnel use "yes", but for
 family skyping and conference type deal with other military personnel and other means of communication, definitely not for gaming. Take that head out your *** before you speak soldier.
</p>
<p>I didn't even mention how they are changing to money instead of points after all these years of the same complaints now they decide to change it. Great way on trying to steer consumers away from the real big issues. Which is out right ownership for the consumers
 who are buying these games. We the people understand every company is here to make a profit, but be realistic with the things you do. All that analyzing and what Apple has been doing crap will not work with the consumers. We tell you what we want either you
 listen or don't and the outcome will show. </p>
<p>If they delete this post which I pretty damn sure they will I'll just go on any other site that will show this and it will show that I do have a point and you know it's wrong what your doing at MS. Stop giving us B.S. and stop the money hungry schemes.
</p>
<p>Another thing "Don't use the men and women who are serving our country as a means of explanation to your money hungry schemes."

<h2>            Display shown at bottom of screen</h2>
                    When I open a window within a window...i.e., looking at houses on Trulia.com. When I click to make the picture larger and look at the photos for a house, the header info for the house is at the top of the screen (normal), the screen is black and the bottom
 inch or so on the display shows the top inch of the photo. It also will continue clicking through all of the photos, but of course I can't see them.

            <p>Try (if even only as a test) downloading an alternative browser such as Firefox and try the site with that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More than a few sites have problems with IE11, Microsoft made several changes with its release but with some twisted logic it is the sites fault they do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;web designers I know all complain they spend more time trying to get their site working with IE properly than with all the other browsers put together (and that includes Safari).</p>

            Thanks for your help. I use both IE and Chrome. It was working fine up to a few days ago and then this started happening. I did bring it up on Firefox, and you're right, it does work there. But I really would like it to work like it did last week on both
 Chrome and IE. Was there and update in the last few days?

            <p>If you recieved the notification to reserve the Windows 10 upgrade, you will notice the following disclaimer in the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc588d18-6166-4c1e-a9b0-523fff66e109" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Yes, free. This limited time upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial.
<strong>3GB download required, internet services frees may apply.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you are able to download on a metered connection, overage charges can be significant cost. If you have the option of doing this, make sure you monitor your connection by ensuring it is set to Metered.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Understanding overage charges and data allotment:</strong></p>
<p>If you are on a metered connection or monthly data plan, because of the size of the download which is about 2.7 to 3.5 GBs, you might incurr additional data charges if you go over your limit.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>For instance, suppose your data allotment per month is 2 GBs from your Internet Service Provider.</li><li>The Windows 10 download is 3 GBs.</li><li>You download Windows 10 on your 2 GB plan, if you go over the 2 GB allotment, the ISP might charge you for the extra MBs used, which is 1 GB.</li></ul>
<p>The ISP might charge extra premium for the additional data you used. For instance, my ISP charges 25 cents per MB for every MB outside of my data alotment of 1 GBs. This means&nbsp;I have to carefully manage my data and ensure it does not go over 1 GB or I will
 be charged for it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are some of the options you have for downloading Windows 10 affordably?</strong></p>

<span>Hi Answerable,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Are you experiencing this only with online videos?</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to play the videos in Windows<span>&nbsp;</span>Media Center and check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the computer becomes low on memory whenever you run certain programs, one or more of those programs might have a memory leak. To stop a memory leak, you need to close the program.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To determine which program is using the most memory, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open Task Manager by right-clicking the
 taskbar, and then clicking<strong>Start Task Manager</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the<strong>Processes</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To sort programs by memory usage, click<strong>Memory
 (Private Working Set)</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>

<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list See if HP Scan to PC is listed there, uncheck it you find it 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />

    <title>windows 10 password unrecognised - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janzell  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 password unrecognised</h2>
                    I have been using windows 10 on my desktop and laptop for a couple of months without problem.&nbsp; My desktop worked fine last sunday.&nbsp; On Monday my laptop would not recognise the password on the log in screen so the laptop was unusable.&nbsp; the IT guys at work
 reset it back to factory settings.&nbsp; When I came home yesterday (Friday) my desktop has the same problem i.e. will not recognise the password so I cannot use the desktop.&nbsp; I do not have a password reset disk.&nbsp; Microsoft tech help have said I will need to reset
 the desktop and loose all my files.&nbsp; This is not an option as my back up (the laptop) has been wiped so I currently have no backup for my files.&nbsp; Surely there must be a way to restore access without such a drastic measure?

<h2>            Wireless mouse not working after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if anyone has any answers to this but I hope someone does! Okay so I use a wireless Microsoft mouse, it worked perfectly fine on Windows 8.1 and previously on Windows 10 but all of the sudden when I turn my mouse on now there is a serious lag
 with it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mouse pad works perfectly fine so I know it isn't a pointer issue, and I've tried updating my mouse (but it was on the current driver or it), I've tried changing the battery in it but that did not help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions or answers please let me know!!</p>

            Thanks, but before I do this, I want to be sure it will not affect my touchpad as well.&nbsp; For awhile, after I upgraded to Windows 10, neither device worked.&nbsp; After rebooting, they both worked for a bit, then the mouse quit.&nbsp; I have reinstalled twice with
 no luck.&nbsp; For awhile it showed my mouse paired, but it didn't work. I removed it again, and now it is asking for a CODE that I have never had to install it again

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
Perform the following methods and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update service and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Click on <b>Start</b>, type <b>services.msc</b> and hit <b>Enter</b>.<br />
b. Locate <b>Windows Update</b>.<br />
c. <b>Right click</b> on the service and select <b>Properties</b>.<br />
d. In Start-up type, select <b>Enable</b>.<br />
e. Click <b>Start </b>under <b>Service </b>status.<br />
f. Click <b>OK</b>.<br />
g. <b>Repeat the steps c to f for the following services also</b>: </span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</b><br />
<b>Cryptographic Services</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the steps do not help resolve the issue, then you may proceed with the methods mentioned below and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></b><span><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Your antivirus software may be conflicting with Windows Updates. You can test this by temporarily disabling your antivirus:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Disable Anti-virus software<br />

</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Note</b>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it
 as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: </span></b></p>

<h2>            Games for Windows Live and Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>about two years or so ago I purchased Fable 3 and installed it activated it on my acconut at GfWL.
</p>
<p>And then my PC crashed so I got a new one and thought it would be awesome to play Fable 3 again.</p>
<p>I installed it signed into my Live account after getting a new password and now when I enter the product key it says this key was already used on a diffrent account.</p>
<p>So any suggestions/help?</p>
<p>Please and thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: Don't know if this is the right category...</p>

<p>That is the exact tutorial I followed in the first place to create the task and I get the exact same problem. I thought that I could then just schedule to give me a reminder (which was simpler) but I still get the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that the computer does not start. Let's try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows 10 ISO using Media Creation Tool
</a></strong>(using another computer) </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you have downloaded Windows 10 ISO, use the <strong>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows USB/DVD download tool</a></strong> to transfer the ISO to USB flash drive to make it a bootable device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>Please ensure there is no data in the USB flash drive before making it bootable. If there is any data in the USB flash drive, please save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Switch off the computer and insert the bootable flash drive and switch on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Change the boot device priority and set <strong>USB Drive</strong> as the first bootable device, check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Procedure to enter BIOS settings&nbsp;vary depending on the manufacturer. Usually, you must press a key (such as
<strong>F2, F12, DEL, ESC</strong>) or a key combination immediately after you turn on your computer but before Windows starts.
</span></span></span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
</strong>as the first boot device (use the arrow keys to change the device priority), press
<strong>F10</strong>, select <strong>Yes</strong> to save the settings.<br />
<br />
c. Now your computer restarts, check if you can boot from the <strong>USB Drive</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important: </strong></span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Run repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to refer to steps provided in the article below to run repair after you have created bootable device.

    <title>windows media device centre and RAC 1000 sat nav - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesleygiggins  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows media device centre and RAC 1000 sat nav</h2>
                    <p>When I first bought this sat nav I was using a windows XP. When I connected the two the sat nav software was automatically installed on my PC. Also I had to install Microsoft ActiveSync. After this I could access Route 66's shop etc and check for updates
 for my device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have a windows 7 computer. As I am going away on holiday soon I decided to see if there were any updates I needed. Connecting the sat nav to the PC resulted in the installation of Windows Mobile Device Centre which I had not heard of before.This presented
 me with a list&nbsp; - settings; music &amp; videos; photographs and files. I have no wish to have&nbsp; music, videos, photos and files on my sat nav. I just want it to show me the best routes to take for my journey. However, I could find nothing in that list that enabled
 me to get to the Route 66 and check for updating. The RAC forum reports that I need an installation CD but I never had one in the first place, it installing automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some one who could explain to me in words of one syllabel what Windows Mobile Device Centre is, what it does and how I can check for updates for my sat nav using it ?</p>

Hi, I am attempting to run World of Warcraft on my computer, OS is Windows 7. I have had to reset my comp to factory settings in the past and re-installed the game. It worked fine. Now for some reason, this time, the game will not open to the log in screen.
 It just opens up to the initial "play selection" screen and that won't reopen on any attempt to restart the program. Please advise

    <title>Skype for Business 2016 - Daily Exchange Credential Prompt - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 - Daily Exchange Credential Prompt</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many different posts on this topic and tried all the usual troubleshooting which fails in this case.</p>
<p>We are a small consulting company and I'm O365 tenant admin and all is working fine for me and my 5 team members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that we need to use *another* Skype for Business account (provided by one of our customer), different from our O365 account.</p>
<p>In other words, one account for SIP/chat and another account for Exchange (conversation history).</p>
<p>We log in with the customer account, then after a while, SfB says it can't contact Exchange so we provide our O365 account and everything works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue is that, once a day (time varies slightly but typically around the same time), I am asked again for my Exchange credentials.</p>
<p>The weird part is that, if I provide my Exchange O365 account straight away, it rejects it.</p>
<p>What I need to do is to first re-provide the customer account credential, and *then* my Exchange O365 credentials, and then it's happy again for a day.</p>
<p>And from that point forward, everything works fine again (both SIP/chat with customer + conversation history stored in our O365 tenant account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This looks very much like some kind of authentication token expiration issue.</p>
<p>But it would be good if I hadn't to re-provide *both* credentials in that same order every single day.</p>
<p>The weirdest part is that, among 5 others who do the same thing, only two of us are affected by this "daily prompt for credential, in the right order"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate any help/advice as this is really annoying.</p>
<p>And please, I've seen post answers saying "you're not supposed to have a different account for SIP/Exchange" but it has worked for years and it works fine for other members of my team who only had to provide the two credentials once and for all. So any constructive
 help to achieve this would be very valuable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi EricTabet,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting. According to your description, you are repeatedly prompted for Exchange credentials after you alternately use two Skype for Business accounts. This problem occurs for multiple reasons, and in certain scenarios, it is the expected behavior.
 Skype for Business generally prompts you for credentials only after you're signed in and when it must connect to an external service such as the Microsoft Exchange Free/Busy service or the Exchange Calendar service. As you alternately use two Skype for Business
 accounts on your computer, the Skype for Business might re-connect to the service for different credentials. In this way, it’s recommended for you to use one Skype for Business account in the Skype for Business client of one computer to get a better experience.
 Meanwhile, you can get more information about this related problem by referring to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2298541/you-re-repeatedly-prompted-for-exchange-credentials-after-you-sign-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> (Although it is wrote for Lync, this article is also applying to Skype for Business).<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if you want to switch the accounts to use Skype for Business, we suggest you try to sign out of the Skype for Business (Click the triangle icon next to the gear icon &gt; Select
<strong>File</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Sign Out</strong>). And then, click <strong>
Delete my sign-in info</strong> before you type another Skype for Business account credentials information. Besides, we suggest you clear your cached passwords by following steps (you may need admin right to do this):<br />
<br />
1. Close all Office clients.<br />
2. Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; Click <strong>View by</strong> in the upper right of window&gt; choose
<strong>Large Icons</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>User Accounts</strong> &gt; Click <strong>Manage your credentials</strong> in the left column.<br />
4. Select credentials for Skype for Business and choose <strong>Remove</strong>.<br />
5. Close and reboot your computer.<br />
<br />
If it’s inconvenient for you, it’s recommended to vote the related feedback <a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/11504190-save-different-login-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had mentioned in my post, I did read about the "you are not supposed to have two accounts" replies.</p>
<p>Your suggestion to switch accounts will not allow storing conversations with my customer account inside my O365 conversation history. This is the requirement (able to chat with customer and capture history/meetings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is clear that the ability to use one account for SIP and one for history capture is possible, given that it works today and it also worked with previous versions of Lync (or Communicator even).</p>
<p><br />
So what remains to be answered is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it working for some and not others?</li><li>Why is it working for a full day without requiring credentials and not more than one day?</li><li>Why is it requesting the two credentials in that specific order (and rejects the second one if the first one is not provided)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Based on this observation, it appears that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functionality is already there and is used by many (including in my team, with no issues)</li><li>There is a daily expiration of credentials, even when still valid</li><li>The Exchange credential is rejected if not providing the SIP credential first</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I had already tried the typical troubleshooting (including removing credentials) but this issue remains so I would appreciate help on "How to use the SIP/Exchange accounts" which does not involve an answer that suggest "Do not use two accounts"
 because I do not have any choice. And because we need conversation history on chats with customer, then it cannot be one account and then another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>Again, we were able to do this for years, so this doesn't look like a new feature request. :)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Eric</p>

            Hi EricTabet,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. For some Skype for Business features need to connect to the related Exchange services and may be assisted by the Outlook client in the same Exchange account, it’s not recommended to use multiple accounts in the Skype for Business client
 on the one computer. Meanwhile, it is not feasible to login to multiple accounts in the Skype for Business client on one computer at the same time. In this way, if you use the Skype for Business client by switching between two accounts, it might have hidden
 instability in normal using and may affect some related features. So, you may use the Skype for Business without prompting the Exchange credential request for a period of time or some of your co-workers may not get credential request prompting. And it’s not
 recommended to use the Skype for Business client with two accounts on the one computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If it’s really bothers you, you can try to use the virtual machine software to help you create a virtual environment. In this case, you can use the Skype for Business with another account in the virtual environment you created and it will not affect the actual
 system environment of the same PC.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't "bother" me but what you suggest just does not allow capturing Conversation History for my discussions or meetings with my customer.</p>
<p>That is the issue/requirement and your answer is not helping or addressing it (how would a virtual machine capture conversations from another host?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the time you take to answer.</p>
<p>But your repeated answers with "<strong>not possible</strong>/<strong>not recommended</strong>" do not seem to acknowledge that:</p>
<ol>
<li>This works fine for three other users on our O365 tenant</li><li>This worked fine for me with older version of Lync</li><li>This works fine for me today as well, but only for one day.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion that involves "switching" accounts or "using virtual machine" in parallel (or two computers even!) will not address the requirement to capture conversation history on my O365 account for discussions/meeting with our customer account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I appreciate any help, but not if your third reply also includes "it's not possible" or "it's not recommended" because I have three other users here who do it fine and have been doing it for months/years (and so did I, before upgrading to SfB 2016).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<br />
Thanks for your updates. As I mentioned above, using multiple accounts in the Skype for Business client on the one computer may lead to potential problems and instability, so it’s not an official recommendation for normal using Skype for Business and the problems
 caused by it will not be supported.<br />
<br />
In this way, you can try to manually move the conversation history file from one account to another as workaround. Besides, there are network connection related settings in the virtual machine software. If it’s inconvenient for you, as I suggested above, you
 can <a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">submit a feedback</a> and your comments will be valuable. Your time and understanding are highly appreciated.<br />

<p>Sorry Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You keep repeating the same argument of "not recommended/not possible/not supported" but you do not answer these questions which I already repeated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it working for some and not others?</li><li>Why is it working for a full day without requiring credentials and not more than one day?</li><li>Why is it requesting the two credentials in that specific order (and rejects the second one if the first one is not provided)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You carefully choose to ignore these questions and ignore the fact that it has been working fine for years.</p>
<p>At best, this denotes of inconsistent behvaiour of Microsoft products.</p>
<p>At worse, this looks like actual bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this was recommended/supported, then I wouldn't have any issue and would simply create a support ticket with Microsoft instead of posting a question here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have dozens of meetings and conversations per day.</p>
<p>Suggesting to move then manually one by one is not a helpful answer.</p>
<p>Please refrain from answering a fourth time with the same "it is not recommended" and give a chance to others to respond with constructive comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi EricTabet,<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Question1: Why is it working for some and not others?</strong></em><br />
<br />
As using multiple accounts in the Skype for Business client on the one computer is not an official recommendation for normal using Skype for Business, may lead to potential problems and instability. That’s why it works well for some and not others.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Question2: Why is it working for a full day without requiring credentials and not more than one day?</strong></em><br />
<br />
Just like I mentioned above, when you use multiple accounts in the Skype for Business client on the one computer, it might have hidden instability in normal using and may affect some related features. In this case, it works for a period of time or just doesn’t
 work for your not recommended using. Since it is not consistent with the official recommendation, we won’t support the issue caused by it.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Question3: Why is it requesting the two credentials in that specific order (and rejects the second one if the first one is not provided)?</strong></em><br />
<br />
As it is not an official recommendation about using two accounts in the Skype for Business client on the one computer, there are not related official articles and documents to explain this specific credentials’ sequence.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, If it’s really inconvenient for you when you deal with the conversion history use two accounts in Skype for Business, it’s recommended to
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">submit a feedback</a> about it. Appreciation on your time and understanding.<br />
