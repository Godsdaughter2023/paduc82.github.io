<p>All my friends are online and i have perfect internet connection at my house.....<br />
WTF gives Microsoft, I only have 12 days of gold left and this type of *** is seriously making me want to sell my xbox and buy a ps3 and be done with it.</p>
<p>Whenever I want to use my xbox there is always something wrong on your end..... PS3 is never down and when they are they reimburse there loyal customers with free games..... for this type of service you guys should just go free too since obviously your servers
 are not worth the 60 dollars a year we pay.<br />
<br />
I am so *** sick of Xbox issues on your end and not mine fix your god damn ***!</p>

    <title>Dedicated Servers, Halo MCC and Guardian problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geneworkman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dedicated Servers, Halo MCC and Guardian problems</h2>
                    
<p>To whom it may concern at X-box Live, 343, and Microsoft;<br />
When I purchased Halo MCC, it was with the intent of playing Halo CE, "Free-for-all" online. ( Free-for-all isn't even offered in MCC for Halo one CE.)
<br />
Due to the lack of dedicated servers, I and many others have a difficult time with online play. When I shoot at an opponent, I will be right on target (their forehead). Also, (he hasn't got a power up)with five or six shots, he doesn't die. With one shot he
 can kill me. I have been playing this game since it's inception and have been a very successful player in the past. In Guardians, my player level is in the thirties. Someone with a faster internet speed definitely, always has the advantage in Halo MCC. In
 HALO MCC I had to back my level to 3 or 4, or never win a game ever. (which is no fun). The game will also pair me with a 1 or 2 and put us against levels 47s and 50s! This wouldn't bother me if I was by myself with dedicated servers and nobody had the advantage.
 My download speed is 6.4 mbps and my upload speed is .42 mbps, which seems to work great in Guardians with its dedicated servers. There is nothing I can do about my internet speed since it is the fastest speed offered where I live. This has proven to be an
 extremely miserable experience for me and many other bloggers I have chatted with.<br />
Another blogger wrote the following blog which I am now sharing with you<br />
"In any online game, there needs to be a server that receives and transmits data to all of the players. In most games on consoles, the player with the best connection in a game, will be made the server. Because it is an average user, if their connection is
 not that great, or is interrupted, it can cause lag for all of the players. A dedicated server is a server that is not a player, but rather a dedicated computer connection that everyone connects to with more computing power and a better connection. Dedicated
 servers cost money, player servers don't. I personally think it's a rip off that we pay $60 a year for Xbox live and don't receive dedicated servers... Many computer games use dedicated servers and the users pay nothing."
<br />
Another thing that is sadly missing in Gaurdians and MCC is a custom map mutiplayer choice for regular players to pick. Here, this beautiful forge has been built with awesome maps and map making abilities, but we can't use it for a multiplayer game. So, you
 download or make some great maps and TRY to get people to play, but, as soon as they realize thats what you have invited them to, they quit! And yes, I realize there are sites like HALOFORGE and reddit, etc but they don't work ether. I tried it and no one
 shows up. I would like some answers. a) Are you going to put dedicated servers in HALO MCC? If yes, when? b)Are you going to put Free-for-all in MCC? c)Are you going to put a custom multiplayer choice in both? I am sure many others won't be buying anything
 else until you start paying attention and make these games more enjoyable. <br />
This letter is from a 56 year young adult who is taking the time to try to help you make a better product. (Please pay attention!)</p>

<p>I'm sure this is a major part of the problem I am experiencing with game play. &nbsp;However; I cannot do anything about my internet speed. &nbsp;Dedicated servers, I am sure would help solve the problem. &nbsp;My game play on Guardians is fine since that game uses dedicated
 servers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update is TOO LARGE.</h2>
                    <p>This update isv crazy-large. I -DO-NOT-HAVE available space for this 'update'... I've moved files deleted, compressed and fragmented, still I don't even have HALF the space required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to rethink this Microsoft! You have to, if you want to roll this out to every machine. I still keep getting the annoying pop-up that will never go away and all I can do is mute it, repeatedly. I will never be able to install this update on this
 machine. The programs to run it occupy 4gb alone, and I'm supposed to have 8gb 'available'.....dream on!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, compress this, or rethink this. - This is insanity.....</p>

<p>I agree fully</p>
<p>Just bought a new DELL notebook with windows 10 "installed" only to find when I turned it on and used my phone as a wifi hotspot Microsoft started downloading&nbsp; ""updates"" for the "new" system........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well with a very limited amount of data on my phone (8GB) Microsoft chewed this all up in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>My ISP (Optus) then began adding extra 1 GB for $10 to my phone</p>
<p>This has now got up to extra $60 on my normal monthly bill of $65!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like Microsoft to refund me this amount!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I realised the issue tried to get the updates done on a free WIFI service at a library, and the updates didn't update properly causing me to contact Microsoft Support on two occasions to sort this mess out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have a system to log in remotely took control of the computer and tried to fix the problem...... all to no avail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the troubleshooter said update files corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it tried to fix the issues the download started again and hung at 0%&nbsp; ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>The librarian offered some assistance in that the wifi service wont allow '"Big"" files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fair enough but Microsoft DOES NOT TELL YOU HOW BIG THE 8*%^$$#ING FILES ARE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further Microsoft does not tell you it's downloading things....</p>
<p>Further Microsoft does not have a download indicator saying how many MB of GB left</p>
<p>to go or even how long it might take.... (These things were available in Win XP)</p>
<p>Further there is no way you can disable the automatic download process after you are completely pissed off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While WIN 10 has a few nice features it is a major step backwards in intelligent computing software!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine if you went to a car dealership and bought an expensive new car</p>
<p>You would EXPECT to hop in start the motor and happily drive away. NOT then be told you have to remove and upgrade the engine with new plugs, swap all wheels for slightly larger ones et4c....</p>
<p>
</p><p>C'mon Microsoft -----GET REAL WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS before we simply all go to Google Android Tablets.</p>

<p>that is utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>finally, that stupid update actually installed on mine (not through my doing) ....but anyway, it's no 'better' infact some of the cool features and one of the only apps i actually liked was removed and replaced with an utter crap 3d one, which ofcourse,
 there's no removing.</p>

<p>Let me add my official protest to all of this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a Microsoft user since MS-DOS days, through all of the Windows OSs inclusive of the current operating system, Window 10. I purchased a Dell Inspiron 14-5100 less than a full year ago, equipped with a 32 GB SSD drive. Everything has performed
 as expected up until recently, when Microsoft announced that a new upgrade was ready to be installed. Well, as you all know, because of its enormous size, I don't have enough room available on my drive to accommodate it.&nbsp; And, to top it all off, because I
 can't install it, Microsoft has now stated that no security updates will be allowed for those in the same situation that I am in because they consider my computer and yours unstable and outdated, a real catch-22 situation. It is like we are XP or Vista users
 and are being penalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft/Dell should have put a warning on the cover of their laptops like they do on cigarette boxes saying "warning, do not buy this laptop with a 32 GB drive unless you are prepared to accept its obsolescence when we release the next major upgrade to
 Windows 10".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Satya, who on the Windows team is responsible for this outrageous mishap? As a Microsoft stockholder, I am pleased with what you have done with the company so far. Your move to strengthen and amplify cloud services and your strategy for Microsoft's Office
 products was and is brilliant. However, the move to shut out end users like myself, the faithful Windows users, because they purchased a machine they thought would be viable at least for a couple of years, at the very least, is absolutely unforgivable.&nbsp;</p>

            Add me to the list of frustrated users. My little ideapad has NO ROOM for this, and I'm thoroughly sick of the popup reminders. Geeks rule the world, but don't live in the real world, I'm afraid. Planned obsolescence has always annoyed me, but this is
 ridiculous. And note, no response from headquarters!!!

<p>Seriously, Robert, I would use this tool if it wasn't so blatantly obvious. I don't need setupdiag.exe to tell me what</p>
<p>
</p><p>is so "Captain Obvious" wrong. I have a 32 gig machine with only about 6 gigs left for an update that needs 8 Gigs to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell, HP and all the rest sell these machines and they are great for getting things done. After taking off all the bloatware I was</p>
<p>
</p><p>left with just the 6 gigs above to play with. I am a big Microsoftee and was hoping that Microsoft would break down the latest</p>
<p>
</p><p>update into two parts so I can get the update done. There are other ways around this, I would imagine, but what I said just above</p>
<p>
</p><p>would make the whole process that much easier. Thanks for the tip though.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have used disk cleanup and compression which got me to the 5 or 6 Gigs I have now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I have no more Windows.old either. I am probably going to go the external disk route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am very stubborn and will still try a couple of additional attempts to gain more space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still feel that the Microsoft techies should consider all those users, besides me, who are definitely</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the same boat. There is no reason not to make it easier for the install/upgrade to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, by the way, I just ordered a new machine with a terabyte drive that I will use while I "futz"</p>
<p>
</p><p>around with this issue on my "old" machine.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit &#40;latest Updates applied&#41; on 16GB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdougshelton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit &#40;latest Updates applied&#41; on 16GB Alienware can&#39;t connect to two different networks &#91;with 2 different adapters&#93; at same time</h2>
                    <p>So on this Alienware running all the latest Windows 8.1 PRO updates, I have an Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 AGN internal NIC and a USB-based Linksys AE3000 External NIC - both are Dual-band [i.e., 2.4 GHZ and 5.0Ghz capable], high-speed network adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Cisco Linksys Wireless Router broadcast two different networks: &nbsp;'DOUG", my 2.4Ghz band network, and "DOUG5", my 5.0Ghz network</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I have no problem connecting to both (and **maintaining** the connection) of these on my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1 HP Laptop machine with a similar setup [i.e., with one external dual-band USB NIC - AND - one internal dual-band
 NIC]</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I ALSO have no problem connecting to both of these (and **maintaining** the connections) on my Windows 8.1 [but not Windows **PRO**] Toshiba laptop machine with latest updates - also with a similar setup [i.e., an external USB dual-band
 NIC and an Internal NIC - in this case, single - 2.4 Ghz - band]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have no problem connecting to Either One Of these two networks from my Alienware running Windows Pro 8.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I actually **can** connect to **Both** of them - BUTT - only for about 30 seconds - than some kind of automatic Windows network parse takes place and one or the other of the two adapters is disconnected. &nbsp;FYI - for reasons I have yet to [fully]
 determine, the Intel adapter "prefers" the 5.0 Ghz network ("DOUG5"), and the Linksys "prefers" the 2.4 Ghz network ("DOUG").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Note: &nbsp;on my Alienware machine, these two networks ("DOUG" and "DOUG5")are both configured as "Private" networks, w/o any homegroup. &nbsp;ALSO, Windows "automatically" creates an "actual" network that it gets connected to if both of these adapters are (temporarily)
 connected: &nbsp;"DOUG 2" {note the space between the "DOUG" and the "2"}. &nbsp;I don't know how or why it chooses to "create on its own" this network name (it is **Not** something I am actually "Broadcasting" from my wireless router)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also it is very doubtful it is a compatibility problem: &nbsp;In fact, the Win 8.1 PRO machine runs a Linksys NIC as its USB NIC which is known to be fully compatible with my Linksys router (whereas: my other two laptop USB NICs are **Not** actually Linksys
 NICs, yet they have no problem with having both NICs on their respective laptop machines connecting at once).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts??</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to resolve the issue you have to install the proper drivers by downloading it from the manufacturer's website. Do the same and check if that helps.</p>

            <p>Not really. I can link you the thread where he solved it. Thing is i've NEVER installed folderlock. So i'm a little apprehensive about installing it now. I also can't find an uninstall for it in any part of the registry explorer.</p>

<h3> joeavenetti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps going to desktop while running full screen games</h2>
                    Every time I try to run a game that goes into full screen, or set a game to go into full screen in the settings, my computer immediately jumps back to the desktop with the game still running in the background. Whenever I try to open the game up again,
 it just minimizes again after a few seconds. Some times it takes longer to minimize the game, allowing me to actually play it for a little while, but its really irritating and I want to know how to fix it. I have a new laptop, I got it a few days ago. It has
 Windows 10. Any help would be really appreciated.

            I have tried looking for people with similar problems, and i did find several, but none of their solutions helped me. I haven't tried the app trouble shooter, but the problem hasn't happened since i made the original post. So I'm not sure if I even can
 find the cause of the problem anymore, since its stopped happening on its own.

<p>I have an HDTV that displays up to 1080p. I have the the 1st Gen xbox 360. I was wonderning If I bought the VGA Cables and Plugged it in my TV because it has the option to serve as a Monitor would I be playing in HD and Also would I be able to hear out the
 TV because It offers the L and R output so I wouldnt have to use speakers ! If anyone can tell me Im confused !! or should I just buy HD cables??</p>

<p>The VGA cable supports up to 1920x1080 output. It'll be "HD".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and get a quality VGA cable - Microsoft's or another brick and mortar retailer package you can return if needed. The cheap knock-offs available at Monoprice and third party sellers on Amazon tend to ghost badly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Your 360 is gonna die. Non-HDMI designs are pretty bad from a reliability standpoint.</p>

<p>You can connect the VGA cable's audio outputs to your TV or to an AV receiver. Whatever you prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VGA cable has L/R analog audio outputs just like the Component or Compsite cable, as well as an optical output port on the housing like the Component cable used to.</p>

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A misconfiguration with a device driver is a possible cause of the issue you're experiencing with the Xbox app. I will need additional information to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this the first time you encountered the issue?</li><li>Is the issue isolated to the Xbox app?</li><li>Have you tried using a different sound setup and see if the same issue occurs?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Have you installed the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update Windows 10">latest updates</a></strong> for Windows 10?</li><li>Can you tell me the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 device? You can find this information by clicking the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>To determine if the sound issue is caused by a software conflict, I recommend performing a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when
 you run a certain app. For the steps on how to perform a clean boot in Windows 10, please refer to this

<h2>            Windows 10 seems to be coming apart at the seams</h2>
                    <p>I'm finding that ever since Microsoft forced the Win10 upgrade on my homebuilt PC (originally window 7 professional), it seems aas though it's becoming less and less stable:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;It will not shut down without a hard reboot (it just spins until I hit the button) or restarts.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;It will not let me uninstall profgrams.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">If I have understood right, you are able to find the E:\ drive in the File Explorer but not in the File History Wizard. In this case, it could be an issue with
 the File history. I would suggest you to try these steps:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 1: Reselect your drive</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Since, you deleted the files in E drive recently, it is possible that you might have accidently deleted some configuration file needed by File History. I would
 suggest you to reselect the File history drive and check. Refer to the “Reselect your File History drive” section in this article:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-something-goes-wrong-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-something-goes-wrong-file-history</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 2:
</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If File History is still not detecting the drive, then I would suggest you to select another drive for back up and then once again change it back to E:\ drive and
 check. Refer to the “Select a different File History drive’ section in this article:</font></p>

            The E drive could be a card reader or usb slot in your printer or on another computer. It can appear and disappear without being anything to worry about. Also the letter can change--E today and F tomorrow depending on what drives are active. Windows sees
 everything as a drive--usb ports, card slots, thumb drives, etc.&nbsp;

            I have already tried all these, but it doesn't work.&nbsp; These links don't address the problem.&nbsp; The repair drive connection option doesn't come up.&nbsp; Reconnect drive doesn't come up and someone suggested designating a file named File History in D and then
 going out and coming back and trying to access E for file history and that doesn't work either. I am sure you are correct in that I deleted something when I erased the files.&nbsp; For the life of me I can't make it come back.&nbsp; I went to system restore to the last
 time it worked, 05/14/2013, and it won't restore at that time either.&nbsp; What the computer is calling E drive is internal and it is there, and I can access files on it, but only through 05/14 and when I try to run file history, it says it has been disconnected
 too long and reconnect it, but no instructions on how.&nbsp;

            I have been going over your suggestions once again, and it says "file history does not recognize this drive.&nbsp; Select another drive."&nbsp; I can't get it to do anything.&nbsp; Does this really matter at all if I am backing up on an external drive also?&nbsp; If this
 is just a partition and not a real drive, why does it show so much space?&nbsp; Actually it shows the same (almost) as the C drive shows....

 the<strong>Device Manager</strong> dialog box, expand <strong>Sound, video, and game controllers</strong>.<br />
<br />
If there is a speaker icon next to the sound driver, the driver is installed. If there is a yellow question mark next to the sound driver, the driver is not present or will not load.</span></p>

<h2>            monitor suddenly displays fuzzy</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday (Nov 26) when I came into work in the morning my PC was off (not usual).&nbsp; Once I got it booted up (Windows 10) and was typing in a Word document, the screen suddenly looked different.&nbsp; The text is fuzzy and the proportions of the text just doesn't
 look right.&nbsp; Everything looks wrong -- not just Word.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really annoying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I bump a keyboard shortcut to change the way the monitor displays?&nbsp; If so, what's the shortcut so I can get it back to normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all kinds of keyboard combinations.&nbsp; I tried updating the monitor's driver.&nbsp; I played with the display settings.&nbsp; Nothing has made it look normal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(at work I'm the only employee and we have no tech support)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - delete user profile picture</h2>
                    <p>I'm a new user to Windows 10.&nbsp; When I select Start Menu&gt;(right click on my profile picture)&gt;Change Account Settings I cannot delete my user picture.&nbsp; I tried selecting another system picture and that worked OK.&nbsp; But now I have the system picture next to
 my picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete both pictures but I cannot find any option for deleting.&nbsp; The only option I have is to Browse for more pictures.&nbsp; Is there a system default folder for these pictures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I delete the pictures from my Start Menu&gt;(right click on my profile picture)?&nbsp; I tried Control Panel&gt;User Accounts and Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Your Account too, but no delete picture option there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would like to find where on the hard drive these pictures are located.&nbsp; They are not under %user%&gt;pictures anywhere.</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p><span>Your frustration is understandable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Through research, I found the following locations for “default pictures” on my C:\ drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please note, however, that you have to have “hidden” and “system files” turned on in your view setting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(File Explorer Options/View).<span>&nbsp; </span>I found the options by typing “hidden files” in the Search Windows panel, and “show hidden files and folders” popped up in the Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My default pictures are found in these three locations.<span>&nbsp; </span>I deleted the picture of me that I didn’t want to appear in my user profile.<span>&nbsp; My default picture was in all three locations.&nbsp; Play with it and see if it solves your issue.&nbsp;
</span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Stream games from Xbox One to PC.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own Battlefield 4 and all the expansions on Xbox One. Recently, I wanted to experience it on PC. I looked at the "Xbox play anywhere" page, but I guess some games are not shared between platforms and I did not see the "owned" tag under the game. It did
 show that I own the premium pass and all the expansions, though. I bought the game in the windows store on my PC, but when I clicked "install on my devices" it only gave me the option to download it on my Xbox. What happened?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><span>***Modified title from: Not given the option to download on pc***</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">***Moved from: Windows 10/ Microsoft Store***</span></em></p>

<p>I think the confusion comes because when you saw the game on Microsoft Store you assumed it was for PC. If you would scroll down on game details page, just above the description it will show "Available On", and for Battlefield 4 it is Xbox One only. Also
 the premium pass and expansions you saw that displayed as you own already were also on Xbox one and not on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC version of Battlefield 4 is not available from Microsoft Store and has to be bought from EAs Origin Store or Steam.</p>

<p>Other Errors I have been getting that are not in the list are:</p>

<p>And why in the column labeled "What it means and how to fix it"&nbsp;does it say "might mean" ?</p>
<p>Doesn't anyone at Microsoft actually KNOW what the error codes mean ?</p>
<p>And why doesn't the error message say what it means and how to fix it ?</p>
<p>Why a code ?</p>

    <title>WD My Passport Ultra Inaccessible on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evilangelus  say:</h3>
<h2>            WD My Passport Ultra Inaccessible on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just got a brand new Lenovo Flex&nbsp;14 Laptop with Windows 10 and am unable to use/access the content on the WD My Passport Ultra external drive that I have all my stuff from my old Macbook&nbsp;backed up on.<br />
<br />
When I first plugged the drive into the Lenovo, it was instantly recognized and added.&nbsp;<br />
It appears in 'Devices and Printers' and 'Device Manager' but not in 'Devices and Drives' in File Explorer nor in Disk Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update the drivers via 'Device&nbsp;Manager' but it said it was already up to date and in 'properties' is says "This disk is working properly" and I don't have a new chord to try at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to reformat it because I believe that would erase the data and that defeats my purpose. I want to access what's on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other options? How do I fix this?</p>
<p>I don't know the encoding of the drive, I'm afraid I'm not IT savvy. If you need that or any other information, you'll need to instruct me on how to obtain it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S Tried it on my&nbsp;old Acer, which also has Windows 10 and can't access it from there either, so it's definitely&nbsp;a Windows thing.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi EvilAngelus
<br />
<br />If that drive was formatted on a Mac, most likely the file system is HFS+ which will be un-readable on a PC
<br />
<br />If that is the case, you will need to connect that drive to a Mac and copy your data back onto the Mac. Then format the drive to either ExFAT or FAT32, then copy the data back onto the drive
<br />
<br />If that drive is formatted to ExFAT or FAT32, then both the Mac and your new laptop will be able to access the files . . .

<p>I have no idea what it's formatted to tbh as it was given to me by a cousin.&nbsp;<br />
Will you please explain to me how to determine this and perform the reformatting if that is necessary?</p>

            Hi EvilAngelus
<br />
<br />That will need to be done on a Mac, does you cousin still have their Mac?
<br />
<br />If so, connect that drive to the Mac and from there you can perform the steps listed above . . 
<br />
<br />In the meantime:
<br />
<br />Open Disk Management (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of the resulting window . . .

<p>I Googled the instructions and successfully reformatted the drive to ExFat (Fat32 was not available) but if you still wanted the screenshot, I took it just to get reacquainted with it on Windows:<br />

            Hi EvilAngelus
<br />
<br />When you formatted that drive did you loose all the data on that drive. In your original question, you said you need to hold on to that data . . 
<br />
<br />Are you now able to use and access that drive?

<h2>            Windows 10 and Internet Explorer</h2>
                    After installing W-10 and setting Internet Explorer as default internet access I still keep getting a pop-up window asking&nbsp;"How Do You Want To Open This" with the "Keep using this App"&nbsp;showing Internet Explorer and under that the "Featured in Windows 10"
 and Edge app. and then "Other Options"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a box to check that indicates "Always Use This app"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I've checked the box and made sure Internet Explorer is set as default but continue to get this pop-up when checking a link in an email or other document.&nbsp;

            Having the same issue, with the same results.&nbsp; No amount of telling IE to be the default prevents Windows 10 from displaying the "How do you want to open this?" dialog.&nbsp; It goes away if I revert to Edge or set Chrome, but as soon as I set it to IE, it
 prompts everytime I click an URL in Outlook.

 This isn't the only issue I'm having: I had to remove and reinstall my Norton security app; my printer will not print even though it's sent and in the queue; and the “sleep” settings work sometime but not all the time.

 it but I'm not switching to MS Edge or Google Chrome. Good luck if you figure a solution please share I'll do the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; That's probably something else entirely.&nbsp; Probably what you are saving is something other than what is causing the prompt due to a security setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. see if your symptom changes if you uncheck Enable MIME sniffing in Security settings, Miscellaneous
 section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise it's possible&nbsp;that you have a registry protector at work and evidence that it does its job.&nbsp; You could try booting in safe mode with Networking&nbsp;and see if your symptoms change from that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise you may have to run ProcMon to get some clues about what is happening.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, have you tried accepting Edge?&nbsp; Frequently the&nbsp;simplest way to get rid of trials is to actually try them.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, as I indicated, I would try using ProcMon to see if it can expose the underlying implementation.&nbsp; Usually that allows you to short-circuit the trial and mark it "tried" without actually having done so.&nbsp; Some admins have to know such things in
 order to customize the UX for their users.&nbsp; There may even be some related GPO available to facilitate such modifications.&nbsp; In that case it could be as simple as browsing with gpedit.msc to find the appropriate override.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>Thanks RogerPS, your screenshot shows precisely what the problem is. I tried selecting "Microsoft Edge", "Always use the App",&nbsp;&nbsp;and "OK", which worked exactly as you would expect, always executing Edge without first bringing up the popup. But, when I then
 changed my default browser from Edge back to Internet Explorer, the popup returned, as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, someone at Microsoft: Tell us how to get rid of this annoyance, or change your program (whether it be Windows, Outlook, or whatever) to get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hello CHESAPEAKE9126,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Click <strong>start (orb)&gt;</strong> select <strong>control panel</strong>&gt; select
<strong>hardware and sound</strong>&gt; select <strong>mouse</strong>&gt; your mouse and touchpad software window will open (example: Synaptics is mine) select
<strong>touchpad tab</strong> were you can turn it back on or reset to default as well as adjustments to your devices. Let us know either way if this helps you. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />

    <title>Have num lock turned off when computer boots - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Have num lock turned off when computer boots</h2>
                    <p>The num lock was turned <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on </span>with the latest unscheduled Windows 10 update.&nbsp; I was puzzled that my password didn't work until I noticed the light was
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the settings so the num lock, scroll lock, and caps lock settings are
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">off </span>on bootup?&nbsp; Also how do I permanently disable the useless num lock, scroll lock, and caps lock keys?</p>
