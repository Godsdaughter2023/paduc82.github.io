            Hi Gpranay, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If you're able to provide  the model of your HP laptop, I can research whether projecting wirelessly is supported by your hardware.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, see if updating your graphics drivers resolves the issue. Here are links to download, depending on what graphics hardware your laptop has:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:
<br /><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amd.com/en/support</a>
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />Intel Graphics:
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

 for me using the built-in OS drivers. My wife runs Windows 7 on an off-the-shelf Dell XPS box and didn't have any built-in drivers that supported the printer so we installed the latest version of the Samsung Windows 7 drivers for the printer. It worked great
 for a day or two and then she started getting the dreaded "</span>Function Discovery Print Provider Dll Has Stopped Working<span>"</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I googled and found the most commonly recommended solution is to remove the printer, then uninstall the printer drivers, then reinstall the drivers, then reconfigure the printer.
 I went through this rather arduous process and, sure enough, she was able to print again. But after another few days, she started getting the error again. The whole uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure process takes about half an hour and it's a huge pain but I
 haven't found any better solutions yet by googling. I have seen that this is a widespread problem affecting Windows 7, Windows 8 and a wide variety of printers, so surely someone has figured out a fix for it (I'm hoping). Can anyone help us?</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure that solution would work. The printer uses DHCP to get an IP from the router, so if I create some kind of hard-coded port in the Windows printer driver, won't it stop working next time the printer changes its IP?&nbsp;

    <title>Accessing files without logging in&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i am a zombiei am a zombie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing files without logging in&#63;</h2>
                    Basically my new laptop (I've had it around a month or so) is broken. <br />
I cannot even get onto the login page before it crashes. <br />
<br />
I have consulted everything I know about pc's and had many people attempt to fix it but nothing is working.<br />
<br />
So I plan to return it and get a replacement.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I have very important files on it - of which are no longer on any other computer or portable device and I havent had the chance to back them up.<br />
<br />
I've heard that there is a way to access your files via the boot/start up page - DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS?<br />
<br />
Otherwise if this is just a myth is it possible to drag my files onto another pc if I have a double ended usb cable attatched to both?<br />
Like a drag and drop scenario?<br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />

<p>1. Manually install KB3083710</p>

<p>3. Restart computer</p>
<p>4. Run Windows Update Diagnostic Tool in order to reset Windows Update (support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058)</p>

                    <p>Hi I just read an article saying that the file called waitlist.dat keeps all of the keystrokes on my computer and that it can be hacked. Is there a way to delete it or disable it? The info they gave was to go into C:\user\%user%\appdata\local\microsoft\inputpersonalization\textharvester&nbsp;
 I did a search no results. I did fond ntdata file but it is locked. I am no happy with this information. I have a lot of sensitive information I do not want copied. I may have to get an offline computer if nothing else. I also am concerned about passwords
 on my computer. Yikes! Thanks for any input. Have a beautiful day!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 tethering for Nokia 1020 problems</h2>
                    <p>Before I upgrade my laptop from Win7 to Win10, I could tether it to my Nokia 1020 for internet access without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the upgrade to Win10 I noticed that even though I could tether to laptop fine and everything appears OK. As soon as I try to access the internet I get limited internet connection!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd, as I can still get to the internet on the phone, but not via my tethered laptop!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop still connects to my home WIFI without any issues. I've managed to ensure the laptop is connected to the phone, but a limited connection exists, when I run diagnostics I get the message that the DNS Server is not running! Which DNS server?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've upgrade all my drivers on my Dell XPS 13" ultrabook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tethering worked fine until the Windows 10 upgrade, which might have been a red herring!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to tether my Surface to the same mobile device last night and had the same issue, for some reason when any device it tethred to my Nokia 1020 it's unable to get to the internet, and it reports the DNS server is down!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this error may well be with the phone and or Telco. Don't remember having any updates to the phone since I last tethered to it 3 weeks in Australia while on holiday. Since getting back in New Zealand if fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will investigate further</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what it what, but did narrow the issue down to a problem with Windows 8.1 on the Nokia 1020. The reason I know this is that I tried to use the wireless hot spot on the phone with multiple devices and got the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Lumia update, which had several updates to apply. None that I could see were for AccessPoints or Wireless Hot spots. Odd as none of the updates appeared in the store, the only way I found them was by running the Lumia Update application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update everything was OK!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

    <title>Backup strategy for BitLocker-encrypted Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> realmasters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup strategy for BitLocker-encrypted Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>I can't believe it is so difficult to find clear advice from Microsoft on the best backup strategy for my Surface Book 2, which has a BitLocker-encrypted disk.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I use OneDrive for most of my documents and music.</li><li>I use File History to get a continuous backup all of my main data and files so I can retrieve specific files as required. (These are unencrypted files.)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I understand that it is recommended to also have full system image backups to be able to restore in the case of a major failure.</li><li>MS suggest using "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" for this, but at the same time say that this is no longer supported and may be withdrawn at any time!</li><li>The third-party program I am considering is "R-Drive Image" - it seems to backup efficiently and offers fast technical support BUT how do I restore a sector-by-sector image of a BitLocker encrypted drive so that it works?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is it possible?&nbsp; If not, how do I do a full system backup &amp; restore as part of my backup strategy?</li></ul>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            Hmmm. The lack of suggestions - let alone answers - confirms my suspicion that Microsoft do not actually have a recommended strategy for system backups. Which is *very* disappointing.

    <title>Windows Explorer in Windows 7 takes a long time to refresh a large - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffnlisa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer in Windows 7 takes a long time to refresh a large directory&#59; Windows XP was almost instantaneous</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a directory that contains dozens of subfolders, many of those contain dozens also.&nbsp; And there are many thousands of files in this directory.&nbsp; It is in exactly the structure I need and want, and I have used it this way for over 15 years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer in Windows XP always takes no more than a second or two to open the folder and display the contents, and if I'm looking at it from another Windows XP computer over a network, just two or three seconds longer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows 7 on my primary machine for over a year.&nbsp; Just as I hated Windows XP the first few months I used it, there are things about Windows 7 that I am used to now but still hate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One such is that Explorer in Windows 7 takes between 7-8 and as much as 20-30 seconds to open this folder, and generally 10-15 seconds to refresh it or to write a file to it.&nbsp; I have a backup copy of the entire folder on the local hard drive, and it takes
 almost exactly as long even on the local drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced it is something in the way Windows 7 Explorer looks at files and directories compared to the way Windows XP does.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I refresh this directory at least 50 times a day, and EVERY SINGLE TIME it takes 7-8, or 10-15, or 20-30 seconds.&nbsp; I am used to it, but it is DRIVING ME CRAZY!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have info why it does this, and what can I do to make it behave like Windows XP and access it instantaneously?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for anything anyone can tell me :-)</p>

</p><p>Just a thought in passing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have "indexing" on in that folder?&nbsp; XP did not have search/indexing WIn 7 has a rudimentary one.&nbsp; If there are thousands of files and nested folders it may be choking.&nbsp; Without further info its just a guess.</p>

            <p>Was waiting to see if any more suggestions, thanks for the one suggestion.&nbsp; I have all indexing turned off, and have turned off or disabled every related thing I can find.&nbsp; I have also set the "optimization" to "General" because several suggestions recommended
 that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Windows 7 has changed what Explorer is actually doing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer in Windows XP would simply look at the structure of the level you are clicking on, and show it.&nbsp; With no regard to how many sublevels there might be in any of the trees, or how many files might be in the subfolders.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main docs folder has 61 folders and about 1,300 files.&nbsp; Explorer in Windows XP can open that in a millisecond.&nbsp; But the entire structure of subfolders contains almost 700 folders and over 18,000 files.&nbsp; And Explorer for Windows 7 chokes EVERY TIME I try
 to access it, refresh it, write anything to it, or do anything with it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Explorer for Windows 7 is not just looking at the structure of the level you are clicking.&nbsp; It seems to be trying to take a peek at EVERY FILE in the entire structure, every time I refresh it.&nbsp; Which again also includes any time I save any
 file in the directory.&nbsp; It takes 15 seconds on average to save a file, and I think it's because it "has to" refresh itself every time, and I think the Win7 way is to look thru the entire structure every time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm used to it, but I HATE IT!!&nbsp; It is SO frustrating to go so backwards as technology moves forward.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried five different file manager programs.&nbsp; All of them fix the way Explorer LOOKS in Win7, and I have it LOOKING like Explorer in Windows XP.&nbsp; But they all seem to be operating with the same Explorer in the background, and still it takes this dang
 long to do anything.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I can understand if this is needed or indexing purposes, but I have EVERYTHING turned off hat I can find.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read of at least one company that could not roll out Win 7 on any of their over 100 workstations because of this problem.&nbsp; I could not find any info about how or if they ever solved it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I get Explorer to STOP trying to look in every file down the entire structure, and ONLY look at the what's in just the level I clicked? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANY way? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, PLEASE help!!</p>

    <title>delete all HDD paritions incl disk recovery partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 257220  say:</h3>
<h2>            delete all HDD paritions incl disk recovery partition</h2>
                    im in the process of upgrading to vista 32-bit ultimate edition -&nbsp; a Lenovo T61 laptop original OS&nbsp;vista home, comes with 160GB&nbsp;HDD&nbsp;but only showing 110 GB.<br />
there is the hidden partition for the disk recovery. now, i wanted this disk recovery partition deleted to have more room for important video editing files.<br />
<br />
how can i delete that hidden parition containing the disk recovery?<br />
<br />
i have purchased the Recovery CD media for the laptop - so i dont need the hidden partition.<br />
<br />
in the process i wiped out the existing partition (not the hiiden recovery partition)&nbsp;and&nbsp;installed vista 32&nbsp;ultimate and it goes on without a problem. i then installed<br />
the INF chipset utilitty downloaded from Lenovo website, then installed some downloaded device drivers - and all&nbsp;in perfect shape smoothly running.<br />
<br />
now i decided to delete that hidden partition containing the disk recovery - whatever happens after, i have the Recovery CD media.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;how to delete that hidden partition? TIA

"""""<strong>This only applies to Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
*Make sure you have backed up your OEM keycode before deleting the hidden partition.*</strong><br />
<br />
The Lenovo Hidden Recovery Partition is a protected partition so you will not be able to delete it through Disk Management as you would with any other normal partition. You will need to use Diskpart. You can still use these steps to delete the hidden recovery
 partition if you have already done a clean install, but you'll need a 3rd party software to combine it with the primary partition. It is best if you delete the Hidden Recovery Partition first, then go through with a clean install using one of the many guides
 available on this board. <br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1.</strong><br />
Burn Recovery Media. Type "Recovery Media" (without quotation marks) into search in the Start Menu. Open the application, and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2.</strong><br />
Open the Diskpart application by either typing in "Diskpart" (without the quotation marks) into the search, or type "Diskpart.exe" into Run by pressing the Windows key + R.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3.</strong><br />
Now with Diskpart open, you must enter the following command lines:<br />
<br />
<strong>I.</strong> Type "list disk" without the quotation marks and press enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>II.</strong> Type in "select disk 0" and press enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>III.</strong> Then type in "list partition" and press enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>IV.</strong> Then type in "select partition x" x=the recovery partition you wish to delete (i believe it's 1, i dont recall) replace x with the recovery partition number and press enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>V.</strong> Then finally type in "delete partition override" and press enter.<br />
<br />
That should do the trick. Best of luck! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.answers.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fen-US%2fvistainstall%2fthread%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsmile.gif" />

    <title>Cancel and refund for the renewal membership - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cancel and refund for the renewal membership</h2>
                    
<p>I was noticed by the confirmation email for the xbox live gold membership renewal a day before the renewal date.</p>
<p>The night that I was noticed I was trying to cancel the renew the membership. I received the email.</p>
<p>So I hardly contacted with the chat support system. She said it cannot be cancelled since it's been renewed and cannot be able to refund it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked further for the better solution. She just left during chatting. I cannot still believe it.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;<span>was only noticed as "You will be charged immediately. Your membership will auto-renew monthly at the then-current price plus applicable taxes, subject to change, until you cancel. You may cancel at any time at
</span><a href="https://t.co/2EHMa3k7BK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://</span><span>xbox.com/accounts</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></a><span>." It never said about the time
 zone for the renewal membership.</span></p>
<p><span>My chatting experience with MS chat support was the worst service I have never experienced before.&nbsp;<span>I was struggled with an issue. But the supporter did not help me to understand and give a solution for it. Even she just left during the chatting.
 How I can solve the problem now? I want to attach below the chat history. If you were me, are you really satisfied with it?</span></span></p>

 You are now chatting with 'Elizabeth S' Elizabeth S: at 21:14:26 Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Elizabeth S. How can I help you today? you: at 21:14:45 I received an email for the auto renewal of my subscription for Xbox
 Live Gold. The auto renewal date should be tomorrow. But I received it today for the confirmation. And I cannot cancel for this renewal. please help me for it. Elizabeth S: at 21:15:18 So you had you xbox live auto renew, is that correct? you: at 21:15:21
 Hi Elizabeth. I am Han Kook. I hope you can help me for it. you: at 21:16:13 Last month I bought the xbox one and registered. And I applied the xbox live gold for the first time. you: at 21:16:56 I only knew Jan 4 will be the renewal date. So I tried to cancel
 today. But I received the email confirming the renew already. Elizabeth S: at 21:19:12 So when it comes to our system we run off of GMT time for every account, so at 8:00 pm EST tonight it was 12:00 am GMT time and the membership auto renew. Since it has already
 renewed we are unable to cancel this, but I can turn off the auto renew so it will not renew next more. you: at 21:20:15 But I didn't use it and also will not use it as more. Elizabeth S: at 21:20:56 2016. 1. 3. about:blank about:blank 2/2 I understand, but
 we are just not able to cancel a 1 month gold membership. you: at 21:21:20 You can charge for one day. But I don't really want it. you: at 21:22:27 So what can I do for it? If any of you cannot help this cancellation issue, who can help me for it? Elizabeth
 S: at 21:22:28 I am sorry we just can't stop this auto renew now that it has already renewed. Elizabeth S: at 21:22:43 I can turn it off so that next month you won't get charged again. Elizabeth S: at 21:23:35 Which it looks like you have already turned that
 off. you: at 21:24:09 I mean I don't want to waste my money for this time. Therefore your answer is not the solution. you: at 21:24:55 Yes, through the website, that was all I could do. That's why I am chatting with you for further help. Elizabeth S: at 21:24:56
 I am sorry we just can't cancel a 1 month gold after it has already renewed. you: at 21:26:19 So do you mean Microsoft simply takes the money like this? Microsoft does not have any solution for this strange system? you: at 21:27:06 At least you should let
 me know who I can contact for it. Right? Elizabeth S: at 21:27:28 With one month golds not because we give you 1 month to either go online and turn off the auto renew or even contact us to get it turned off so it doesn't renew again. We also state in the terms
 of use that all sales are final. you: at 21:29:00 I don't think I was noticed about the time. It was told a month renewal process. Elizabeth S: at 21:27:53 If you want to voice your option on this issue you can at

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>to cancel a subscription immediately (which should be possible) you will need to contact Xbox Support, the people in the forums can't help with issues like this.</p>
<p>I would advise to contact Xbox Support by Phone, use this link to get the Phone number, be sure that the region in the bottom left corner matches your country: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>

<h2>            Defrag and task scheduler corrupt</h2>
                    <p>About 1 year ago I upgraded to Windows 10 - and after 30 minutes decided it was not for me and uninstalled it.&nbsp; Now my disk defragment tells me another program is running this and to click here to remove settings.&nbsp; Nothing ever changes.&nbsp; My task scheduler
 comes up with "this task has been tampered with"&nbsp; - on many tasks.&nbsp; I just want to defrag my computer!!!&nbsp; Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many forums and it seems this is a problem for anyone who has upgraded to Windows 10 and then removed it.&nbsp; I have tried logging in as the Administrator and have done command prompts etc from other forums but nothing has worked.&nbsp; I removed all
 of my anti virus programs and now just have AVG.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone just post a link that I can click on and it will magically repair this issue.&nbsp; I have spent many long hours trying all of the different repair methods and nothing has worked.</p>

<p>There is no magic for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 includes a Scheduled Task to automatically run defrag once a week (low priority):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41f1b109-1b45-4c52-891d-0f7d37558452?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41f1b109-1b45-4c52-891d-0f7d37558452?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 also includes about 80 other Scheduled Tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when reverting back to Windows 7 after a Windows 10 upgrade all the Scheduled Tasks get corrupted so you need to determine if just the defrag task is afflicted or if all the Scheduled Tasks are afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen, or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
task scheduler<br />
<br />
Click Task Scheduler to open the Task Scheduler (Run as administrator) and describe what happens
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either Task Scheduler opens just fine or if errors are reported describe what you see or post a screen shot.</p>

<p>Thanks for that - I have gone through all of the fixes etc - there are 31 of these messages on different tasks.&nbsp; From all of the forums I have read - it seems that the only solution is to go back to before the install.&nbsp; I bought my computer new - from a
 store and do not have a disc!</p>

<h2>            Getting Windows to detect a CPU change</h2>
                    <p>Let me&nbsp;first start out by saying I am open to reinstalling windows to get everything working correctly, but I first wanted to see if there was anyway to resolve the follwoing problem without the reinstall.</p>
<p>The problem is this: I had a CPU that went toast was RMAed and the CPU sent back from the RMA was toast as well, so I bought a new CPU that I know works with all the rest of my hardware. With the new CPU installed odd slowness was experienced and more CPU
 activity than normall was seen. Games that I knew would run on this system just fine slowed down to an almost unbareable halt. So I went hunting and discovered this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/12HA4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/12HA4.jpg</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows has no idea what sort of CPU I am using and therefor is running it at quarter speed (it is an AMD Phenom II Quad core 3.3 GHz processor). My question then is this: Is there some way to make windows recognize the CPU? I am trying to track down a BIOS
 update but the stupid 16-bit flashing tool that does not work with 64-bit&nbsp; windows won't let me upgrade and there is no inside the BIOS flashing ablity.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If so, see this from their knowledge base ( <a href="https://support.speedtest.net/entries/21544197-What-does-Latency-Test-Error-mean-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>""Latency Test Error" typically occurs when the server has gone temporarily down. We have a server watchdog that will periodically contact servers to verify they're working properly, but there may be a slight delay before we automatically recognize the server
 is down. Please let us know by <a href="https://support.speedtest.net/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
filing a support ticket</a> specifically identifying which server caused the error, and try testing to a different server."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was speedtest.net, then try another tester like <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/broadband-speedtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.zdnet.com/broadband-speedtest/</a> for example ( there are many others ).</p>
