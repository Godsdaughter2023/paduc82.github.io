            Hello, 
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

    <title>sound test microphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mondimi  say:</h3>
<h2>            sound test microphone</h2>
                    <p>I want to test my microphone, which used to work on Skype but no longer does.</p>
<p>You say to search for the Echo / Sound Test Service. Good idea.<br />
But WHERE do I search for that????<br />
If I enter Echo / Sound Test Service into the search engine at the top of the page, it brings me back to the same page.<br />
It used to be easy to do the sound test under the old menu -- just look under "Call" and there was a rubric for the sound test. Now???&nbsp; This is just an interminable exercise in frustration. And true to Microsoft tradition, I will submit my question, but never
 expect a response.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
And, by the way, thanks for continuing that wonderful Microsoft tradition of asking us to submit questions to which we will never receive a response.</p>

<p>I'm glad to find out there is somebody out there, and that this problem is not unique to me. The new version of Skype on Microsoft is overall a major disappointment for me. After using it daily for 10 years, I now can't use it at all. Thanks, Microsoft.<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Completely remove everything of Graphics driver using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.

<br />
<br />You can head to either the card manufacturer or device manufacturer to get the newest driver.
<br />Let us know if you require any assistance.

            When I was having this issue (granted it was an English Surface purchased in the US, so this may not work for you), I fixed it by going to the PC settings and checking for software updates. It had updates, so I told it "run updates now". It took about
 an hour of updates, but after it updated and rebooted, I went into the store and it downloaded all the Windows store updates no problem. Try it and see if that fixes it!

<p>Xbox updates usually occur from 3-4am PST, or 6-7am Eastern. As much as I love pulling all-nighters for dlc/expansions, it is usually a good idea to wait until later in the day for Fallout dlc, as there has been, in the past, bug/glitch based reasons to
 not play dlc right away.</p>

            1. This is more likely to be a hardware issue or CD/DVD issue. Please check your CD/DVDs are not scratched and in good shape. 
<br />
<br />2. Try to clean your CD/DVD with a clean cloth to remove dirt etc. Also clean the lens of the CD/DVD drive.
<br />
<br />3. From Windows side, you should try following -
<br />
<br />A. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand DVD/CD Drives &gt; Right click on entry below &gt; Uninstall Device &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />C. Review following Microsoft Help

            Hello,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop, then launch Device Manager by pressing Windows key + X and clicking Device Manager. Expand DVD/CD-ROM drives, right-click the optical drive listed, then click Uninstall. Exit Device Manager then restart your computer. Windows 10 will detect the drive then reinstall

<p>Thank you David for your response concerning my hiberfil.sys file and your instructions on how to disable hibernate mode. This does not however enlighten me&nbsp;on the effect of disabling Hibernate mode on my laptop/PC...nor does it suggest that it is beneficial
 or actually determental to my PC and the processes in the future. I would really appreciate some in depth response to the consequenses of your suggestion to disable the hibernate mode on my pc. Thanks so much.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you activate <strong>Hibernate</strong>, Windows takes a snap shot of your current session (all your running programs, open files, etc.) and writes that information to your hard drive.
<strong>Hibernate</strong> was designed to speedup shut downs and restarts and save power on laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hiberfil.sys, as the name suggests, is the file to which Windows saves the snap shot data. Thus, the file is always equal in size to the total amount of available RAM on the computer. On a computer with plenty of free disk space having such a large file
 just hanging around usually isn't a problem. But if you're running low on hard drive space and never use the
<strong>Hibernate </strong>feature, hiberfil.sys is unnecessarily eating up valuable disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, feel free to ask us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>with win 8 and up <br />
if you do <br />
powercfg -h off <br />
to disable hibernation it also disables "fake shut down" aka fast start up<br />
<br />
thus, whenever the system is shutdown<br />
it does a full shut down, <br />
and a full boot takes place at every startup<br />
<br />
you will likely also have to visit the power configuration dialog to change any settings relating to hibernate<br />
eg. <br />
with laptops there are settings relating to low / critical battery level that cause automatic hibernation</p>

<h2>            Skype not syncing across devices</h2>
                    <p>I've had Skype for about a decade and in the last two months when I signed on to new devices, nothing is syncing. &nbsp;My contact requests only show up on the old device and not on the new. Recent conversations only show up if I initiated them from the new devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>New ones are Macbook air and iPhone 7, old ones are iPhone 5 and older Macbook air. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example, someone sent me a request. I did not get it on the new device. &nbsp;They were able to leave me a voicemail, but I only saw it when I signed in on to the old device, and I could also see the request there. &nbsp;This is one example of many similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm befuddled. &nbsp;How can I get my new devices in sync with my old ones and with new contact requests?</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Good Day! </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for that information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start, are you using the latest version of Skype for all your devices?
</span></p>
<p><span>If not, we highly suggest for you to use the latest version.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Also, for your iPhone device, please be advised that, please be advised that, due to changes in Skype set up from peer to peer to the cloud, some version and platforms will no longer work.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With that, we strongly advise for you to update also your supported OS version to avoid incompatibility issue and for you to not lose access to Skype.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, your conversations are saved on your hard drive for a period of time, which you can specify in your

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The last 30 days of your conversation history are also stored in the cloud, so you can access it when you're signed in to Skype on any device.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">For your contacts, please sure that you have the
<strong><span>latest version of Skype</span></strong> installed for all the devices you are using.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have more than one Skype account, make sure you are signed in with the correct Skype Name.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi there! This may seem quite obvious but… Make sure you are logged in with the exact same account in all of the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to change your presence / status if the platform allows you to do so, or the privacy settings to something different and then back to your desired settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing works, you can try to use a different network. In the case of the laptop, please try a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi.</p>

</p><p>There were a few incidents lately related to connectivity but all of them were resolved quite a few days ago.</p>

<h2>            Trouble pairing Jabra halo with my vista laptop</h2>
                    I have a windows vista 64 bit HP computer. I have bluetooth 2.0 on my computer. I recently bought&nbsp; a Jabra Halo bluetooth headset (650s) and would like to pair it with my computer to use as wireless headphones. My computer found the headset just fine and
 it connected with drivers installed successfully (supposedly) but I still can't seem to get it to be recognized on any programs. I ran the Microsoft fix it devices and got back recent hardware changes might not have been detected. I have tried the steps it
 gives me and still no luck. Anyone know what I can do to fix it (if at all)? Thanks

            Thanks for you help. I tried the Microsoft fix it and it detects the problem but the program doesn't actually fix anything. I tried to remove and reinstall it with no luck solving my problem. My bluetooth device is passkey enabled however windows never
 prompted me to put one in, could that be the source of my issue? I also made sure that my firewall wasn't blocking anything. I just don't see how my computer installs the drivers and the connection is good however the device is still not showing up as a viable
 audio option.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I found the solution to my problem. The drivers on computer itself were out of date (the bluetooth ones). I just had to use HP's website. In case anyone else needs help I went to support. After that they asked me to enter my computer model. I used the software
 that would automatically detect my computer instead (that way I can get the exact model). After that I put in what version of windows vista I had. I then downloaded and re-installed my bluetooth software. Problem corrected.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 problems - Are all of them known&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulo reichert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 problems - Are all of them known&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using my Surface Pro 4 (i7/16GB/512GB) since Dec. 7th and have been having the following issues:</p>
<p>- Device overheating and draining the battery when asleep.</p>
<p>- Screen not turning on when waking up from sleep (I can see the infrared camera light on but the screen doesn't come on)</p>
<p>- Fan constantly turning on for no apparent reason when using the device. Even when just browsing the web on Edge and CPU stable at 13-20%.</p>
<p>- Display driver crashing (still happens to me at least once a week)</p>
<p>- Device hangs completely, forcing me to hold the power button for 30 seconds to force a reboot. Happens at least once a week.</p>
<p>- Maps can't render streets in map view because of the Intel Iris GPU drivers.</p>
<p>- YouTube videos don't play (image corrupted) sometimes after waking up from hibernate.</p>
<p>- BSOD - had a couple since I had the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the very latest software having all Windows Updates installed. Windows version is 10586.63 released this Tuesday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the problems seem to be more frequent when I have the device connected to the Surface Dock and my external 4K monitor. Namely the overheating/constant fan and the graphics driver crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen other people having similar issues but I would appreciate if there was someone who could tell me whether Microsoft is aware of them, which ones are due to software and what they are doing to fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a deadline of Feb 4th to return the device and accessories. I love the device when it is working well but I'm not prepared to live with the list of issues above indefinitely so what I'm looking for is some word from Microsoft on whether I should stick
 with it and they will fix the issues imminently or whether I should cut my losses and return it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't want to do a reset/restore of a device that is brand new. I have tweaked settings, applications and so on over the last month to get the device just the way I want it and the thought of having to start over is daunting, even more as I don't
 believe it would fix all of the problems above.</p>

            <p>I'm updating this thread for future reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 2/17/16 firmware update for the Surface Pro 4 all the issues I listed on the OP minus the issue with Edge sometimes consuming too much CPU time seem to have been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update the device is faster, has better battery life, standby now uses little power and I haven't had any display driver crashes or freezes even when connected to my dock and having an addition monitor to drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still very disappointed by how Microsoft dealt with these issues without clear communication and supports response was just about useless. In the future I'd like Microsoft to be a bit more transparent about what they are doing to fix issues on&nbsp;a device
 that I dropped nearly £2K for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said I'm thoroughly happy with my unit now and look forward to it getting better with further Windows and firmware updates.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0xc0000428 -black screen after login</h2>
                    So a couple days ago my computer crashed while i was messing around on Ableton Live. It shut down and then quickly boot up for 2 seconds and then again shut down. I turned on the computer a minute or two later (it may have turned on by itself- not really
 sure) i got blue screen and the message for 0xc0000428. The next day when i turned on my computer it was working fine but it turned itself off after 30-40minutes. Now when i turn on the computer i can log in just fine but after the login my screen is black,
 but pop ups for nvidia drivers update and for some other programs are visible and i can press the x icon and they disappear. I have already tried the system restore and startup repair option (shift+restart button/troubleshoot/) . The screen is also black in
 safe mode. What should i try next?&nbsp;<br />

            This error can be caused by a corrupted boot file.
<br />Boot into recovery.
<br />From windows go to Settings - Update and Security - Recovery - Reset this PC
<br />
<br />If you can't get into Windows you will need either a windows 10 bootable image or recovery disk.
<br />
<br />If you can't do any of the above you will have to force the machine to recovery.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.

<br />
<br />When you get to the advanced options go to the command prompt.
<br />Type the following
<br />bootrec /rebuildbcd
<br />
<br />Then reboot.
<br />See if the problem persists.
<br />If it does let me know.

            Hello,
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot:

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB:
<br />Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<p>Hello Alejo, <br />
<br />
<br />
We noticed that your thread had became idle for a time now. Were you able to have solutions for the said concern already? If yes, the community will be really happy to know what it was.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you still need further help on this, it would be best if you can <strong>provide us the screenshot of the failure after you login</strong>. On our understanding, you are able to successfully login, but there is where the black screen comes in with pop-ups.&nbsp;
 The screen that would be provided will help us analyze and generate a more accurate solution for the concern.
<br />

<p>Has networking ever functioned on this machine.&nbsp; If so, d<span><span>o you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information
 you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>How are you connected to the internet?&nbsp; Are you using just a modelm or do you&nbsp; have a wireless router attached?&nbsp; Can computers connected directly to the modem
 connect to the internet?&nbsp; Can any other computers you have there connect to the internet or is the problem isolated to this one computer?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If none of the above work (but I think one ot them will give you the clue you may be missing in trying to set it up yourself), I recommend you contact your ISP
 and reqeust assistance to confirm the settings, confirm that the modem and line are OK, and help you set up the connection.&nbsp; They may be able to assist you with any required router or modem settings required for this to work that we wouldn't know about becaouse
 they are ISP-specific and we don't have access to that information.&nbsp; And because of the error oode, be sure your IP addresses are correct for your system and network and you have no duplicates if any are set to be static.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            &#34;The stub received bad data&#34; error when opening Task Manager</h2>
                    Occasionally when I try to open Task Manager (usually by right-clicking the taskbar), an error message pops up that says "The stub received bad data". Is there anything I can do to fix this? It might happen once a day or so, and never twice in a row. When
 I try again after the error, it opens without any problems. Thanks.

    <title>What is required to play downloaded games offline&#63; Hidden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dugfreez  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is required to play downloaded games offline&#63; Hidden licences&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the situation. I have an Xbox One X and I have noticed that some games I have bought digitally I CAN play offline. Others I CAN NOT play offline. Whenever this questions comes up the answers are always...yeah, you can play them offline just make
 sure blah blah blah set as your home console. Make sure you have it blah blah blah set to offline. I set it to offline and I have my system set as my home Xbox....yet I can't play hardly any games I have purchased digitally while offline.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Well it's all a bunch of blow. What I have discovered is that you CAN NOT play the games you have paid for and downloaded when you are offline...UNLESS you have some sort of license for them ON YOUR CONSOLE. This is something that you never see mentioned.
 If I go to start a game when I am online I am often greeted with a screen saying "Getting your game ready. This might take a minute or two" well it never takes longer than a second or two and I am convinced this is the system getting the license for that game.&nbsp;
 The reason I say this is because after that is done on a game....I can then play that game fine offline. If that isn't done FOR EVERY GAME AND APP they can not be played offline or even started when offline. If you try to start them you get a "First connect
 to Xbox Live" message and if your internet is out....you can't really do that and your precious digital games are useless.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The issue is..........I am in the Xbox Insiders program. This means I have to reset my console to factory setting every so often when they release a buggy alpha update. So then I am back to none of my games being able to be played offline....until I start
 each game while online so it can grab this little permission license and store it on the system.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; My question is WHY? Why not make it so it gets all of these licenses all at one time? I mean every time I go into My Games &amp; apps section when I am online it scans to see what is installed and what I own and is ready to be installed if I want to. Why not
 have it do a scan for the games I have installed licenses and then it can download and store the ones that aren't on the system for use when I am offline? As quick as it is to grab the single license when I start a game...I can't imagine grabbing them for
 all of my games taking very long. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; What I am not certain of is if these hidden licenses have a limit (ex: Only the last 100 games played are stored) or even possibly a time limit (Ex: If you haven't played a game in 6 months the license drops off and needs to be re-upped by being online and
 starting a game again).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; In any case....it seems pretty strange that you never see these hidden licenses being mentioned and that there isn't a a way (even a manual way) to get these licenses all at one time without having to start EVERY GAME individually online to get the permission
 for offline play.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; A place in the setting to "Check for and download available licenses" is really all that is needed. Leave them on the system and if you have to wipe them away if you change your home xbox setting or something like that...make it so when you change a system
 back to your home xbox it scans for the licenses again and ties them back to your home Xbox.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; As it is now, if you have had to reset your system or upgraded to another system (ex: Xbox One to Xbox One X) you really don't know what games you can and can not play while offline without making sure you start every game while online or just trying them
 when you are offline and hoping it is one you bought or have played since the change, reset or license expiring or dropping off the system.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; There is something else I noticed as someone on the insider program. If you hold down the X button you get an option to the right to report a problem. If you select it the insider hub app will open and take you to the bug reporting form. If you select Add
 new problem and then select games....you will see a list of all of the games that you have played or downloaded recently. These seem to be the only digital games that it WILL let you play OFFLINE. If the game is not listed there....you can not play it offline.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; These small hidden license files are also needed for disc based 360 and OG Xbox games, but they do seem to be created when the game is installed, but if you have had to do a system reset or changed from one system to another....you will have to start these
 games while online at least one time before playing them offline. So even though the game is installed, you have the disc inserted...you won't be able to play it offline if you haven't played the game online, if you have done a system reset or system upgrade.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I guess, all and all, it is nice that you can get this license file just by starting a game while online connected....instead of having to delete and re download the game itself, but it seems like they could have a check to scan all installed games at one
 time and issue the needed offline permissions without a user having to manually start each game.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Has anyone else had these observations or noted that some games do start for you offline while others won't? Why have I never saw this mentioned when I hear people talking about having issues playing digital games offline? Why hasn't Microsoft explained this
 or allowed a way to transfer licenses the way they did with the 360? It seems it could be done even more seamlessly as a "Check for and download available licenses" button seems like it would do the trick . After a 2 or 3 minute download you would then be
 able to play all of your purchased digital games offline without issue, even if you have had a system reset or system upgrade.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; It seems like some DRM that MS is trying to keep on the down low. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />

You didn't read the post did you? If you had you would have seen that just setting to offline does not work.

            &nbsp; Yeah, putting it in offline DOES NOT work. As I said, this is always something people and MS put out there, but does it really do anything as far as a game being playable or not while not connected? It seems it is just telling your system to not even
 look for a connection whereas having it in online mode when your internet is out...is the exact same thing except the system is waiting for your internet connection to kick back on. MS even suggests to leave it on online mode if the offline-ness is due to
 an internet outage and not because you are simply someplace where you do not have internet. I guess setting the system to offline may be telling certain games "Don't worry about looking for an internet connection....we know it's not there" and let it go on
 about it's business without thinking there is an issue. It may speed things up at the very least since it probably won't even bother looking for a connection.&nbsp; What I can say for sure is setting your system to offline will not allow the digital purchased and
 disc installed back compat games to play offline if the game doesn't have that needed license file on your system.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Can anyone point out one instance of a game playing while offline and the system set to offline mode.....yet that same game will not play if offline and keeping the setting to online mode? To me it just seems like an excuse and something to tell people to
 get them to stop asking questions. The REAL issue seems to be these hidden license permissions that MS has never even mentioned as far as I have seen.<br />
<br />
They also like to use the "this is my home console" as some sort of distraction. I know that setting can be useful when wanting to play games on different systems and things, but I have 1 console and don't share my account with anyone. I also know that having
 my system set as my home console has no bearing on if one of my games will or will not be playable offline. So why do they say if it is set to "this is my home console" will make games playable offline...when that simply isn't true....or at the very least
 it isn't the deciding factor on if a game is playable offline or not.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Microsoft please let us know what the: "Getting your game ready. This might take a minute or two" is doing. What are you getting ready? Please don't be shy about your hidden DRM. Why not explain things instead of having confused customers not knowing why
 some of their games will start when not connected to the internet while others will. Why not give people that have had to reset their systems or upgraded to your new Xbox One X have a way to import all of those hidden permissions and play all of the game they
 have spent their money on offline....without having to make sure they start each game while being online?<br />
<br />
PS: I had to reset my system yet again this morning. So now none of my digital or installed disc based 360 or OG Xbox games will work if my internet goes out. It seems the only way to correct that is to start each game while I am online to get that permission
 added.<br />
