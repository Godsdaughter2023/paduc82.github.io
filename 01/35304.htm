<h2>            Is it possible to print a range of pages in a multi page document or print selected pages of a multi page document in Windows 8.</h2>
                    Windows 8 allows printing after you click on Devices and select your printer.&nbsp; However when the print page comes up it only shows that the document has 1 of x pages.&nbsp; If you hit print you get all the pages.&nbsp; It does not allow you to put a range in the
 box or change the page.

            <p>The only way that I have found is to access your email through the desktop rather than the Mail app.</p>
<p>1. Go to the desktop and access your email using a browser (e.g., thru Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, etc.)</p>
<p>2. Select print. You will have all the normal print options including page range.</p>

            <p>Hi John Zavitz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could reply to this question to assist you further.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the printer?</p>
<p><span>2. Does this happen only when print from a specific program?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you need to know if the printer can print a range of pages in a multi page document or print selected
 pages of a multi page document in Windows 8, the print settings vary according the printer you are using. You need to get in touch with the Printer
</span><span>manufacturer to get more information on the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information
</span></p>

    <title>Unable to find a system image on a local drive using Repair Disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alancam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to find a system image on a local drive using Repair Disc</h2>
                    <p>I have had a few problems with my computer which necessitated a re-install of Windows 7 Pro + SP1 from the DVD.</p>
<p>After the re-install I have updated the system with all the patches.</p>
<p>I then setup Backup/Restore to use my NAS and successfully took a full backup including the system image.</p>
<p>Another problem then caused me to try to restore the backup. This failed with the error code 0x800704CF.
</p>
<p>I am still looking into why that should fail it appears to be lacking a NIC driver to access the NAS.</p>
<p>While I try to solve that one I re-installed the system again and this time using Backup/Restore took a full back up to a local drive.</p>
<p>"Once bitten twice shy" I tried to restore immediately after the backup finished.</p>
<p>This failed with the message:</p>
<p>Unable to find a system image to restore.</p>
<p>I installed all the patches and tried again with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have almost given up on Backup/Restore and have resorted to a 3rd party System Imager - this works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>Why does the Backup/Restore program not save the NIC driver it knows about when it is doing the Backup on the Repair disc?</p>
<p>Why can Repair not find the system image?</p>

            <p><em>Why does the Backup/Restore program not save the NIC driver it knows about when it is doing the Backup on the Repair disc?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Backup/Restore is intended for user files. System files such as drivers are included in partition images only. On the other hand, if you are talking about an image restoration then the next question is: What makes you think that there was a problem with
 the driver? In the vast majority of cases networking problems are caused not by the NIC driver but by inappropriate settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Why can Repair not find the system image?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; This would happen if the image folder structure (or its files) is disturbed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I have almost given up on Backup/Restore and have resorted to a 3rd party System Imager - this works!</em></p>
<p>-&gt; The native image creation/restoration tool is both very basic and rather temperamental. It is for this reason that I use a fully mature commercial product.</p>

<p>The error is with the driver&nbsp;because the repair system says it cannot find a driver for the NIC.</p>
<p>It correctly found the driver when it was backing up but it is not there when the restore is attempted.</p>
<p>I accept the main purpose of the Backup/Restore program is for user files but why then does it offer to create a system image. Particularly if it cannot restore it in extreme emergency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file image folder was not disturbed the failure occurred immediately after the backup!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that there are limitations with the MS provided Backup/Restore but seriously if it cannot restore a backup image it has just taken it should not be allowed to exist. I suspect there are a lot of users blithely assuming that they have their backups
 and are therefore protected AND ARE NOT!!</p>

            When you restore an image you get everything, system files, user files, warts and all. There is no way that an image restoration skips a NIC driver. If there was then we would have heard about it years ago.<br />

            <p>I think you misread my original posting.</p>
<p>The NIC driver is missing when you use the Repair disc or even the Full Installation Disc and select the repair option to restore the image taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I may have confused you with the two questions.</p>
<p>1. Relates to the inability to restore a system image from a network storage device.</p>
<p>2. Relates to a failure to restore a&nbsp;system image from a local drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe these are connected hence my single question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expanding 1.</p>
<p>I think many people are under a mistaken belief that the system image taken during a Backup/Restore by default (if you let MS choose what to back up) provides a means of restoring a complete image of the disc should it become faulty and have to be replaced.
 This is obviously not the case in my installation, how many others are&nbsp;labouring under that mistaken impression?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expanding 2.</p>
<p>It is still unclear to me why the Repair Disc &gt; Restore option cannot find a disc it has just created an image on. In my case the image was taken and said it completed satisfactorily.</p>
<p>I am guessing that it did not save something on the disk&nbsp;that it stored the image on.</p>
<p>I am still looking for an answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that Backup/Restore is not fit for the purpose it purports to do!!!</p>

The Backup/Restore process is intended to back up or restore <strong>user files</strong>. It is not designed to back up or restore system files. This becomes patently clear under Windows 8 where nothing but user libraries get backed up. To restore a system
 (e.g. to a new disk) one must have an image. This has been like this under all versions of Windows. I do not know how you came to assume that backup/restore can be used to restore a failed system.<br />

            <p>You have misunderstood my last reply.</p>
<p>I did not say that Backup/Restore could be used to restore a failed system.</p>
<p>What I did say was that the Repair Disc 'that it suggests that you create to be able to restore an image' cannot restore an image either from a network storage system or a local disk in my particular situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network restore of image fails because it says it cannot find the driver for the NIC.</p>
<p>Local restore of an image fails because it cannot find the system image it has just taken to that local disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is possible that my particular machine may have a previously undetected fault or misconfiguration which is what I am trying to determine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you say it, the same result occurs when I try to do the same with the full installation disc that I used to re-install the Windows 7 SP1 system.</p>

            <p>I would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working on an other machine, create an image. Store it on a local disk or on an disk in a USB case. Ask a friend to help you if you do not have ready access to a second machine.<br />
</li><li>Boot this machine into Repair Mode.</li><li>Check if it can detect the image you made in Step 1.</li><li>If it can, reboot normally, then use a fine-toothed comb to compare the contents of the folder created in Step 1 with the folder that the restore process refuses to detect. Include hidden files and folders. The two folders must in essence contain the same
 subfolders and files.</li></ol>

            <p><strong>I have tried the action you suggested and the results are confusing to say the least.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two almost identical machines. Both are installed with Windows 7 professional + SP1 and all the latest patches. They both have a SATA port accessible from outside the case. I have a number of 1Tb hard disks which I use to backup the internal O/S drives.
 I have cleared another hard disc to act as a test disc.</p>
<p>I installed this test disc in the external port . Formatted it (quick format) to clear all the data from it. I then using Backup/Restore created a backup of the C drive. Allowing Windows to choose what to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then attempted to restore the system image&nbsp;in two different ways.</p>
<p>1. Using the full installation disc and </p>
<p>2. Using the repair disc created immediately after the Backup/Restore finished.</p>
<p>Using option 1. I was able to get to the point of restoration, it had found the backup system image and I thought problem solved. To complete the test I then tried&nbsp;option 2. This failed to find the system image!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeated this test on the second machine.</p>
<p>Neither option 1. or option 2. was able to find the system image!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So problem is not solved. I do not wish to spend a lot more time on this and am&nbsp;going to revert to using my third party image taker exclusively.

<p>Unfortunately there is little value in performing this test on two nearly identical machines. If one is flawed then the other is likely to suffer from the same flaw. The test should be carried out on a machine that is by and large independent from you.<br />

<p>To start things off concerning the "Where's my Cape" achievement. Make sure you have completed all the reward able challenges. There are a couple that give Power upgrades that normally are not listed when looking at the powers themselves. It can be a pain
 tracking down which one is missing, but I've had two other friends in the same situation, and an incomplete challenge was holding their last upgrade hostage.</p>
<p>As for your second issue of the 40 hour achievement, I just figured this one out earlier today myself. When you go to save the game, there is a time stamp of in game time for the file, but unfortunately this time is not what is being counted for the achievement.
 The achievement goes based off the Play time which you can find on your stats in the Extras menu (1st page near the top). After completing everything I found that there was about an hour and 45 minute difference in my game... guessing it has to do with menu
 screens and cut scenes.</p>
<p>I hope this bit of information becomes helpful and solves your issues.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I got the 40 hours played one but the Where's my cape still hasn't popped, I'm at 98% I've done absolutely everything in the game including all gold medals all clusters and all reward giving challenges, I also ran down the powers and
 upgrade lists to make sure they're checked 3 times and they were. So it has to be a bug, looks like I'll just need to hope they patch it.</p>

<p>For some reason the game did not allow u to unlock upgrades to buy. You will have to start a new game. The upgrades from the challenges don't count. This glitch is because you collected too many clusters before beating the game or you did too many missions
 for your homies before getting to certain points in the story. </p>

<p>I collected as much as I could early on, and did homie missions as soon as they were available before anything else, and I didn't have that glitch.</p>
<p>I have all the clusters and haven't finished the main story yet and managed to get all upgrades.</p>

<p>In case anyone is still wanting to get this achievement. &nbsp;After playing this game 2 x and getting 100% and not getting this achievement I found a solution on another site that someone had posted. &nbsp;I did it the way he said to and did this on a 3rd playthrough
 and it finally popped. &nbsp;This is how I did it.</p>
<p>1. Do the main story mission up until The Kinzie Gambit. Save game.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Do all the side missions and loyalty missions. &nbsp;Be sure to get to level 50.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Was told to collect all data clusters but I want to note I did not collect all of them. I only collected the amount I needed to purchase power upgrades and I did collect most of them while doing the side missions. &nbsp;But you can wait until after the side
 and loyalty missions if you like.</p>
<p>4. Went back to main story and played and finished mission Kinzie Gambit.</p>
<p>5. Purchased all the power upgrades and achievement popped.</p>

<p>The Saints row games are so awesome but so badly bugged too! In a game where they insist so many little tiny things are tracked (kills with this gun but only on aliens miles in this car, hours played) and rewarded you would have thought they'd have built
 in a trustworthy system to track it. It should be simple really. I'm playing it further down the line so hopefully most of these are patched now.</p>

<p>Playing some Saints 4 right now and annoyed that I cannot even log in (in game) to access the character gallery so I can switch characters. &nbsp;I can sign in on the website although the My Steelport sections isnt accessible and probably why I cannot log in
 (in game) to get my other characters. &nbsp;Really disappointing and tired of it always being something when it comes to the website/in game connection.</p>

    <title>Surface RT &#43; Windows 10 on Arm - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rism_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT &#43; Windows 10 on Arm</h2>
                    Because Microsoft may release a version of Windows on ARM devices (maybe an emulator, from what I've heard) is it possible that we could run it on Windows RT devices such as the Surface RT?

<p>I agree, especially since they didn't let us upgrade. I was an early adopter for the Surface and this is what Microsoft gives back? If they do let us upgrade, I'll be so happy! Who knows? Maybe they are making Windows 10 on ARM for us.</p>

            It would be nice, but I doubt there's going to be an official path. It's a shame - the Surface RT hardware is excellent, and I rather liked the OS.

    <title>Re-Install Windows 10 Store App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denisjc-hp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-Install Windows 10 Store App</h2>
                    <p>Is there a viable way to re-install the Windows 10 Store App</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the current posted fixes do not work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that have been tried</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Run Powershell script to re-install =&gt; <strong>result</strong>, &nbsp;IO Error see below for details.</li><li>Create Second User =&gt; <strong>result</strong>, &nbsp;store icon appears, but does not open.</li><li>&nbsp;Restore to previous restore point =&gt; <strong>result</strong>, well nothing really no change.</li><li>Create duplicate of the windows store package folder and change permissions from Trusted Installer =&gt;
<strong>result</strong>, same IO error as in 1, which is interesting as the folder now has admin rights and ownership.</li><li>Ran Windows Store troubleshooter =&gt; <strong>result</strong>, informs me that there is a problem. &nbsp;nice but not very useful.</li><li>Run the Windows Store Cache reset =&gt; <strong>result</strong>, well nothing really same problem.</li></ol>
<p>So atm rather stumped.... and as this is a development works station to re-install windows would take well a few days.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Powershell IO Error</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode</span></p>
<p><br />
This does not work it throws a write IO error, this might be due to the lack ot write permission in this folder. the only person with write permission is TrustedInstaller.</p>
<p>So any ideas please to just simply getting the Store working again.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Denis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot your concern, we suggest that you restore your computer to the time before the Windows Store app was uninstalled. Refer to the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Search </strong>box.</li><li>Type <strong>Create a restore point</strong>.</li><li>Press<strong> Enter</strong> to open the legacy "System Protection" settings page to configure the feature.</li><li>Click the <strong>System Restore</strong> button.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. It will show all the available restore point with date, description, and more importantly, you'll also see the type, which specifies if it was created manually or by the system.</li><li>As you select a restore point, click <strong>Scan for affected programs</strong> to view the applications installed since the last restore point, which will be deleted during the restore process.</li><li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to go back to the wizard.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> to begin the restore process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Stephanie</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Already Preformed and no Result</strong></p>
<p>This is point number 5 on the list in the first post. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Ran Windows Store troubleshooter =&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>result</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">, informs me that there is a problem. &nbsp;nice but not very useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thus the troubleshooter does nothing but report that there is an issue, no resolution, no links no nothing, just ..... there is a problem, so the tool is in effect useless.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Was Original Problem in the first place</strong></p>
<p>As this was the original problem, before someone recommended un-installing and re-installing the Store. &nbsp;<br />
Which completely breaks Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So by managing to perform a restore, we simply got the store back but with the same error as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Re-install Windows a bad solution</strong></p>
<p>Atm it seem that there is no fix for this and it requires a complete re-install. &nbsp;It is a very bad design by Microsoft that allows the easy removal of the store, but has no method to restore it to working order. &nbsp;You really need to create some type of admin
 section in the control panel to sort out the inbuilt apps in windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as there is a lot of programs on this workstation to re-install will take a week of work. So I was looking to fix the store first and not just dump my whole installation for something that is unknown, and might happen again at any day in the future
 after re-installing all my applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other attempts to Fix this issue already tried&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Delete SoftwareDistribution Folder =&gt; result Store simply recreates the folder and shows the same error.</li><li>&nbsp;Use DISM Tool =&gt; result displays message that there are no errors.</li><li>Create new User &amp; Login =&gt; result much worse the new user cannot open any of the Windows 10 Apps, calc, store dvd etc.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Repeated Requests for this to be resolved on forum</strong></p>
<p>Also why has this not been escalated in Microsoft Support, as it appears to repeat over and over on the forum?</p>

            <p>The link above is not the answer to the question. &nbsp;I have unmarked this link, as it is a useless discussion between many users that have issues with the Store application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATM I am sure that Microsoft does not know how to fix these issues. &nbsp;And referring us to a community post that rambles on for pages and pages is unacceptable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this error now for two months, and bar a re-install of Windows 10 it seems it cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you care to read the post from the start, the first thing I tried was</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Run Powershell script to re-install =&gt;&nbsp;<strong>result</strong>, &nbsp;IO Error see below for details.</li></ol>
<p>This is what you suggested in your comment above. And <strong>it does not work</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Kindly escalate this issue within Microsoft, as this forum clearly has no technical personnel to deal with this issue.</p>

    <title>Clicking Play in ANY Challenge game returns the screen to the Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindileeloo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clicking Play in ANY Challenge game returns the screen to the Windows home screen</h2>
                    I haven't been able to play any of the challenge games since November 5. I can select the game, watch the advertisement, but when I click Play it returns me to the Windows home screen. No error message is displayed. I've tried it repeatedly on every game
 and every day. Same result. Challenges are the only part of the game that I play. If not fixed, I'll uninstall it.

    <title>Edge&#58; cannot open lots of PDF files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxim__s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge&#58; cannot open lots of PDF files</h2>
                    <p>This one, for instance (Russian legal agreement):</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.bgoperator.ru/pr_img/1000516/20150608/59038698/ag_ag_bgo.pdf</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE+Adobe Reader opens it fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More so, from&nbsp;the error message, I suspect that the PDF stuff in Edge crashed internally and then C++ exception was caught. This means that there is a potential of buffer overrun security issues there.</p>

            <p>Oh yes. Good that we have Adobe Reader preinstalled :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE cannot open PDFs itself. It can only OLE-host Adobe Reader inside itself, which still works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just note that the feature of "native PDF opening in Edge" does not work with a good deal of existing documents.</p>

            <p>Hi Divaker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to open the Administrative tools from the Start Menu, then you may refer to the steps provided in the following link:</p>
<p><span><strong><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff700232.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Display Administrative Tools on the Windows 7 Start Menu</a></strong></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you get the administrative tools window empty, then the issue may be caused due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The Administrative Tools shell folder path is incorrectly set.</span></li><li><span>The Administrative Tools shortcuts are deleted accidentally.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Therefore, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>

<h3> chipmunk13  say:</h3>
<h2>            No LifeCam studio dashboard with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 Pro and I have just purchased a Microsoft LifeCam Studio webcam and installed the latest software (LifeCam4.25.exe) from the Microsoft product page for this device.&nbsp; While the software seemed to install correctly and I can see the
 web cam under Devices and Printers I don't seem to have any access to the LifeCam dashboard - I believe it should be under Start/Programs however there is nothing there.&nbsp; I have also tried to execute the 2 x system files in the c:\program files\Microsoft LifeCam
 directory (LifeEnC2.exe and LifeTray.exe) however nothing happens when I click on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having the same issue and/or have a solution to this problem?&nbsp; I am looking for some way to access the camera setup.</p>

<h2>            Random Zoom in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Completed updated Windows 10 appears to allow for random zooms on almost all windows.&nbsp; This is true in IE, File Explorer, Chrome etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the two finger scroll settings stops the problem for a minute or two, but then the problem is recreated.

            <p>Drivers have been updated and it is still happening. &nbsp;Windows 10 upqdated yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem stops when I change the two finger scroll settings. &nbsp;But after a few minuted the system reverts to the default mouse two finger scroll setting and random zoom problems begin again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is an HP Envy 17inch with touch screen. &nbsp;But we are experiencing the problem on several Windows 10 computers in our home..of a variety of makers..but all purchased within the last year.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screens&#63; Causes&#63;</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just recently built a Windows 7 computer a couple months ago, Haven't used it much since Ive been really busy studying and such. I've decided to play some games on it since I built it as a gaming pc, Everything's been working all fine and dandy but recently
 I've been experiencing blue-screens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've noticed them when using the PCSX2 Emulator and DS3 Motionjoy tool. I have some additional information that makes me believe its the DS3 Tool. I was once playing Just Cause 2 and it crashed out of no where mid game. I'm not too sure if the controller cord
 got nicked and the connection was lost that cause the blue screen. It happened again when my pc went in standby mode. (I think ds3 tool was still active) and once when I plugged in my iPod it crashed. (again DS3 was active.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked at other forums and people suggested other users to update their gfx card since that might be the issue and I proceeded to do it. and as you guessed it when I played the PS2 emulator it indeed crashed. It never bluescreens when Im on the web and
 stuff like that. at least I dont recall it ever happening. I included all the DMP files excluding the Just Cause 2 one since I misclicked and my dmp files are already uploaded. If yous need it just let me know and ill upload it. I also included a msinfo32
 document. for yeas.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me. I don't want to be in the hole for $1300, it cost me to build this thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Im not sure if this is relevant at all but might as well give yous as much info I can. Game was Persona 4.<br />

            Thanks very much!<br />
<br />
The attached dumps are almost entirely made up of the following bugcheck <b><br />
<br />
WDF_VIOLATION (10d).</b><br />
<br />
The Kernel-Mode Driver Framework was notified that Windows detected an error<br />
in a framework-based driver<br />
<br />
In all of your dumps, it's pointing to the culprit MijXfilt.sys on the stack, etc, which is the MotioninJoy simulate Xbox 360 controller (virtual Xinput device) driver:
<a href="http://www.motioninjoy.com/blog/motioninjoy-simulate-xbox-360-controller-virtual-xinput-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.motioninjoy.com/blog/moti...-xinput-device</a><br />
<br />
In the *10d dumps, the process at the time of the crash is also very consistent, which is
<b>DS3_Tool.exe</b>.<br />
<br />
<br />
To my knowledge, using this specific driver rather than the official drivers is not recommended... I've seen MijXfilt.sys tons in the past in cases of analysis. Remove this driver and install the official driver:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/xbox-360-controller-for-windows/52A-00004#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en...-00004#support</a><br />
<br />
As far as I know, removing MotioninJoy via add / remover programs uninstall list doesn't work and the driver still remains, so you must uninstall it via the uninstall list, AND THEN navigate to c:\windows\system32\drivers and delete MijXfilt.sys.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    Where can I get it. The one that came with WIN 10 is horrible. Even if I wanted to use it as bad as it is, it wont import the MM files and I have created a lot of travel and music videos. Although the programmer did what they were probably told to do,
 the committee who approved its replacement should be fired.

            Hello, unfortunately, Windows Movie Maker is unavailable for download. More on that here:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054502/windows-10-movie-maker-is-no-longer-available-for-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405450...</a>
<br />I agree that Movie Maker was a really great program, however, Microsoft has gone through the path where we would ditch this program. Hope this short explanation made you understand and let me know if you have questions!

            A. Windows Essentials 2012 suite which included Movie maker has been retired by Microsoft as on 10-Jun-17. Hence, Microsoft doesn't provide the download for this. 
<br />
<br />But you can download Windows Essentials 2012 suite which will include Movie Maker also from below location. 
<br />

<br />
<br />B. However, Microsoft Store offers few choices which you can make use of to download a good movie editor program.
<br />
<br />Some of them are (You can hunt for more on the Store)

            You may not be able to download it directly from MS, but there are other places where it can be downloaded. I am hoping that someone else here after coming to the realization that MS screwed this up and have left people like me abandoned and unable to
 import MM files in their "new" and "improved" package, may have found a place.

            I agree that Microsoft has made a poor decision in cutting support completely for Windows Movie Maker. There are however some ways to open wmm files in Windows 10.

            Thanks I will give this a try. I checked out the other packages and they are nowhere near as good those ratings are doubtful. Its absolutely amazing that MS would intentionally put their loyal (non-MAC) customers at risk but doing this almost forcing them
 to go to outside sources to make up for their lack of good judgement. And to make matters worse, their replacement software wont even import their own MM files.

            You may want to try installing the Movie Maker 6.0 as this supports opening .wmm files. Try and see if you could do so, and update me on the progress :-)

<p>It never does this. So I put in what I thought was my password and it says it isn't right. I tried the repair above and it didn't work. Is there a way to find the password or to change it?</p>

            I have managed to get in now by just keeping trying! But I still can't access my Windows Live Mail account on any other device. I tried following your link, but this is just for Hotmail I believe? It's an info@..... account we are having the trouble with.
 Thanks :)

Hi</p>
<p>Excel 2007 has some known problems with the Aero Snap features. You cannot drag or use the keyboard shortcuts for most of these options when Excel is maximized, you must click the Restore Down button first.</p>
<p>However, if you have multiple monitors you can still use the Windows logo key+Shift+left or right Arrow key to move a maximized Excel window to the other monitor.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Alice,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the PC is not recognizing USB devices, then there could be an issue with the USB port or the USB drivers. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, I would suggest you to try using a different USB port to check if the issue is with the USB port.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run the hardware and devices troubleshooter which can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key +F</em></strong> to bring up the
<strong><em>search</em></strong>&nbsp;Charms bar.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong><em>settings</em></strong> in the drop down menu below&nbsp;search and type
<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><em>Troubleshooting </em></strong>and select the
<strong><em>view&nbsp;all</em></strong> option on the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><em>Hardware and devices</em></strong> troubleshooter and&nbsp;follow the prompts.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any incorrect settings, then I would suggest you to manually check the Device manager for any errors. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, select Device manager.</span></li><li><span>Expand the “Universal serial bus controllers” section.</span></li><li><span>Check if there is a yellow exclamation mark or a red cross mark any USB controllers.</span></li><li><span>Right click on device and select properties.</span></li><li><span>In the General tab, check the device status.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the device status reports any driver issues, reinstalling the driver could resolve the issue. Visit the computer manufacturer’s website to download the latest USB driver and BIOS, chipset drivers. Save the drivers in a temporary location.
 Now uninstall the current USB drivers by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, select Device manager.</span></li><li><span>Expand the “Universal serial bus controllers” section and&nbsp;locate the USB controller.</span></li><li><span>Right click the device and select “Properties”.</span></li><li><span>Click on the driver tab to check the current driver installed&nbsp;for that device.</span></li><li><span>Click on the uninstall button to uninstall that driver.</span></li><li><span>Now restart the computer. Windows will boot the computer with the&nbsp;generic drivers. Check if the issue persists with the generic drivers.
</span></li><li><span>If yes, install the latest drivers that you downloaded and&nbsp;check. Also install the latest BIOS and chipset updates.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Try these steps and let us know the results.</span></p>
