<h2>            BSOD 0x0000003B</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having severe issues with BSOD's contentiously crashing my system at random. Lately it has been happening more and more. Currently I am in Safe Mode because standard mode will not boot properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting the following stop error;</p>
<p>
</p><p>0x0000003B</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run anti virus, CHKDSK, uninstalled programs such as graphics drivers (internet recommendation), and ATTEMPTED to apply the hotfix from the windows troubleshooting website. The hotfix said I was running a more current version or whatever it was trying
 to apply, and failed to install anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows XP 64bit Pro. I understand this is no longer a supported product, but I cannot upgrade due to financial constraints, and need to work within my means.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I seem to be okay! I think this is a success! I mean, I'm leery of early celebration because I've been dogged by the problem for so long, but I haven't suffered a single BSOD since removing AVG! I'm shocked! AVG was the last thing I expected to be the
 cause of my problems. If anything, I was thankful I had it to run down any threats!<br />
<br />
In other news, I'm out an otherwise serviceable Anti-virus program.

I stayed up to see if it stayed "fixed," and near as I can tell, all is well. I can go to sleep now. :) I'll give it a day or two and see what happens, if anything, by then.</p>

    <title>Surface Book will not awaken on either monitor since recent update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnarmor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book will not awaken on either monitor since recent update KB4022716</h2>
                    I am having trouble with my dual screen viewing on my surface book and an external Dell monitor [latter connected to a MS mini display port adapter to the Surface Book]. I've not had any problems with this setup until immediately after I downloaded the
 recent upgrade KB4022716.&nbsp;Normally, I set my power options on the Book, with cord plugged in, for a 20 min period of inactivity putting the sreens in sleep mode until I touch the touch pad and facial recognition reactivates the software. Since I loaded this
 upgrade, while I have no issues on viewing both screens in a fresh start mode, when I walk away from my Book for &gt;20 min, neither screen (Dell nor Book) will light up. I have found 2 approaches to bypass this monitor problem: 1- if I hold the power button
 on the Book down for ~10 sec, the screen on the Book flickers and if I swipe upwards on the screen, I can see images on both monitors, or 2-if, in trying to awaken from sleep mode, I momentarily unplug the cable from the Dell

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about this problem and thanks for the details. Another option that could assist you for now is to use the
<strong>Crtl+Shift+Windows Key+B</strong> key combination. This will reset your display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try turning off and then back on your external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7/11 Update:</strong> Please ensure you have the latest update installed by checking
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update.
</strong>More information about this update can be found in the article at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4025342/windows-10-update-kb4025342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;have found 2 approaches to bypass this monitor problem &nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>A common workaround for blank screen scenarios is to press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter, depending on what should be on the screen then.&nbsp; E.g. the idea is to open the Project dialog (whether you can see it or not) and use an arrow key to change the Display mode.&nbsp;
 That will cause a refresh.&nbsp; If it does something you don't like you can then try Win-P, CursorDown, Enter to try to undo it.&nbsp; If you have any open windows their position may be the only casualties of the experiment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another helpful diagnostic for these scenarios is to use Narrator to tell you what it "sees" and help guide you with some keyboard navigation. &nbsp; Unfortunately the keyboard shortcut we were used to was changed by the W10 CU recently so you would need to know
 whether to press Win+Enter or Win+Ctrl+Enter to get that started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>I am having a similar problem with my Surface and 2 additional monitors through a Surface Dock.</p>
<p>It used to wake from inactivity sleep fine with a mouse wiggle; but now while one screen flashes a bit, ultimately nothing comes back on 3 black screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can force it to by unplugging the Dock connector, after which all the Windows flick back to the Surface, and then I plug it back in again and all screens come alive and then I have to move all the Windows back where they were - but it's a pain.</p>

<p>Greg, many thanks for this additional work-around [<strong>Crtl+Shift+Windows Key+B</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;key combination]&nbsp;</span>and it was very helpful. This did work for me, but it is not as ideal as the
 operation before the MS update; although I like it better than the two I came up with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also interesting from the building message stream that others are running into the same issue, so I hope that MS can come up with a future update that takes us back to where things used to work. There ought to be a forum or email address to notify
 the MS programmers about issues like this, but perhaps this train of messages will filter back to those within MS who can resolve the problem.</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem as others have described:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Walk away from docked Surface Book connected to external monitors</p>
<p>2) Computer goes to sleep</p>
<p>3) Try to wake it up, all I see is the cursor arrow and all screens black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can get out of this is to disconnect the dock and then re-connect the dock.</p>
<p>

            Rhen Pal- thanks for providing the detail regarding driver updates. I (John A.-originator of this message train) did try this for both my monitors, but in my case it said that the most up-to-date drivers were installed and running. However, I shall record
 your potentially useful solution in case I run into future driver issues. So far, contrl/shift/logo/B works for me as as work-around, but it still requires this extra effort. Hopefully, MS will issue a future update on this update that corrects this problem.

<h2>            CONTROLE XBOX ONE LIGA NORMALMENTE COM PILHAS, MAS COM USB N&#195;O &#40;XBOX ONE CONTROL CONNECTS NORMALLY WITH BATTERIES, BUT WITH USB NOT&#41;</h2>
                    <p>pessoal, primeiramente bom dia, boa tarde e boa noite. Seguinte, meu controle do xbox funciona normalmente usando pilhas, porem quando tento ligar pelo USB ele não da sinal de vida, sei que parece que o USB estragou, mas ai vem a parte curiosa: se eu estiver
 com as pilhas no controle, conectar o USB e tentar ligar o controle, ele da uma vibração muito forte e isso acontecia quando eu usava o usb.&nbsp; Se eu tentar ligar o controle sem o usb, ele liga normalmente, apenas fica piscando por alguns segundos até conectar,
 por isso achei estranho ele vibrar quando esta com usb (oque me faz acreditar que a entrada usb não queimou). Já tentei outros USBs e deu a mesma coisa (também fiz o esquema até ele vibrar e depois tirar a pilha pra ver se ele continuava ligado, porém ele
 desliga). Alguem sabe oque pode ser? Muito obrigado desde já</p>

<h2>            adding new device to family safety</h2>
                    Dear All, I recently bought a new W8 pc for my 12 year old son.&nbsp; When I added his user account to the new pc, I clicked the box to indicate that this is a child's account, and accessed family settings to make sure that all of the right boxes were clicked.&nbsp;
 However the new pc does not show up as a device on familysafety.microsoft.com, and I do not receive a weekly email giving me details of his activities on the new pc.&nbsp; Family safety continues to work well though on his w8 phone, and on my w8 laptop (on which
 he is a user).&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; thanks

            <p>Hi frednell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. I understand that the child account on the new computer&nbsp;does not appear in the Family Safety website. To troubleshoot this issue, please ensure that the parent email account is set as an administrator on the
 child's Windows 8 computer. After that, please follow the steps below on how to properly manage the settings on the&nbsp;Family Safety&nbsp;website:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Start screen, type Family Safety.</li><li>Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Family Safety</strong> icon.</li><li>On the bottom part of the window, click <strong>Manage settings on the&nbsp;Family Safety&nbsp;website</strong>. Your default browser will direct you to the&nbsp;Family Safety&nbsp;website.</li><li>Sign in using the parent account.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

 Windows Update to stop it from trying to install automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve attempted so many different ways, to get it installed, it’s unbelievable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s a list:</p>
<p>Windows Forum.</p>
<p>Settings – update &amp; security – check for updates. Failed to install V.1703.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Update Assistant. Failed to install V.1703.</p>
<p>Media Creation Tool. Failed to install v.1073.</p>
<p>Contacted Microsoft Support – They downloaded ISO file that also failed to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran troubleshooter numerous times: keeps finding the same item’s, states “FIXED” but next time it’s still the same.</p>
<p>Some security settings are missing or have been changed. Fixed.</p>
<p>Service registration is missing or corrupt. Fixed.</p>
<p>Potential Windows Update Database error. Fixed.</p>
<p>Windows Update Components must be repaired. Fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset PC. Failed</p>
<p>Used USB Stick Recovery. Failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update Standalone Installer. This update is not applicable to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Install and Uninstall. Failed.</p>
<p>BITS Diagnostic</p>
<p>Command Prompt (admin) sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m at the point of no return with this!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’ve 3 other laptops: 2 ACER Aspires &amp; ASUS TP300LA all have the Feature Update V.1703 Installed with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final conclusion is, I now seem to be getting the same pop up banner stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“<span><strong>Set up couldn’t start properly. Please reboot your PC and try running Windows 10 Setup again.”</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>I don’t understand registry so please don’t explain about using it.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanking you for you time in reading this. Any other idea’s will be gratefully received.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry it's so long.</p>

<p>I suggest downloading Ver 1703 directly rather than through Windows update and updating to it using&nbsp;a procedure called a Repair install [also known as an In-Place upgrade].&nbsp; Its name is a bit misleading, it is not an installation as such [your applications,
 user accounts &amp; your own files are not overwritten].</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Create a Windows 10 installation disk [USB/DVD] using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</a> - this will be a Ver 1703 installation disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Boot your computer normally [not from the installation disk].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; Backup your own files and, if you use them, create a new system image.&nbsp; I have never had a Repair install go wrong on me but I still always take this precaution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; Disconnect any unnecessary hardware such as external drives just to keep things simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; Run though the Repair install procedure - <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install Windows 10 with an In-place Upgrade - TenForums</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>6&nbsp; Uninstall the Media creation tool that you installed in step 1.&nbsp; It is of no further use to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note - Ver 1709 is to be released on Tuesday 17th October 2017.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Along with many other people I will update to that using&nbsp;a Repair install procedure.&nbsp; It is a very reliable procedure.&nbsp;
</li><li>But we have to start with step 1 again because each version of the Media creation tool is hard wired to its own version so if you used the one you have used today you would accidentally be updating to Ver 1703 again instead.</li><li>I did read posts a while ago that this hard referencing in the Media creation tool was to be removed so that we did not have to keep getting&nbsp;new versions of it but I have never seen any confirmation that the change was made.</li></ul>

<p>Windows 10 setup only performs basics checks regarding compatibility: processor speed, memory and video ram. There might be other issues at play, which is why the laptop is not supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ASUS doesn't support it, I recommend you either downgrade to Windows 10 1607 and block 1703 and later or go back to Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>I cannot see anything in what you have written that explains the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That error code oxc1900107 indicates that Windows was already trying to&nbsp;do an update when the procedure was run.&nbsp; You can guard against that by running one of two troubleshooters then disconnecting from the internet before running the Repair install.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">1&nbsp; The proper troubleshooter - Settings, Update, Troubleshoot, Windows update.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">2&nbsp; The one I use - download &amp; run the batch file provided in
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-windows-update-reset-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update - Reset - TenForums</a></p>
<ul>
<li>What both of these do is reset Windows update's database and clear out the files it saves along the way.&nbsp;
</li><li>This removes impediments to running updates.&nbsp; </li><li>I have seen the #2 TenForums version succeed when #1, the proper one, has failed to fully clear things up.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would&nbsp;run one of those troubleshooters then try the Repair install again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you say you have already downloaded the ISO does that also mean that you have made an installation disk already.&nbsp; If so then there is no need to download it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Are you familiar with making system images?&nbsp; Making one beforehand would be the ultimate guarantee that you could revert to what you have now if anything went wrong.&nbsp; You would need an external drive with as much spare space as you have used up on your
 C:\ drive.&nbsp; If you have then making&nbsp;a system image would be well worthwhile.&nbsp; </em>

<p>It also occurs to me that, before considering further update attempts, you might benefit from running SFC-DISM procedures - see
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
SFC and DISM - ZigZag Forum article</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst you might think the whole thing is just too complicated,&nbsp;just consider each step in turn then do it and only then start worrying about the next step.&nbsp; Before you know it you'll have finished the lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that everything addressed by the SFC-DISM procedures will get overwritten by the Repair install but completing them first might remove something that has been lurking in the background &amp; hindering your previous Repair install attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This suggestion is a bit of a long shot but I was re-reading your first post and there is such a long list of individual failure items that it seems worth trying [by which all I mean is that I would try it].</p>

<p>Staffs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok but it was to avoid that possible situation that I suggested <em>disconnecting from the internet before running the Repair install</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By disconnecting, you are ensuring that Windows update cannot be in the middle of anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you now have everything downloaded &amp; ready, </p>
<p>1&nbsp; disconnect from the internet,</p>
<p>2&nbsp; re-run the TenForums batch file to reset Windows update,</p>
<p>3&nbsp; restart the computer,</p>
<p>4&nbsp; run the repair install,</p>
<p>5&nbsp; reconnect to the internet&nbsp;&amp; run Windows update.</p>

            Knowing the specific drivers is only half the tale.&nbsp; Why are you looking for these drivers?&nbsp; Are you having problems with your parallel port and/or USB ports?&nbsp; This could be caused by driver problems or it could be a hardware issue (hard to diagnose a
 hardware issue without good parts to swap out and test).&nbsp; If you need to update the drivers, you need to use Device Manager (not msinfo32) - or perhaps clicking on an executable file which loads the drivers automatically (it depends on how it is sent via download).<br />
<br />
<span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device
 for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (I assume you will for the parallel port
 and USB ports), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span>.&nbsp;
 Or execute the driver installation program provided by the computer vendor or device manufacturer.&nbsp; Be VERY careful to get the correct Vista-compatible drivers as these devices are hard to identify (they usually don't come with model numbers or anything like
 that though they may have serial numbers) and using the wrong drivers could make the problem (whatever it is) worse.<br />
<br />
If you update the drivers succerssfully and still experience the problem, then it is probably a hardware issue.&nbsp; In that case either contact your computer manufacturer for technical support (hopeully it's still under warranty) or bring it to a professional
 computer repair technician (NOT Geek Squad or any of those big store centers as they don't really know what they're doing and charge a lot for that level of expertise) to have the components tested and possibly replaced.<br />
<br />
I hlpe this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<p>
</p><p>So I have a hard drive that was in a WD mccloud that wasnt working. Just wanting to get the pictures off of it I took it out and plugged it in to my PC. There is a blue check mark and when I go to assign a letter or do anything in computer management it

            Hi Al.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm not seeing a blue check mark, instead seeing a question mark on a D drive in Explorer that isn't shown in Disk management, even though you said you couldn't assign a letter.  Is that what you were referring to?  If not please post a screenshot so we can see what you're seeing:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot get the drive recognized in Disk Management then you can't even run File Recovery on it.  It would need to be have a professional File Recovery service try their methods which are expensive.  
<br />
<br />This is why I recommend to always have a cloud backup like Google Drive backup which lets you designate any folders to sync in real time up to 15gb free.  It's saved my bacon  even when I have an external and OneDrive backup as well.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Surface Pro Connection to second monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hoping I can get some answers!&nbsp; &nbsp;For several years, I was able to connect my surface pro to an external monitor without any issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;As I work on drafting software, this has been important.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not needed to do so for several months, and today, when
 relocating to a temporary office, my surface pro seems to be unable to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I have tried three different monitors, none of them work.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I have used both HDMI (2 different adapters) and a VGA adapter.&nbsp; Also no luck.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I have disabled the graphics card driver (Intel Iris 540) and enabled it more times than I can count.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the graphics card driver and reinstalled.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I have rolled back the driver.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I have reset my surface pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally, and I have not determined the pattern, the monitor will register on the display as being connected, but I am still getting a blank screen.&nbsp; No signal.&nbsp; I</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have power cycled, restarted, reset, and reinstalled all day long.&nbsp; Does ANYONE out there have a clue as to the problem here?&nbsp; I would be wildly appreciative as I am stuck with this temporary situation for a bit longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you.</p>

<h2>            Recover Gamertag attached to closed Windows Live ID account.</h2>
                    
<p>The Gamertag that I would like to continue using is attached to a Windows Live ID that I now assume has been compromised and closed. The same Windows Live ID was linked to the Windows Live ID&nbsp;I am using to post to this forum but now it is not. I have contacted
 Windows Live Support Forums to try and re-activate the account but am asking if there are any support staff here who can change the Windows Live ID associated with the Gamertag to a new Windows Live ID of my choosing if I can verify some of the details that
 were used to create the account.</p>
<p>As an aside, may I ask if Gamertags return to the pool of available Gamertags upon a certain level of inactivity or when the associated Windows Live ID is deleted?
</p>
<p>Moderators/support staff, please private message me for the Windows Live IDs and Gamertag in question. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

            Hi Raymond,
<br />
<br />Are you getting this message on a Blue Screen
<br />
<br />If you can get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If you can then get into Windows please provide the Mini Dump files as explained previously . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Lagging Out of Xbox Live Parties and Games.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all! I'm having some issues with my xbox live. Here's the scenario: I'll be playing Modern Warfare 3 with a full 4-bar connection, as well as sitting in an xbox live party talking with my friends, when all of a sudden, the party will go dead silent
 and everyone in the game will be running in place. A split second later, I lag out of the party and get kicked back to the multiplayer screen with a message reading: "Server connection has timed out."</p>
<p>I've tried so many things and browsed many threads on here from people who have had similar issues and nothing seems to work. Originally, my xbox has been connected to the router via ethernet cable, and everything was fine. Then, about a week ago, I started
 having these issues. So I changed some things around. I set my xbox's IP as the DMZ host, forwarded to all the correct ports, turned UPnP off, changed ethernet cables, changed ethernet ports, and reset the router multiple times. I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>I ran a speed test from speedtest.net, and here are the results:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.speedtest.net%2fresult%2f2022279415.png" /></a></p>
<p>Some additional background:</p>
<p>Located in Tampa, FL</p>
<p>ISP: Road Runner</p>
<p>Router: Ubee DVW3201b</p>
<p>Any and all help would be greatly appreciated guys. Thanks so much.</p>

<p>If yes, you should try playing again when all other devices are turned off/ not connected to the router.</p>

<p>Greetings, Magikarp. Thanks for bringing your question to the forums. To get some perspective, are you only encountering lag when playing Modern Warfare 3? Or, do you experience lag during other games, while using apps, or navigating the dashboard?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question that will help shed light on the issue would be whether you use any wireless accessories?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much, Magikarp. Keep us posted!</p>

<p>Alright guys, sorry for taking so long to respond. Anyway, the lagging out happens playing everything I own. I've experienced it with Call of Duty, Battlefield 3, Halo 3, Halo: Reach, everything. I will also lag out of parties sometimes while on the dashboard,
 but not as much. As far as apps, I don't really use any. Everything for my xbox is on a wired connection. I don't use anything wirelessly. iROC Your Socks brings up a very good point, I never had any of these problems before the most recent update.</p>

<p>The most recent update has made no changes to the way your console interfaces with the network. Although many see this as "the issue," updates typically always make things better rather than worse. ;)
</p>
<p>That said, have you tried doing a direct modem connection with your console? Let us know!

<p>Yes, my console is directly connected to the router/modem (it's a router/modem combo). None of my other devices have trouble with connecting or staying connected to the internet. This is very frustrating and I cannot seem to find out the issue. The only
 reason I question the update is because everything was completely fine before the update. Now all of a sudden, I'm constantly lagging out of parties and games.</p>

<p>I too have many problems as your encountering when playing Modern Warfare 3, I thoroughly believe its activision/infinity wards problem seeing that they do not have dedicated servers and always having lag issues. best way to find out is to follow activision
 assist on twitter and you can ask them, they are good about responding in a timely manner.</p>

<p>It's not just Call of Duty that is giving me problems. It happens with Battlefield, as well as Halo. As far as my router goes, I looked at the link provided and my router does not appear to be on it. I have a Ubee dvw3201b. That's just the one my isp provided
 me with. When I initially log on to xbox live, I can play fine for 30 minutes to an hour, then after that, I constantly lag out of parties and games. It wouldn't be so much of an issue if I were just lagging out of parties, but when I lag out of the party,
 no matter what game I'm playing, I get booted back to the multiplayer screen.</p>

            DCOM errors are normal and are present on all the computers. BSOD is a different issue.
<br />The crash dump isn't of much help except telling the cause that it was caused by Memory corruption. Do you have some more crash dumps?

<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation.

            <p>Provided the partition has not been removed Toshibas come with a recovery utility.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power on with the supply holding the "0" key pressed (zero). Keep it pressed until it starts the loading bar and it should boot into recovery mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have recovered the system all files, programs and settings will be lost as it rebuilds back to factory state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise if you Google "Toshiba recovery" one of the results will be the media ordering page.</p>

            <p>Greetings TacitHalfling0!</p>
<p>You have to download your gamer profile from LIVE with the username and password for your Microsoft account that is associated with the correct profile. Here's how!<br /><br />Run a connection test to Xbox LIVE to ensure that your Xbox can connect properly to LIVE. Now download your profile as follows:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<b>Xbox</b>&nbsp;<b>Guide</b>&nbsp;button on your controller (large X button in the centre of your controller).</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<b>Download Profile</b>.</li>
<li>Enter the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox LIVE gamertag. If you don’t know your Microsoft account or password, see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find your Microsoft account or password</a>.</li>
<li>Enter your Microsoft account password.</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, it's clear that my gamertag somehow became associated with some different MS account from my "real" one.</p>
<p>I'm still at a loss for how to figure out what account that is. &nbsp;Your instructions tell me that my xbox knows what it is, but it doesn't; it's a brand new xbox. The xbox that did know what it is died. Can I bring it somewhere to have it serviced?</p>

<p>I have a&nbsp;Toshiba Netbook NB200 which came pre-loaded with Windows 7 Starter.</p>
<p>It has been working really well until tonight when I've come to use it and at first I noticed Internet Explorer would not load - the 'wait' icon appeared and then after a few seconds disappeared. I have Office 2010 loaded on it and these applications work
 fine. I then decided to go to 'control panel' to maybe return to a system restore point but discovered that when i try to open any of the following; my computer, documents, control panel etc through the 'start' menu i get the following error message: Error
 code: (26EE0668=A00A=44D7-9317-BEB064=C98683)\0<br />
'The remote procedure call failed and did not execute'</p>

            Hi Mahesh,<br />
<br />
Although I do not have an issue with disk space, I will give your suggestions an honest try.&nbsp; I currently have 337 GB free.<br />
<br />
I have been having so many problems that I started over from scratch - I backed up my data, and completely reinstalled Windows OS 7, Open Office 3.4, JRE, Skype, Firefox, Windows Essentials Live, PDF Reader, Flash Player, and Spotify.&nbsp; I think that about covers
 it.<br />
<br />
I was trying to install Database 11g Express Edition, because I do a lot of work with databases.<br />
<br />
This error does not occur when trying to install other software.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am logged on as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help...although, I do believe I will need more help after I complete the suggestions you have offered.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Tony<br />

<p>&nbsp;I am having problems with Microsoft Office Updates. I have tried alot of things I have found in the forums, but nothing helps me.</p>
<p>Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 SP1 Security Update for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (KB979906)</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office Access 2007 (KB979440)</p>
<p>A security vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office Access 2007 that could allow arbitrary code to run when a maliciously modified file is opened. This update resolves that vulnerability.</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB2251419)</p>
<p>Security Update for the 2007 Microsoft Office System (KB2277947)</p>

<p>Any suggestion would be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi wrightm,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error messages when you try to install these updates?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try manually installing these updates by downloading it from the Microsoft download center?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below to see if that helps in installing the updates successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Perform a clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>While the computer is in clean boot, try to install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Once you’re done with troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Turn User Account Control Off</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below to know how to turn off the user account control</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</a><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Once you’re able to install the updates, turn on the user account control.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Disable your security software.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some anti-virus software will not allow making changes to the system files and thus blocks the installation of updates. Disable the anti-virus
 software completely and then try to install the updates.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Please do re-enable the security software once the troubleshooting is over.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Run the fix it from the link below and then check if you’re able to install the updates for office.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Error code "0x80070646," "646," or "1606" when you try to install Office updates</span></strong></p>
