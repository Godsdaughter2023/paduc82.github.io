</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this issue, but it's related to only one of my colleagues. The messages are stuck sending if it's a direct message with just her. If she's included in group text, it goes through.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I have uninstalled and re-installed and it has not helped. Any assistance would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

            <p>I solved the above problem for myself but I don't know if your problem is the same.</p>
<p>The install log was complaining that the WIC 32bit (Windows Imaging Component)&nbsp;wasn't installed, however when I tried to install it, the installer would claim I had a newer version on my system (which I did).&nbsp; However after careful study of the log files
 I discovered the installer fails because when it tries to install the WIC 32 bit and the system won't let it install because of the newer version, the installer takes this as an error and terminates.&nbsp; this is clearly a bug in the installer, but now the issue
 was how to fool the software into installing the .NET Framework.&nbsp; It turns out the installer checks the version of a file wmphoto.dll and if it is newer, then the install fails.&nbsp; This is how I got around&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>1) Go to&nbsp;the <strong>system32</strong> folder (under windows usually but for me it was under windows.0) and change the name of the file wmphoto.dll to something like HiddenWMphoto.dll so the installer can't find it.&nbsp; Don't delete it, you will need it again
 later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Install WIC 32bit from here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=32</a></p>
<p>3) When the install is complete, a WMphoto.dll file will now be in the system32 folder again.&nbsp; It should be the older version (you can check by right clicking and looking at properties).&nbsp; Delete this file and rename your hiddne file to wmphoto.dll again.</p>
<p>Now the .NET Framework will install.&nbsp; Good luck, and feel free to send me questions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot transfer files or folders to external hard drive or jump drives</h2>
                    <p>Cannot transfer files or folders to external hard drive or jump drives. Approximately a month ago, my computer (Windows 7 Home Premium) stopped letting me send/copy/paste/transfer files to my external hard drive. Nothing was corrupted but thinking it may
 be the hard Drive (external). I purchase a 128GB USB 3.0 JumpDrive and tried that...still nothing...I have a new computer and I want to copy all of my files and folders to put on my new computer (including MANY&nbsp;family pictures that date back to the 1990's)
 but it's not letting me take it off my computer to place on an external drive.</p>

</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when XP feels threatened
 by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d3631cf-b4ae-49f1-8cd5-a95c1e7f2055" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!

<h2>            Why am I getting Error Code&#58; 821 when I try to update to Service Pack 1 for Vista Home Basic&#63;</h2>
                    The latest update my computer (running Vista Home Basic) has been trying to download and install is the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework 3.5 Family Update (KB951847) x86...according to Windows Update. The problem is, it always
 finishes telling me the installation failed due to Error Code 821. I have found nothing covering this error code on Microsoft's support page. Why am I getting it and how do I fix it?

            Yep, it looks like the updates are bundled. Not having the cover attached will cause the trackpad drivers update to fail while all other updates are installed (but still shows as "Failed"), reattaching and running WU appears to have worked.

            It did.&nbsp; I plugged my keyboard in, ran Windows Update again and it found another Hardware Update.&nbsp; Which installed and applied without a reboot.<br />

Guess the keyboard firmware got an update.<br />

<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, let us know the below information.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since WordPad is designed with&nbsp;less features, I suggest you to open the file in Microsoft Office if it is installed in your system and check if you face the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Kindly write back to us with the updated status of the issue for further assistance on Windows, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Brightness icon missing in Action Centre. Windows 10. How can I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eileen71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brightness icon missing in Action Centre. Windows 10. How can I recover&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is day one of working on my brand new HP&nbsp;computer and I'm already having problems. I also noticed that I have only 8 buttons in the Action Centre. From what I have seen of screenshots of the Action Centre should there not be more than 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far,&nbsp;navigated to the&nbsp;'Display Adapter'. Selected 'Update Driver Software'. In resulting interface menu selected 'Browse my computer for driver software' then 'let me pick from a list of drivers for my computer'. Then selected' Microsoft Basic Display
 Adapter' from the list and, then selected 'Next'. I&nbsp;restarted the&nbsp;computer but the problem wasn't rectified. I don't know if this set of commands was to&nbsp;introduce the slider in the System/Display Settings (under Orientation) or not? But no slider has appeared
 there and no brightness&nbsp;icon in the Action Centre. I tried the Control Panel and Power Options but the slider isn't there either. How else am I supposed to adjust the brightness settings? And what about those other missing buttons? Is this a problem with the
 hardware? &nbsp;I hope not!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;for any advice&nbsp;you can give me.</p>

            <p>Yes, Lawrence, I did. I expected to see the slider right&nbsp;at the bottom of the page. &nbsp;At least that is where I was told to find it. Still no luck. What concerns me is the missing brightness icon in the Action Centre (also I have no WIFI icon), would like
 to know how to recover that. These are the sort of problems I would expect if I was upgrading to Windows 10 but certainly not in a brand new computer. But anyway, I really appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Just a thought. maybe 'Quick Actions'&nbsp;appears skeletal because I picked "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter' from the list of drivers.&nbsp;I had 2 options, may be I should pick the other one?</p>
<p>

            The other option was AMD Radeon (TM) R4 Graphics, which I forgot to revert to before I took the screenshot. Doesn't make one iota of a difference though, still get the same skeletal screenshot as before, with no brightness button to choose from. Don't
 know what to do now. Intuitively, something with this computer feels off.

            Well, would you believe today, I was automatically upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary. I now have two extra buttons and full pics of them underneath 'Quick Actions' but, unfortunately, the brightness button is still missing.

            <p>Phoned the Technical Helpline at Tesco Direct where I bought the computer from. It's a Desktop PC, so the technician&nbsp;reckons, the only way to control brightness is using the buttons underneath the screen, which are barely visible, may I add. So there is
 no brightness button in&nbsp;the Action Centre or brightness slider if you are working with a Desktop. Sorry, guys, for wasting your&nbsp;time. My fault for not telling you I was working with a Desktop PC.&nbsp; Furthermore, the&nbsp;brightness control slider only appears within&nbsp;
 System/Display in laptops only.</p>

    <title>Supported&#63; Windows 10 with USB 3.0 PCI adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darksquare  say:</h3>
<h2>            Supported&#63; Windows 10 with USB 3.0 PCI adapter</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 10 but had to rollback to 7 since I couldn't get Win 10 to see my external USB 3.0 drives. Actually they were seen immediately following the upgrade, but after rebooting they are no longer seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PCI card which has a Renesas chipset for USB 3.0. Using my Renesas CD, I reinstalled the drivers a couple of times. Device Manager indicated that my USB controller had up to date drivers but that there was no PCI driver for my card. Also, there
 was no rollback driver option for USB or PCI&nbsp; -&gt; it was working immediately following the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I wasn't able to see all of the options I saw on Win 7 when I used the installation CD. Normally when inserting the CD I get the option to install a PXI version of the card or a 2-port PCI version of the card. Now I just get a message that said old
 drivers were deleted and new ones were installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the website of Renesas but didn't see any Win 10 USB 3.0 drivers. So, before I give Windows 10 another shot I'd like to know if there are any USB 3.0 PCI cards which have been deemed to be compatible with the OS for use with external HDDs. I looked
 around online but didn't find any that listed drivers beyond Win 8.1 </p>
<p>
</p><p>My USB 3.0 external drives are WD Passport which are bus powered. Since my PC is old it only has native USB 2.0, so I need a USB 3.0 PCI adapter card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What USB 3.0 PCI adapter card can I go out and purchase and expect to have it work with my PC?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. Right now I'm just looking for known hardware that is Windows 10 compatible. Each time I go to Windows 10 and back to Windows 7, my Symantec Anti-Virus software gets uninstalled, Windows Defender gets disabled, and Microsoft Office
 2013 get deactivated. Reinstalling software, reactivating software, along with the OS installation and rollback times really starts to add up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have no problem going out and buying a 2-port USB 3.0 adapter card (PCI) which is compatible with Windows 10. I just need to know which one to buy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*After further checking, Renesas doesn't indicate that their product is Windows 10 or even 8.1 compatible</p>

<h2>            Photoscreensaver.scr on Win 7, x64&#59; max play time &#60; 5 hrs&#59; 4.3 GB of many jpg files.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>dear Readers,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>thanks a lot for taking time to read my&nbsp;posting.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My main queries/concerns about windows 7's photo screen saver .scr :</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. it is only a 32 bit application and hangs when there is a large number of files,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. sometimes restarts the computer after BSOD - removed wireless mouse n keyboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. is there a maximum size of all files in the folder from which it is&nbsp;playing the photos (all photos are in .jpg format)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. is there a bit 64 bit version of the app in the pipe that people might not encounter the issues i had.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. i have an early 64 bit amd 64 machine (6gb ram)&nbsp;that i have connected to my 46" SONY BRAVIA&nbsp;TV and want to use that as a photo viewer when bored; computer idle time out = 1min for photoscreensaver to start.&nbsp; it plays for less than 5 hours properly and
 literally chokes for me to reboot (details below).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6. is there any other windows photo player that i missing out that will plays pictures in random/</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>7. i have 17 megs of zipped&nbsp;dump file that i can share with developers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>DETAILS OF EVENTS:</strong></div>
<div>more details as to why i am asking the above questions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>after searching many postings for the problem i had with my screen saver, i found out the following;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>in win 7, 64 bit, scrnsave registry entry is correct as per <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2425702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>i have put all my pictures approx 4.3 GB to my e:\MyPhotos4TV to watch&nbsp; pictures from digital camera adn the rest scanned on the 46" tv.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>suddenly the pc crahsed with blue screen of death.&nbsp; so i removed the wireless mouse and keyboard from the PC and replaced them with a USB keyboard and mouse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>then the picture screen saver show used to freeze or hang.&nbsp; after looking into the folder, i found some .mov files and a zip file.&nbsp; so i moved them out of the e:\MyPhotos4TV folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>after that there was no bsod, but when the pictures are played at random, the photoscreensaver.scr process hangs for a&nbsp; few minutes and resumes displaying photos on the tv screen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>after the 1st hang of the screensaver on a particulary&nbsp;photo, the app continues the display of other phoros continues, only to hang on some other photo.&nbsp; the frequency of the hang increases with time and i get deparate to stop it and either restart of
 the machine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>the 1st hang of the photoscreensaver.scr application happens 4 hours of letting the photo display on tv using screensaver.&nbsp; the 2nd and 3rd hangs happen with 30 minutes and i will have to reboot with 90 minutes of the 1st screen saver hang.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>another thing i noted was that the photoscreen saver was only a 32 bit application - i did not know whether the 4.3 gb (2power 32) was limiting the photoscreensaver.scr or scrnsave.exe;&nbsp; my question: why did nt microsoft make this a true 64 bit app?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>when the application hanged, i saw the process in the task manager and generated a dump file - surprisingly that dump file was 75 megs in size.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>i have a 64 bit OS with 6 gb ram (533 hz) and the hard drive&nbsp;is a SATA.</div>
<div><br />
I will be glad to help out or test with MS for a good screen saver software that will make many lives interesting.<br />
<br />
thanks and regards<br />

            Hi Ravi,<br />
Thank you for replying.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to send us the minidump files so that it becomes easier to identify the reason behind this issue. But, before moving to the steps on how to collect the minidump files, please make sure that minidumps are enabled on the computer.<br />
<br />
You can follow the steps:<br />
<em>Step 1:</em></div>
<div>To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
a) Go to Start Screen, type 'sysdm.cpl' and press Enter.<br />
b) Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings button.<br />
c) Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
d) Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
e) Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as "%systemroot%\Minidump". <br />
f) Click on OK.<br />
g) Reboot the computer if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<em>Step 2:</em></div>
<div>Please follow the steps to copy the contents of minidump files:<br />
a) Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
b) Zip up the copy.<br />
c) Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
d) Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
You can refer to the link to know how to send us the minidump files using Skydrive:</div>

    <title>Touch Keyboard not appearing on tablet when trying to type in text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifer123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch Keyboard not appearing on tablet when trying to type in text fields</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung ATIV smart PC 700-T&nbsp;&nbsp; Tablet Windows 10 ( from 8.1 Pro )</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, when I touch a typing field, the keyboard does not appear in the task bar for me to open and type all the time. When it does, I annoyed, have to select the bottom right stylus button which in itself counter intuitive - to then get the options of a
 keyboard, to which I then must select which keyboard layout I want. For each and every time I want to type. Ridiculous. Someone please help me make my tablet's keyboard responsive and where can I turn off this ridiculous new option plus view - I only want
 to see normal layout each and every time like it used to in 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried setting keyboard to task bar and must do this each time I turn on the tablet. If I switch to tablet mode I get no keyboard option at all.</p>

            <p>Hello Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below to enable touch keyboard when there is no keyboard attached to the device.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key </strong>or click on Start icon.</li><li>Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Devices</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8134834-29f8-4505-8ce3-c41dd7c1df56" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Typing</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and toggle on: <em>Automatically show the touch keyboard in windowed apps when there's no keyboard attached</em>
<em>to your device</em>.</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb3af364-aeb8-4f65-8853-2bfd94a2bb55" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If issue persists then the issue could also be related to the <strong><span>Touch drivers and other updates</span></strong>. I want to inform you that&nbsp;updates will be released by Microsoft. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates
 not only important one but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the
</span><span><strong>Touch </strong></span><span>drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong><br />

<h2>            Update Win 10 without internet access</h2>
                    <p>I have a lan in my office which cannot be connected to the internet under any circumstances. I wish to download the patches on a separate computer, transfer using a flash drive and then install them on my lan. I couldn't find any option to download updates
 onto a flash drive for win 10. If possible, I require the download link.</p>
<p>I'll also be thankful if i can get the similar links for win 7 and win 8 since i have them also on my network.<br />

<h2>            Product key sticker eroded. Cannot read product key</h2>
                    I bought an Inspiron N5010 laptop from dell, and like all computers it came with the product key to the included copy of Windows 7 on a sticker, but it is on the bottom of the laptop and it has some wear.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot read the product key. I called Dell support and their only option is to sell me a 60$ installation CD that bypasses the need for the product key. Is there any way to retrieve my product key? I bought this copy of Windows and now it seems like
 the only proof of purchase is a flimsy sticker.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Very frustrated. Please help</div>

            Use F8 key during boot to get into the Advanced Boot Options menu. <br />
From the Advanced Boot Options chose the Repair Your Computer option. <br />
<br />
Click Next and login to your administrator account on the computer. Your administrator account is the account created the first time the computer was turned on.
<br />
<br />
Click Dell Factory Image Recovery and DataSafe options and follow the onscreen instructions.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
<p>There are several <strong>system recovery options for Dell computers</strong> and not all of them require such drastic measures as reformatting the hard drive and starting over. Newer Dell computers, such as the Dell Inspiron 580, will have the DataSafe
 Local Backup Option in addition to the the tradition method of restoring from an image located in a system recovery disk. Use the following methods to create recovery media and restore it in the event your Dell PC no longer boots.</p>
Create Dell System Recovery Media
<p>You can create recovery media using the DataSafe Local Backup utility. You can use either DVDs or a USB stick with 8GB or more of space. The system recovery media can be used to restore your Dell to the condition it was on a previous date without having
 to worry about the loss of data. To create the System Recovery media, turn on the computer and let it boot up. Insert the blank DVD (cannot be a re-writable disk) or USB stick and then go to Start&gt;Programs&gt;Dell DataSafe Local Backup and then click the
<em>Create Recovery Media</em> option.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/datasafe.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fdatasafe.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the creation of the media. Once done, store the media in a safe place for future use.</p>
Dell System Recovery
<p>You have several options to get your Dell back up and running again. Try the following in order, as they are organized as easiest to hardest:</p>
<p><strong>System Restore</strong> – A system restore is a feature built into Windows that allows you to go back to a previous state in the event a system file or hardware driver has been damaged. To perform a System Restore, go to Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System
 Tools&gt;System Restore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sysrestore.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fsysrestore.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Click through the restore options and go back to a date when you know the computer was working properly. Your personal data should be safe using this method.</p>
<p><strong>Dell DataSafe Local Backup</strong> – You can use this method if the System Restore does not work properly. You will need the USB key or DVD you created from the instructions above. Restart the computer. When you see the Dell logo, tap the F8 key
 until you access the <strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong>. Select <strong>Repair Your Computer</strong> from the list. Next, select
<strong>Dell DataSafe Restore and Emergency Backup</strong> from the System recovery Options and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the recovery process.</p>
<p><strong>System Recovery Media</strong> – Use this method to perform a System Recovery in the event you cannot boot into Windows or if you have replaced your hard drive. To use the System Recovery Media you created above, put the USB stick or DVD into the
 computer and restart the machine. As the machine begins to boot, tap the F12. Select the boot device (either the USB or DVD) and then follow the instructions to perform recovery using the media you created.</p>
<p><strong>Dell Factory Image Restore</strong> – This final method will destroy any data or programs you have added since you bought the computer. If you are still able to backup, backup any important photos, documents or other data before attempting this process.
 When ready, reboot and tap F8 until you see the Advanced Boot Options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/dellrecovery.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fdellrecovery.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Select <em>Repair Your Computer</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/factoryrestore.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2ffactoryrestore.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Select <strong>Dell Factory Image Restore</strong>. The image resides on a separate partition of your Dell’s hard drive. When the factory image restore has completed, your Dell will be the same as it was when you brought it home.</p>
As you can see there are several different recovery options for your Dell; some are easy, some are drastic. Choose the one that is best for you. Be sure to create the recovery media as soon as you can and always perform routine backups of your important data.<br />

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">If you don't have the restore partition or install disks:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.

<p>
</p><p>According to this, your TG862 is a <strong>cable</strong> modem --&gt; <a href="http://www.arrisi.com/products/product.asp?id=79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>The log you provided is from a telephony modem, which uses an analog telephone line.&nbsp; This is
<strong>not </strong>your cable modem.&nbsp; It may be your "Acer USB modem" (is any device connected to the computer by USB? if so, what is it?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Arris TG862 is not only a cable modem gateway, it also is a wireless access point, a router,
<strong>and </strong>can support to voice lines.&nbsp; Is the telephone handset on which your conversations cut in and out connected to the Arris TG862 or do you have telephone service that is separate from your cable service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who is your Internet Service Provider?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by "set up with a network"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you have an Acer USB modem connected to your computer, what is connected to the other end of that device?&nbsp;

<p>

</p><p>Not sure why that was even set up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Desktop Windows 7/ Laptop Windows 8.1</p>
<p>They share wireless printer.</p>
<p>

            <p>Do you have the Time Warner "Triple Play"?&nbsp; That is, do you pay TW for Internet, TV, and phone?&nbsp; If not, who do you pay for your phone service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your "land line" <strong>telephone</strong> connected to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are your "land line" telephones cordless?&nbsp; If so, the question above refers to what the base unit is connected to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that your telephone is connected to your Arris TG862 and that you pay TW for phone service.&nbsp; If both of those assumptions are correct, I'm afraid that only TW can deal with your phone service quality.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with your computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The likely culprits are either the Arris TG862 itself -- which TW should replace, assuming that you got it from them in the first place -- or the cable connection from the street to your home, which TW can test and repair.&nbsp; If you live in an area with detached
 houses and overhead utility wires, it is not unlikely that the wire from the street to your home has been damaged (usually by squirrels) or that the connectors on the outside of your home have become loose or wet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your telephones are cordless and only the base unit is connected by wire to the Arris TG862, TW may claim that the problem is your cordless phones.&nbsp; If this is the case, you should get at least one old-fashioned wired telephone and connect it
 to the TG862 to demonstrate that your equipment is not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume from what you wrote in your original question that the computer for which you supplied the Device Manager information is your desktop computer running Windows 7.&nbsp; Out of curiosity (it almost certainly isn't part of your current problem), what is
 the make and model of this computer?</p>

</p><p>1.&nbsp; Yes, we have Triple Play</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Windows 7</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; LG tower from Milwaukee PC&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Only had problems with phones the past few months</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; One base, plugged into a jack in bedroom (Tech did test).&nbsp; Did have it plugged into modem - no difference in quality of calls.&nbsp; 4 cordless extensions throughout house (phones are less than a month old)</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; This is a newly replaced modem from TW (last 2 weeks)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sent had sent an email to&nbsp;the COO of TW.&nbsp; No reply, so this morning I called.&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposedly someone is calling back!&nbsp;We'll see!!!&nbsp; I did laugh because for a moment she said she couldn't hear me - that was a first!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My husband then noticed someone from TW outside by our cable box.</p>
<p>

            <p>Good luck.&nbsp; There's a reason why nobody likes cable companies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what that security alert means.&nbsp; Searching for that gave a number of hits complaining of issues with that modem ... but not that warning.&nbsp; You could ask the TW tech when he shows up, but you may not get a straight answer.&nbsp; You could also try
 asking here --&gt; <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/twc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/twc</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked about your computer because I was trying to understand what that Device Manager entry refers to.&nbsp; It's odd that you don't see anything connected to the computer other than the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with Milwaukee PC, but it looks
 like they sell semi-custom computers.&nbsp; You might give them a call and ask what the "Acer USB modem" is all about ... but again, that's not related to your phone problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned squirrels because I had that problem on my cable TV:&nbsp; when there was heavy rain, I would get pixilation and video dropouts.&nbsp; Several visits from the Cablevision techs were no help until one finally told me that squirrels like to bite the wires.&nbsp;
 Their teeth leave little holes in the insulation, so that when it rains, water gets in and shorts things out.</p>

<h2>            Sudden Wireless Speed Troubles - Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource &#40;DNS server&#41; is not responding.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Sudden Wireless Speed Troubles</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a Dell Inspiron 1720 running Windows 8.1. Wireless has always worked perfect, I believe the wireless card is an Intel Pro-Wireless Link 4965 AGN. &nbsp;&nbsp;I normally get 40-50Mbps down and 10-20Mbps up running Xfinity by Comcast. I also have A desktop
 hooked up via Ethernet and 2 Mobile phones Connected view Wireless. I have the Newest Xfinity Wireless Mobile/router.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today all of a sudden on my Dell, my wireless download speeds dropped. They average around 2-3Mbps down but sustain the normal 10-20Mbps up.
</p>
<p>I also have a Netgear Wireless N USB Adapter I plugged into the Dell and it works fine. Speedtest came out normal as every other device. But going back</p>
<p>to the built in wireless, It goes back down to the 2-3Mbps range. This behavior just happened out of the blue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Diagnostics and I get the Message " Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Flushed my DNS cache, Released and Renewed IP address. Everything appears okay to me.
</p>
<p>I have my IPv4 and IPv6 all set to Auto DNS set. </p>
<p>I have updated all my drivers. Reinstalled the Pro Wireless Utility program. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not seem to find out why only my download speeds are suffering, and what caused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router settings have no changed. I have it set to Band 5 due to The Auto Band 11 being high used in my apartment complex and was suffering band congestion. And all of my other devices are working top notch. It's just something with my internal built in
 wireless card. USB dongle works fine. Ethernet works fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a copy of my IP and Network connections. </p>
<p>Any help would be great! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7129a88d-e6f9-4569-be0f-515c215372b7" /></p>

            <p>Hi B Kelley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better with this issue, I would like to ask few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>3) How did you update/reinstall the network card drivers for your computer model? Was it done from the Dell website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first suggest you to try restarting or resetting the router, connect this computer first with the router and before connecting the other devices, check download speed and let us know if there is any change. If that doesn’t help then try the troubleshooting
 methods given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 1: Temporarily disable the third party security program. (If you have installed any)</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any third party security program on the computer, I request you to contact its technical support to temporarily disable it and then check the status of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t tried uninstalling the Network Card drivers and then reinstalling its latest version from the Dell website, then please try that and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Network Card Drivers from the Dell Website</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Device Drivers</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on “<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>” from that list.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Search for the Network Card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this device</em></strong>”
 you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the restart, please open the <strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>” button. Check if Windows 8.1 detects the Network Card device and installs an appropriate driver
 automatically. If the issue still persists, then try the next step. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Check Windows Updates for the latest drivers.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” from the search result.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” window, click on the link: “<strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8.1 driver, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Step 3: Update Driver Software from the Dell or Intel Website:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Visit the Dell/Intel website, search for the latest drivers available for your computer/graphics card model and then download and install it on the computer
</span><span>by following the instructions given in the website. You may click on the link given below to download and install the latest drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=22510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel® PROSet/Wireless Software and Drivers for Windows*</a></span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the results.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I have performed a system restore twice. Each time, it continues to do the same thing. One restore from earlier that day when things were working correctly, and the other from a week ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers, I manually installed from the Dell Website, and I also Updated the drivers from within the device manager wireless networking card properties. System Update is up to date. Nothing new was installed or uninstalled around the time this happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it possibly be maybe something with my wireless card just going bad? I'm not sure if something like that would cause download speeds to suffer and not upload, or if it would even work all together. This is a 10 year old computer. But it runs Windows
 8.1 flawlessly. Probably better than my 2 year old HP. And I've never had a problem out of it.

<p><span>The steps you need to follow are as simple as they could be: just open Device Manager, select your main network adapter, click on “Properties,” go to “Power Management” and uncheck the option reading “Allow this computer to turn off the device
 to save power.”</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;Windows 8.1 automatically turns off your Wi-Fi adapter when idle, hence the limited connectivity that some experience.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You are absolutely correct regarding the “<strong><em>Power Management</em></strong>” settings on Windows Operating System. When the option “<strong><em>Allow this computer to turn off the device to save power</em></strong>” under “<strong><em>Power
 Management</em></strong>” tab on the network adapter properties, is enabled, the Windows automatically turns off your Wi-Fi adapter when the computer is idle and due to which the user may face connectivity issues on the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, on this thread, “<strong><em>B Kelley</em></strong>” is not facing any no/limited connectivity issues. Here, the issue is the sudden drop of the download speed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be either due to the driver issues or some other software conflicts on the computer.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your reply with the relevant information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your previous reply, you haven’t mentioned if you have any third party security program on the computer. I just wanted to make sure that you haven’t missed out that possibility with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have a security program, then try booting the computer in Safe Mode with Networking and check if the issue persists. This is to check if there are any other conflicts on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is Safe Mode. Here we start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. Please
 refer to the steps given in this article to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>

<h3> rolf7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Security Requires Password when Attempting to Connect to Windows 10 Shared Folders Even Though Password Protected Sharing is Turned Off</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 we are prompted for authentication when trying to connect to shared network folders on this PC even though password protected sharing is turned off. &nbsp;The only computer on the network able to connect to shared folders on this
 PC without being prompted for a username and password is a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried everything listed in the forums:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Enabling the guest account</p>
<p>-Using existing local user usernames and passwords</p>
<p>-Adding local users to the host PC that match existing users trying to connect</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)"><strong>-</strong></span>Allowing Windows to manage Homegroup connections (even though we do not use a Workgroup or Homegroup)</p>
<p>-Disabling Windows Firewall</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not have or use Microsoft Outlook accounts on any computers (and prefer not to).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if we could find username and password combinations that work, that the host PC requires authentication prevents us from using software which needs to access the shared files and folders, as well as scanners and copiers that are unable to connect to
 this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we can, we would prefer to turn off any and all prompts for authentication.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case your computer is installed with any third party antivirus software or online security software, then try to disable them temporarily to see if they are causing any issues. In case problem still persist, then place your computer in Clean Boot stare
 and see if it makes any difference. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or
 when you run a program. Follow the below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong>Windows Key,</strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the search box, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the <strong>
System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>
System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Close Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>
System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer. Now try to reproduce the issue and see if the same thing happens.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
If a service is causing issue, I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time, reboot and then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one by one, till you find the one
 which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for <strong>Startup's
</strong>too.</span></p>
