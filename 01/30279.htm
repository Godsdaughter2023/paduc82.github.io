<h3> damian gorski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 7 startup sound playing in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    After my upgrade from Windows 7 to 10, When I turn my pc on and it is at the windows 10 login screen it somehow plays the windows 7
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">startup</span> sound. When I looked into my media folder I saw that there were still left over windows 7 sounds. When I change&nbsp;the theme it plays the windows 7
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">login</span> sound. I can't delete the older sounds sadly. Do you know what to do? I want to delete every sound that is based on windows 7 and set all of the default sounds to windows 10. Is that possible?

                    <p>I am trying to add 2 text boxes in one clip, i have googled a few ways to find it, but the only way i have found is to export the video, then add the text to THAT video. THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR ME! Mainly, because i am making a video that has words synced
 up with the music,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP! if this is impossible, can someone tell an ACTUAL person that works at microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, GeorgeB!</p>

            <p>hello George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you want to add two text boxes and two audio within a video in Movie Maker. To set your expectations, Movie Maker can only insert a single text box while editing your project file. As for including
 two audio files into one clip, this is possible by using the <strong>Record narration</strong> and
<strong>Add music</strong> option. To do this, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the video/photo file in Movie Maker</li><li>Click <strong>Record narration</strong>'s drop down icon (<strong>v</strong>) and choose
<strong>Add sounds...</strong></li><li>Choose the sound that you want and hit <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Afterwards, click <strong>Add music </strong>and choose the music that you want.</li></ol>
<p>As for the text box, you can post a feedback within this <strong><a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Microsoft will review the information within the site for future updates on the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other inquiries regarding Movie Maker, please let us know. We'll be here to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Surface Connect to USB-C Adapter not charging Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the Surface Connect to USB-C Adapter with the purpose of charging from my 20,000 mAH Cygnett Power Bank (has USB-C PD). However, despite all the voltage etc. requirements/compatibilities being met, it's not charging or even detecting it's plugged
 in. Why is that? The light on the adapter turns on when plugged in but turns off after about 5 seconds.&nbsp;I have also tried charging with the Nintendo Switch AC Adapter and Pixel 2 XL Adapter (even though it doesn't meet the requirements) and they have the same
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any other accessories (e.g. keyboard) to test the Adapter on, but I know the Power Bank and cable work (tested on a Nintendo Switch and Pixel 2 XL).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Australian models (where relevant) of the below:</p>

<h2>            How to change the default font in the Windows 10 Mail app</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Since upgrading my work PC I have been unable to change the default font setting when using the built in Mail app, I am stuck using calibri at font size 11 which does not match any of my pre-prepared notes. It's a minor inconvenience to have to change the
 formatting of each message before I send them but it will save me time and there is the possibility of my forgetting to do so which would then look unprofessional.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The app reports it is Version 16005.10325.20091.0 - can anybody advise please?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p></div>

            I dont think you can change the font (its not in the options) - but the version on my computer appears to use Word styles and it defaults to Heading 1. (I have an insider build of windows.)

<p>Thank you Diane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like as bit of an oversight from Microsoft as this feature was built into the previous version of the app I was using before we changed the hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, might as well get on with it then.</p>

<h2>            &#34;we found a windows 10 home digital license for this device running windows 10 pro&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new computer in August, and yesterday it stopped working. I am waiting to hear back from the company about the warranty. However I work from home and needed a computer to work, so I took my old hard drive from my previous computer that had windows
 10 on it, and put it in the new computer. Everything is working great, except I cannot activate windows. I get the following error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"we found a windows 10 home digital license for this device running windows 10 pro"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try and do the activation and link my microsoft account, the troubleshoot doesnt work. If I click "I recently changed hardware" my computer shows up as a listed device. When I click on it, the message reads :</p>

Unable to activate Windows

<p>
We can’t reactivate Windows on this device. Try again later. </p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
You can also activate this device by going to the Store and purchasing a genuine copy of Windows.</p>

            Hi Kyle, of that hard dive you put into that PC has Windows 10 Pro installed on it and the licence for the new PC is for Windows 10 Home, you will not be able to activates the Pro version
<br />
<br />Unless that Windows 10 Pro licence is based on a Retail licence (was not pre-installed on a PC), then you can transfer the Pro licence to the new PC, however, that will then be removed form the old PC
<br />
<br />If that is a Retail licence, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

                    My Windows 10 computer is connected to my old XP computer by a network cable I want to be able to transfer files from one computer to the other through that cable. How do I do that? It worked when I had Windows 8.1 but now it is asking for a password when
 I try to open the Windows 10 computer from my XP computer. A password that doesn't seem to exist.

<h2>            Frequent Blue Screen &#40;of Death&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Home 64 bit running on Asus Zenbook UX430UNR with 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a brand new laptop, but I've experienced 2 BSODs on random occasions, but they have one thing in common: The system crashed (BSOD'd) right after I unplugged the mini HDMI dongle (that I used to project my screen to external displays). The first incident
 was when I use a mini HDMI to "regular" HDMI dongle to project screen contents to a screen via projector and the second one was when I use a mini HDMI to VGA dongle to project to a larger TV screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've browsed the net and many answers point to display drivers being the culprit. Suggestions involve updating the drivers to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both Intel UHD Graphics 620 and NVIDIA GeForce MX150 on the laptop, and I'm pretty sure that they are upgraded to the latest version, specifically by going to the Device Manager, right click on the devices, and select update drivers. The system shows
 that it already has the latest versions of the drivers for the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I really need to know what is happening? Why the brand new, supposedly error-free laptop, experiences BSODs? What causes it? How to prevent / solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            Hi gryphone,
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates your Intel Display HD Audio driver as the root cause of your system crashes . . .
<br />
<br />That driver comes with your Intel HD graphics card device driver
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager, expand the Display Adapters section, note down the model of Intel graphics you have
<br />
<br />THen you should go to the Instel website, then download and install the latest device driver for your Intel HD graphics card

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like the camera is not aligned properly. Normally the camera is oriented such that when the latop screen<br />
is just past 90 degreee, so you can see the screen clearly, the camera is pointed at your face.<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation, and ask in their forums where there will be<br />
others with the same or a similar model.<br />

<h2>            windows 10 reinstall</h2>
                    <p>i bought a windows 8 preinstalled dell laptop couple of years ago and subsequently upgraded to windows 10 via open internet offer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is I neither got the windows 8 OS&nbsp;CD along with the laptop nor do I know how to create a copy of the windows
 10 I currently have.&nbsp; Of late my system is not working properly and I am worried of a crash and how do I bring back my system to the current condition after a crash and how do I clean install the windows 10.&nbsp;

    <title>no store on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> applewindows  say:</h3>
<h2>            no store on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>i upgraded to WINDOWS10 on the 1st of DEC 2015 , and since then I have been unable to access the WINDOWS STORE for anything .I have been in touch with my service provider to see if the e-fiber modem was at fault ,but after the new modem was installed I still
 could not get into the windows store . I now see that WINDOWS 10 is the cause of the problrm with the WINDOWS store .I have tried clicking on the store icon but all I get is THERE IS NO CONNECTION . There is a connection to any other sites , but no MICROSOFT
 STORE ON THIS COMPUTER . I can get onto other app storers but not windows ,WHY ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently I had a problem with the windows store , but PAVAN_N has come up with an answer ,for me at least . your first suggestion about RESET STORE CACHE &nbsp;seems to have worked for me .The first try did not work at all , but the second try seems to have opened
 the shop door for me . &nbsp;Thank you PAVAN_N AND KUDOS . </p>

<h2>            Unbind scroll wheel click</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased a Microsoft comfort Mouse 4500 and when I click with the scroll wheel it shows window flip (same as Alt-tab). My question is, can I unbind it? I don't want to change it to another setting in mouse properties, I want it unbound so there
 is no action when pressed. Is this possible? How?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            You change it to "Disabled" in mouse properties.&nbsp; It is about the eighth setting down the list of choices that you can set it to (i.e, between "Middle-click" and "Alt") on mine.<br />

    <title>Where does System Protection in Windows 7 store restore points for the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> humblepie08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where does System Protection in Windows 7 store restore points for the Recovery Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I turned on System Protection for the Recovery Drive by mistake. I assigned the maximum 100% (14.5GB) disk space for this drive. System Protection has used over 4 GBs for the Recovery Drive so far. My question is, is the original factory preinstalled data
 in my Recovery Drive compromised? Since that partition is not supposed to be written to, and the&nbsp;memory is not large (I think).</p>
<p>Where does System Protection in Windows 7 store restore points for the Recovery Drive? Is it within the Recovery Drive or in (C:)?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If the files in D don't need to be protected, why was the option there to do so? It just creates more confusion for novices like me.</p>
<p>If both the Recovery Drive &nbsp;protection option is selected, as well as that for the OS (C:), does that mean a restore point&nbsp;will be created&nbsp;for both drives whenever restore points are created (either automatically or manually)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system info:</p>
<p>Dell N5110 (15R) Intel Core i5-2430m</p>
<p>Windows 7, 64 bit.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

            <p>When you create a restore point it does&nbsp;not write over other existing files. An area of the disk in each monitored partition&nbsp;is set aside and reserved for the system volume information folder and&nbsp; the restore points are written there, If the area becomes
 full the oldest restore point is removed to enable a new restore point to be written. When a restore point is created it records system and user settings and in the case of a recovery partition there is little of that nature to record. As I said there is nothing
 to worry about it. </p>

            Hi Ardelle, I am unsure if it is the screensaver or the lockscreen that is causing this, either way it will require a registry fix . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />To disable the Screensaver:
<br />
<br />In the left pane, navigate to:
<br />HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop
<br />
<br />In the right pane, if ScreenSaveActive does not exist:
<br />Right click in the right pane and choose New - DWORD 32bit
<br />Name it ScreenSaveActive
<br />
<br />Then double click ScreenSaveActive 
<br />Set its value to 0
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />
<br />To disable the LockScreen:
<br />
<br />In the left pane, navigate to:
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
<br />
<br />In the left Pane, right-click Windows and choose New - Key
<br />Name the new Key Personalization 
<br />Click on the new Personalization Key (folder)
<br />
<br />Then Right click in the right pane and choose New - DWORD 32bit
<br />Name it NoLockScreen 
<br />
<br />Double-click NoLockScreen
<br />Set its value to 1
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and Restart your PC

</p><p>"Sorry, Movie maker can't start. Make sure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements before trying to start Movie maker again, then try to update the driver for your video card if Movie maker still doesn't start"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Erm?&nbsp; My video card driver hasn't changed and my system hasn't either !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how come it won't run anymore?</p>

<p>Hi, What you are saying makes a lot of sense. I must remember to take my own advise about not updating anything if it is still working ( if it ain't broke, don't fix it!).
</p>
<p>If I manage to update the driver but it causes unwanted problems, can I save the old one first so I can revert to it?</p>

            <p>HELP PLEASE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working on a video for about a month now. It was up to 16 minutes of music, pictures, and a few video clips. I do this every year. Only thing is, this morning I opened it and for no apparent reason it is suddenly only 9 minutes and on the right
 where I should see all the slides laid out, music, etc there is nothing at all. I can click play and it will show the first few opening slides but that's it. I fear losing about 30 hours of work on this. I'm hoping for a quick fix or I have to start from scratch,
 only have 3 weeks to finish the project. Even worse, I fear if I don't know why/how it happened, it could happen again. I've been using movie maker for years and never had this happen before. I confirm that all pics, video, music, etc are all still in their
 original locations, they have not moved. I am using version 12, and my operating system is Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1, Intel Core 2 Quad 4GB RAM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For timing reference, and what makes this even more bizarre, is the video was 45 minutes almost from the very beginning, and then slowly edited down to 16 minutes as I selectively removed pictures to make it shorter. So 9 minutes is definitely not a recent
 edit point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I did the "repair" windows essentials, nothing. I also updated the video card suggestion from another thread, again nothing. Still the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me get this project back up the next round is on me!!!!!!!!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

                    <p>Foi feita a renovação automática da minha live Gold, através do cartão de crédito. Porém, quando vou jogar os jogos que já baixei ele diz q falta renovar. Vou em gerenciar assinaturas e lá está a GOLD válida até 2018. Porém, quando entro no Games with Gold, aparece as opções para renovação. Alguém sabe o que pode ser? Inclusive já consultei o extrato do cartão de crédito e está lá a cobrança.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Estou com o exato mesmo problema. Liguei meu console hoje e estou jogando online sem problemas,&nbsp;mas quando vou na aba Assinaturas em Meus Jogos e Apps, ele informa que eu devo assinar o serviço e também não consigo baixar gratuitamente o Game with Gold mais recente (SpeedRunners), pois só tenho a opção de comprar pelo preço cheio ou assinar Gold. Mas, minha lista de jogos "prontos para instalar" lista tudo que já adquiri no Games with Gold e, nas configurações do console, a informação é de que minha assinatura Gold está ativa e foi renovada no último dia 28/05 (embora também haja uma informação de que a cobrança só ocorrerá em 10/06 - daqui a 5 dias). Será que quando a cobrança for realizada, a conta voltará a operar corretamente e poderei baixar os Games with Gold?</p>

<p>I would like to be able to create a desktop shortcut for the "Task Manager" entry, within Task Scheduler. Is this possible? Keep in mind, I'm not looking for the CTRL+SHIFT+ESC Windows Task Manager, I'm looking for the Task Manager that lets me see my scheduled
 tasks. Thanx.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I can click on Task Manager and see the scheduled tasks there.</p>

<p>My goal is to have a desktop shortcut (or any other method) that will allow for a "reduced click" access to the end result of viewing the scheduled tasks mentioned above. Thanx.</p>

<h2>            CPU Speed not Moving</h2>
                    My CPU speed has been acting weird and it stays at 0.48 GHz than normally it's like 1.5-2.6Hz. I have a laptop with a&nbsp;i5-5200U 2.20GHz, 8GB DDR3 Ram and a Intel HD 5500 Graphics. It sometimes randomly spikes up to 2.5GHz and goes down back to 0.48GHz after
 a few seconds even if I have it on heavy load it still stays the same. I recently got thermal paste put on the processor as my fan was freaking out and I got a few problems fixed but it still doesn't work as it did. Just so you know I have a Lenovo U41-70.

            My apologies I posted the wrong link. Upon researching this I am finding that users with this issue have found a solution by updating their bios to the latest version.

            I am still looking into this. But so far I have found many users who have found relief to this issue by the use of a software called Throttle Stop.

<p>Canon stopped supporting that scanner after Windows 8.1, so they didn't publish a driver for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't necessarily mean that your scanner won't work on Windows 10. It only means that Canon won't claim that it does, because Canon hasn't tested your scanner on Windows 10, hasn't updated its driver to keep up with all the new technology in Windows
 10, and has no official answers if it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the Windows 8.1 driver you won't need a CD or a USB flash drive. Simply download the driver from Canon's website.</p>

                    <p>So I having same issue to the tea and its been identical responses from all help.&nbsp; well all is a very small amount of people cause well there the lucky ones that get to "pester" the rude inexperienced stressed out people on the other end of that hot line.&nbsp;
 Now think back to when it first started did ya build the computer your self? Or was it given to you with a hacked ver of windows or maybe your buddies computer guy fixed it once for you and ya realized then there was something just not right and all of a sudden
 your lap tops key is a hacked version on your laptop. Well then your guilty and these "selected" Few are set to literally&nbsp; "Pester" you(weather ordered or not by the corporation).&nbsp; Everyone will say no way that cant even be real well,&nbsp; it is they study your
 sleep refer to you as subject if your lucky enough to see a transferred msg or log with communication, and don't be so nieve as to think you will be able to save those things cause like most of you said these guys/sirls will out code out smart and out maneuver
 you at every turn.&nbsp; Ask your question HOW are they doing this even with the vulnerabilities as of late I can only find very few people with this issue, and that my fellow crazies is the key I &gt;assure&lt; you!That one word look familiar to you I bet all of us
 sprung and where treated so bad that we will never feel the same about anything Microsoft again and that is why its only the few that are well &gt;init&lt;(again another word you will not find anywhere but we all see on a daily.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now because we cant trust our pcs or well any device cause we all cinque everything together and give above normal access to our trust installer/fav apps so with a couple very intelligent individuals all around the world start to "pester"
 you after a couple months your just about certifiable and all your friends and family think the same. Come on who be leaves ya the techs ya spend thousands of dollars on ok well I did cause I was trying to save a gaming pc I have saved for for 6 or so years
 at a cost of 5500 bucks.&nbsp; I'm beating the only thing we have in common with the computers themselves is at one time in our day we pinged Microsoft or where somewhere we should not of been, or where just wet around the ears with a begging trend. or we have
 a viruses that s hidden deep and no one wants to tell you what's really going on so we all have started to dig. Right trying to gain controle of your own computer in your house with a stranger just walking through the whole thing from gaining access cause
 we let it in.&nbsp; I can even bet that after that first opps ya got frustrated and just stopped or ya fight with-it for 4 years like one poor sole I heard now don't get me wrong I'm not here with pitch fork and flams I'm here cause if this is some sort of punishment
 clause in something we accepted ok I get it . but where is my trial or explanation to what I had done where are my peers to judge me fairly.&nbsp; There where none. nothing not even as I begged to be left alone and once I broke down and I cried.&nbsp; I Have a daughter
 just about that age where every boy becomes evil.&nbsp; ya don't need as a father to also not be able to protect your family in there own house or give them there xmas gifts cause your scared there new phones and pcs will ujust get pulled into the mix.&nbsp; which wel
 they do I have my sons laptop sighing in pieces a phone that's been locked with a kek key and tablet that's been at my mother inlaws and is still there cause I cant bring it into the house cause consumed by these app and azure entities. Cause well if you don't
 already know your a virtual system and your miricast is the device the project on what you think is empty space in your hard drive but the reason for a thousand ports irqus is cause every one that come to your computer has a different set up and need to be
 able to be the middleman between your devices and you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; now I know none of his will me the mainstream or anywhere but maybe whoever reads it will pace there own judgement on the evidence I am going to give now please understand my new girlfriend has no idea about computers and me I just love to tinker
 and think.&nbsp; She is guilty of one thing tv she loves movies new and old and she streams and yes I know horrible but&nbsp; yes there is a but, most of those shows she pirates and steals she also then owns she buys a ton of that stuff and supports the industry handsomely,&nbsp;
 Me I game not a pirated version of anything every I think when I was literally around 20 I tried to find some cracked version of I cant remember but that turned out bad for years to&nbsp; come. t was my IE history haunted me no mater how many times it was erased
 always came back but that was all really until recently.&nbsp; See I'm sure we all have some stupid but this is not ok this could have avoided so much a question most of us would trip over our selves to explain but we never had that chance. I was told that my original
 computer had a store demo windows 7 base I know that's not true that has been with me since xp and I up graded to 7pro and then 10 but hers my sentence its laterally with the devil lol'' my wx has my 7 up grade in her attic maybe as a pillow and she dreams
 of this moment everyday.&nbsp; well and now my GF she had 2 lap tops one hers one her daughters both registered&nbsp; to 7 pro no hack. so we thought well to me and here the quest was why was it hacked well short ethics went the local pc guru kids thing he liked the
 team viewer and would seem might have manipulated cause and effect polices to sum up an income when ever he nodded that's not her fault she had ) idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but now there is the part most wont like to here this is not all the people that started theses fault well maybe but with the now www,w3 free international windows we are running (which I'm guessing when they stick us up in the cloud is cause we are naughty)
 . and well protection of the product cause back to that little glitch in ie now this is speculation but most is. is the real kicker they opened Pandora's box so to speak I bet you chek google and anywhere else you have been nailed by a firm or your phone has
 pooped up in some crazy part of the world you have les heard off then been and sites are keeping results from you cause of plagiarism copyright exc.&nbsp; this hackers which they are threw and threw are stealing everything you have on around have looked at or touched
 around you to supply the worlds largest forgery factory so between windows pester/self protect mode and this or these hackers you stand no chance but with the help of windows all our local federal agencies I'm sure we can smash them I know I have a tone of
 info on ok no laughing a camera just and old camera lol like 400 pics of some of the most crazy stuff I have ever seen and windows keep your pants on nothing full never I'm not stealing but someone is truly in all our homes and is using miricast as a bubble
 viewer of sorts right down the bios level and well I mean before or that I would truly rather be you guys and not one of us are innocent we where straight up doing what where not suppose to do we ae suppose to get the professionals to handle this but not one
 of the new techs even understand that a macro was the 90 hacking h bomb and is coming back with a stylish vengeance when its been out of play for years. so we cant blame Microsoft for the crazy but we can blame them for not listening to us or giving us novice
 just like to tinker types a break we weren't trying to steal nothing as you can tell we wouldn't still be in this situation if we where. so before any starts being mean or making fun or telling me its in the wrong forum stop goto another page please if its
 not happened to you&nbsp; will never believe till it does cause as a tech will tell you no ram can hold memory after there is no power oh ya I had 5gigs held in there for a night in a day on my dresser hows that trickery or wow . but I could go on but that will
 get no solution so why don't we all use this thread to start working on a solution and if your are a pirating cheapskate please move on your the reason these people exist thanks btw, but really move on.&nbsp; so for the rest come on were not getting anywhere with
 the blam game and we can sure as hell make our own moves with some of the very intelligent people in some of the horror stories I read I will check as often as my computer wil let me and MS if your worried about loosing your tech through me a 95 copy of windows
 for now fight old with old lol k well I hope this does hit some ears on both sides and all can just come together cause its an all of our problem not just one intel knows they know but no one wants to be liable so how bout we are all liable and then we can
 fix it this cant be generated by a simulation or corporate attack this is very much basis by basis I think.&nbsp; Again I'm not a writer nor a computer science major or anything else but I got a good thinker and have ocd we can do this so please guys/girls come
 on.lets take our digital lives back.&nbsp; ` all that our new to this bug after patch again I think it a sleeper and MS is only responsible for the error police with tunnel vision lol well I could be wrong and if so see ya in court just kidding I spent all my money
 on techs that swore it would be fixed until I got it home and turned it on everytime I'm sure you will do right buy us if this reaches an actual employey</p>

 the same computer and now that's impersonation lvl crazy but really true and huge risk cause they actually change your keyboard imput to be able to control those password you have no idea why they wont work
