            <p>I believe thats a 16bit program, and if so will not install under win 64bit without the use of an emulator, eg DosBox, and may not run under win7 32 bit, allthough you could look up Comaptibility in win Help &amp; Support for some options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program is still functioning on another PC you might want to look at what export data options are available for your data, in order that you can perhaps import that data into a win7 supported program</p>

<p>Also , if you have one of the following anti-viruses installed, Windows Defender will be sht down because those anti-viruses have their own defenders. To have 2 defenders running in the same machne will create conflicts.</p>
<p>The list&nbsp;of the mentioned anti-viruses are .....</p>
<p>Norton<br />
McAfee<br />
AVG<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>If the above applies to you. You are OK. Nothing to worry about.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi jessemax,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When do you get this error message?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>When was the last time it was working?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This error message might occur if there are some corrupt system files on the computer. Would suggest that you run a SFC
 scan which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps to perform SFC scan</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt
 opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to
 continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not
 find any integrity violations"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information
 from the installation CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows
 Vista or on Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step does not fix the issue would suggest that you uninstall or disable the AVG and Advanced System Optimizer
 and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:
</span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Store Repeated Order Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjg2018  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store Repeated Order Glitch</h2>
                    <p>On 22nd March 2018, I got an email from Microsoft store to say they had dispatched a surface pen I had ordered in June 2017. Called immediately to query this to be told it was an error but I would not be charged. Credit card bill arrives and there is a charge
 to Microsoft. Three more calls to Store looking to recover my money do not seem to have made any progress so have asked the credit card company to recover. Have deleted the card from the Microsoft site to prevent any more money being taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had the same issue and any tips on resolution? </p>
<p>
</p><p>(apologies for posting under safety and security but it's about as close as the categories get)</p>

            I believe that the steps you have taken are all right. But, in general, Store support is quick to refund. You can try Chat Support also. This is a general chat support for Microsoft things not specific to Store only.

<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You have to find out which program creates the Icon entry and close the program.</p>
<p>Some programs have an option whether to be displayed in the Traybar, and you can configure the option.</p>
<p>Some programs would dispaly an icon when they are running and have No options. I.e if you do not like the Icon do not use the program (take it out of the StartUp folder).</p>

<h2>            Connection to printer lost after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Kodak Hero 7.1 all-in-one printer/scanner on wireless connection. It worked under Windows 8 but now doesn't. I have followed your guides and opened the network but "find devices and printers" does not appear as an option. Previously I have found
 the printer manager through the network but still I cannot find it through the Settings. The printer does not show as an option on Add Printer. When I try to open Excel or Word documents they freeze and show "Not Responding" the same happens when I try to
 print from Adobe. When I try &nbsp;to print from the Web I only get a "Save" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do as it is making my PC unworkable.</p>

            It is probably out of warranty if it is a used device. You can try calling <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>, ask for Enterprise Surface Support and see if they can de-register as an Enterprise device (be patient, you will be asked to enter a serial number, but when you get a person, explain it is 2nd hand and ask if they can deregister it). If they deregister it, you then should be able to register as a personal device.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance.

    <title>GTA5 disc install keeps stopping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xbackfiredx  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA5 disc install keeps stopping</h2>
                    
<p>I've dealing with this for now, to get out of 5 that I purchased from Target to work. First, it would not get past 1 percent and it continued to say the disc is dirty or damaged I called in and the first person had me do regular troubleshooting steps, and
 his final solution was the disc was faulty, and therefore needed to be replaced. I went to Target again, but they were all out, so I had to drive to the next town to get one because target refuses to give money back for an opened game. Nevertheless, I got
 another disc of grand theft auto 5, and it is doing the same thing. The installation stops, but if I start it again occasionally it will install a portion of the percentage before stopping again. The next person I spoke to had me do the same troubleshooting
 steps, and then a few more, to no avail. I was hung up on in the midst of being transferred to what I guess would have been tier two. I gave up. That was yesterday. I woke up this morning, and called first thing. I hadn't had about enough at this point, and
 so I ask elated. Finally I got someone on the phone who claimed to be a supervisor, and his final solution was for me to send my xbox in, to be repaired, which would take about a month before I would get it back. That to me is unacceptable. I do not believe
 it is a disc reading issue, when no other games have a problem, no Blu ray movies have a problem, &amp; I have read many threads of people with the same exact problem. Is there anyone out there who has any more information for me? All I want is to be able to play
 the game I spent $60 and my entire weekend off work trying to get to work properly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Error 0xc000021a&#59; Unable to Boot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 Error 0xc000021a&#59; Unable to Boot</h2>
                    There was a recent update for Windows 8, and so of course my desktop had them done since it said it would do it whether I accepted it or not (Said it will restart and update the computer in a few days if I don't do it soon). Now, I am unable to use my
 computer and would get the "Your PC seems to have encountered a problem" screen and the error code was
<b>0xc000021a</b>.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've had this computer for about 4-5 years now. I had upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 last December, and ever since then I have been getting problems where the computer would not boot up. I've had to refresh and reformat my computer many, many times
 already. I'm sure most would say "Just go back to Windows 7" because that seems to be an easy fix but shouldn't there be a solution to this problem?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every time this would happen, it would be after I get a message saying "There are updates available, the computer will restart and install them in 3 days if you do not" so I feel sort of forced to do it and then I end up getting problems.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to enable <b>Safe Mode</b>&nbsp;but that just got me the same error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't get the option to run the <b>command prompt</b>&nbsp;because when I do happen to get into Advanced Settings, opening up command prompt is not an option.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to run the Windows 8 install disk but when I select Repair it says that it is missing files. I can't understand how it could be missing files as I had installed Windows 8 from that disk when I refreshed and reformatted the computer using that same
 disk. It is <b>not</b>&nbsp;just an upgrade, it is the full Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've looked around for a day or two trying to find a solution. All there is out there are unsolved threads and websites telling me to install a program onto my computer - but I would need to register for a pro account for it to fix anything. Even if that
 does work, I wouldn't be able to install since I can't even get the computer to boot up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm just confused about how it can work fine for a couple of months, and then just break. The other
<b>rare</b>&nbsp;times it did get fixed, I didn't do anything. I just tried my luck at turning it on, which is the most puzzling part.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I can turn on the computer but it doesn't boot up and runs into Error 0xc000021a. It can't get into Safe Mode, I can't open command prompt, and I can't repair it through the disk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there some way to fix this, or is there just no hope for my desktop anymore?</div>

There were Windows 8 hardware device drivers from the manufacturer(s) of the hardware components for the 4-5 year old machine?&nbsp; Nothing automatic, nothing just 'installed at upgrade' - but you went to a web page for each component and downloaded a supported
 Windows 8 device driver or a Windows 7/Vista driver you installed in compatibility mode or that seemed to work *after* you upgraded to Windows 8 for at least the motherboard chipset, audio, video and network devices?<br />

            I'm not entirely sure what you're asking me. Are you asking me if they've made hardware device drivers?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If you're asking if I've installed the device drivers for the hardware components then yes, I have. I always do every time I have to refresh/reformat the computer and it works just fine until a Windows 8 update happens. It is a 50-50 chance the computer
 will not boot up the next time I turn it on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, <b>everything works just fine until new Windows 8 updates happen</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have now just tried giving up and refreshing the PC for a millionth time and now it says "There was a problem refreshing your PC. No changes were made."</div>
<div><br />
<div>And now: I <b>cannot</b>&nbsp;go into Safe Mode, I am <b>unable</b>&nbsp;to open up the command prompt as there is no option for it in Advanced Options, I
<b>cannot</b>&nbsp;use a disk with Windows 8 on it to Repair as it says I am missing files even though it is the full Windows 8 install file, and as of now I
<b>cannot</b>&nbsp;Refresh PC because it says "There was a problem refreshing your PC. No changes were made."</div>

            <p>Are you booting from your Windows DVD to access the Advanced Startup Options?&nbsp; Perhaps that DVD is corrupted?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could try using a Friends Windows 8 machine to create the "Recovery Drive" (don't add the Friends Recovery Partition to it though).&nbsp; You should be able to use that "Recovery Drive" for Startup Troubleshooting on any Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; See Control Panel\All
 Control Panel Items\Recovery<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have a look at this location too, Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Windows 7 File Recovery.&nbsp; Look at Create a System Image and see if that is useful for you.&nbsp; Also look at&nbsp; Create A System Repair Disc, see if that might work for you as it seems similar
 but a bit different to the original "Recovery Drive" we are talking about.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you can create a Recovery Drive see if you can boot from that and access the Advanced Startup Options.&nbsp; Away from your own DVD you might have more success with your repair attempts?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you can get to the Command Prompt try the ChkDsk c: /r command to check your hard drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The hard drive manufacturer will have free diagnostic software that is bootable, or that&nbsp; may even run from within Windows, that will thoroughly check the condition of your hard drive.</p>

            <p>Hi Valya,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">In&nbsp;fact, there is a language icon on the logon screen which allows you choose the language. Refer this screenshot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7bb3f248-169c-4869-a661-87e49a942aed" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the language settings to the Welcome screen, the default lock screen, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Start screen and type <code>Region</code>.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> as the search area, and</li><li>Click <strong>Region</strong> on the left pane.</li><li>Click <strong>Administrative</strong> tab.</li><li><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fzNZ9d.png" /></li><li>Click <strong>Copy settings</strong> in the <strong>Welcome screen and new user accounts</strong> group.<br />
You will see the current settings.</li><li>Select <strong>Welcome screen and system accounts</strong> check box and click
<strong>OK</strong> to copy the settings of the current user to the Welcome screen.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fXMysm.png" /></li></ol>
<p>Since you switched to German language, you have to search for German word Region at step 1.</p>
<p>Alternative way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the language on the Taskbar.</li><li>Then click <strong>Language preferences</strong>.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fN1S66.png" /></li><li>Click <strong>Advanced settings</strong> on the right.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply language setting to the welcome screen, system accounts, and new user accounts</strong> link in the
<strong>Override for Windows display language</strong> group.<br />
It will open <strong>Region</strong> settings with <strong>Administrative</strong> tab selected.<br />
Follow the steps 5 and 6 from the instructions above.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p><span>Hi,</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span> <span>
&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try these methods and check for the issue status.</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<span>Method 1:</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Check if you can experience the issue in ‘Safe mode’; if safe mode works fine then set the computer to ‘Clean boot’ state to check for software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1</strong>:</span> </p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span> and check the issue status.<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep the computer on a clean boot and check for the issue status.</span>
</p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span>

</p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span> Please go through step 7 of the Kb to keep the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b></p>
<p><span>Disable the security software temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span>Disable antivirus software</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></p>
<p><span>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The memory card works fine when I stick it in the printer.<br />

<p><span><span>1st thing to try is a system restore in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://www.windowsvistauserguide.com/system_restore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.windowsvistauserguide.com/system_restore.htm</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Vista</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Restart your computer.</div>
</li><li>
<div>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware&nbsp;being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the<strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select the <strong>Safe Mode</strong> option using the arrow keys.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista&nbsp;Safe Mode.</div>
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.</li><li>
<div>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.</div>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>if that does not fix it read this information</span></span></p>

    <title>Missing .dll file errors and a corrupt dll registry after replacing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing .dll file errors and a corrupt dll registry after replacing files in System32 and syswow64 folders</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem starting a game demo downloaded from the official website. After installing the game I got a missing .dll file error so after googling to find a solution I downloaded a .rar file with "common .dll files for games". I then copied the files
 from the rar archive into the System32 and syswow64 folders. This allowed me to start the game (Fifa 16 demo) but immediately I found problems in starting other games on my PC. For example games started opening in window mode or without sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have since run a couple scans and reset my windows while keeping all of my files but the issue persists. Getting slightly worried to be honest.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the basics of it I'll provide additional information as soon as possible if you have some idea of what might be the problem or what I should try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big thanks ahead if someone can help me out.</p>

            Hi Grigs,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Did you install all the pending updates on your system? &nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Did you make any changes on the system, prior to this issue? &nbsp;<br />
3. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the&nbsp;system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the&nbsp;system&nbsp; to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>SFC Scan: </strong><br />
<br />
I suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check, if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption .The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed,
 or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.<br />
<br />
Please click on the below link and follow the procedure to run SFC Scan.<br />
<br />
Click on, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Do not close the Command Prompt Window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Further, you may want to re-install the game to check, if that helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps. Reply with the result and I'll be happy to help you further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>I simply reset windows while deleting all my files and now all is well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess replacing the files in system32 and syswow32 corrupted something but resetting fixed it.

 nothing about devices with built-in licence and no GML.<br />
Also there are some manufacturers that tell about no necessity of GML on new hardware with Win10 preinstalled:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/Article/en/us/rubsdt1/SLN289418/EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/Article/en/us/rubsdt1/SLN289418/EN</a><br />
<br />
For example I bought tablet or miniPC in China like <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-sale-VOYO-V3-Mini-PC-Cherry-Trail-X7-Z8700-Quad-Core-Windows-10-5G-WiFi/32663385369.html?spm=2114.01010208.3.1.9Pqx2l&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_2_10065_10068_9982_10084_10083_10080_10082_10081_10060_10061_10062_10056_10055_10054_10059_10099_10078_10079_10073_10100_10096_10070_10052_423_10050_10051_424,searchweb201603_1&amp;btsid=acb7419c-6395-4b53-97d7-c5351d12dc13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>, where seller says it has genuine Windows 10.</p>
<p>Even if it actually has genuine Win 10, how can I prove it to authorities if I'll use it in business purposes (like in a shop or office)?</p>
<p>Responsibility is rather strong for using non-genuine software in different countries.</p>
<p>As I understand, I can use built-in win10 home for business purposes without buying win10 pro.</p>

            <p>Excuse me, I've expressed incorrectly. I didn't bought PC, I'm planning to (It was hypothetical sample). And I want to know before buying, how can I prove that system is genuine to local authorities.</p>
<p>For example, if I had a GML sticker on laptop/miniPC or whatever I can always show it to any inspection.</p>
<p>But if the hardware has no GML, how can I prove it is legal?</p>

            What "local authorities" do you mean? The only people that care whether it's licensed is Microsoft.
