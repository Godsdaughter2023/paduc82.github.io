<p>With BlackOps 2 and Tranzit zombies has become even more complicated. Has zombies become too complicated? Also is this direction a good or poor one?</p>

<p>I still prefer EVERYTHING about WAW over any other COD. I do like the BO2&nbsp;zombies. Its fun getting on the bus going from town&nbsp;to town.&nbsp;WAW was the last COD I purchased.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just rent these COD&nbsp;games now since they come out every year.&nbsp; I only have BO2 because
 by brother bought it for me as a Christmas present.&nbsp;I still love WAW the most especially the 4 player co-op campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I preferred waw zombies as they were just about survival,it ruined it for me when they started adding "easter eggs" and confusing maps.</p>
<p>The last black ops zombies i played was moon and i really hated it.</p>

<p>I pretty well never buy DLC, and Zombies is a very DLC-based game mode, so... can't really say I've enjoyed any of them, although I did find Black Ops 2's Zombies more interesting than either the MP or campaign.

<p>Same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the highest wave you have reached in the WAW zombie mode?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With at least 2-3 other players I usually average about level 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the highest I reached a long time ago was maybe wave 18 but its been a long time.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">WaW for sure. For the simplicity all the maps had; it made the objective "to the point". Black Ops 1 zombies was not that bad; but like some said the easter eggs drove me away after some time. Then after some hours of playing
 Black Ops 2 zombies I lost my taste for the mode altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">DLC wise, WaW was the best (in my opinion). Although the new maps added more complexity it was still enjoyable and refreshing without overdoing it.</span></p>

<p>You might do an offline windows defender full scan.</p>
<p>You might also try doing the Malwarebytes scan, it can be installed along with defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bleeping computer site usually has good info for that type of exploit.&nbsp; I'd suggest you do some investigating there before spending too much effort.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 digital licence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limitator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 digital licence</h2>
                    <p>hi to all,</p>
<p>I need help from someone with big experience in licencing. Our company recently purchased unbranded PCs with Windows 10. No COA was provided, and according to reseler &nbsp;PCs are with digital licence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, running command&nbsp;</p>
<p>wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey</p>
<p>Returns no results which neans key is not present in BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running command&nbsp;slmgr.vbs /dlv shows that PC is from RETAIL channel (not OEM). As I know, licenses from retail chennel are FPP or bought from Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I susspect that licenses might be upgraded 7 or 8.1, but as I know you need a valid windows 7 or 8.1 licence (COA sticker) to have right to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I’m reading confusing info about digital licences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone help me to determine are licences valid? I have cca 70PCs wirh such licences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
unfortunately seller is unfare. Windows 10 OEM accompanies either product key in BIOS or factory made DVD and sticker with a product key.
<br />
Digital license is not a license at all, it is just a technical method of activation.
<br />
Ask the seller for&nbsp;a documents confirming the presence of licenses. </p>

            Hi Limitator 
<br />
<br />I think you are OK, the seller seems to have paid full price for Windows, that is all . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App on one of those PC's
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation
<br />
<br />Is that reported as activated with a Digital licence?
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the dialog resulting from running  slmgr.vbs /dlv

            Hi Limitator
<br />
<br />I do not see anything wrong with that licence, for some unknown reason the seller seems to have paid full dollar for the Windows 10 licences, instead of supplying OEM. However, that licence is legit and genuine . . .
<br />
<br />You should probably contact the seller and have them explain this in more detail . . .

            Hi Limitator, well that sure does not sound legit . .. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Do you get an error (unable to open MSDM Table) running that utility or does it find the Windows licence key?
<br />

    <title>Need Driver for Wireless Comfort Keyboard 1.0a - Model 1027 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aardvark_sr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Driver for Wireless Comfort Keyboard 1.0a - Model 1027</h2>
                    I have a "Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 1.0a - Model 1027", which I kept when upgrading from XP to Windows 7 (64 bit). The MS site said that this keyboard would be compatible with Wdws 7. It did keep most of it's functionality but, for the past couple
 of years, it has been impossible to customize or tweak anything. When I try to use the "MS Mouse and Keyboard Center" it only shows the wireless mouse things. I cannot see or figure out how to access the keyboard customizing area. I did accidentally open it
 1x but I cannot duplicate that a second time. Unfortunately, the Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center thinks that I am using the USB-wired MS Wired Keyboard 600 or something like that.<br />
<br />
The closest driver mentioned on the MS site to the "Wireless Comfort Keyboard 1.0a" is the driver for the "Wireless Comfort Keyboard" (ITPx64_1033_8.20.469.0.exe). When I try to install either that driver or the one for the "Wireless Comfort Keyboard 5000"
 it errors out, saying something like 'this action cannot be completed as you already have a more recent driver installed'.<br />
<br />
1. How can the driver I download from Microsoft be older that the one "already installed"? I don't know enough so am scared to try to uninstall or disable the current driver lest that make me totally lose functionality before installing the new one.<br />
2. Is there some generic driver that would allow me to once again customize or use buttons like Zoom +/-, Log Off, or Sleep buttons?<br />
3. We have to use Thunderbird as our e-mail program. Should we get any of this to work, is it possible to customize the mail button to something besides Outlook or is that default built into the MS hardware? Thanks for your consideration.<br />

            Thank you. Good suggestion. I have NEVER had much luck trying to get through to MS which is why I thought I'd try first searching their website and then approaching the community forum. I have spent the past :40 minutes trying to get through, dead-ending
 at every turn. <br />
<br />
I have tried your link and then going through "Contact", contacting "Live Chat with Customer Service", as well as "Technical Support" - "Ask". I have tried selecting a piece of hardware from their page (having now tried several) and tried selecting "Contact
 by e-mail". Those each come back with either a page saying: <br />
"Sorry, the page you requested is not available." (Hardware inquiry) or a page that comes up headed:<br />
"Support" but nothing below that. (my inquiry trying for the e-mail option)<br />
<br />
Is there some sort of a Microsoft plug-in or thing which I would need to enable or download to be able to see the rest of that page? I don't know whether these links will work for you but here are three of those them if they might help troubleshoot why it is
 so difficult for me to reach them.<br />

                    When I try to save file, I get that error (I have Windows 7 (64bit))<br />
<br />
<strong>You dont have permission to modify files in this network location<br />

Then PC saves broken file and then I save again and replace that broken file then it's okay.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm doing work with pictures, like "save picture as" and thats very annoying (error with every picture) to save file twice.<br />

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>First lets start your computer in safe mode and try saving the file and check for the issue.</p>
<p>Follow this below provided link to start your computer in safemode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly let’s give file permissions and check if that works.</p>
<p><strong>Follow these steps:</strong></p>
<p>1. Right-click on the Drive and select Properties, then go to Security tab, and click Edit.</p>
<p>2. A new window will open, now under “Group and User Names”, select the user from the list whom you want to deny / allow access to a specific folder, now under “Permissions for Users” check the Deny / Allow checkbox next to Modify (all other checkbox will
 get ticked automatically).</p>
<p>3. Click OK and then click Yes when a Windows Security window will pops-up.</p>
<p>4. Now click OK again and you are done</p>
<p>Check if the issue gets resolved.</p>

    <title>Detect headphones as a separate sound device in Windows 10 v1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony iozzia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Detect headphones as a separate sound device in Windows 10 v1709</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have headphones that I connect with jack to my computer. I want that Windows detects them as a separate sound device for this reason : I would want to choose separately the volume of the computer speakers and the volume of the headphones and to choose
 what sound device to use now.</p>
<p>The main reason is that I put the volume of the speakers to 0, then I plug the headphones, I put their volume to 50, and when I unplug them, the sound switches to "Speakers", so the volume switches to 0. This is to avoid noise for near people if I forget
 to stop the music that I was listening.</p>
<p>I don't know if I explained well. If not, feel free to ask me precisions.</p>
<p>Is there this&nbsp;functionality in Windows, or do I have to instal a third-party software (and which one do that) ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help !</p>
<p>PS : I'm french, so you can answer in french too :)</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to speak French, but I'll answer you in English anyway. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows 10</span></strong><span> has a feature that allows you to select a default sound output. If you want to replace your current audio device, you can select the other audio playback device available on your system
 and set it as <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">default</span>. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right-click the sound icon in your system tray and click
<strong>Playback Devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Playback</strong> tab, check which device is the default. Then, right-click it then set it to default.</span></li></ol>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply !</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my headphones (connected with jack) are not detected as a separate sound output. In fact, they are currently plugged, and there is only one output : the speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4dbc82e-c758-41e9-ac63-363c4b0a16d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4dbc82e-c758-41e9-ac63-363c4b0a16d6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It works, that is to say, when I connect headphones, the sound goes in them, so it is not a problem.</p>
<p>It would be more comfortable for me to have 2 separate outputs, in order to control their volume separately. (Like in Android)</p>
<p>But I think this is not possible in Windows.</p>
<p>And I didn't find any third-party software that have this&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<p>If you have any trick to do that, I'll take it gladly :)</p>
<p>Also, later I will suggest to Microsoft that they add this functionality in Windows, because it is a good one.</p>

    <title>After Windows 8 install reboot, no display signal post boot up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skilledazz  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 8 install reboot, no display signal post boot up.</h2>
                    I recently purchased Windows 8 via the Upgrade Assistant, which found no compatibility issues. I proceeded with the install at which point the setup asked to reboot my computer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After rebooting the computer to commence the set up, I could see the initial BIOS splash screen and the 'Loading up Operating System...' text, but after that the display signal cuts out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already installed the latest graphics drivers and attempted the installation several times with no success. I tried all the ports out of my graphics card (2xDVI, 1xHDMI), all without any signal.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a&nbsp;ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series chipset graphics card.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I have the same problem, breaking my head over it the last two days.</p>
<p>Reinstall, Removed drivers, reinstalled latest drivers, latest BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Cold BOOT or ReBoot or Hybernate or Sleepmode. The computer succesfully boots, but my monitor turns off because of No-Signal. If I disconnect the DVI Cable and Reconnect it to the same port it works fine. It is like Windows 8 does not detect a screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use sleepmode&nbsp;I can actually hear a sound when I reconnect the screen (sound of USB or Device&nbsp;connected). So I almost certainly know that it does not detect my screen after wake-up or reboot. Because&nbsp;I cannot hear a disconnect sound the first time&nbsp;I
 disconnect the screen. </p>
<p>I can hear a disconnect sound if I do the disconnect a second time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Clue why it happens. I tried all 3 DVI ports on my GPU but they all act the same. I even tried another screen, same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried another GPU, same issue. </p>
<p>Only if I use my old GPU with only 1 DVI output it works.</p>

            Same issue here, but miraculously i got it kinda working after a day of suffering, trial and error. However, i can see the post-screen and "loading windows" when using one of the two dvi-ports on a graphics card, but not Windows itself; and i can see the
 Windows but not BIOS or Loading when using another dvi-port. It's all i could squeeze out of it.<br />
<br />
My advice: before making a complete Windows restore (dont think u have to reinstall it completely) try to turn off the IGPU setting in North Bridge preferences (meaning a multi-display support for an onboard video). Then it might (just MIGHT) ignore the onboard
 video during the initial driver installation and display detection at the end of the installation.<br />
<br />
BTW I had PCI-E as a priority and it didnt help anyway: i HAD to set the priority to Onboard video in BIOS and plug the display into it after the Win 8 install to actually see the desktop. Then i was able to change the display settings for multiple displays
 in the resolution menu and choose the right port for a right display (i have 1 display, like most of people). Then i could plug the monitor into my 8800GT after choosing PCI-E as a priority in BIOS. Looks like Windows nowadays doesn't care about those settings
 much.<br />
<br />
I really hope they fix this isssue because prior to Win 8 Pro i used to have Windows 8 Release Preview, and everything was working. Still had similar problems but at least it was working right away from the start.<br />
Now i got really disappointed after i was soo happy from buying the final Windows 8 Pro.

            Latest update seems to fix it. For me it did, at least. BTW it happened when I added Media Center through the promo-code which you get here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs<br />
Didn't like the Media Center (the same WMC we had years ago), but loved the updates (especially with the Store and some standard Apps)

            Now this is interesting. I left the computer running all night. Surprisingly, I had a blinking blue light on the monitor, indicating Sleep Mode. So I moved the mouse and got.....the Vista log-in screen!
<div><br />
<div>When Log-in sequence was done, a message appeared on-screen "Could not upgrade to Windows 8. Your computer has been restored to the way it was before you began the upgrade".</div>
<div><br />
<div>So...it passed the upgrade advisor...then no BIOS access at all...then after sitting all night, the install was somehow aborted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is like an alternate reality. It is completely insane.</div>

I'm experiencing this same issue on an existing install after replacing a multi-mon setup with a single 30" display (HP LP3065). Actually, it doesn't seem to happen for Sleep (most common state for my setup) or Hibernate (occasional state); but after a Shutdown
 or Restart, I have to unplug the DVI cable and reconnect it before the monitor receives a signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My display doesn't support input resolutions other than 1280x800 and 2560x1600, so I can't see any of the POST screens or Windows start up screens prior to loading my desktop settings. I was thinking that something was going wrong there (like Windows not
 getting a response back from the display in the initial phase, and then not looking for it again after loading the desktop settings), but that wouldn't apply to your scenario. So, perhaps I shouldn't focus too much on that aspect of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is with a GTX670 connected to an HP LP3065 display via dual DVI-D, with all Windows Updates applied and the latest (314.22) NVidia drivers.</p>

            Hello everyone,
<div><br />
<div>I have the same problem since switching to windows 8 this past year. After running the windows installer from the disc and then logging into windows for the
<b>first</b> time, any reboot after will stop and sit at a black screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The steps I have taken to work around this may help with some of you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. After installing windows, go through the first steps of setting up your computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. When the option is available,<b> immediately</b> run the windows updater. Do this
<b>before</b> you begin to install your video drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To access windows updater, move your cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen. Click on "settings", then "PC info". On the bottom left of that window, click on "Windows Update" and let it run. Install
<b>ALL</b> the critical windows updates available.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. <b>Reboot</b> after you have successfully updated windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. After the Reboot, if you didn't get stuck on the black screen, You should be good to go with the rest of your driver installations.</div>

    <title>What is normal for XP SP3 Backup and the Removable Storage service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerrytolan  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is normal for XP SP3 Backup and the Removable Storage service Startup type&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was preparing to schedule and attempt a full clean backup for tonight.&nbsp; I currently have backups created on multiple save sets, but have a very stable system at the moment and wanted to try to make a clean backup file.&nbsp; This day has finally arrived after
 having been forced to "Repair" from a hard drive failure that corrupted critical system files and forced me to rollback to SP1a (my Genuine Windows validated CD which I highly value) in order to get any system to boot, including safe mode and console mode.&nbsp;
 That repair introduced many incompatibilities at program and system levels, including basic core system WMI and COM corruption.&nbsp; Three months later... it is time to update my backups and recovery procedures and hope this never happens again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In preparation,&nbsp;I decided to refresh my memory on using backup, and started browsing through the Help and Support Service Center files.&nbsp; One of the first things I noticed was "The Removable Storage service must be started for Backup to work properly."&nbsp; Upon
 checking and inspecting my current Services using Computer Management (Local), I observed that following a normal windows startup, the Removable Storage service is unstarted with startup type manual.&nbsp; I use a connected USB drive as my backup media, and it
 is fully operational as a normally formatted NTFS data disk volume.&nbsp; I have windows indexing turned off on this volume.&nbsp; Is the required Removable Storage service startup type of manual normal?&nbsp; Does the backup program automatically start this service?&nbsp; I
 know that I have never manually started it myself and backups seem to work fine.&nbsp; Should the startup type be changed to automatic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- Thanks in advance,&nbsp; Jerry</p>

            I would leave it as Manual.<br />
<br />
The Service will start (if it is able) as soon as ntbackup.exe starts.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you want to see it, with your Services window up look at the RS Service and it will not be running and Manual.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
ntbackup.exe<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Backup and Restore Wizard.<br />
<br />
Switch back to your Services window and press F5 to refresh and the RS Service should now be running.<br />
<br />
When you exit the Backup and Restore Wizard, the RS Service will stop (it might take a few minutes), and you may have to close the Services applet and reopen it to notice that it has transitioned back to not running and Manual.<br />
<br />
You will see stuff like this in the Event Viewer System Log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7036<br />
The Removable Storage service entered the running state.<br />
<br />
(here is when you exit the Backup and Restore Wizard and wait a few minutes... then the Service will stop by itself...)<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7036<br />
Description:<br />
The Removable Storage service entered the stopped state.<br />
<br />
It is like the Help and Support Service...&nbsp; Most people (including Support Engineers who are engaged by Microsoft) say to set the Startup Type to Automatic, but you don't have to...&nbsp; Set it&nbsp; to Manual and it will start just fine when it needs to start (if it
 is able).<br />
<br />
There is no need for these Services (and many other XP Services) to be starting on every reboot and running all day with nothing to do.<br />
<br />
Here is a good list that will help you understand your XP Services:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Update graphics card drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Because game performance can be affected by display drivers, it's a good idea to make sure that you have the latest drivers for your hardware.

                    hi, i have a sony vaio and my internal mic stopped working all of a sudden. two days ago it was working fine. my friends say all they get from my side of the mic is static. i put the setting so i would be able to hear the static and it is there. it's not
 on mute, it's not disabled. i've tried moving around the settings. i have two high definition audio devices and both give off static. both drivers say they are up to date. i don't know what else to do. can anyone help?

            Hi Juana18,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
a) Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurrence?<br />
<br />
b) If you plug in your external mic, does it work?<br />
<br />
c) Are you using an online service(eg. Skype) to communicate with your friends?<br />
The issue could be with the online service itself. Check with them<br />
<br />
Your Mic volume could be too high, make sure it is not too high which may make it sound static.<br />
<br />
It's most likely that a driver update can fix the issue. You need to visit the manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers for Windows 7.<br />

<h2>            Win 10 create a password reset disk mssing from control panel</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro 32 Bit</p>

<div>
<p>Upgrade on three machines from Win 7 Pro<br />
All there Win 7 PCs originally with no password (the way I wanted it).</p>
<p>
</p><div>1.&nbsp; How can I wipe the sign in passwords of my Win 10 machines?</div>

<div>2.&nbsp; How can I keep them off and keep HomeGroup working?</div>

<div>3.&nbsp; How can I skip sign in screen at reset? </div>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Made mistake of using Microsoft Account on one PC, then HomeGroup would no longer work, even with HomeGroup password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>HomeGroup problem Solved once using Microsoft account sign in on other PCs, no other change to HomeGroup settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Now at sign in all PCs show two users, both&nbsp;with Microsoft Account name and not original user which was PC name.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Unable to get past sign in screen with original names, indicates the blank is not correct password.&nbsp; Original names never had password.</div>

<div>I tried run "netplwiz" and unckecking box <br />
&nbsp;"users must enter name and password to use this computer".&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;Doesn't work, You still get sign in screen and must select name and password to get past.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>When typing "create a password reset disk: into Win 10 search box, top entry / best match is
</p>
</div>

<div>"&nbsp; Create a password reset disk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Panel "<br />
&nbsp;(without quotes)</div>

<div>When you click top entry / best match</div>

<div>
<p>the list collapses and takes you to nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Win10 appears to be a collection of numerous half changed aspects.&nbsp; Microsoft is wasting stockholder $ changing things that worked well and made them worse and incomplete.&nbsp; All to try and nickel and dime users at the store?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. When you say "PCs show two users", do you have access to those two accounts?</p>
<p>2. Are you referring to directly signing in automatically when you boot the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please be informed that as long as you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, you need to use a password. Your password helps keep your account secure, no matter what PC you sign in to or what apps, settings, and services you use while you're
 signed in. If you don't want to enter your password every time you sign in, you can create other sign-in options to use with your account, like a picture password or a PIN. If your PC has a fingerprint scanner, you can also sign in with a fingerprint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sign in to Windows with a local account, you can choose not to enter a password. However, we don't recommend this as it's the least secure way to sign in to your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your second query, what happens when you try to join the HomeGroup without using a Microsoft Account? Were you logged in through the administrator's account while trying to join the HomeGroup?</p>
<p>Please note that you do not have to be signed in through a Microsoft Account to be able to join a HomeGroup as long as you are signed in from the Admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you were unable to open the password reset disk window. I would suggest you to try these steps and check again.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. Type control and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Type user accounts in the control panel search box and open it.</p>
<p>4. Check if you see the password reset disk option on the left pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when you say "skip sign in screen at reset", are you referring to the password requirement window while trying to reset the computer? If so, this feature is by design and for security purpose so that no other users could reset the computer without
 the administrator's consent and avoid loss of data and important files and settings.
</p>
<p>For more information on resetting the computer, refer the link below:</p>

    <title>Laptop randomly shuts down without warning when running on low battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eliteash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop randomly shuts down without warning when running on low battery &#91;Windows 8.1&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Fujitsu Lifebook AH512 which I've had for about a year and half now, and within the past few days to a week I've been experiencing problems with the battery. It's perfectly fine with the AC adapter plugged in and it works when it runs on battery
 up until it get's to about 10% battery life. The first time it happened, I got the low battery notification at 10%, telling me to plug in the AC Adapter, and another notification after that at 7% for the reserve battery level. At 5% my computer would usually
 hibernate. However the second time this occurred, I got the notification at 10% and about 10 seconds after that it just shut down completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then it's happened about 3-4 more times and recently I've noticed it shuts down without the notification popping up, I'm a little unsure what to do now. I'm aware that the main cause with this is overheating and I've noticed that it does expel reasonably
 warm heat from the air vent, however I've opened up my laptop and cleaned the dust from the fan with cotton buds so it's clean as a whistle now, then I put it back together and tried it again where it shut off again at 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried;</p>
<p>-Taking out the battery and letting it cool down for a while.</p>
<p>-Changing the settings in the power plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Changing to different power plans and setting them to default settings.</p>
<p>-keeping the air vent clear from obstruction so it doesn't overheat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly sure if this is to do with Windows 8.1 because I never had a problem with it on Windows 8, it's unlikely but just putting it out there in case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a computer whiz so I don't really have much knowledge, however I am experienced enough to know some stuff, but I'm pretty much at a loss of what to do now. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am facing the <strong>exact same issue</strong> with my Fuitsu Lifebook.</p>
<p>As the PC gets down to 30-40 % the system shuts down (as in it goes off in a heartbeat).</p>
<p>I didnt try any forceful calibrations or the steps you suggested as they didnt help you in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you ever able to resolve this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I do have the same problem.Earlier it started to shutdown on 20% then it's get worse day by day and battery life got reduced significantly.Now I am on stage where my laptop shut down on 50% without warning.</p>
<p>I contact fujitsu support and they have informed that its battery life which causing problem.you should buy new battery and replace it.My battery in no more warranty period now so need to spend $50.23 to buy new battery.</p>
<p>But i am not happy about the solution as in no matter how bad the battery become but it should give warning before getting shut down.In some instance I have lost few important works because of this.I don't have feel of laptop anymore its give you feel of
 old days of desktop.</p>
<p>Will update you how it will work after buying new battery.Do post if anyone has any other solution.</p>
<p />

            <p>Did replacing the battery help? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same issue with my Lifebook NH532. &nbsp;It's shutting down when on battery power and it's getting worse - was shutting down at about 40% battery life remaining and just now it shut down with 79% battery life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured it was just the battery itself, since it's about 5 years old, even though I baby my laptop. &nbsp;So I put in a new battery, not Fujitsu brand, but from a reliable company. &nbsp;Bang! &nbsp;First test after letting it charge up to 91%. &nbsp;Laptop shut down at about
 81% battery life. &nbsp;What the heck is going on??? &nbsp;Can't be an overheating problem with mine. &nbsp;I've checked system and cpu temps&nbsp;</p>

                    Okay to get straight to the point, I have my one X placed in a low position, one where I have to bend down a bit to put disks in. Its usually fine but there are moments once in a blue where ill try to put the disk in and i guess because of the angle it
 doesnt go in right, itll stay stuck there and itll make the motor sound for a second, then ill pull the disk out and the sound still goes on for another 2 seconds then goes away. I’d say this has happened to me about 6 times now. My question is can the disk
 being held like this in the disc drive damage the system at all, because im feeling really paranoid about it. &nbsp;

            Best is to insure you put the disc in straight. It might cause some damage to your console if it keeps happening.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern of the noise your disc drive makes on occasion when inputting discs in to play. I'd be happy to provide some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, we want to put the disc in at the same level as the Xbox and slowly to let the disc drive take the disc and insert into it's position where it will spin and have an optical laser read the disc. If for whatever reason the angle you insert the disc
 causes the disc drive to insert the disc in the incorrect position, the noise generally comes from the disc hitting the sides or being impeded by something internally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest either moving the Xbox to a higher level, or get down to the level the disc drive is in and insert the disc straight in. If the console continues to make noise when inserting the disc, then you will need to send in your Xbox for repair. This article
 helps with going through the repair process if needed: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced">

<h2>            Windows 10 added family member cannot login&#33;</h2>
                    Hi, I upgraded Windows 10 on 4 of my machine. On one of them, I got a problem of not able to login from new family members that was added to the machine post upgrade. &nbsp;This is a laptop with a SSD drive. &nbsp;I orginially removed all of the users from Windows
 8.1 before the upgrade to save space because I only had 7Gb before the upgrade. &nbsp;After removing the rest of the family, I had 12Gb. &nbsp;But a big mistake! &nbsp;After the upgrade, I went into setting-&gt;account-&gt;add family members to add my wife and kids account. &nbsp;I
 cannot login with their account at all. &nbsp;It tries to login and immediately signoff right after. &nbsp;Has anyone encounter the same problem? &nbsp;If yes, what is the solution? &nbsp;I tried going into the registry and remove their profile after deleting it from manage users
 in the control panel. &nbsp;That didn't work. &nbsp;Any help is appeciated.

            I'm have a similar problem when I created a new family account post update and can not sign in. After typing in the password it signs off right away. I know the password is correct because when I type it wrong I get a message saying incorrect password.
 The account is a standard adult. I found if I change the the account type to administrator I can log in but can't do anything. I see the desktop but can't open start menu, action center, store, etc.

            <p>1. Nope,&nbsp;I&nbsp;did not see any error message when I log in with the other accounts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Trying to reset password does not work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to Brian129x, I tried changing the account to administrator for the other adult, it allow them to log in but there is not start menu, no internet explorer(edge) and I have to manually log off using the CTRL-ALT-DEL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried downloading the Microsoft account troubleshooter.&nbsp; It does not work either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'm about to reinstall window 10 again from scratch if all else fails.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a 'Reset&nbsp;this Pc' under the recovery options and tell it to wipe everything off.&nbsp; I did a backup of the system prior to the refresh just to make sure if I brick the PC, I have something to go back on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 'reset' option, I ask it to delete everything, even my files and settings and restart from scratch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, this works.&nbsp; I can now add adult and kids from the add user option and it will log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will be helpful for some.&nbsp; I'll have to reinstall everything again, but I still have all my data backup.</p>

            <p>The solution I found was written by someone who had a similar problem signing in to a new account after upgrading from Windows 8.0 to 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the&nbsp;folder C:\User\Default from a Windows 10 installation on a virtual machine where the contents weren't corrupted and pasted it over the corrupted folder on the host machine. The folder is hidden, so you need to "show hidden folders" so you can
 see it to copy it. I had to use a shared folder to pass the folder from the client to the host machine. Used Oracle's VirtualBox.</p>

            This didn't help me either. I have also been having other issues, possibly hardware as my primary SSD drive wasn't recognized but the Blu-Ray drive was. Plugged it into that slot and it was recognized. That says at least some of the SATA on the MB are&nbsp;having
 issues. The was recognized when plugged into another machine so I know it's fine. This is likely why these scans didn't work in my case. I also had random restarts until I opened the case and left it open. When I did get windows to load, my start menu was
 back to default. So something is wrong and not just with my hardware. Hmmm...

<p>Didn't work and this is a fresh install of Windows done by Microsoft level 3 or 4 (So many upgrade transfers I lost count). They did it all themselves remotely to try to get rid of the issue but, it still persists. I am the one who handles Microsoft Family
 so the only adult I could ask is myself. There is also no way to add this program to allowed apps for adults.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Version 1511 Clean Install Sleep Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike mccollister  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1511 Clean Install Sleep Problems</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 14 5447 laptop. Last week I did a clean install of Windows 10 version 1511. All device manager drivers were install directly from Windows install except for the Realtek USB 2.0 card reader. I got the Realtek drivers from the Realtek
 site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I did this clean install my laptop will sometimes&nbsp; not wakeup out of sleep mode. If I open the lid, nothing. If I briefly press the power button, nothing. I have to press and hold the power button for 10+ seconds for it to start. This happened
 before I installed the Realtek driver so I'm pretty sure that is not the problem. This is a pretty generic install with minimal software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have this problem before I did the clean Windows install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query at Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As Windows 10 is a new operating system, some application will need new drivers for proper functioning.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The sleep function is not dependent on any audio drivers but could be due to graphic drivers. I would suggest you to download and install all the drivers especially graphic drivers from the

            <p>Rakesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. I installed the Dell Video driver for this and it did not make it better. In fact it made it worse. My computer would lock up after a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and found that it was the Intel IMEI driver. I IMEI driver that was automatically installed with windows was version 11.0.0.1157. When I installed Dell's IMEI driver, which is version 9.5.21.1754, the problem went away. This is a known
 issue with version 11.x of Intel's driver. I am very disappointed that this driver got through testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seems well now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>Major bad news update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updated my Intel video driver from 10.18.15.4256 (7/17/2015) to 20.19.15.4331 (11/18/2015) and now my laptop will give me the dreaded black screen after a restart. I can get past a restart if I keep pressing a key on the keyboard until Windows finished
 booting up. Doing a shutdown and then powering up gives me no problem. It is the restart that is giving me the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I roll back the video driver Windows just updates it back to the broken one at the next Windows update. I've tried the Dell supplied driver 10.18.15.4278 and it give me the same black screen of death after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable. To get through a restart I have to press a key multiple times. Why has this not been fixed?&nbsp;From the research that I have done, this appears to be an Intel driver problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to tell Windows not to update the video driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi Mike,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. &nbsp;<br />
We apologize for not being able to address your concern in a timely manner. &nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There can be many reasons for booting to a black screen.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
These screens may appear with or without the mouse pointer.&nbsp; The main causes observed are:
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
•Problems with the driver for your display adapter. <br />
•The video output is being sent to an unexpected port.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to refer to the suggestions given&nbsp; by Sharath Srinivasa, replied on August 7, 2015, to fix your issue with black screen on Windows 10.</div>

            <p>I talked too soon. After doing a clean install of Windows 10 version 1511 it worked fine for a day. After I finished copying over my data and installing my apps the problem started again. I figured that one of the apps caused the problem so I decided to
 start over. After another&nbsp;clean install, after the first reboot it got stuck on the black screen of death. After some power cycles I was able to get the rest of the drivers installed from Windows update. I kept getting the black screen of death after restarts.
 After doing yet another clean install I had the same problem but after a few restarts it seems to be working now. I'm going to be creating system restore points after every app that I install and when it breaks back off one and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there is some serious problem with Windows 10 and/or Intel on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I just had a cumulative update yesterday and maybe that has fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I'm not having the problem with this latest clean install. I have a few things to try that I think might cause the problem to start. I'll see what happens in a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my screen goes black after a reboot again is there a way to determine which driver is the culprit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Antony,</p>
<p>I appreciate your answering my question twice with the same response but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After further tinkering I decided to disable the touchscreen display by disabling the HID-compliant touch screen in the device manager. After I did this all worked well. Every reboot worked just fine. This is with all drivers from Microsoft and none from
 Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then decided to re-enable the touchscreen and found that I was having the black screen of death problem again, as expected. The next time the computer restarted with the black screen of death, I decided to touch the screen and behold the computer responded
 and the screen came on. I have been working on the issue for over a month and it did not occur to me to simply touch the screen if it was black. Ugh! I don't know how many times I did a clean Windows install on this computer to try to figure out which driver
 was giving me the problem. I was focusing on the video and IMEI drivers, without any luck. While the problem may still be with the video and/or IMEI drivers, at least I have a quick fix, touch the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started in early to mid-January and it appears to be a serious problem with Windows 10. I hope that Microsoft gets this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ll update this post if I find out any more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

<p>Turn the Xbox completely off. What happens when you then plug the Xbox One directly into the ethernet port on your apartment wall, rather than to the E900, then turn it on and try?</p>
<p>I suspect you have a double NAT situation (there is a probably a router with NAT firewall for your complex that is upstream of your own), which does not work well with the Teredo IPv6 &nbsp;solution the Xbox One uses...</p>

<p>same thing, strict nat when I plug it in from the wall. Its very frustrating I can chat with my friend in a Ghosts lobby, but when I join the Xbox Live party I can't hear him or it says "You can't join the party right now". 360 never had this problem don't
 know why it would start now</p>

<p>It is likely because the Xbox 360 uses only IPv4. &nbsp;It does not have IPv6 support and does not use Teredo. The Xbox One fully supports IPv6, which is the future of the Internet (the supply of IPv4 addresses is pretty much exhausted). &nbsp;Because many ISPs and
 other parts of the Internet infrastructure (including many or most home users' routers) are not yet IPv6 capable (or have a broken implementation), the Xbox One uses a transition technology called Teredo to tunnel IPv6 over IPv4. Unfortunately, Teredo does
 not work in some setups such as symmetric NAT, double NAT, etc. Additionally, you have a problem in that your Xbox One is likely behind a symmetric NAT router over which you have no control--i.e. one run by your apartment complex. This means you cannot effectively
 forwards ports, enable UPnP, put the Xbox in DMZ, etc. (doing so on your own router is ineffective assuming I am correct that it is behind your complex's router).</p>

<p>Dr ritter, check what you use in network settings on the xbone. Is it ipv4 or ipv6.</p>
<p>If its ipv6 than your router does have some sort of tunneling and its possible to turn of ipv6 actually. I checked it. Basically go to setup -&gt; IPV 6 setup and at the bottom it has tunnel try to enable that, its pretty cryptic what it says there but I presume
 its teredo tunneling. IF not try disabling ipv6 all together and then perhaps try DMZ again. Reply back with what happens please.</p>

<p>Yes, if I am correct that you are behind a NAT router and firewall they are managing. If, as I understand, you are getting Internet via CAT5e/6 from the wall and do not have your own modem, then that is almost certain. You can verify by looking at the WAN
 IP of your E900, as reported in its web interface. &nbsp;If it is a private class IP (see &nbsp;explanation at
<a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/private-ip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">whatismyipaddress.com/private-ip</a>), then your E900 is behind another NAT router--presumably your complex-wide one. It may be very difficult to convince them to open ports for
 you, and what if another resident with an Xbox One wants the same? A port can only be forwarded to one host at a time...</p>
