<h2>            Windows 7 Clear Type causing on-screen text display corruption</h2>
                    Greetings.<br />
<br />
I'm posting this in the hope that it may help some people with similar display issues.&nbsp; I have no idea how rare or widespread this problem is, as I was unable to find much in the way of information regarding it.<br />
<br />
The problem was such, that <u>some</u> small sized text displayed on my monitor incorrectly.&nbsp; Sometimes some letters would show fringing, overexposure, and discoloration. It was most apparent in vertical groups of letters such as "ill". In Photoshop for example,
 on-screen options and settings boxes, where the text was white on a black background, such groups of letters would appear blue in color. This type of text distortion appeared in other unrelated programs as well. To add to the confusion, over an extended period
 of time (months), the symptoms would come and go for no discernible reason. Perhaps there is some sort of conflict with other apps or drivers (?)<br />
<br />
By far the worst example of this was in Firefox (ver. 24) on the YouTube web-site (see attached picture below). The YouTube problem did not occur in Internet Explorer, or in Firefox on my admin. account. I tried uninstalling Flash, Firefox, removing browser
 add-ons, all to no avail. Very frustrating, until I finally discovered that by turning off Clear Type text (right-click Desktop/Personalize/Adjust Clear Type text/) the problem disappeared in all the above mentioned scenarios. Unfortunately, as a result, the
 text is not as legible and well defined as it was when Clear Type was activated.&nbsp; :-(<br />
<br />
I'm using a 46" Sony HX850 TV as my monitor, which is connected to the PC graphics card (ASUS/NVIDIA GTX580) via an HDMI cable. At first I thought the TV or cable might be the culprit, but if so, the problem would not show up in screen capture images such as
 the one below.<br />
<br />
If you have any insightful comments regarding this matter, I'd love to read them.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

    <title>Delay in playing system sounds AND odd audio &#34;skipping&#34; during - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sft777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delay in playing system sounds AND odd audio &#34;skipping&#34; during playback</h2>
                    I am an IT Professional, so please bear with all the details for this ridiculous problem.&nbsp; I would be VERY THANKFUL for a solution to this problem!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a Toshiba U205-S5067 laptop with Soundmax on-board audio.&nbsp; I recently did a full installation to Win 7 Ultimate (32-bit).&nbsp; I installed all the Toshiba updates for this particular model, including audio drivers.&nbsp; I have also installed ALL Intel 945GM
 INF updates . I have odd problems with my on-board audio that never existed before.&nbsp; Sound payed from Windows Media Player or iTunes usually plays ok, but I notice DELAYS in basic system sounds; for example, if I click on the speaker icon and change the volume
 level, there is a delay before I hear the distinct windows "ding".&nbsp; During the delay, the entire system to slow or hang-up. When the "ding" is heard, I can click the sound level and the "dings" are heard normally.&nbsp; This delay is also encountered when I am
 doing a reboot or shutdown, as the system will actually hang, then ask if I wish to terminate the audio program "waiting for system shutdown sound" (or something to that effect).&nbsp; Once the sound is heard, then the system will shut down.&nbsp; I recently installed
 Great Planes Flight Simulator G5, which also seems to have problems unique to certain audio portions.&nbsp; The normal sounds, such as engine running and other sounds, are fine.&nbsp; When I run the flight training instructions, which include recorded audio from pilots,
 their recorded voices tend to skip and repeat.&nbsp; There is obviously a systemic problem with the audio components.&nbsp; I have tried older Vista-compatible drivers from Toshiba (as I read on one thread elsewhere), and I had no success.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had installed some 3rd party Codecs (K-lite) after the clean install of Win 7, but I have removed them as well.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
*** I THINK THIS MAY BE&nbsp;A CODEC ISSUE, BUT I CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH THE BASIC WAV CODEC, I THINK!! ***&nbsp; I would love to be able to reinstall the basic .WAV codec, but I am unable with Media Player 12.&nbsp; I even went through the Control Panel and&nbsp;tried "Turn
 Windows Features On or Off" and UNCHECKED ALL MEDIA options.&nbsp; Sound still played back after rebooting, and the problem remained.&nbsp; I re-checked all the Media options and now have Media Player 12 back.<br />
<br />
I tried another&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Forum, and was recommended to run a Clean Boot (msconfig&nbsp;changes to disable statup files - DONE and no help).&nbsp; No luck after that either!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am really stuck and could use help!!&nbsp; I was fine with Vista Ultimate, and I now have regrets about "upgrading" to Win 7 due to this new and unusual problem!&nbsp; I would appreciate any support!!

            Hi sft777,<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some solutions for getting proper sound from your computer. These solutions can also help if you don't hear any sounds from your computer or from a sound device connected to your computer, such as a microphone or speakers.<br />
<br />
You can also try running a program from Microsoft that automatically diagnoses and repairs problems with sound and audio on your computer. To do so, click this link and follow the instructions:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</a>
<br />
<br />
Click on fixit from the above link and check.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong>
<br />
<br />
Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‌<br />
<br />
In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
<br />
Click the Driver tab, click Update Driver, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers or headphones.<br />
<br />
You may run the troubleshooter from the below mentioned link and check if you can get to the exact issue – Open the playing Audio troubleshooter -<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter<br />
</a><br />
<br />
Most speakers have a volume control, but you can also control the overall level of sound on your computer using Windows.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<p>In Windows® 7, the built-in administrator account is disabled by default. Enable built-in administrator account and check if it works fine.</p>
<p>To enable the default administrator account, you would have to login to an account having administrative privileges and follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>1. Open the MMC console and select Local Users and Groups.<br />
2. Right-click the Administrator account and select Properties.</p>
<p>The Administrator Properties window appears.</p>
<p>3. On the General tab, clear the Account is Disabled check box.<br />
4. Close the MMC console.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more information:</p>
<p><strong>Enable and Disable the Built-in Administrator Account<br />
</strong><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744293(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744293%28WS.10%29.aspx</strong>
</a></p>
If it works fine, then you may have a corrupt user profile and hence want to fix corrupt user profile<br />
<br />
Follow the steps in the link to fix corrupt user profile<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a>
<br />
<br />
If none of the above suggestions work get in touch with the manufacturer.<br />

<h2>            Different size of folders when copied from one source and pasted to another</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone can help me figure out why a folder size can be different when it is copied from one source and pasted to another i.e. hard drive to an external drive?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My work requires me to backup databases to an external source before making changes to a program/database as to protect info before any troubleshooting begins/changes are made. These databases can be several GB in size and take a relatively long time to
 copy over depending on size and transfer speed, but when I compare the properties of each folder after the copy is made often times the sizes don't match exactly. Mind you the discrepancy can only be a few KB to MB but nonetheless this could represent informational
 data, scheduling data, or picture data which needs to be preserved. Can someone explain why/how this happens and if there a way to ensure an exact copy is made each time so I do not have to go back and make a second or third attempt at copying files over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>David</p>

<p>
</p><p>Copy/paste and drag and drop do no error checking.&nbsp; bad, bad, bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A file that takes up 100 Mb exactly on a 500 Gb HD with 4k sectors will not take up the same space on a 1Tb Hd with 8k sectors.&nbsp; There may be a slight varience between the two because of the sector size if for example the las bit of info (it could be as
 little as 1 byte) is placed in a 8k sector it will often say it used the whole sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is no effective error checking if a network issue drops data it will not be recopied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing with ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always google something like error checking with file transfers in win 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>For an example of an app with error checking check this one&nbsp; https://codesector.com/teracopy (there are dozens)</p>

<p><span>The 8015 series error you mentioned indicates a connection problem. Some NAT problems are subtle and don't appear in the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Most likely there's a port blocked or misdirected
 away from your Xbox, in your router, modem, or at your ISP.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since the Xbox 360 uses different ports than PCs &amp; Macs ordinarily use, you can't see the effect of a port blockage
<em><strong>except on the Xbox</strong></em>, for the NAT problem is really the blockage or misdirection of ports.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing a port problem, and
<em><strong>the order and timing of the steps is important to success</strong></em>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) turn off the Xbox then</span></p>
<p><span>2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).</span></p>
<p><span>3) unplug power from the modem.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Wait at least 30 secs then replug the modem/gateway power.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and
 router or a modem with no router, then when that light says it's ready, skip to step 7.</span></p>
<p><span>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</span></p>
<p><span>7) Turn on the Xbox. &nbsp;For more background on Ports, see

            <p>Hey there Christian!<br />Do you have a modem built in router? If not, try connect your Xbox directly to your modem instead. If you have a Kinect connected to your Xbox, unplug it.<br /><br />Keep us posted.</p>

 Proszę o informację zwrotną w jaki sposób mogę przywrócić do stanu fabrycznego (początkowego) gdyż na chwilę obecną konsole jest wręcz bezużyteczna. Nie można także na niej uruchomić żadnej gry.</p>

<p>Hello Krystian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Please take the time to perform all troubleshooting steps on this link here regarding
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Error code D000-0185</a>. This should resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would simply like to just format the 360 harddrive, follow these steps </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Guide</strong> button &nbsp;on your controller, go to <strong>Settings</strong>, and select
<strong>System Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Storage</strong> or <strong>Memory</strong>. </li><li>Select the storage device that you want to format, and then press <strong>Y</strong> &nbsp;on your controller.
</li><li>Select <strong>Format</strong>. You will see the following message: <br />
This will delete all content on this device. Do you wish to continue? </li><li>Select <strong>Yes</strong> to format the storage device. </li><li>If prompted to enter your console serial number, do so, and then select <strong>
Done</strong>. This step helps guard against accidental formatting. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and let us know the results!</p>

<h2>            Rewards Mission Not Recognizing Microsoft Marketplace Purchases</h2>
                    <p>Dear Xbox Rewards Team,</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I am a member of the Xbox Rewards Program and frequently look at the missions. Every time I take a survey I earn the 250 points toward the 5,000 banking goal for them to be deposited. However, when I am playing on&nbsp;Xbox live and purchase content at the marketplace it does not reflect the purchase in the&nbsp;Xbox Rewards Program. As a result, the system does not recognize that I have progression or completed a mission (or VIP star)&nbsp;which causes me to miss out on the bonus rewards credits.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Specifically, there is a "bromance" mission right now that lists rocket league as part of its mission. Since this mission has come out I have purchased the game but have yet to see any progress towards the completion of the mission.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I have noticed this problem for a while now and assumed it was just during some transitional period nonsense, glitch with a specific title, etc. but that is simply not the case. I am astounded that two systems, which both rely&nbsp;on a Microsoft Account, cannot communicate to one another about&nbsp;the same purchase and immediately recognize&nbsp;/&nbsp;fulfill any mission requirements. Having been an&nbsp;Xbox Live member for a long time I feel taken advantage of having missed out on countless reward credits, and at this time believe third party companies such as Gamestop, G2A, etc. may provide better discounts, bonus content, etc. Please help me reinstate my support of&nbsp;Xbox and the outstanding&nbsp;benefits they can offer.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Hello Bluepigs,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It takes us up to 96 hours to recognize and process new activity. Since your Rocket League purchase was made yesterday, February 21st, it is too early for that data to have been processed by our system. The only other purchase we see made through the Xbox store&nbsp;for the previous MyVIP year (September 2015-December 2016) was a purchase of Astroneer. However, since that purchase did not go towards any offers, and you do not have any MyVIP&nbsp;stars, it did not qualify for either offer completion Credits or MyVIP payback.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are no general&nbsp;offers that awards Credits for playtime. The only offer like that currently would be the ROBLOX offer from FREEdom Rewards, which awards sweepstakes entries for playtime.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I have a lot of cnc files which I would like to change the extension of .PGM to .TXT  how is this done if I want to change a whole folder</h2>
                    I am trying to copy my cnc program files to my book reader. The problem is that the reader does not recognise the extension .PGM which I use on my cnc machines. I would like to change all the extensions in one go&nbsp; to .TXT as there are so many of them .
 I can change them one at a time but this would take a very long time. Is there any way to do this?

<h2>            Suface Book Display&#47;Freezing</h2>
                    <p>Wow,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote this big paragraph about how my display was messing up and... wow, it all got deleted. Ugh. Ok, I'll rewrite what I said and make it quick so hopefully this won't happen again before I can post my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone! Please help me with my computer :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer keeps freezing and having display problems. I have attached two pictures that happened literally within the last hour. When the freezing occurs, the computer does make this small buzzing type noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not completely computer illiterate so I have done the following:</p>
<p>Scanned for viruses - nothing</p>
<p>Checked for windows updates - latest updates already installed</p>
<p>Used SFCcannow thing in CMD but no problems</p>
<p>Ran a memory test - all good</p>
<p>Ran chkdsk - it did find errors, corrected them but still having the issue</p>
<p>I have not installed anything new lately</p>
<p>Did a reset on the computer (the kind where you keep all your files but just "refresh" the system)
</p>
<p>Even with all of the above, the issues continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does anyone notice their surface book display getting super hot? I know computers get warm but is it normal for this computer to get HOT?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Reliability Monitor Shows Repeated Unexpected Shutdowns when Shut Down via Power Menu</h2>
                    I checked the Reliability Monitor for any issues regarding my work machine and noticed that there are multiple Critical events detailing my machine had unexpected shutdowns. I only shut down the machine via the shut down menu and let it completely shut
 off so I'm confused what could those errors. Any ideas why a typically triggered shutdown could cause an Unexpected Shutdown error?

            Hello,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing issues with unexpected shutdowns. I will certainly help you with the issue.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to know a few information:<br />
1)&nbsp;Are you using any Security software/Antivirus?<br />
2)&nbsp;Did you make any changes to the hardware/software prior to this issue?<br />
3)&nbsp;What is the make and the model of your PC?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would suggest to you to install all the latest drivers for the devices on the computer and also BIOS update, check if issue is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span>As you get the BSOD in safe mode as well, I would suggest you to try updating the computer BIOS and the chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and check if that resolves the issue.
 It would be better to contact the computer manufacturer for further assistance with this, because updating BIOS and chipset drivers include risky procedures and if anything goes wrong, that would leave the computer unstable or unusable</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important:&nbsp;</span></em></strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Modifying
 BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also get the technical details for the expected shutdown that is reported in the reliability monitor.</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Windows key + X and select Control Panel, and then, under System and Security, clicking&nbsp;&nbsp; Review your computer's status.</div>
<div>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Maintenance.</div>
<div>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Check for solutions to problem reports, click View reliability history.</div>
<div>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of reliability details, double-click any item to vie w its technical details.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, check the event logs to identify the exact issue.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Go to the Start Screen. <br />
b) Type in Event Viewer. <br />
c) This will bring up the Event Viewer box. Click to open the event viewer. <br />
d) In the left pane, expand out Windows Logs. <br />
e) Click on Application log. Highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down.
<br />
f) Most of your event will be Information. You may see Yellow Warnings or Red Errors. If you see a red error, you can double click on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>Please provide us the required information to search more about this and understand the issue more clearly and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot seem to get the touchscreen working for the Lenovo C50 all-in-one desktop.&nbsp; This is a new machine&nbsp;that came&nbsp;pre-installed with Windows 10 64-bit.&nbsp; I've installed the latest drivers from the Lenovo website as suggested but still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the user guide there should be an option to enable 'Tablet PC Settings' in the Control Panel under the Hardware and Sound, but this is not even coming up as an option (i.e. it's missing!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE can someone help????</p>
<p>

<h2>            Please help me get my account back, somehow I am labeled as a child &#38; can&#39;t access account without parent permission</h2>
                    <p>I was installing Skype on another machine &amp; when after I entered my credentials, a popup appeared &amp; I just clicked next&gt; next&gt; next.</p>
<p>In that popup apparently I selected that I was born on 1/Jan/2017 which would make me a baby/child.</p>
<p>And, now I can't access my account without parent permission.. If I login with Microsoft account, there is only 1 screen I see, where it tells me I need parent permission, so I can't edit my account age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is the option to enter billing info, to prove I am adult, but it request credit card info + US address, but I am not for US!.</p>
<p>Whatever flow provided by microsoft/skype, I just enter some blocking screen.</p>
<p>I managed once, with another account to add my problematic account as family member, I reached a page where an "Upps error occured" message, with another I manged to add myself as family member, but I requested again billing info (that matched my problematic
 account)..</p>
<p>One colleague who tried to help, managed to talk on skype with someone from Customer Service, they asked for id + some declaration &amp; a FAX.. I've sent it, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is insane, worst flows I've seen.. why FAX?!</p>
<p>I need my account, I have all my contacts there..</p>
<p>Please anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I exit this?</p>

            Considering you have tried 'compatability mode', w/Admin rights, the chances of getting 25 yr old games to play with W10 are very slim, maybe your best option would be to install W95&nbsp; or W XP, in a Virtual Machine setup.

<h2>            Pinball FX import detection failed...</h2>
                    
<p>I have Pinball FX and Pinball FX2 claims you can import the tables from the first game, but I keep getting this error message when I try: "Pinball FX import detection failed"</p>
<p>I have tried deleting and redownloading both games, and clearing the cache, and still get the error. There are others on the Zen forums that are having the same problem, and Zen claims the problem is on Microsoft's end, so any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>To be sure, Gear, had you purchased content for the first game with the same Gamertag you're using now? Also, have you tried using a different memory device to complete that transfer, such as a USB device configured for use with Xbox 360?</p>

<p>Yes, it is the same gamertag for both purchases. I have only tried it with two different hard drives, I have not tried with a USB device. I will give that a try and see if it makes any difference. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>I don't know what exactly happened but when I booted up Pinball FX2 today, it asked me to import the tables from Pinball FX right off the bat, and they are now working, so I say thank you to who ever fixed it!</p>

<p>What is the file size.</p>
<p>The x86 .iso should be 589 MB (617,756,672 bytes) in size.</p>
<p>SHA1 Hash value should be:&nbsp; 1C735B38931BF57FB14EBD9A9BA253CEB443D459</p>
<p>Download and install SlavaSoft's HashCalc<br />
HASH, CRC, AND HMAC CALCULATOR<br />
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</a></p>
<p>For Windows .ISO file just place check marks in the SHA1 and&nbsp; CRC32 boxes.</p>
<p>In the main HashCalc Window the 'Data format' box located in the upper left should be set to "File"</p>
<p>In the 'Data' field click on the&nbsp; ... box located in the upper right and then click 'Cancel' if you get an 'Insert Disk' window pop up.</p>
<p>After you click cancle you should see a 'Find' window. Use this to navigate to the folder where your .ISO file is stored and click on the file.</p>
<p>You should now see the .ISO file you clicked on listed in the 'File name' box located near the bottom of the 'Find' window.</p>
<p>Now click the 'Open' button. The Data field should now show the directory/folder path and the name of the .ISO file you selected.</p>
<p>With only the SHA1 and CRC32 boxes checked (Do not place check marks in any other boxes as this can slow down the time it take to calculate the values) click the 'Calculate' button located at the bottom of the main HashCalc window.</p>
<p>It will take anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds for the calculation to complete and the SHA1 and CRC32 data values to be displayed.</p>
<p>These values are not case sensitive, so a lower case 'a' is the same as an upper case 'A' as far as the results are concerned.</p>

<h2>            Surface stuck at &#34;Getting Windows ready&#34; screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my Surface Pro 4 that isn't a good sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It revolves around the update feature. Sometimes when you start up your Surface Pro 4 it'll say that it is "getting Windows ready" meaning it is going to work on updates. My problem is it won't start the updates. It's stuck on the "getting Windows ready"
 page. I really need my Surface and it's bugging me out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Glad to here you got your issue resolved. &nbsp;<strong>But, believe me, it was not holding the volume up and down buttons down when the sp4 is off. &nbsp;You accomplish absolutely nothing when you do this.</strong> &nbsp;If you get stuck at "getting Windows ready" &nbsp;during
 power up or restart, wait a reasonable amount of time, perhaps 15 minutes and if the msg is still displayed press and hold the power button for at least 20 seconds to force a power down and then press the power button to startup the sp4. &nbsp;It should startup
 normally.</p>

<h2>            Unable to start Windows Time service - Error&#58; 2</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Windows 7, unable to start time service - cannot find the file specified&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an industrial PC running Win 7 Ultimate, SP1. &nbsp;It supposed to take GPS time then act as NTP server to rest of the PCs on an isolated network. &nbsp;I found the time is off from GPS time so I &nbsp;started to look through the setup and found the time service
 disabled. &nbsp;So far I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">w32tm /unregister</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">w32tm /register</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p>so far so good, then</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">net start w32time</p>
<p>
</p><p>and get the following error,</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The Window time service is starting</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">The Windows Time service could not be started</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">A system error has occurredSystem error 2 has occurred</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the same error when using service.msc. &nbsp;I looked through the registry and also ran SFC and everything seems ok. &nbsp;Now, any suggestions?</p>
