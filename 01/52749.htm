<h2>            Sending file from Office 365 &#34;desktop Skype for Business&#34; to &#34;regular Skype&#34; fails.</h2>
                    <p>I try to send a file from Skype for Business that is part of Office 365 to a regular Skype user but it fails immediately. According to some threads here the solution to this problem (or at least a similar problem, sending files from Skype4B to Skype4B) is
 to enable some setting in Skype server admin but since this is part of Office 365 I guess that we don't have that option. However, it would surprise me if Microsoft blocked that feature completely, with no workaround available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I send files from desktop Skype for Business to a regular Skype-user?</p>

<p>Hi Lagrave,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your details. As Skype for Business and Skype are two different software, they are vastly different even though they share a similar name. You can transfer the files in Skype for Business to another Skype for Business user,</span><span>
 but it’s infeasible for you to transfer files from Skype for Business to Skype. If it’s inconvenient for you and you really want the related features, please give feedback to our related engineers via
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What youd want to do is the following:</p>
<p>1. Turn off the console.</p>
<p>2.Turn on the console</p>
<p>3. Turn on the controller</p>
<p>4.wait until the dashboard is completely up.</p>
<p>5.press and hold right bumper (RB) (the button above the right trigger) till your at the last menu on the xbox.</p>
<p>6. you should see 8 big green squares. click on &nbsp;the one that looks like an Xbox console (the upper most left green square)</p>
<p>7. Then click "a" (green button on controller) on the first option (again looks like a Xbox Console)</p>
<p>8. You'd then want to scroll down to the third option and click that</p>
<p>9. click the first option (theres only 2)</p>
<p>10. Then youd want to scroll all the way up (i am assuming you want English) on my console its the very top choice. and click that. You'd then be taken back to the "languages and Locale" area.</p>
<p>11. Just to make sure. Click on Locale</p>
<p>12. Pick your country and click that.</p>
<p>13. Restart your console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Im hoping this helps (i changed my language settings on my console and just did this as i typed it)
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes :)</p>

<p>Your console is currently in the Initial Setup process for the kinect sensor. Unfortunately there is no way to Abort this process, but you can reach the Dashboard if you continue with the Setup. From there you can either reset the console again or set another
 language. My advice would be to search for a video showing the Setup process for the xbox/kinect sensor and follow from there. (e.g forward to the point with the kinect microphone calibration) Even if the language changes and you can't read what stands on
 the Screen, you can still follow the proces by doing what the Video suggests. It might not be perfect but helps reaching the Dashboard.</p>

            <p>That's much better, thank you.<br />
<br />
The settings you should be using are the ones in the middle of this page: <span>
<a href="http://myeastlink.ca/customerSupport/Internet/FAQs/Email.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Email Settings</a>.
<br />
<br />
Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>On the <em>Servers </em>tab, select <em>My server requires authentication</em></span></li><li><span>On the <em>Advanced </em>tab, select the topmost <em>
This server requires a secure connection (SSL)&nbsp;</em> and change the outgoing mail port to 587.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Delete the unsent test message from the outbox, then c</span><span>lose down WLMail and wait a few minutes before re-launching and sending a new test message to yourself. Give it a new subject (e.g.
<em>Test2</em>) so you can see from the error message which one it is that's not getting through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>These settings are provided for mobile device users, so there's unfortunately no guarantee that they'll work from a PC. If the error message you now see indicates something of the sort, you're out of luck. You must either use the SMTP server for your daughter's
 ISP, or for a Hotmail or Gmail account if you have one, or else use webmail to send messages while you're away from home. This isn't a shortcoming in WLMail - it's your mail service provider (Eastlink) that's making life difficult.</p>

                    I purchased my Surface and from the start had problems.&nbsp; After 20 days it shut off and would not power up again.&nbsp; I notified Technical support and they suggested I return my Surface, they in return sent me a refurbished Surface.&nbsp; I was told that any Surface
 (even if new) would automatically be replaced with a refurbished unit.&nbsp; To my consumer mind this indicates that Surface could provide a substandard product with little if any consequences since all products would be replaced with REFURBISHED products.&nbsp; Any
 one else had this problem???? <br />

<p>I had my surface for just over a year, my wife and daughter paid nearly £500 for it last Christmas,&nbsp;once it was 2 months out of warranty, it stopped charging, I contacted microsoft and they said that because&nbsp;my warranty&nbsp;was 2 months out of date, i would

<p>no doubt if I agreed, my surface would now be in someone elses home, after they had paid £165 for a replacement as well?

<p>Hello ClareHogan1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Is this issue occurring on an Xbox One or Xbox 360? If this is an Xbox One, we recommend testing the network connection on the console. We will provide the steps on how to complete that process. Let us
 know if an error message appears. The best step to take after a power surge or power outage is to reset the power supply of the console. Press and hold the
<strong>Xbox </strong>button on the console for 10 seconds, until the console turns off. After the console shuts down, unplug the power cable from the wall. After 30 seconds, plug the console directly into the wall outlet. Touch the
<strong>Xbox </strong>button on the console again to turn it back on. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide. </li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Network</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Network settings</strong>. Any known outages will appear in the middle of the screen.
</li><li>On the right side of the <strong>Network settings</strong> screen, select <strong>
Test network connection</strong>. </li></ol>

<h3> palmetto60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t recogonize iPod Touch</h2>
                    Windows 8.1 iPod Touch 6th gen. 64GB. iTunes updated. IOS updated. Apple Music Family Share. All worked fine until 3 days ago. My music library disappeared from iPod , but not iPhone 5c. (where I didn't want due to space) I've had hours-long convos with
 Apple reps-all my settings/etc are correct. No one can tell me why or how to fix. When I try to sync iPod with iTunes, Window Media Player pops up. It does not recognize my iPod. Uninstalled/re-installed all iTunes components to no avail. While aware that
 my issue is of no global import, 'tis indeed frustrating to me; any help greatly appreciated.

During the installation of Windows 10 on Asus FX553VD &nbsp;(which was pre-installed with Endless OS ), I lost 100 GB disk space. Do I need to uninstall Endless from my system prior to installation if yes what should I do now or check for now as a solution.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be possible that the missing disc space was due to the partition created upon installing Endless OS. You may want to check with the developers to see if that holds true. You may also check this

<h2>            Windows 10 upgraded to wrong version &#40;Home instead of Pro&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 and it installed the "Home" version rather than Pro. OEM laptop that came with Win 7 Pro and an option to upgrade to 8.1 which I did without issue. Now I'm stuck with 10 Home which does not allow me to log in
 to my domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the upgrade through Windows Update, using the manual command "muauclt.exe /updatenow" if that helps.</p>

            <p>Update - if anyone cares:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to revert back to Win 8.1 (feature available in settings), and there was an option to try troubleshooting with MS support first - thought to myself "why not?" It was actually helpful. Tech accessed remotely and looked at system logs to gather info
 so they can address the issue, which seems to happening to a lot of folks. Good to know I'm not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No solution yet, but they are working on figuring out what is causing this glitch. In the meantime, I am trying several things based on MS support suggestions, and will report back as to what does or does not work. First is I will revert back to 8.1 using
 the Win 10 utility in settings, and will try the update to 10 a second time. They felt this may or may not correct the issue, so I'll give it a try and see if it works. More to come on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - the other solution I will try if that one does NOT work is to go back to my factory Win 7 Pro install (this laptop came with 7 preinstalled and a set of discs to upgrade to 8), and then I will try the upgrade to 10 from there. But that will only be
 if the "back to 8.1" solution doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope my journey helps someone else find a solution. I will post back shortly as the retro to 8.1 just finished and I am about to redo the update to 10.</p>

            <p>Wow! Stupid me. The laptop came with Win 7 Pro, and I used the upgrade discs supplied with it to upgrade to Win 8.1, but I never verified that it installed the Pro version of 8. I use this laptop in the field and have yet to have an occasion to log in to
 my domain in the office, so until now I "thought" it had upgraded me to 8.1 Pro. This does not appear to be the case, as the "Network ID" button in System Properties is grayed out. So all this is for naught, as it appears my problem was not in upgrading from
 8 to 10, but instead was upgrading from 7 to 8. Thanks Lenovo for providing upgrade discs that actually downgraded me from the Pro to standard version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a system restore back to Win 7 Pro (factory) and will try the Win 10 upgrade from there.</p>

            <p>Upgraded two laptops. One with Win 7 Professional the other Win 8.1</p>
<p>The Win 7 had no problem and the Win 10 version is Professional. The 8.1 received Win 10 Home.</p>

 1511 it will force Home version if there is embedded Windows 8 Home product key even if there is already an Entitlement for Pro.&nbsp; I elevated this to developers via MVP Communications channel but there is apparently no plan to change it.&nbsp; Meanwhile the workaround
 is to insert the<a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Pro default key</a> to change version to Pro which will then activate with the 10 Pro Entitlement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread's issue seems stranger yet since it appears it is converting versions from Pro to Home during an in-place Upgrade.&nbsp; Can you confirm this is what happened?&nbsp; Was this an in-place Upgrade of Windows 8 Pro that changed during install to Home?&nbsp; Was
 there a Windows 8 Home embedded Product Key? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that inserting Pro Default key to change versions will work&nbsp; because unlike the other issue there is not yet 10 Pro Entitlement on the PC.&nbsp; This is supposed to be done by transferring the correct installed version of Windows 8 (Pro).&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop came with a Windows 8 Pro installation which has the key in the BIOS. I later upgraded to Windows 8.1 which worked as the Pro version. After that, I upgraded to Windows 10, and Pro worked. I needed to install a new hard drive, so I did a clean
 install of build 1511 of Windows 10. It never prompted me for a license key, I think because it got it from the BIOS. After it installed, I noticed it was already activated but it was on the Home version.</p>

</p><p>If you know for sure you have Pro Entitlement because you confirmed Pro version was Activated in the original Upgrade, then you can safely perform the workaround by inserting the Pro Default Product Key linked earlier, which will change versions to Pro and
 should soon thereafter activate Pro from the Entitlement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This of course doesn't explain why Home version activated if you didn't have Home Entitlement previously, unless it activated based on the actual embedded Key being read as 8 Home which Version 1511 can do directly.&nbsp; I don't know any other reason it would
 activate as Pro. if you know the original 8, 8.1 and 10 Upgrade were all activated Pro.&nbsp;

            <p>I just tried entering the default Windows 10 Pro key, but the software will not activate now. I ran "slui 4" manually to activate by telephone, and that failed, at which point it asked me if I wanted to contact Microsoft support by phone. I did. I got in
 touch with somone guy who said he'd help me and he understood the problem. He had to connect me with someone else in another department. This guy didn't seem to understand the problem and insisted that I had to reinstall Windows 8 and upgrade to Windows 10
 from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I've read over and over that you can do a clean install of Windows 10 without going through Windows 8 -- is that true? Right now my computer sits unactivated even though it should definitely have a Pro entitlement because it was on Windows 8 Pro,
 Windows 8.1 Pro and Windows 10 Pro in the past (yes, I have seen the System app myself where it says Pro.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what do I do now? If I enter the original product key will it downgrade to Home? I'd rather have an activated Home version than unactivated Pro version.</p>

    <title>How to open manually created backup files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel_h123  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open manually created backup files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So my Windows broke down 2 days ago. I don't know how nor why, but the computer wouldn't boot, and I had important files on it. I decided the best thing to do would be to use the backup function the OS provided when I booted from a memory stick, which I
 then proceeded to do. I've now got roughly 1TB in compressed files on my external hard drive that I now have no idea how to either open or even use, for that matter. The file format is completely new to me, and all of the decompression programs that I know
 of is not able to do the job. What do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Picture of the top of the folder with the archived files</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A file with <strong>000</strong> file extension is most likely an
<strong>Indexing</strong> <strong>Service Data </strong>file used to store file locations so that Windows can perform file searches. A
<strong>000</strong> file can also be a <strong>DoubleSpace Compressed</strong> <strong>
(DriveSpace)</strong> file which is a compression utility used on the old <strong>
MS-DOS</strong> OS. These file extensions are also utilized by a data format as part of the Windows CE installation. Still, a few applications append the
<strong>.000</strong> extension to a file for data backup or archive part files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The files seen on the screenshot are not compressed files, instead contain separate components of a file. Any
<strong>000</strong> files found as part of a backup set or archive, especially with other numbered extensions like
<strong>001</strong>, <strong>002,</strong> etc., are meant to be used together and combined, &nbsp;and possible uncompressed, with whatever backup software or archiving utility that created them. &nbsp;We need to get all those numbered extensions together, combine them
 with whatever did the splitting, to access the real file. For these files to work, they must be joined back together.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There are a few third party tools available which can combine these extensions. You may use your favorite search engine to search for a tool that can split files or put
<strong>.000, .001, </strong>etc., files into the original state. Install a tool that supports this, combine the files and check if you can access.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the backup created was a complete system image back up, then I would suggest you to refer this article to
 refer the section 'Restore' and check if it is helpful to you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Using Third Party Software or Link, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third
 Party Software or Link can be solved. Using Third Party Software or Link is at your own risk.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope</span> it answers.</p>

<p>I am so confused. I've tried opening the .000 file on several mounting tools, but with no success, which led me to think there was a solution to this in Windows, rather than having to download a new program entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some more context, as I was about to reinstall Windows, I was prompted to whether or not I wanted to back-up all my files, which I then did and had them saved on my external hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm feeling more and more pessimistic about being able to recover my old files. Is there absolutely no way of opening/decrypting the files without having to resort a 3rd party software? When using the Windows restore feature, the files aren't even recognized
 as shown&nbsp;<a href="https://gyazo.com/d9349b7572ac5086a09ef09d44c9b635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>Hey there rafoca. I've a bit of a weird question. Around the same time that your app stopped working, have any changes been made to the Youtube account that's tied to your Gamertag? Is it strictly a Youtube account, or is it for Gmail/Google+ as well? There
 have been a few past instances of G+ accounts being confused with Youtube accounts, or the merging of the two causing issues. If anything has changed there for you, see if you can dig into that account or unlink it from your Gamertag and let us know if that
 does anything to remove the error code from your app on Xbox One.</p>

<p>Hi. My Youtube account is linked to a Gmail Account, but not to Google+. I dont recall making any changes to my account. You need a gmail account to use Youtube these days.</p>
<p>But I can assure it is not Gamertag related, cause I have two Xbox One in my home and in one of them I cant use Youtube regardless of the gamertag logged. I mean, if I login in XBOX ONE (1) I can use Youtube with my gamertag, but if I use my gamertag on
 Xbox One (2) I can´t use Youtrube at all.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t stop downloading unknown items even after I set my connection as Metered</h2>
                    <p>I bought my windows 10 laptop a couple months ago, but recently I have been facing a problem where my laptop has been continuously downloading items which i do not know of or cannot find on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Set my connection as a Metered Connection,</p>
<p>I tried to reset my connection and set it as a Metered Connection again,</p>
<p>I tried to turn off all the background Apps,<br />
I turned off live tiles,<br />
I unchecked the "Updates From More than One Place" option as well<br />
</p>
<p>When i start up my laptop, the net works fine for 3-5 mins and then, the net speed drops to zero.<br />
I tried searching online for solutions, but all the pages tell me to simply turn on the "Metered Connection" option, which doesn't seem to solve my problem.<br />
I checked if any recent softwares have been installed, but none have been.<br />
During the process I noticed some of my apps were updated, even though I disabled automatic updates for them (Eg. Skype, where i had turned off its automatic update for months, recently updated itself on 15 Jan or so)<br />
I have run out of ideas and thought I'd just post this here.<br />
Hope you all could help me find a solution to this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 plug and play won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t charge controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 plug and play won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t charge controller</h2>
                    
<p>Hi for christmas I recieved a Black Wireless Controller (Slim Xbox one) and an official plug and play charge kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off the plug and play charge kit wouldn't charge the controller, so I thought it was faulty and got it swapped for a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new one I recieved charged the controller once and no will not charge it again. All that happens is when the xbox is turned on... or the usb is plugged into any usb port on the xbox the light flashes green, goess off and then doesn't do anything no matter
 how long its plugged in for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it ANOTHER faulty plug and play kit or what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah I can use the controller to play games with it its plugged in, and the battery still has a tiny bit of charge in it so its not completely dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe</p>

<p>Hey there Joe! I understand you're having some issues with a Play &amp; Charge kit. Please make sure that the cord is seated firmly in both the console and the controller, and that the battery is seated firmly in the controller. Also, can you test your Play
 &amp; Charge kit on a different wireless controller to see if it works there. If so, there may be an issue with the connection in the controller. Let me know if this helps, thanks!

 on for a few minutes.</p>

Get 1 of these.</a> They're fantastic... Batterys last really long and only take like 30-45 mins to fully charge. They're powerwed by USB so advise you use a PC or some sort for charging. I got these like over a year ago and still working perfectly.</p>

Rohit_Nagpal</a> for your reply! You were very helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We followed the steps you outlined, but nothing worked. I probably used the incorrect terminology (installing) when describing our problem. I apologize for the confusion. The software is installed, and the program loads, but when I try to open a folder in
 the program, a message pops up that says Neat has stopped working. So I can't access any of my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program in question is the Neat 5.4 (just upgraded to 5.5) scanner. It stopped working after we had our computer cleaned remotely via SparkTrust PC Cleaner Plus. We immediately went back to them to resolve the problem, but they directed us to Neat.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The Neat support response I received is as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>Please see the following article from Microsoft to repair the .NET component of windows.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135<br />
<br />
Neat for Windows uses a portion of your operating system, called the .NET framework. This is not a part of the Neat software, but a part of Windows that is used by some programs, particularly database programs like Neat. It appears that problems with your installation
 of .NET may be the cause of your issues with the Neat software. Since not every program uses .NET to run, it is possible that other programs on your machine are running without any problem despite an underlying issue with .NET. As part of our troubleshooting,
 we are able to perform some limited steps to repair the .NET framework, but as it is part of your computers operating system, we cannot troubleshoot beyond basic repair attempts due to potential risk to your installation of Windows, or other programs relying
 on the framework. We cannot take responsibility for the functionality of other programs after we have repaired or reinstalled the .NET framework.
<br />
If our troubleshooting fails to resolve the issue, you will need to contact Microsoft or a computer technician for further assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as we know we are able to install all windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you ask if we use version v1.2.NET framework repair tool, how do we find out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we ran the .NET framework repair tool, it said it completed. The next message was "Please&nbsp; try reinstalling the .NET framework or update that was failing." Then if the reinstallation was completed, we were told to click Finish. My question: How do we
 reinstall the .NET framework or update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional help you can give us is so appreciated. Thank you!</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>This is yet another instance to demonstrates that registry "cleaners" are snake oil. They make no difference if you're lucky (other than reporting large numbers of irrelevant errors) but cause massive problems if you're unlucky. Adding the word "Trust" to
 the product name is intended make you feel safe and secure when using the tool. The Windows registry needs neither cleaning, defragging or optimising. When a machine runs slowly then it is usually sufficient to disable or uninstall unwanted or unnecessary
 programs. If this was my machine then I would take one of the following steps, listed in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform a System Restore to set Windows back by a few days.</li><li>If no restore points are available (why not?), manually restore the registry files from their backup folder.</li><li>If this fails to resolve the issue, restore the most recent image you have. If you have no images, consider the cost of rebuilding a machine vs. keeping a few image files.<br />
</li></ul>

            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Did you try to completely uninstalled the .Net framework?<br />
2.Did you follow the method 3 from the link "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982/en-us</a>"?<br />
3.Is your computer connected to a domain environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Try booting your computer in the safe mode and check if the issue persists:</strong></p>
<p>Start your computer in safe mode <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>

<div>You need to find the XP drivers for the drive and install them if the manufacturer of the drive has made them available.&nbsp; The backup program may work on Win XP but if it is a Win 95 program you may not get it to work.&nbsp; You can try running
 in compatibility mode.</div>
