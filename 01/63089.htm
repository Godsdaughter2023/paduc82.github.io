<h2>            File type changed to Doc x.</h2>
                    I opened and saved some Office for MAC files from a friend. Somehow it has changed the file type to "DOCX" and changed the associated icon to the DOCX icon&nbsp;for&nbsp;ALL of&nbsp;my Word 2010&nbsp;documents as well. Can you tell me how to change the Type of File back to
 Microsoft Word?

<p>DOCX *is* a Microsoft Word file extension, It's been the default extension for Word files since Word 2007.</p>

===============================<br />
OK...what is the current extension? <br />
<br />
And...if .DOCX is not the current extension <br />
how do you know they are DOCX files?<br />
<br />
If you double left click one of the current<br />
files...what program opens it?<br />

<br />
File "type" is a Windows translation of the file extension.&nbsp; Somehow the "Microsoft Word Document" has been replaced with DOCX (???)

            <p>You can change the file extension by opening the file in Word and clicking File, Save As. However you then have to delete the original file in Windows Explorer if you do not want to keep it. This option is very useful if you have to send a copy of the file
 to another person who has an older version of the programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other way to change which programme opens a file with a particular file extension, is to right click the file in Windows Explorer and select Open with. You can then change the default programme to open files with that file extension.</p>

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word 2010 is the "programme" (love that British spelling stuff) :-) that opens the file. I will illustrate more with screenshots in another post.</p>

            <p>Here are two screenshots that might better explain my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see in this one, that the icon is not a Microsoft icon and the Type of File is not the typical way that Windows Explorer designates a Word 2010 file. In the next screenshot I illustrate what happens when I save the same file as a Word '97-'03 file.</p>

            <p>The icons do not change here! The file extension changes from .doc for Word 1997 to 2003 to .docx if saved as a Word 2010 file. The layout of the document changes and the file size reduces.</p>

    <title>Accessing ATT account on Windows Mail 2012 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cynthia_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing ATT account on Windows Mail 2012</h2>
                    <p>I recently signed on with ATT.&nbsp; I added my email address to Windows Mail 2012 and cannot get it to work.&nbsp; Is there anything different I need to add than a normal account for properties.&nbsp; The one area I think may be the problem are the ports.&nbsp; My entries
 for Servers are (POP3)&nbsp;inbound.att.net and outbound.att.net</p>
<p>Under Advanced Ports:&nbsp; outgoing mail (SMTP) (465);&nbsp;&nbsp; incoming mail (POP3) (995).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I feel like I'm back in the 1990s with Yahoo Mail, the ATT choice.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What happens when you try? Windows Live Mail will usually display an error message which tells you what's wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane), then compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself. Post the error messages in your reply; you can click on&nbsp;a message&nbsp;to select it, then
 use right-click to copy it and paste it into your reply. There can be no troubleshooting without seeing error messages in their entirety.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I just realized that I can send from my att.net Windows Live Mail account.&nbsp; But still cannot get new mail.&nbsp; This is the error message that I am getting on downloading&nbsp;incoming mail:</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's better, thanks. If you use port 995 for POP3, you must use a secure connection. Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. On the <em>Advanced</em> tab, select <em>This server requires a secure connection (SSL)</em>. Then close down Windows Live Mail and wait for a few minutes to ensure that the new SSL settings stick. Re-launch the program, compose a new test
 message with a unique subject and send it to yourself. Post any new error message in your reply.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; But, still having problems.&nbsp; If you can believe it I have been trying to troubleshoot this for 3 hours.&nbsp; In any case, I tried adding another account which also didn't work, with same results.&nbsp; Have since deleted it and am back to original
 problematic account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on send/receive I get the following error message:</p>
<p>Unable to send or receive messages for the Att (mssuziep) (2) account. An incorrect password was entered. The next time you send or receive messages, you'll be asked to enter your user name and password for this account.</p>
<p>Server Error: 0x800CCC90<br />

Server: 'inbound.att.net'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC92 <br />
Secure(SSL): Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, now get Box called LOG On - (mssuziep) (2).&nbsp;" Please enter user name and password for the following server: inbound.att.net." It fills in the user name "mssuziep" and the password.&nbsp; I have gone back into the properties and reentered the password to
 be sure that it is correct, then gone to the LOG ON box and reentered it.&nbsp; I've done everything multiple times.&nbsp; When I click on OK, the box keeps returning.&nbsp; When I click on CANCEL or CLOSE I get the above error message and a yellow triangle caution icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The password that I am using in creating this account is the same one that I use when I go into my ATT account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one other thought about this.&nbsp; The user name for the att.net account is the same for my original account in Windows Mail.&nbsp; Could this in some way be causing a conflict.&nbsp; The other account is working perfectly.&nbsp; BTW when I got this laptop 6 months
 ago, I created the original account myself with no problems.&nbsp; This is getting frustrating.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>That's not enough for a generic&nbsp;AT&amp;T server. You must enter the full email address. This is because there might be a john.doe at sbcglobal.com, john.doe at bellsouth.com, john.doe at att.net and so on.&nbsp;The server inbound.att.net wouldn't be able to distinguish
 between them if&nbsp;only the username part was transmitted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Want to back up custom fonts only&#126;</h2>
                    I know how to backup fonts [both system fonts &amp; custom fonts]. But is there a way to backup custom fonts only? [Choosing custom fonts inside that font folder is a pain].&nbsp;I don't want to backup system fonts too. Thanks in advance :)

            Not automatically, but you could build your own batch file or script to suit your needs.&nbsp; For example you could have a list of pre-existing fonts, and set your backup job to only copy ones that aren't on that list.

            <p>This reply is bad for many reasons, starting with the first instruction.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I sign-in as administrator? I am the OWNER. That status should give me the intrinsic power to do<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;anything I want to do to my property! More than even Microsoft can do.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Also, and pardon my &nbsp;(and 90% of the rest of the world who are non-experts) ignorance, but
<p>The second thing is Why should an owner go to each file individually? I have hundreds of thousands of files. This method is not helpful , and little bit patronizing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why should the owner of a computer have to choose 1 folder at a time to get permission to change it? The owner of a computer should have omnipotent powers, even over Microsoft, when it comes to their files and hardware.</p>
<p>Why this is an issue I am at a loss for words to explain. This is so Machiavellian and a malicious way to treat users. We shouldn't have to "ask" for permission to use our own files on our own computers.</p>
<p>BIG BROTHER is evil. Fix your system. MAKE IT MORE SIMPLE. MAKE IT BASIC. ALL COMPUTER PROGRAMS HAVE OUTPACED HOW FAST USERS CAN ADAPT TO THE CHANGES BEFORE ANOTHER COMES ALONG AND CHANGES WHAT WAS LEARNED SINCE THE LAST "CHANGE".<br />

            <p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.
</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner </strong>in full scan mode, and remove all the threats that get detected by it and see if the issue persists.
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</div>
<div><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Run the <strong>performance troubleshooter</strong> and check if the issue persists.
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Performance-troubleshooter</a></div>

            since it's a netbook with starter OS,running more number of programs at a time is not recommended.<br />
try the following procedures,<br />
# terminate unnecessary background processes.<br />
# disable unnecessary startup programs.<br />
# Increase your lap's virtual memory.<br />
# scan using an updated anti-virus.<br />
<br />
if problem still persists,then download fixes from , http://support.microsoft.com/fixit/

<h2>            I cannot print to a shared printer on our network after the host PC automatically updated their Windows 10</h2>
                    I work as a graphic designer for a screenprinting company. My coworker and I print to an Epson 1430 for our films. That printer is connected via USB to her computer, so when I print to that printer, I have to&nbsp;go to a&nbsp;shared path on the network. So really
 my printer says&nbsp;<strong>\\ARTPCWATERTOWN\Epson Artison 1430 Series </strong>(really it goes through a RIP program on her PC that is connected to that printer but right now I think that is besides the point)&nbsp; BUT now I can't print today. We both upgraded to
 Windows 10 when it first came out and she said her computer updated itself last night. She can print to the Epson but now I can't. I think it had something to do with the update because she said some things ''looked different'' on her PC. Not sure what though.

</p><p>Her computer ran a&nbsp;Windows 10 updates overnight, I think it's like an automatic thing it does?&nbsp; It was from that point on that I couldn't print to the shared printer on her computer.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I&nbsp;figured if I just tried to ''add a printer''&nbsp;to basically re-add that same printer again,&nbsp;I could&nbsp;get it to work. &nbsp;But when I tried to do that I kept getting a popup asking for me to "enter my network credentials".&nbsp; I have no idea what the password &amp;&nbsp;user
 name&nbsp;were, nothing was working.&nbsp; I ended up finding instructions online to disable that feature in the Network &amp; Sharing settings and that did the trick. (I had to turn off password protected sharing).&nbsp; I was then able to access her computer and re-add that
 printer and so&nbsp;I can print now! </div>

Again, thank you for your reply</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop Keyboard Wake Up Setting</h2>
                    <p>I would like to change the settings on my Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop keyboard so that when I hit a button on the keyboard, it does not&nbsp;wake up my computer. How would I go about changing this setting if I have Windows 10 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Press “Windows +R” key on the keyboard to open Command Prompt(Admin).<br />
b) Now type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>in the search files and programs field.<br />
c) At the device manager screen, right click on the Mice and other pointing devices.<br />
d) Select properties.<br />
e) Now you have to click on power management tab.<br />
f) Now uncheck&nbsp;"Allow this device to wake the computer". Perform the same steps for Keyboard as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hello Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That didn't work for me either. I'm having the same problem even though all devices are set to "allow this device to wake the computer". I recently upgraded from a wireless MS keyboard with usb dongle. That old keyboard had no problems waking the computer.
 I believe this is related to this MS Designer keyboard and mouse being Bluetooth. Is there a setting to allow Bluetooth devices to wake the computer? Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Photo app &#40;Picture&#41; default extensions in &#47;KindMap&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Question in title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a difficult time trying to find what the default file extensions are for the Photo App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed a problem where an installed application (Libre Office in this case) changed a number of registry KindMap entries to "Document" from "Picture" as described in another thread here.&nbsp; This caused havoc with the Photo App and I wanted to make sure
 all the Picture extensions are corrected.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

<h2>            File Access Denied</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I'm new here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been setting up my new windows 8 computer.&nbsp; Finished setting up my network OK and have been installing my apps both from disk and by download.&nbsp; Now I'm copying files from one of my other computers running XP, copied all my music files and when I started
 copying My Pictures I got the "File access denied - You need permission to perform this action - You require permission from the computer administrator to make changes to this file"&nbsp; Then it list the file name and date.&nbsp; All connected computers show up on
 the network and I can see the files on the windows 8 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set the sharing on the directory on the computer that I'm copying from to share this folder and allow making changes.&nbsp; Some of my pictures actually did transfer.&nbsp; I have traced the picture that was listed and made sure that the sub directory also
 have sharing set but nothing seems to help.&nbsp; I'm the only person running either of these units and have administrator access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the most ridiculous problem because Windows won't fix it! It appears Microsoft has decided to cut support for in hopes of driving us to 10. But it sure seem curious that suddenly Update is not functioning properly both for updating 7 and trying to
 upgrade to 10! 2.5million problems with Update is not our fault this indicates a major problem in Windows and Microsoft!</p>
<p>When is Microsoft going to fix the problem?? I do not have a "ONE DRIVE" account because I do not trust Microsoft because they cannot keep&nbsp;Update or Windows running properly! When I run the "TroubleShooter" it constant returns the following results:</p>
<p>" Windows Update error 0x80070057 (2016-02-10-T-05_23_04A)&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT FIXED </p>
<p>and Crytpographic service&nbsp;components are not registered&nbsp;NOT FIXED.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter cannot fix the problems! If I run the reset tool same result failed updates over 50% failure rate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't Microsoft address these issues and fix the problem!</p>

</p><p><span><span>The System Update Readiness Tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located at the following location:

            <p>I ran the Microsoft FixIt for Update and it could not load, reran the Update Troubleshooter and it also would not load. Booted to&nbsp;Install Disk ( Windows 7 64bit OEM ) and tried to repair the installation with the install disk, Windows said it could not repair
 this installation. Afterwards Windows would not boot except to safe mode. At this point I decided it would be better to start all over than try to figure out the problem and reformatted the SSD. I also decided there was a possibility that my disk could be
 faulty so I downloaded a copy from Microsoft and burned it to a USB drive. When attempting to boot to the New Installation it would read the USB drive Windows would start and I selected Install Windows 7.... a few more moments and I got the infamous request
 for a Driver for my USB Drive ??? Read several&nbsp;requests&nbsp;for help with the same problem here and did not see much in the way of a solution that a majority found to work. Many people reported that switching&nbsp;SATA&nbsp;from AHCI to IDE worked, when I tried that no
 drives&nbsp;were available to boot from&nbsp;when&nbsp;I got to the Boot menu, reset Bios to defaults and turned of legacy support for USB2 &amp; 3</p>
<p>and enabled UEFI USB. Rebooted and Windows&nbsp;7 started to install. Installation continued and about 3 hours&nbsp;later it finished. Finished loading drivers and MS&nbsp;Security Essentials. Then started Windows Update, after&nbsp;running 6 hours it finally returned 175 important
 and 70 optional updates ... 240 updates!!! And how many more afterwards it takes days anymore to get the computer updated and you get constant failures of the same downloads. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why isn't there an Accumulated Update download like MS did for Win 8 (the second best failure OS ever) making Windows 7 reinstalls difficult does nothing for my confidence in maybe upgrading to Win 10 because both rely on the same faulty Update System.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            How to completely remove mirror driver</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7, however, I'm having hell trying to remove HP RC Mirror Driver from my system. The mirror driver is incompatible with the upgrade so I uninstalled it via Device Manager, but I still get an error stating
 I must remove the driver. When I select the option to uninstall the driver, an error appears stating that action is only valid when the program is installed. I've searched the internet for two months and still have no solutions. Screenshots are what follows:</p>

Can you give some specs. of your system? How much RAM etc. so we can get an idea of what you have. Make it a great day!<br />

            From the software side, make sure the computer is virus/malware-free:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
From the hardware side, test the RAM. I believe that Vista has a memory tester, but I like
<a href="http://www.memtest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Memtest86+</a> . Obviously, you have to get the program from a working machine. You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. You will need third-party burning software to do this such as Roxio, Nero, or the free
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> . Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the media you made (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let the
 test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM. Since your computer is new, you would contact the laptop mftr.'s tech support for warranty repair.<br />

    <title>Unable to re-register missing Media Centre services, &#34;TV Setup has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camel_456  say:</h3>
<h2>             Unable to re-register missing Media Centre services, &#34;TV Setup has encountered a serious problem...&#34; </h2>
                    
<p>Since carrying out a clean install of Windows 7 I was having a problem with Media Centre, the program would not record any programs unless it was open, it also would not wake the computer from sleep to record any programs. I figured this must be a problem
 with the ehSched service. After playing around a bit with the service options in the Services window I decided to un-register all the Media Centre services (as detailed here: http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/81303/404215.aspx and on many other websites on
 the internet, including on the answers forums).Here are the commands I entered:</p>
<p>regsvr32 atl.dll<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehSched /unregServer<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehSched /service<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehRecvr /unregServer<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehRecvr /service<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehRec.exe /unregServer<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehRec.exe /regserver<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehmsas.exe /unregServer<br />
%windir%\ehome\ehmsas.exe /regserver</p>
<p>After I had completed those steps the services were apparently un-registered, since they disappeared from the Services window, but they failed to re-register, so now I have no Media Centre services and receive the "serious problem" error. I have tried MceRepair
 0.2 but that didn't work, and I've also tried a system restore but all the restore points I try just fail!</p>
<p>I've also tried executing a batch file with the commands but that has no effect.</p>
<p>I'm running a WinTV Nova-t-500 dual digital (UK) tuner which was working fine up until I lost the services, which leads me to believe there's nothing wrong with the tuner. I did try re-installing the driver for it but that made no difference.</p>
<p>I'm totally lost as to what to do now, I really don't want to have to re-install windows again, I just finished one re-installation after a hard drive failure! Any help or advice would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately when trying to un-install Media Centre via "add/remove windows features" I receive an error that reads "An error has occurred. Not all of the features were successfully changed" and there are no changes made. I have tried downloading and installing
 the System Update Readiness Tool to fix the problem but that had no effect. I also tried running the removal in safe mode but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>I ran the sfc /scannow scan and it said "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them." I checked the log but it's really long and I don't know what I'm looking for!</p>
After running the scan I tried to re-register the services but it didn't work.
<p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hello, camel_456</span></p>
<p><span>From what you are saying, there may be an underlying problem that needs to be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span>First check what couldn’t be repaired using the system file checker:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Start, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. Type the following
 commands in order, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>findstr
 /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt; sfcdetails.txt</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>sfcdetails.txt</span></strong></p>
<p><span>At the bottom of the file, it should list what files could not be repaired, see the following link for more information:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a></span></p>
<p><span>You can try reinstalling Media Center, but if there is an underlying problem, it may not work:<br />
Go to Start, Control Panel, Programs, Programs and Features and click Turn Windows features on or off.<br />
Under the Media category uncheck Windows Media Center, press OK and restart your computer.<br />
Next, repeat the steps and check the Windows Media Center option to reinstall it.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Sticky Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viking2121  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sticky Notes</h2>
                    <p>Well this has been an issue for me since build 1703, at least that's when I stated to use the Sticky Notes, I'm currently on Build 1809 (17763.316), Well Sticky notes will consume 100% of my CPU, causing things to freeze up and slow down, Like I was playing
 Forza Horizon 4, and tried to load into a race, and it sorta forze and when it came back it wouldn't load anything, the camera just circled the car over and over until it forze again and I force closed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I was pointing fingers at a bad update for the game, then seen my CPU temps around 70c, Indicates high CPU usage to me, open Task Manger and sure enough Sticky Notes is once again using 100% of my CPU. I had this happen playing Battlefield V, Diablo
 3 and a few other games, Even sitting at desktop tho harder to notice, it will sometimes randomly consum all of my CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this, I force close it, and open it back up, and its fine until it wants to use more CPU again. Is this ever going to be fixed? Its fully updated, I've seen another post about this from 2015, said it was solved because Microsoft knows of the issue,
 but that was years ago...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other apps like this I can use since I know microsoft won't care a lot with only a few people complaining about something that's hardly even used anyway....</p>
<p>

    <title>Surface Pro stops recognizing Surface 4 Type Cover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rahulkapoor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro stops recognizing Surface 4 Type Cover</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new Surface Pro with Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and ever since I got it the computer once in a while stops recognizing the Type Cover and I have to detach and reattach the keyboard to make the computer recognize the keyboard again. The problem
 has become a lot more frequent now (happens a few times a day). My computer has Windows 10 Pro and always has the latest updates. I primarily use it with a custom Surface Pro dock but the problem has happened even when I'm using it undocked.
</p>
<p>I have already tried cleaning the connections between the keyboard and the computer and reinstalling the Type Cover driver - neither of those have helped. Anyone have any other ideas or I need to take this back to the Microsoft store?</p>

            Taking it back to the Microsoft Store didn't help. They just reset the Windows software which created more problems but didn't fix this keyboard being dropped problem.
<span>I didn't have the issue with Surface Pro3 but ever since I got a new Surface Pro along with a new Surface Pro 4 type cover this issue has been present.
</span>The technician at the store seemed to suggest this is an endemic problem with detachables and Surface Pro line in particular, so Microsoft should do something about it ...

            I had this issue with the Pro 3, still happens every so often. I think it's to do with the contacts, give them a jiggle. After I did that the problem became much less frequent. Last time it happened to me was about a week ago. One of a fairly long list
 of issues with my surface and for me, it's not at all worth pursuing.

<p>It's not returnable but I have a 3yr business version of the Microsoft Complete warranty. They could have given me a replacement TypeCover but the store techs are probably trained to try out things like software reset before doing a more expensive hardware
 exchange. I also explicitly emailed the Microsoft Store managers to get an official response from Microsoft (something better than the tech's suggestion that I have a fake version of Windows - which is hard to believe because I got the computer new from Microsoft's
 own store in Bellevue, WA right next to Microsoft's headquarters with Windows already on it) on the issue but no response so far in 3 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contacts appear strong, just like other Surface's I have had I'm able to hang the display by the Type Cover and it doesn't fall off or detach. Also given that the issue happens intermittently when the Type cover keyboard and computer is securely docked
 in the custom dock and not moving suggests it's a software issue. Microsoft developers needs to investigate ...</p>

<p>When they "reset the Windows software" did they reimage from a USB stick or use the reset ON the Surface? Are you able to try a different typecover? Trying a different typecover would rule out an issue with the one you have.</p>

<p>They used a USB stick. The Surface diagnostic tool didn't find anything and the keyboard being dropped problem happened even after the "repairs" done by the diagnostic tool. I don't have an extra typecover to try but as I mentioned I doubt it's the Surface
 Pro 4 keyboard contacts issue as I can hang my Surface upside down using the type cover and then go back to using the type cover keyboard without a problem. Recently I have noticed that I don't need to undock, detach and reattach the keyboard to have it recognized,
 I can just undock and dock my Surface and the keyboard starts working again. Earlier I did see the keyboard issue even when the Surface wasn't docked so can't say it's a docking station problem but perhaps updating the docking station driver may help. Unfortunately
 I only found driver updates for the brick style docking station (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock) not the custom one Microsoft created earlier (and promised to support for newer Surfaces). Windows Update says
 everything is uptodate and the docking station doesn't appear as a device by itself in the device manager so I can't use that to check for updates (I can see "Microsoft docking station audio device" listed in devices and for that the best driver is already
 installed).&nbsp;</p>

            <div>I don't have a dock, but this is NOT an issue I see here at all with my 2017</div>
<div>Surface Pro. It isn't totally clear that you have a Surface Pro 2017 as opposed</div>
<div>to a Surface Pro 4. But either way, if it were me, I'd go back to the Store, ask</div>
<div>for the manager and ask for an exchange under the 3 year warranty that you</div>
<div>mentioned. You would be able to inspect the refurb that they supply and test it</div>
<div>before you leave the store (and I'd try to talk them into a NEW vs REFURB</div>
<div>replacement). </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is very unlikely that it is an issue with the typecover and more likely it is</div>
<div>an issue with the Surface. And if a wipe and reset didn't fix it, exchange is</div>
<div>the next option.</div>

            As I mentioned the computer is the latest Surface Pro model - the one for which Microsoft dropped the numbering, not Surface Pro 4. The typecover is the one from Surface Pro 4 but was new along with the computer. This problem cannot be tested in the store
 with a replacement as it's intermittent.&nbsp;

            <div>Yes, intermittent issues are the toughest.. but as I said in the other thread</div>
<div>you started, Microsoft does not officially support using the old SP3 slide in</div>
<div>dock with the newest 2017 Surface Pro, so it would be worth it, as a test, to</div>
<div>run undocked for a few days and see what happens. I know you said it happened</div>
<div>undocked, but it would be good to know the frequency both docked and undocked. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't see this at all here with a SP2017 and the newest typecover FWIW.</div>

<div>&gt;This problem cannot be tested in the store with a replacement as it's intermittent.&nbsp; </div>

<h2>            Venting My Frustrations with Xbox One and Halo&#58; MCC</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I apologize if this is not the correct forum to vent. I read the rules and didn't see anything in particular forbidding this kind of post.</p>
<p>I bought an Xbox One on Sunday for the primary purpose of playing Halo: MCC. I went with the bundle that includes AC: Black Flag and AC: Unity. Once I got everything hooked up and online, I digital pre-ordered Halo: MCC.</p>
<p>My first frustration comes from the fact that I've yet to be able to play a game. It took the better part of 3 days for all the digital download games to complete. Now granted, AC: Unity and Halo: MCC were pre-orders that would not have been playable even
 if the entire download was complete. But AC: Black Flag is not. I found the download speed to be lacking, and way slower than what is typical for my internet connection. At a certain point in the download, I got a message saying that AC: Black Flag was ready
 to play, even though the download had not completed. Although I was able to get to the main menu screen, I was not able to start a campaign. After searching online, I found plenty of forum posts with the anecdote "yeah, games say that they're ready to play,
 but really, you've got to wait until the whole thing is downloaded. Only way I was able to fix it was to uninstall the game and re-download it". Having to wait so long for these games to be playable and being jerked around as to if an when they were actually
 ready led to aneurism-enducing levels of frustration.</p>
<p>Moving on to Halo:MCC... The slow download speeds persisted, and even though I had set storage to remain on, even when the console is shut down, and having started my downloading on Sunday, as of midnight last night, Halo: MCC was STILL DOWNLOADING. Whatever.
 This morning, it was complete. So I hop on to try to get a multiplayer match under my belt before heading to work. And yet, nothing. Every matchmaking lobby for every multiplayer playlist...nothing. I'd sit for 5-10 minutes at a time, and no other players
 would join. According to the network settings, it appears that Xbox Live had some multiplayer issues. GREAT.</p>
<p>So as it stands currently, I've spent about $600 for a new game system (that's UI looks awful and is totally disorganized...although that may be my fear of change mixing with my frustration) that I've had for 3 days now and haven't had a chance to play a
 single game. At this point, I'm seriously considering returning the thing if it doesn't start working and at least meeting my expectations. My fear is that once I do get into the meat of Halo:MCC, it'll be fairly underwhelming.</p>
<p>So yeah, end rant. Am I the only one in this position? Am I just over-reacting? Is there something great about all this that I'm missing?</p>

<p>I wasn't used to the new changes either but they do grown on you as you use them every day. Regarding the MCC the servers are experiencing problems right now and they are working to resolve the problem so it's not just you. Just hang in there.

<p>Regarding the download speeds bigger files are going to take a little bit longer to download now especially with the update that Halo received to play. some games just take longer than others depending on the size of the download. Halo took a long time for
 me too and I'm 105 down and 12 up.</p>

<p>weird mine downloaded in 45mins when I preordered a couple of weeks ago, then automatically downloaded the update.
</p>
<p>I would double check your settings (what speed connection do you have ?)</p>
<p>I love the layout and with the new background images makes it look even better (I am in preview program) reminds me of windows 8 and windows for mobiles, so they all tie in nicely. I believe we will be able to change alpha options on tiles at some point
 too.</p>
<p>Not tried matchmaking yet, but I have read some similar posts this morning so will be trying tonight. I guess if Live has had some issues it could be that but my region is not showing any issues.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with venting, it's just harder for us guys to help :)</p>

            <p>the download speeds will vary from user to user. &nbsp;i had a similar situation though at launch when i had all the launch games queued up. &nbsp;it was crazy. &nbsp;none of the games download as fast as i'd like and some even slower. &nbsp;</p>
<p>but that's why i love remote downloading. &nbsp;i queue the games up when i'm at work or somewhere else and that way i don't have to even worry about it when i get home. some of them are still downloading when i get home because let's face it .. they're huge now. &nbsp;Halo MCC is over 60GB alone!</p>
<p>these games are big. &nbsp;i can generally download a 15-20 GB game in a reasonable amount of time under an hour .. but above that it's a toss up.</p>

<p>All these 'issues' you raise could've been researched beforehand though matey and might have meant you had a little more realistic expectations?</p>
<p>I hope your situation improves though as i would be *** too if i'd bought it and was unable to play anything!</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I tried to DL the MCC and it was taking too long. Come to find out my NAT magically changed from open to moderate. So I unistalled what little had DL'ed and did a system reset . I then made sure my NAT was open and started the DL of MCC
 again and it worked perfectly over night. I don't even have very fast internet. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I appreciate the thoughtful responses (and have ignored the ones that are less so). I've definitely troubleshooter to confirm NAT and general network settings, and everything's on the up and up. And yes, my internet is plenty fast (is that the "whose is
 bigger" for the Internet age? :-) ).</p>
<p>Like I said, this is me venting. I don't think I should have to adjust my expectations. I'm the consumer, I just dropped $600 to have a great experience, and I haven't had that because MS was woefully unprepared for what it knew was going to be a huge launch
 day.</p>
<p>But yes, lesson learned. I'll now wait for other people to purchase games and work out the bugs before I buy...if I but at all. That's a pretty poor way to perceive the Xbox brand.</p>

<p>The Xbox One is far from perfect. The UI is clunky and the OS is buggy and glitchy. It will freeze on you often. Sorry, but you should have spent that money on a PS4. It's got a better and prettier UI and it will never go down on you. And the download speeds
 on PS4 are faster as well. See if you can get a refund. </p>

    <title>Minecraft, Mojang and Mirosoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft, Mojang and Mirosoft</h2>
                    <p>Soooooooo......</p>
<p>Well, it's now common knowledge about Mojang being bought by Microsoft and I would like to ask some questions add my 2 cents to this discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minecraft became popular as it provided players with freedom. Freedom to play how they wanted, without pre-set goals. This is the one and only reason minecraft has flourished the way it has.<br />
The problem is, players are concerned about minecraft in the hands of you guys, because they are uncertain of how you will run it. Personally, I would like some insight on some main points. Here are my questions, in no particular order:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will you allow players to continue to host their own servers?</strong></p>
<p>The main reason most people play is because of the original content found on servers. Any player can create them and can host them from their own computer or a paid host. Mojang has attempted to provide competition to these servers by creating the Realms
 feature, but it was an utter failure due to the popularity of these servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will you create an easy to use server modding program to replace Bukkit?</strong></p>
<p>Mojang recently came into possession of the server mod called Bukkit. This allowed players to create modifications for their servers called plugins. These plugins allowed unique features to be added, such as changing what items did, but without having to
 download any install files to use them. As of Mojang taking over Bukkit, many of the Plugin Creators quit. The reason bukkit became popular is because it was open source project. There are other server modding programs, but will you provide an open source
 program to create these mods?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do you plan to change the EULA to allow servers to sell perks and abilities?</strong></p>
<p>A recent point of anger to the minecraft community was the anger due to Mojang enforcing it's EULA (<strong>E</strong>nd
<strong>U</strong>ser <strong>L</strong>icense <strong>A</strong>greement). Servers used to pay for hosting due to "Donations". These were effectively the owners selling perks and items to players which allowed them increased convenience or an advantage over
 other players. The EULA was enforced and now only allows servers to sell cosmetic perks, which has lead to a severe drop in donations and has forced many servers to shut down. If you were to provide a hosting service this could work to your advantage.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will you allow players to continue to create modifications (or mods)?</strong></p>
<p>Many players play minecraft using modifications, which are game files that can be installed to add new features and textures. These mods allow players to choose what they would like to add to minecraft, without it being official.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will you advertise on the Minecraft launcher?</strong></p>
<p>Now, I'd imagine this isn't the case as Minecraft is already a paid game, but a definite answer would be good.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do you plan to add more ingame items?</strong></p>
<p>The minecraft community are not always fans of minecraft updates. Sometimes these updates add useless features, such as Mojang's Sea Lantern, which was a re-textured Glowstone with a different crafting recipe. Successful updates have included features that
 have had significant game mechanics added. Such as enchanting, command blocks, pistons and anvils. Also, items which do not fit minecraft's theme, such as robots or guns will not be accepted by the community.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purchase of Mojang was only announced&nbsp;a few&nbsp;days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minecraft to join Microsoft:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It will take some time before the details of the acquisition is finalized and Microsoft assumes control of the company.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I haven't tried it for myself though, so I can't confirm based on my own experience.

<p>
</p><p>Another option would be to stream your media to the Xbox One with an app, like

    <title>Windows Update Error 80244019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarsarcasm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error 80244019</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>Since this afternoon I started getting this error on Windows Update. I was checking my history of updates and noticed that the update for Windows 10 failed 8 times so I thought that maybe there was a problem with my Windows Update. So I ran the Windows Update
 Diagnostic Program to correct any possible problems and &nbsp;after that I started getting the&nbsp;80244019 Error.
</p>
<p>Thinking the program messed up my settings I restaured my system to 3 days ago. Windows update worked and found some updates on which I updated and then after those the error appeared again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already read everything on this error. And I already scanned my laptop for viruses and It was clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do? I'd really appreciate some help.</p>

            <p>I have been having the same problem the last few days . The first fix on this page worked for me, unchecking the "get updates for other microsoft products." My Windows 10 download started as soon as I did that and went back to check for new udpates again.</p>

            <p>Similar problem here. Windows Update was not downloading win10 installation files so i tried your trick of unchecking the "Get updates for other microsoft products", bot since mine already was unchecked i checked it and then later unchecked it, and by the
 laws of magic it worked, sort of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It told me win10 was successfully downloaded but when i try to "upgrade" it is no longer there and the same problem keeps repeating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Error(s) found:</p>
<p>Code 80244019"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have also tried repairing corrupt files. No luck.</p>
