<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker - How to save a file to your computer at less than 25 mb.</h2>
                    I make short video clips for animal rescue and post them to petfinder.&nbsp; I used another version of Windows Live Movie Maker that worked just fine.&nbsp; Now the format is different and I can't save my videos the same.&nbsp; They are MUCH larger and I can't control
 the size.&nbsp; I don't know how to change it.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 on a Sony laptop.&nbsp; I had a Windows 7 on a different laptop and it's DIFFERENT! :)&nbsp; Now when I save my files I can choose to save them to Facebook like before, but also to a list for Recommended,
 Common, and Mobile Devices.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance if anyone can help me.<br />

            <p>If you go to the <strong>File</strong> menu (Alt+F) and choose <strong>Save movie</strong>, you have a large choice of output settings.&nbsp; For a limited size of 25MB, I would choose
<strong>For email</strong>.&nbsp; Note, for any of the settings, you can get an estimate of file size by hovering over the output selection.&nbsp; For example, email says something like 11MB per minute of video, so you should be able to fit about 2m 15s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need to change those settings, you can go to the last option of <strong>
Create custom setting...&nbsp; </strong>You can lower the height, width, bitrate and frame rate as well as the audio bitrate to get the estimated size you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just remember that video takes a lot of space so it might not always be able to get your clips under 25MB in the quality you want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t restore documents to original location.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'am experiencing difficulties with both my desktop and laptop windows 8.1 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tought it would be a great idea to put the my documents and all the other document files in skydrive, so i would have acces to every thing on both computers. This worked fine unit very recently. I keep on losing files and some games won't work anymore.
 I want to change it back to the original location, but that won't work.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to fix this. It says at the end that it can't change the location of the folder, because there is a folder on that location with the same name as the folder i'am trying to move. But when i go to that location there is no folder with that
 name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that can help me? I get all sorts of strange errors on my laptop and i'am losing files. Now i use a memory stick to ensure that every file is save but i really want to be able to use my hard drive again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With kind regards,</p>

            This can be repaired manually in the registry, but it's fairly advanced.&nbsp; If it hasn't been too long, I would recommend using System Restore instead to roll back to before the changes were made.&nbsp; The rollback only restores system registry settings -- it
 won't lose any of your files.

<p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
I am using ThinkPad T510 noyebook with Windows 10 Education version 64 bit. Recently I had a problem showing a notification "scan for drive errors" and I tried to repair the drive errors automatically, but after the notebook restarted, it failed to perform
 an automatic repair and windows could not be loaded showing a message as "there are some errors, windows can not started...." in a blue screen. I reinstalled the windows 10 but the installation process was too slow. After installing win10, I kept using it
 but after a while the notebook automatically restarted, and again it said that windows can not be started because of some errors. I tried installing win7, but the same thing happened again. I am not sure, but I guess it is a problem with my hard drive. Also
 I like to mention that, in the earlier time when I bought the notebook, I installed windows several times and the installation times were not too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Could anyone please give me a suggestion about how to solve this problem. I have bunch of things to do, but I can't because of this problem. Please help me to come out of this trouble.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi Ifte.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd run drive diagnostics to know for certain the condition of the hard drive:  
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is bootable Seatools.
<br />
<br />If the drive is failing,  I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the drive tests OK, I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your reply although I could not try most of the solutions you suggested me. If I buy a new 1 TB 2.5" 5400 rpm hard drive (https://www.amazon.com/T510-4384-T510-4484-T510-4873-T510i-4313-T510i-4314/dp/B00FPZUP64), and fix it to my notebook,
 will it be a good solution? I don't really wanna bother with the trial and error type troubleshooting methods as I need to fix it asap. My notebook configurations are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo Thinkpad T510 15.6"</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">NVIDIA NVS 3100M dedicated graphics with 512MB DDR3</span></p>
<p>RAM: 4 GB DDR3</p>
<p>320 GB HDD 5400 rpm</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Education 64 bit (original provided by my working institution)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I tried by replacing hard drive from another notebook (Thinkpad E560), but the OS in that hard drive could not be loaded. I was thinking that if I could check by another hard drive from another good notebook, probably I can realize whether the problem
 is with my hard drive or with another component. After that I installed my own hard drive again, and the notebook was not finding any hard drive saying that windows can not be loaded because there might be a faulty hard drive or problem in any removable disk.
 I do not know what to do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me if I buy another hard drive like I mentioned in the above link, will it be a good solution? Also the hard drive for purchase is of 1 TB, so will there be any problem if I install more capacity hard drive instead of 320 GB? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<h2>            SQL Server Management Studio look and feel</h2>
                    <p>I have both SSMS 2012 and SSMS&nbsp;2017. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2012 has quite a nice looking interface with nicely coloured icons, clear fonts and ribbons and generally looks sharp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2017 by comparison looks monochrome (almost), grainy and washed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I missed something or is there a "Please look like 2012" option in 2017. &nbsp; I haven't seen lots of complaints in the forums so am guessing I've done something weird. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

    <title>Being forced to change my password every few weeks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldsskier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Being forced to change my password every few weeks</h2>
                    <p>There are two machines running Windows 8.1, one in the office and one at home. &nbsp;User can turn them on/off, log in and out of Windows without any difficulty whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every 2-3 weeks one of those urgent message flags appears in the system tray and asks that the current password be re-entered. &nbsp;This is showing up far too often and is a nuisance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the biggest problem is that when the user tries to log into onedrive.com (or any of the other web services) we get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>Sign-in is blocked</div>
</div>
<div>Sign-in with <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> is blocked for one of these reasons:</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Someone entered the wrong password too many times.</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>User is then forced to reset the password and is prohibited from using any password ever used previously which makes it impossible for them to use a password that they can actually remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I want to see a log showing WHAT tried to log in too many times and from where. &nbsp;I am convinced that Windows itself is screwing something up rather than some malicious hacker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. We need a way to unlock these accounts without resetting the password. &nbsp;We have the two factor authentication app, that should be good enough. &nbsp;Clearly the passwords aren't completely unlocked or the user wouldn't be able to log into Windows in the morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The password retention policy needs to be dialed back - not reusing the previous three passwords is reasonable, never allowing any password to be reused ever again is not.</p>

    <title>Testing out System Recovery with Bitlocker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessica hossfeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Testing out System Recovery with Bitlocker</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was originally told that with Bitlocker, unlike other third party encryptions, you can still restore from a recovery point. However, I created a recovery point while logged into the OS and tried to restore it while logged into the OS. The system then rebooted,
 attempted the restore, then failed. I then tried booting into system restore, entered my recovery key and was told that I had no recovery points, I'm guessing because I created recovery points while the drive was still encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>1. Do I have to decrypt the drive everytime I want to create a recoverable restore point?</p>
<p>2. If no, how do I create a recoverable restore point?</p>
<p>3. If yes, what is the most efficient way to decrypt first and does that also mean I always have to boot into system restore with my recovery key to go back to the restore point?</p>
                </div>

    <title>Surface Book - Battery life calculating 9&#47;March&#47;2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book - Battery life calculating 9&#47;March&#47;2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery life on my Surface Book often reads 'calculating...' and does not come up with a percentage. Other times it will say my battery life is on, for example, 70% but it will say it only has 2 hours of battery life remaining. When I click the 'battery
 icon' and click the icon for 'battery saver' a couple times; the hours will slowly work their way up to 7 hours, 8 hr, 9 hr, 7 hr, 5 hr with no consistency at all. It changes almost every time you click on the 'battery saver' icon and gives inconsistent battery
 percentages. Is there a way to fix this or is there going to be an update from Microsoft for this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Paul</p>

    <title>Wi-Fi option gone after Windows 10 Update VPN isn&#39;t the problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saraeftekhari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-Fi option gone after Windows 10 Update VPN isn&#39;t the problem</h2>
                    <p>After activating windows 7 on the day I got a laptop, I connected with wireless. Everything worked and was dandy. That is until I upgraded to Windows 10. Suddenly, the Wi-Fi doesn't work. I try settings, but there is NO Wi-Fi OPTION!!! I attempted the VPN
 solution via Command Prompt (Admin), but it only said dni_dne wasn't installed. I gathered from this that problem wasn't with VPN as I didn't even seem to possess it.</p>
<p>I searched and searched for hours, but to no avail. Switching firewall off didn't work. Rebooting didn't work. Nothing worked. Oh Ethernet connection worked dandy. But a cable is annoying. Wi-Fi is necessary.</p>
<p>As for a last attempt try at solving this annoying issue, I am reaching out to you guys to help me. PLEASE REPLY SOON! I am desperate. It has got to the point that either I somehow fix the Wi-Fi or the laptop has to be sent back.</p>

<p>

            <p>First of all, thank you so much for this clear step by step reply. But unfortunately neither methods worked for me:</p>
<p>1) The troubleshooter isn't picking anything up.</p>
<p>2) I found no Wi-Fi network driver on Device management. Only Intel(R) Wi-Fi link 5300 AGN (which I tried to update to see if it helped, but it was already fully updated).</p>
<p>I have referred back to the link you gave me, but the settings as I have said before, I don't have a Wi-Fi option at all where it should be. As for aeroplane mode, it is off. The troubleshooter didn't work.&nbsp; The physical switch for Wi-Fi is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am dumbfounded at this. If I don't have a Wi-Fi option, then what could possibly be causing that?

<p>First of all, thank you so much for this clear step by step reply. But unfortunately neither methods worked for me:</p>
<p>1) The troubleshooter isn't picking anything up.</p>
<p>2) I found no Wi-Fi network driver on Device management. Only Intel(R) Wi-Fi link 5300 AGN (which I tried to update to see if it helped, but it was already fully updated).</p>
<p>I have referred back to the link you gave me, but the settings as I have said before, I don't have a Wi-Fi option at all where it should be. As for aeroplane mode, it is off. The troubleshooter didn't work.&nbsp; The physical switch for Wi-Fi is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am dumbfounded at this. If I don't have a Wi-Fi option, then what could possibly be causing that?

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I happily write to inform other unfortunates out there that a simple reset fixed the problem. Don't worry, there is an option where you get to keep your files (photos, documents etc.) However, Skype and such that have been installed will be deleted. But,
 in the new reset desktop, there is a file that lists what products have been deleted (it is not long, rest ashore those easily bored such as me). Overall, this helps fix any sort of lag including not being able to use 'Ask me anything' bar.</p>
<p>Hope this will help others!</p>

    <title>Kinect detection issues on floor exercises&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Kinect detection issues on floor exercises&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently moved and had to redo where my Xbox is setup for my fitness routine. &nbsp;It is having a heck of a time detecting me on the floor movements now and is killing my score! :(</p>
<p>I have a black fitness matt and dark brown hardwood floors. &nbsp;Not sure if it's that combination. &nbsp;My last place had light colored carpets with my black workout matt.</p>
<p>I reset the green floor before every workout and calibrate the kinect so it's setup properly.</p>
<p>Any tips on getting the floor exercises better detected? &nbsp;I asked the Microsoft support people and they only double checked the kinect setup which is working fine. &nbsp;I sent an email to the app developers (<a href="http://www.sumo-digital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sumo-digital.com/#</a>)
 and haven't heard back yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any tips or tricks would be appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Photo import dialog box missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardmartin358  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo import dialog box missing</h2>
                    It's 7 months since this issue was brought up and I see there is no solution yet as to be able to name the file and location as we were able to in Win7. I had removed win10 back then for this exact reason. Photos are a big part of my job and the MAJOR
 inconvenience of importing them in Win10 was the deal breaker. Now today I was forced by Microsoft to upgrade to Win10 again. (popup window with a 1 hour countdown stating the upgrade was going to happen whether I liked it or not. Not cool MS!) So what has
 been done to bring the import dialog box from Win7 back?

<h3> chrise931  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics driver from Microsoft not working v19.2.4.10</h2>
                    I run a small computer repair shop and we have had this customer's computer in our shop for testing after it was sent to HP for repairs on the touchpad. &nbsp;HP could not find an issue with the shipped driver version 19.0.12.95, and Synaptics' release on their
 website currently 19.0.19.1 both work, but Microsoft wants to replace the driver with version 19.2.4.10 which renders the entire touchpad inoperable. &nbsp; I am able to uninstall the Synaptics software, roll back the driver, but during the process of Windows Updates,
 the driver gets updated to the one that isn't working. &nbsp;Is this currently a known issue or being looked into? &nbsp;Product number: P3X73UA#ABA &nbsp; &nbsp;Model: HP&nbsp;15-ac134ds. &nbsp;The computer was sent it to HP under warranty to fix this, and the computer came back with
 a new motherboard, DC jack and a new palmrest assembly. Again, the shipped version from HP works fine, the problem is when Microsoft does windows updates.&nbsp;

<h2>            How can I stop folders from animated unfold</h2>
                    Every program, every file, every folder I open is an animated little "unfold" move.&nbsp; I really don't like it.&nbsp; I want to click on a folder and it open with no fanfare.<br />
<br />
I cannot find the option to change this.&nbsp; I did go to control panel, and folder options, but it does not give me the option to choose how my folders open.&nbsp;

Does anyone know how to get rid of this problem?<br />

            <p>Hi JagadeeswaranT,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem occurs because the Windows 7 device drivers don’t support running all of the DOS video modes. You might be able to work around this problem by installing the Windows
 XP version of the video drivers for your video adapter or running the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Start</b> button and then click
<b>Control Panel</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click
<b>Troubleshooting</b>. Under <b>Programs</b>, click <b>
Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer the following article for more information:</p>

 device in to new laptop.....but I cannot even get it to copy. When I right click, nothing happens and I cannot highlight the file either! I'm running on Windows 10 for both laptops. Can anyone recommend anything? TIA</p>

            Hi Lisa1471 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with transferring fonts from one computer to another.
<br />
<br />To do this:
<br />1.  Open Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\Windows\Fonts, 
<br />2.  Copy the font files you want from the Fonts folder to a network drive or a thumb drive
<br />3.  On the second computer, drag the font files to the Fonts folder
<br />4.  Windows will automatically install them
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.       
        </p>

<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I looked on many forums, and they said to go to disk clean up, but when I do that windows.old does not show up.</p>
<p>But is clearly in my folder, because I can go to and drag stuff out of it and put it in my new stuff.</p>
<p>Also, is this effecting my windows activation?</p>
<p>I just bought a computer, and got some new hardware, and when I try to activate windows again, it does not activate. I have the key on the side of my comp toi.</p>

            I disk clean up it will show as previous Windows installation files but you must&nbsp;select "Clean up system files&nbsp;to see it".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It does not effect activation.<br />
<br />
Normally, it can just be deleted but some people have had to take ownership of the folder first. I have never had to do that.

<h2>            How to image&#47;clone a hard drive</h2>
                    I have one question regarding Imaging / cloning a hard drive.<br />
I have a Windows 7 PRO 32bit system. I would like to install Windows 7 PRO 64bit.
<br />
How can do this without loosing all the software that are installed on my pc? I don't have the cds to re-install the softwares.<br />
Will this work?<br />
If I create an image of my hard drive with the 32bit operating system on a external drive.<br />
Than install Windows 7 pro 64bit on a new fresh hard drive.<br />
Than copy the image that was saved on the external hard drive to the new drive with the 64bit operating system?

            <p>Sorry, that idea won't work.&nbsp; You'll have to reinstall the software using original installation media and any necessary license keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR, possibly, use Laplink's PC Mover Professional, which claims to be able to migrate programs as well as data.&nbsp;

            <p>&nbsp;I know that Seagate has a free program downloadable from their website, 'DiscWizard' that will clone a hard drive. But, at least, one HD MUST be a Seagate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It also has features to transfer data and partition drives. But the only rule is that the/one HD is a Seagate. If no Seagate HD is present the program will not run at all.</p>

            <p>Hi,if you want to clone the hard drive in windows,you can download clone tool ,like as gparted,driveimage XML,and MniTool partition wizard</p>
<p>There are detail steps of <a href="https://www.partitionwizard.com/clone-disk/clone-hard-drive-windows7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to clone the hard drive in windows.</a></p>
<p>First,you should download clone tool &nbsp;and <span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">
&nbsp;launch it</span>,like as MiniTool partition wizard</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">Step 1. Choose the hard drive you want to clone, and Select "</span><strong>Copy
 Disk Wizard</strong><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">Step 2. Then you will be lead to the welcome page. Click "</span><em>Next</em><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">"
 to continue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">Step 3. Here choose the source disk to copy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">Step 4. Then choose to clone to a hard drive in Windows 7.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">Step 6. Here is a new page telling you how to boot from the destination disk. This is useful if you are going to boot Windows
 7 from the destination disk. Click "</span><em>Finish</em><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">"
 to go back to the main interface.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">Step 7. Click "</span><em>Apply</em><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">"

            <p>Okay, I probably deserved that kind of a statement, So let me understand that although this is suppose to be a forum to answer windows questions and issues, and you are suppose to have a group of individuals that are suppose to keep up on things, you'd rather
 pass the buck onto someone else? Okay, I can deal with that, why not just simply say, I DON'T KNOW!</p>
<p>If a more educated community can't answer my question, and Microsoft dosen't want to, then pass it on to HP? Give me a break, what makes you think HP wants anything to do with it.</p>
<p>I'm done, computer is in the trash, I'm not even going to return the darn thing..</p>
<p>Thanks anyway for the comments... </p>

Well I do know however I can't just pour that information into your learning cup. So I suggested<br />
sites where you can get high quality prepared information which will help with the learning
<br />
curve. You asked what to you seems to be a simple question however since you can't just make<br />
Windows 8 look like Windows 7 there is no immediate simple answer.<br />
<br />
HP made the computer you bought. As OEM they are responsible for both the proper operation<br />
of the hardware and Windows. Therefore they have a lot of reasons to want to help you make<br />
a successful transition to using Windows 8 both effectively and efficiently. So they also will have<br />
detailed "How-To" and other help available. Their forums can be an excellent resource as there<br />
will be others using the same exact model you have.<br />
<br />
The other information I provided above shows how to access Help on the computer and more<br />
information from the web.<br />
<br />
We will definitely try to help with any issues you have however not all easy questions have easy<br />
answers.<br />

<p>Here is one of sites which describes how to make Win8 to look as Win7.</p>

<p>I think you are like me when I start using Win8. I needed a pack of cigarettes not to get crazy but when I set my tiles and applications the work and fun is better than on earlier Win versions.</p>

            <p>AK_666 is right. I like Metro UI but there should be a choice for Classic Start or Modern Start. However, I believe it did not happen because nobody would take time to learn new things. Modern UI wouldn't be so famous then.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There is no Start Button or Start Menu in Windows 8.<br />
<br />
Where is the Start menu?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-start-menu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-start-menu</a></p>

<br />
Windows 8 does not have the Classic look available.<br />
<br />
3rd party programs can&nbsp;help :<br />
<br />
StarDock - Start8 - is $4.99 US<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
From the Start Screen - Right Click then on lower right - All Apps <br />
<br />
In the Windows Store there is a free program called "Windows 8 Cheat Keys" which is a&nbsp;good<br />
tutorial especially for those without a&nbsp;Touch Screen. It would be&nbsp;even better if it were inteactive<br />
so that clicking on a "Hotkey" description would also perform that function. <br />
<br />
I keep a&nbsp;text file of Windows 8 Hotkeys on the Desktop which is handy. Too bad&nbsp;that is also not<br />
interactive. It is 8-Keys and is accessible on my SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
My SkyDrive<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=9ac481c015daee85&amp;sc=documents&amp;id=9AC481C015DAEE85%21125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=9ac481c015daee85&amp;sc=documents&amp;id=9AC481C015DAEE85%21125</a><br />
<br />
Sure which some enterprising programmer would create a combination of "Windows&nbsp;8 Cheat Keys"<br />
and 8-keys so the actions would run from&nbsp;both the Start Screen as an App and from the&nbsp;DeskTop as a<br />
an Application.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <span>Ok, so you bought a new laptop or desktop and the dopey salesman told you you're out of luck and have to get Windows 8 since thats all microsoft is shipping. Well, its not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
You can take it out of the box, set it up and<span> live with it. Some people (not very many from what I'm reading) like the new Windows 8 interface but most do not. Or, you can make a few FREE modifications that I have tested and can tell you work very well.<br />
<br />
1. Setting up windows 8 out of the box: You do NOT need to provide or setup a hotmail, livemail or any other microsoft account when setting up the machine. Read very carefully during installation and it will offer you the chance to "continue without setting
 up" any email whatsoever. It will warn you that syncing will not be as seamless if you continue but this is a lie and you can add any email account you choose later.<br />
<br />
2. Suppressing the metro interface: The first thing to is download Classic Shell <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/</a> This is must to getting the look and feel of Windows 7 or even XP back while utilizing the new beneficial features of Windows 8. Download it, install it, and it will ask you what style of start bar you want and you're
 good to go. Classic Shell will somewhat suppress the metro interface and boot directly to desktop. It will also put the start bar back (in the shape of a sea shell - classy!)<br />
<br />
3. Adding gadgets: If you liked the Windows Vista and 7 Gadgets, you can get 'em back in short order from 8Gadgetpack
<a href="http://8gadgetpack.bplaced.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://8gadgetpack.bplaced.net/</a> This will offer you to put all the gadgets like weather, clock and calendar back and you won't have to call up the charm bar to see any of that, it will be right there
 on your desktop. It loads on startup and will stay there just like in Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
4. GEEK ALERT: Disabling the charm and switcher bar will require a simple (but scary) registry edit: Here's what to do you closeted-geeks:<br />
<br />
Open the Run box by hitting Win+R, and then launch the Registry Editor by typing regedit into the box and hitting enter. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WindowsCurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell, right-click in the right-hand pane and create a new
 key called EdgeUI. Select the key and in the right-hand pane create a new DWORD and call it DisableCharmsHint. Right-click the DWORD and select Modify. Change the Value Data to 1. This will stop the Charms bar appearing when you move your mouse to the top
 or bottom right-hand corners. Note, create a DWORD 32 even though windows 8 will most likely be in 64-bit.<br />
<br />
Now,<br />
<br />
Keeping that same key open, create a second new key and call it: DisableTLcorner Right-click it, after creation, modify its value to 1 as well and close the registry editor.
<br />
<br />
Congratulations! You've just disabled the Charm Bar and Switcher in one fell swoop! But you didn't remove them entirely and thats ok, because they do actually have some value and you may want to call them from time to time. You can now do this by moving you
 mouse to the absolute top right or left corner of the screen and they will appear.<br />
<br />
Confused about this: See this excellent tutorial on modifying the registry for this procedure:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F127645%2Fhow-to-disable-the-charms-bar-and-switcher-hot-corners-in-windows-8%2F&amp;h=hAQEN-E53&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/127645/how-to-disable-the-charms-bar-and-switcher-hot-corners-in-windows-8/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
5. Remove the lock screen: This is a screen which covers over your desktop or metro screen when not in use. You may or may not want to keep this. If you don't need to password protect your machine and don't want to have this feature active, you can turn it
 off and keep it inactive until you do want it. I would not recommend disabling this, just turning it off.<br />
a. Type netplwiz in the Windows 8 start screen.<br />
b. Choose your user account.<br />
c. Uncheck the option: "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer"<br />
d. Enter your password (if you have one assigned) <br />
e. Restart your Windows 8 computer. <br />
<br />
6. Removing annoying apps from the metro screen which interfere with the desktop: If you don't wish to have a metro app creep up on you while enjoying your new windows 8 desktop, simply, call up the charm bar (by going to the very top right-hand corner of the
 screen now), then clicking on the Start app that appears once the bar opens. This will take you back to metro. Find the app that is offending you and right click on it. A bar will appear across the bottom of the screen which will offer you the chance to uninstall
 it. Do so, and it is gone forever and will annoy you no more. Press Ctrl and Esc to get out of metro and back to the desktop.<br />
<br />
Do all these things (which should take no more than a 1/2 hour) an you too, will have a windows 8 desktop that looks and feels just like Windows 7, Vista or XP depending on how you modified classic shell.<br />
<br />
Thats it, just my take on the new Windows 8 - Hope this will help someone out there.

    <title>Story-Driven Games for the Next Generation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Story-Driven Games for the Next Generation</h2>
                    
<p>So, I'm happy to announce that late last night I finally completed all 5 episodes of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead (including its expansion, 400 Days). In regards to the game, I will say this: It is the BEST story-driven game I have EVER played. Coming
 from someone like me who's played thousands of games over the years, that means something. If you have not yet played this game, you are doing yourself a&nbsp;tremendous disservice.<br />
<br />
In any case, to the point -&nbsp;after playing it,&nbsp;I started&nbsp;to wonder about how the next generation of consoles &amp; the technology involved, particularly with the Xbox One's infinite cloud technology &amp; Kinect sensor, could be used to improve&nbsp;upon games like this.
 Would the games be larger? Have more variation in choices? Would you be able to use the Kinect&nbsp;to&nbsp;physically or vocally interact with the game? What other possibilities are there?<br />
<br />
Please share how you think the next generation of consoles could potentially be used to improve upon story-driven games like Telltale Games' The Walking Dead (with an emphasis on the Xbox One for obvious reasons) &amp; why.<br />
<br />
Please keep this a positive discussion at all times &amp; keep any spoilers to a minimum (with a SPOILER or WARNING LABEL) -&nbsp;thank you.<br />
<br />
Discuss.</p>

<p>It was a good game but no matter what you picked it was the same outcome. Very disappointing in that aspect. I dont see how K2 could help unless it was just trying to pick up when you got scared. Game content goes off the fans and we live in a FPS generation
 so we get little to no story and all action. We might see SP games go down slightly over the years to come. Until people on consoles buy story driven games and not just mindless shooters games &nbsp;like this will be rarley made and even more rarely played. Sucks
 doesn't it?</p>

<p>I have Walking Dead on PC on steam, I heard 400 days was very short so I didn't buy it, plus I went off the TV series in season 3</p>
<p>spoiler alert for those who haven't got that far (white text scroll over)<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"> I got a bit bored when I heard Andrea died, I thought it could have been a better story line she doesn't die in the comics, she ends up as a love interest
 to Rick</span></p>
<p><br />
End of spoiler ^ but yeah I didn't bite the bullet on that, I instead bought State of Decay on Xbox Arcade (I fully recommend this game if you haven't played it get the demo) it's basically what walking dead is... as a game made by a new developer called "Undead
 Labs" you go around searching buildings, recruiting survivors, upgrading your facilities and doing campaign missions on the side.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you would love Quantum Break that sounds story driven, but I haven't got 400 days yet, I think you do have very little choice in Walking dead, sometimes you opt to save someone and they die anyway... having said that I think it's a lot of programming
 for developers to do all these alternate endings.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do see what you are getting at though, say for instance Skyrim on PC, Bethesda released the dev-kit so people could make NPCs and quests and things, but they don't want their IP (intellectual property) to have less value and then people to start making free
 content I'm sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think if Kinect is as good as they say it is, maybe games could start to play off your emotions, see you are attached to one character and kill them off, or see you are getting bored and speed things up a bit, it's hard to say though, I think Xbox has so
 much emphasis on Multiplayer, single player campaign is sort of "side content" these days lol<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you ever played any of the mass effects those have so much dialogue, exploring and things you might enjoy those, Mass Effect 2 is one of the highest rated games of all time, I didn't get into it but I know many people who love it</p>

<p>I'm a bit bored of "this story driven thing"....I want game where i can do whatever i want...In Morrowind i was able to kill every npc i want but not in Skyrim....In &nbsp;Witcher 2 you got choices (not good or bad) just choices &nbsp;and differents paths not the
 case of Mass Effect which becames worst and worst....</p>
<p>What i mean by that is that with the powers of hardwares today i don't have more freedom to play how i want and be surprised.And i think you can have &nbsp;great stories without a linear path and no freedom.Rockstar did it with GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption....</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean i don't like Telltales for what they did,They did a great XBLA game.</p>
<p>I would like to see a RPG like the pen and paper.I create my caracter and then....freedom of everything. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>@ Lord Dirt:</p>
<p>That's why I mentioned larger games with more variation in choices - that way, the game would literally branch out like a tree with your choices, starting at 1 point but ending in potentially hundreds of scenarios in the long run. It would be a tremendous
 undertaking with the developers, but it'd be 1 that I think would be possible with the use of the cloud. Also, contrary to popular belief, many shooters do have great stories - Halo, Call of Duty, &amp; Gears of War just to name a few. They may not be as deep,
 but they're far from being bad.<br />
<br />
@ Dark Destiny:</p>
<p>In regards to your emotions, I was thinking the same thing. Telltale Games' The Walking Dead is definitely a game that played on my emotions &amp; I am not afraid to admit that I cried not once, but multiple times. It would be kind of cool, IMO, if the Kinect
 sensor could pick up on your emotions &amp; display them in game - so if it sees me crying at an emotional scene, my in-game character will start crying too, thereby affecting whatever current emotional scenario I might be in. The same could be applied with anger
 or joy too. This would certainly be an interesting concept.<br />
<br />
Even something as simple as using hand gestures with the Kinect could make a game similar to Telltale Games' The Walking Dead even more interesting since a lot of scenes have a mouse-like cursor to interact with the environment. Aim gun here, grab this, pull/push
 here, etc.</p>

<p>Mass Effect was my all time favourite series of games. I while i know a lot of people were pissed at the ending. Personally i didn't have to much of an issue with it. You could see Cmd Shepherd's ultimate sacrifice. Although i do wish some of our choices
 were picked up more in the ending.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Not played Walking Dead, may have to pick it up now on your recommendation. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And i don't think story driven games are going to get worse, i think they will get better, with massive story co-op, just jump in and out to help a friend, and other bonuses.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I didn't even think the stories for BO2 or BF3 were bad, just very short.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEW MASS EFFECT AND ITS UNIVERSE TO SEE WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER</p>

<p>Mass effect is probably my all time favourite franchise actually. Kinda weird as I had a really Rocky start with the It. I bought the first one and initially hated it.. All talking and not much action.. and when there was, the action seemed a bit rough.
 So I put it aside to trade in but ended up finding it one day and deciding to give it one more go months later.
</p>
<p>That was the best decision I made as I suddenly clicked with it a realised it was all about the conversations, choices and character stories. The action was secondary.. After that.. It became one of my favourite sci fi trilogies, except it felt like I was
 actually 'in it' rather than just watching it as you would a movie.. Awesome.</p>
<p>Anyway.. I love Walking Dead too. Will be interesting to see what they could do with K2 in terms of reading your facial expressions and heart rate. For example.. Your heart rate increases when you tell a lie.. Would it be able to detect that? Kinda of funny
 to try and convince NPC's without giving the game away.. Bluffing your way past guards in Skyrim/ Hitman whilst keeping your heart rate calm?.. Intimidating people with you're facial expressions? I don't know.. Just ideas of the top of my head.</p>

<p>Best story Driven game.... Very tough one. So many to choose from. Let's stick with current Gen.</p>
<p>Bioshock, Mass Effect, Gears Of War, The Last Of Us. </p>
<p>There are probably more... a lot more. This gen was fantastic.</p>

<p>The only problem I have with strictly story driven games is that they are basically 'one &amp; done' experiences. &nbsp;Sure, Walking Dead has some different paths but is basically the same experience. Last of Us has only one ending, dont like? Too bad. I know WD
 got GOTY 2012, that was because of the emotion people got from it, but that is a 1 time deal, i wont ever get that first impression again. Last of Us may get tons of GOTY 2013 nods for the same thing. Meanwhile im loving State of Decay way above the 2 games
 I mentioned for the gameplay experience and continued enjoyment.</p>
<p>I am not saying the stories are worthless, but it is more like an interactive movie we may replay a few times if more than once.</p>
<p>Why is CoD &amp; Minecraft played so much? They are fun &amp; replayable games that can be enjoyed over &amp; over again with friends. &nbsp;There is no story to Minecraft or CoD MP, they are video games meant to be played over &amp; over again that rarely play the same way
 twice.</p>
<p>Im not saying these story based games should stop, but progress them further to make them more than a one off experience.</p>

<p>The best story driven game I have played in a long time is Last of US (prepared for the 1 star rating), creating conflict for me deciding which I liked better over it and the ME series. If they can milk those environments out of old tech like that and great
 story, it makes me pretty excited for the XB1 and PS4. I felt the Fable series kind of regressed with Fable 3 but they may have something awesome for the new Xbox.</p>

<h2>            REACTIVATE SKYPE CREDITS</h2>
                    Several days ago I tried to reactivate my Skype credits as per instructions received by email. I upgraded my skype account as per instructed. I now have no credits and no contacts. I have wasted hours trying to figure this out. I am a 71 year old geezer
 and now wonder if I will live long enough to get this to work. What in the heck is going on? Is there any human being that one can contact to resolve this baloney?

<p>You're not getting his email...I have the same problem...Office 365 offers 60 minutes free per month; and they were activated on my Skype accounts and now they're not. I tried to reactivate but the instructions did not prove helpful. There are no support
 or products tab therefore you can't get to the point of 'reactivating' the Skype minutes. This has taken me hours, and still isn't resolved. Why offer something for free when it's a big headache to get it?</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t access network some network drives in win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just updated a couple of my computers to Windows 10, but the computers that updated can't access all of my network drives, only some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my network setup:</p>
<p>router name (network-infrastructure):home-world</p>
<p>wireless network name: homeworld </p>
<p>workgroup name: homeworld</p>
<p>
</p><p>names of network drives that are not accessible:</p>
<p>homeworldmedia</p>
<p>homeworldbackup</p>
<p>
</p><p>names of network drives that ARE accessible:</p>
<p>zdrive</p>
<p>xdrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of these is a standalone WD drive and everything is in the homeworld workgroup.&nbsp; I'm doing this over ethernet, I only mentioned the wireless because of the name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the dashboards of all of the drives using the ip address of the drives, and the drives are all visible in the network section of file explorer, but trying to open a directory on those 2 drives throws an network error on the windows 10 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 7 computers can access all of the drives without any issue, but the windows 10 machines cannot access the files on the 2 that have the workgroup name embedded in the name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change the names of the non-accessible drives to something without homeworld inside the name, then I can access the drives using windows 10.&nbsp; But changing the drive names would require me setting up a whole new set of backups, which I prefer not to
 have to do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the workgroup name on all the devices and computers (but not the wireless access), but that didn't seem to help either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying to figure out why this is happening and if there's any easy workaround.</p>

<h2>            numeric keypad num lock visual feedback</h2>
                    <p>My new HP ENVY Notebook - 17-n001nl has a numeric keypad, but do NOT have any indicator telling me if num lock is ON or OFF.</p>
<p>I wonder if there is any workaround in order to visualize this on screen.</p>
<p>Is there any on screen software feedback telling me the status of num lock?</p>
<p>I know that virtual on screen keyboard has this feature, but I'd like to see a simple indicator maybe in the system tray.</p>

<p>Hi Harshavardhan Rathod and thanks for answering me.</p>
<p>I do not need a feedback on a key stroke.</p>
<p>I do need a feedback on the status of a numeric keypad.</p>
<p>I need to know if that numeric keypad is toggled as cursor arrows or as number input.</p>
<p>If you write:</p>
<p>"there may be no option to visualize the <strong>Num Lock</strong> on the screen."</p>
<p>Should I still hope that "maybe" there is?</p>
<p>"maybe" somewhere else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
