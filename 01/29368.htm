<h2>            Paid &#36;450 for service and was sent a bad Surface - what now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I paid the $450 for an out of warranty repair when I broke my screen.&nbsp; The Surface Pro 3 I received in return had issues right out of the box with the battery life; however, since I normally use it plugged in, I didn't see the need to return it.&nbsp; However,
 now it will not turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am used to the occasional "Surface goes to sleep and won't wake up" scenarios and thought this was the case, but it is not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have obviously been given a sub-par replacement, but for the life of me cannot figure out how to contact Microsoft to remedy the issue without paying $99 for service.&nbsp; I've already paid for service and didn't get what I paid for.&nbsp; There seems to be no
 recourse, not even an e-mail address I can send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, I just want to talk or e-mail someone who can replace my Surface with a descent one.&nbsp; I feel I paid a lot of money and got screwed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received the replacement less than a month ago and I do not live near a Microsoft Store.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t use windows search &#40;it doesnt even start&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have problem with using windows search (NOT cortana, i dont have it probably)<br />
When i start writing nothing happens. Start menu stays black (if you search something it should change to white and shows results).</p>
<p>I made another user account and it works on new account but i dont want to migrate to new account.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Using troubleshooting tool on search and indexing with administrator permissions says:<br />
"incorect permissions on windows search data directory"<br />
<br />
What i did:<br />
- Tried restarting Windows search service<br />
- Runed some powershell comands from tutorials</p>
<p>- Deleted Search folder in&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search (so it could recreate with its own permissions)<br />
- Tried changing owner of&nbsp;Search folder to my user account<br />
- Administrators and SYSTEM have full control<br />
- SYSTEM is owner<br />
- Tried giving my user acount full control to search folder and all subfloders and files<br />
- Tried restarting Search process</p>
<p>- Tried restarting Explorer.exe<br />
- Used command sfc /scannow</p>
<p>- Disabled Antyvirus<br />
- Rebuilded indexes<br />
<br />
Powershell comands that i already tried (running as administrator):</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</span></p>
<p>2)&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode

How to fix this problem? How is it even possible that such a problem randomly occurs and is SO HARD to fix!?</p>

            Hi  kkamil4sz
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Run Search &amp; Indexing Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Search and Indexing &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Make sure the service Windows Search is started 
<br />Windows key + R &gt; Type services.msc in the run dialog box &gt; Enter &gt; Then look for a service called Windows search &gt; Make sure the service is started and set to automatic
<br />
<br />3. Restart Windows Explorer 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Task Manager &gt; Head to Processes tab and select Windows Explorer &gt; Right click &gt; Click Restart
<br /> 
<br />4. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Please report back me the results so that I can advise further steps if your problem is not solved.

            hey …
<br /> I worked out on your problem and found some points can you please tell me when you start to write something on start menu, is "Microsoft Windows Search Indexer" application running on task manager or not.
<br />to check this do the following steps.
<br />1: open the task manager and end the task "Microsoft Windows Search Indexer" if it is there.
<br />2:- type something on start search .
<br />3:- Notice that is "Microsoft Windows Search Indexer" is showing again on task manager or not.
<br />
<br />try this and let me know ,so I can tell you the further solution.

            ok kkamil…
<br />     As I study your case I found that ,you possibly tried to disable cortana and after disabling cortana  your search is working fine till next boot it happens due to cortana is already started and it will work till not killing the process inside task bar . After restart your PC cortana unable to load the executable file which you removed while disabling the cortana and showing black screen hopefully your any dll file is missing from the below address  . I Did some experiment to reach your problem and I got black screen same as you. it happened due to I relocate all the file to new folder. file address is :
<br />C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy
<br />I found a solution for you that is  copy the above folder from same Windows 10 and pest it by renaming the older one.
<br />   if you want to disable the cortana you can disable it partially, search option is inside the cortana so removing cortana completely creates problem on search process 
<br /> when you start to search something on start search ,possibly you will see the cortana application is running on task bar without it you cant see the black screen too.

            i didnt delete anything. There isnt cortana since installation. Maybe its not avilable in my country or there was an option during instalation of windows 10 to not use cortana. I installed my system like a year ago and everything was fine till now.&nbsp;<br />
There isnt any cortana process in task manager and never was. There is instead SearchUI process.

<h2>            Cortana just shows the loading dots</h2>
                    Sometimes when I go to type a question in Cortana after my computer starts up, Cortana gets stuck with the 5 dots loading across the top of her window. All the languages and region settings are correct. Sometimes the problem will go away when I restart
 the computer.

<h2>            Laptop keeps going into blank screen with active cursor but task manager is not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hi, as the subject says, I keep getting into this situation for 3 hours now on my laptop. I tried restarting and shutting it down, but I only end up having to hold the power button to turn it off by force. Again, task manager is not responding even though
 I kept pushing ctrl+alt+del. This problem occurred when I tried to install an antivirus (eset). Once I've finished installing, I quickly restarted my laptop and since then, I'm stuck with this situation. Plus, I can't seem to boot into safe mode given the
 situation that all I'm really looking at is a blank screen. Please provide a possible step by step procedure on how I can fix this. You're response will most likely be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If your PC isn’t loading Windows 10 and you don’t have the operating system installation files, you can use the following trick.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start your computer and follow the POST, when Windows should begin loading, press the power button to shutdown your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repeat the previous step twice, and in the third restart the operating system should enter into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), where a number of diagnostics will be performed to try fix any booting issues, but you will also get an option
 to access the Windows Startup Settings</p>

                    <p>Hello, I have noticed this problem after the last update to the Xbox app on windows 10 (I believe was 09/23/2016). Every time I try and upload an video that has been edited in a 3rd party editor to Xbox live through the app, it promptly crashes at 98-99%
 uploaded. I have tried everything short of trying to upload it from an alternate account and was wondering if anyone else had this problem since the update and/or had a fix around it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Brett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to suggest that you use a non third party editor in uploading the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend to run System File Checker it checks for system file corruption. Check the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click (or press and hold) the Start button, then select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Enter <strong>sfc</strong> <strong>/scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

    <title>MAJOR Crash on Windows 10 Involving Corrupted BIOS and Boot Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MAJOR Crash on Windows 10 Involving Corrupted BIOS and Boot Drive</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 on my desktop, along with my laptop. My laptop is still running it fine, but my desktop has pretty much fallen apart. Windows 10 ran fine on it, but on Wednesday, I put it into sleep mode to make sure the lockscreen would take my PIN.
 However, when I hit the spacebar on my keyboard, the computer didn't wake up. Strangely, my keyboard's backlight and NUMLOCK LED turned on, but the computer did nothing. I tried hitting the power and reset buttons; again, nothing. I thought it was just a bug,
 so I flipped the switch on my PSU's back, and turned the computer back on. It booted up fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I put the computer in sleep for about an hour and a half, and again it wouldn't wake. I flipped the PSU's switch again, and when it booted up, I was greeted with a screen telling me my motherboard's BIOS was corrupted. Luckily, my motherboard had
 dual BIOS, so it was quickly restored. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I continue, I want to give a little backstory about my computer. Originally, it ran Windows 7. One day, Amazon had a sale on some Kingston SSDs, so I decided to buy one. I used the cloning software to copy Windows 7 from my 1TB WD HDD onto my new
 SSD. However, when I was finished, I didn't delete the Windows OS from my HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after my BIOS restored, the computer restarted, and instead of booting into Windows 10, it began to boot into Windows 7, so I'm pretty sure that my SSD was corrupted, and my motherboard saw Windows 7 on my HDD as the only bootable device. When Windows
 7 finished going through its splash screen with the Windows flag, it went through a three step&nbsp;file validation, where it said it found no files were corrupted, but when it went to step two, it started saying something about deleting. New lines of text kept
 coming from the bottom, stating that the system was deleting files. I don't know what that meant, whether it was deleting system files or not, but I'm sure that it wasn't good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that finished, the computer restarted, but it just booted into the file checking routine again. It went through all of this again, and restarted. It didn't go through the file checker again, and just stopped at a black screen. I restarted the computer,
 and went into the boot selection menu. I selected the SSD, and miraculously, Windows 10 booted up. It got to the login screen. I put in my PIN, and it told me that the PIN was incorrect. I put it in again, same result. I tried to login with my Microsoft account,
 and once again, I got the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where my story ends. If anyone has any suggestion into what I should do, please, please reply to this. I was extremely excited for Windows 10, but as you can imagine, that excitement is pretty much over now. I can install Windows 7 again if I need
 to, but I really don't want to have to go through the whole fiasco of installing Windows, installing my drivers, installing about fifty updates, and then reinstalling 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't see any better fitting category to file this under, so I just filed it under Other settings (sorry, I'm new to this forum)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case my PC's specs make any difference in solving the problem:</p>
<p>CPU: AMD FX-4100 Quad-3.6GHz</p>
<p>8GB of RAM</p>
<p>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 (EVGA brand)</p>
<p>Motherboard: GIGABYTE 970A-D3</p>
<p>Boot Drive: 120GB SSD (SATA)</p>
<p>2nd Drive: 1TB Platter Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading my post. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I decided to try signing in again, and it worked. I booted into the desktop, and there were no errors. One weird thing I noticed was that my headset had a new name containing lots of Unicode, and my clock was set two hours ahead. Other than that,
 everything is working. However, I would still like to know if there's a way to validate the system files to make sure that everything is okay. If anyone know, please respond. Once again, thanks.</p>

            <p>This is my issue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the computer to sleep end of my day (saving previous session and all).</p>
<p>Next morning, I have to restart via using F12 as I have a corrupt Bios. I have a dual bios, so it can do it fairly quickly, but OS8.1 did not have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did nothing different, other than add OS10. No new programs. Deleted no programs. Changed no settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no fix offered, I am going back to OS8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not even find my command prompt to run msconfig to give my system info and the system will not allow me to cut and past the info from system.</p>

            <p>I have had the same issue with my bio's becoming corrupt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's my daughters laptop and it was put into sleep overnight, when coming back the next day to it, it would power on with just a black screen and wouldn't even post or get into the bios. After hard shutting it down and clearing the cmos on occasion it might
 manage to post and boot but when the laptop was shut down or put to sleep it would have the same symptoms (although if you just did a restart it would boot up fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After alot of fault finding the hardware I came to the decision the hardware was all ok and it might be something that windows had done and put the laptop into some weird hibernation mode that it couldn't get out of, but my thinking was if I boot it with
 no hard drive and it still wont post how could windows be effecting the boot into bios/post. All along I'm thinking at this point my motherboard has bit the dust and I'll need to replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I decided to focus on the bios, what have I got to lose right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a medion erazer x6823 so I went via medion's website to download the bios which wasn't available for my model so I called them. They said that the fault sounds like the motherboard is faulty and its out of warranty and a replacement is £299.
 I asked them for the bios files so I can try to re-flash it but they said they do not have the bios for my model.... Great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking around the net I was struggling to find the bios for my motherboard but what I did notice is the motherboard is the same one fitted into the msi gt60 so after too much time spent finding a bio's I managed to find a site where people were unlocking
 bio's for their msi and found someone who had a unlocked bios for mines ( motherboard ms-16f31 ). I downloaded it and then had to try getting my laptop to boot. After many attempts it finally booted and I got into windows and used the bios file to re-flash
 it and guess what.... The laptop is now perfect. It boots first time every time as it did and as it should so the issue has always been down to the bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the fun doesn't end there. Windows 10 now says that the key for it is blocked, and after spending over a hour talking with Microsoft they are now saying there is nothing they can do and I have to buy a new windows key. How is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL:DR</p>
<p>Windows 10 wouldn't wake laptop up from sleep. Striped laptop down to find no hardware faults. Managed to reflash bios and everything is perfect again. Windows 10 key is now blocked by their server and they tell me I have to pay for a new licence</p>

            <p>I have the identical problem on an older DELL desktop. &nbsp;However there are no memory, SDI, complications.</p>
<p>I didn't get a message saying the BIOS was corrupt. &nbsp;However, win10 complained there was no boot drive. Further investigation found that the HD interface selection in the BIOS had mysteriously been set to RAID. &nbsp;Resetting to AHCI allowed booting, but still
 have the problem of not recovering from "sleep". &nbsp;I have turned off all the power management features and only use manual power down now. &nbsp;No problems in this configuration, but obviously something is very broken. &nbsp;I should note, that after upgrading to win10
 everything, including power management, was fine until this problem appeared about 3 weeks ago.</p>

            <p>I had the same issues with windows 10.<br />
After I put my pc in sleep mode, a "crash" seems to appear.<br />
<br />
The power on the pc strive to start while windows and bios was totally unactive.&nbsp;<br />
I was sure that some components had crash because of the new version of windows. I was thinking that my motherboard or processors was dead. I started to panic and I was mad.</p>
<p><br />
After I turned down power for long time, for a complete reset, I was able to boot my pc with "an critical error in bios".<br />
I never played on my bios. I wonder who's fault is it? Microsoft, I'm pretty damn sure that your OS crash seriously my cpu.<br />
I'm mad and scared of losing my cpu to your faulty windows 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I didn't need some unwanted nigthmare while I start my pc because windows 10 is on it.<br />
</p>
<p>I always choose pc and windows for the purpose that i make of it. But this story makes me realize that Microsoft doesn't make good and
<p>
</p><p>I would like a contact from you and an many excuses or a new cpu because I'm doing your job by troolbeshooting your dangerous OS.<br />

An unhappy consumer.</p>

What happens if you try to open the files from within Quattro Pro rather than double-clicking on the files?

<h2>            IPV6 Ping Not Working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 and am having some connectivity problems with the Internet and my WiFi router. &nbsp; While investigating this, I saw some strange behavior while trying to ping external websites. &nbsp; The command prompt defaults to IPv6, and the pings appear
 to be blocked. &nbsp; If I provide a -4 flag on the ping, it goes through.</p>

<p>Thanks Eric. &nbsp; I discovered that my Bitdefender antivirus firewall was not compatible with IPv6 traffic and was instructed to upgrade it. &nbsp; Now I can ping IPv6 addresses and get a response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have a related connectivity problem. &nbsp; I purchased an Intel Edison / AWS Internet of Things kit and have connected it to my Windows 10 laptop. &nbsp; After connecting the board to my WiFi network I cannot ping any external websites (ex. microsoft.com)
 from the Edison. &nbsp;The exact same board configuration works with my older Windows 7 machine. &nbsp; Intel is saying that the Edison board is working as expected and they cannot help me with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suspect that the issue is with my Windows 10 laptop. &nbsp; Other than my antivirus package, is there any place in the Windows 10 OS that could be blocking traffic from an IoT board that is connected through USB ports to a laptop?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 1709 x64 broke boot file</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi all,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was wondering whether you could help. This may or may not be a coincidence but after I upgraded from Windows 10 Pro 1703 to 1709 and powered the PC off and back on, the PC's BIOS says it can't find the disk and instructs you to either press F1 to
 skip or F2 to enter the PC's BIOS setup, I kept on pressing F1 and kept getting stuck in a continuous loop after the BIOS's splash screen. The PC's disk setup is 4TB Hybrid Hard Disk which is formatted as GPT and is split into 6 partitions, 5 that are bootable
 and 1 as a storage area. The 5 bootable partitions are 120GB each containing Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64, Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64, Windows 8 Pro x64, Windows 8.1 Pro x64 and Windows 10 1709 x64 and all in logical boot order whereas the storage area is
 using the remaining 3496GB and is non bootable. The BIOS boots the drive using UEFI without secure boot and CSM but in the current situation I am using the drive that came with the PC with making this the master drive and the hybrid drive as the Slave drive.
 The configuration for this drive is a 250GB MBR with Windows 10 1709 x64 and the PC is currently booting it in legacy. I can access the contents of the hybrid drive via the 250GB drive which is an ordinary SATA drive using Windows Explorer. I have performed
 numerous checks using Seagate Tools for Windows and Check Disk and none of them have picked up any faults? Your help would be very gratefully appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for responding to my forum thread. Below I have inserted 2 screenshots of the error messages I get, the first one is when UEFI is enabled and when the ordinary SATA drive is connected whereas the other is when UEFI is enabled and when the ordinary
 SATA drive is disconnected.</p>

<p>Hi CraigLong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my forum thread. Unfortunately your suggestion only works if an error is flagged up by Windows which in my case is flagged up by the BIOS. Would booting from a USB stick with Windows 10 Pro 1709 and performing an upgrade install

            I can confirm that <span>booting from a USB stick with Windows 10 Pro 1709 and performing an upgrade install over the partition is not possible as the media is using legacy mode and not UEFI so it is looking more like I will have to back up everything
 from the hybrid SATA drive and to start all over again which I do not want to do but is looking very likely with the options I have left.</span>

<p>Well that's what I would do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My files are always backed up.&nbsp; I reinstalled my operating system a few times myself and of course that works.&nbsp; But I only have one operating system and I don't partition my drive except for what is created during the install.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's what I will do CraigLong, thank you everyone for your input. Will have to use Seagate Tools for Windows to format the drive as the options in Windows won't be available in order to do a format as the 250GB SATA ordinary drive is formatted as MBR whereas
 the 4TB Hybrid SATA drive is formatted as GPT.</p>

<p>Hi CraigLong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I didn't realise you sent me another post as I didn't receive an email notification from Microsoft Community to say you posted again apart from rate a recent reply. I haven't yet gone ahead with the format as I
 am wanting to weigh up more options before I have to do a format, your suggestion with converting MBR to GPT sounds a plausible solution and will give it a try when I have a moment. Once again thank you for your help as well as posting your suggestions.</p>
<p>

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
As far as I know, if you have the 70$ credits and the game costs 64.99$ you should be able to buy it 100% using your wallet credits. (unless tax or additional costs that may vary per region I guess...)<br />
I guess for billing reasons it might ask for a credit card / debit card but it won't charge on it if you are sure you have enough credits on your account.<br />
<br />
if you want, you can try to buy it from the xbox.com website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/assassins-creed-odyssey-gold-edition/bnf5q9zsd84z?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/assassins-creed-odyssey-gold-edition/bnf5q9zsd84z?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab</a><br />

<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, we know you need set the front camera as<span>&nbsp;
</span>the default one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, in Skype for Business client, we can go to the<span style="font-weight: bold"> Tools</span> &gt;
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-video-device-options-in-skype-for-business-d09017c0-deba-4f6c-a122-9eca6604f50c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set Video Device options in Skype for Business</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if you have tried to switch the camera via this way?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If not, please do it and let us know the result at your convenience. If so, can you try to switch the camera in the Windows OS to check the issue? Please see:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17444/windows-camera-app-webcams-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Switch to a different camera</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the best performance is using Skype for Business client in the latest one. If the issue persists, please let us know the detailed version of this client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Virus</h2>
                    <p>Once a decision has been made not to "upgrade" to windows 10, is there a way to eliminate the "Windows 10 Virus" that keeps popping up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned automatic Windows Update OFF and manually scan to avoid being surprised. &nbsp;I was able to revert back once and will not go through the effort again. &nbsp;If this machine becomes a Windows 10 machine, I will send it to Redmond as it will no longer
 be of value to me.</p>

            i keep getting this same code and it will not allow me to play any digital copy music that i have purchased on my surface rt. This is very unsettling given the price paid for this device and i cannot use it for all that it can do. I have saved it to the
 sd card and xbox music will not play it. Nothing is working and not seeing any fix in site. Might have to switch to a android tablet if these type of errors continue.

            If you make an Ultra Violet account (it's free) and a Flixster account (it's free too) you will be able to use the Ultra Violet codes that come with some DVD's and Blu-Ray's to watch them. I also had to make a VUDU account for certain Ultra Violet Codes.
 Once you make these accounts they will link to each other and you can watch them through Flixster. Good luck and happy viewing :)

            I get this issue to. I downloaded a digital copy with windows media on a windows 7 machine and tried to transfer to my surface rt which I installed windows media on and press play video and none worked. The file I am trying to watch is a WMV file. Neither
 digital copy gave me the option of a flixter /ultraviolet copy, it was windows media or iTunes. Getting error code 0xc101a003. Not sure if it's related to version of windows media. Any help would be great.

I just tried to do this, and the RT called for me to download a player (silver something or other) only to be told that the RT would not run the player.&nbsp; I could not get my UV movie to play.</p>

            Did you log in to flixster through internet explorer? Did you link flixster and Ultra Violet accounts? If so, are your movies showing up in "my movies" once logged into your flixster account, if so you should be able to play your movies.

            It's amazing how you(engineer) have had zero input in resolving this matter in this public forum. I am going to sell this rt. It is absolute garbage that I cannot watch any movies unless I have internet access, or multiple accounts with third parties.
 Horrible device.

<p>
<span><span>Hi bbbbb5,<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><br />
Are you playing an online game?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>If yes</span></strong><span>, you may have to install the Java Plug-in or Flash.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>A)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>To install Java, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Go to the Java.com(</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=82813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=82813</span></a><span> ) website.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the Free Java Download button. This should take you to the Java installation screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If a yellow Information bar appears (warning you that the website requires an ActiveX control or add-on from Sun Microsystems), click the yellow bar and then click Install ActiveX Control or Install Add-on. When a Security Warning dialog box appears,
 click Install.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the Welcome dialog box, click the View License Agreement button to read about the agreement, and then click Accept if you want to install Java. (Note that you can also change where Java is installed from the default location of C:\Program Files\Java
 by selecting the Change destination folder check box and by following the instructions.)</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In addition to Java, you can also install the MSN Toolbar. The MSN Toolbar offers headlines, news alerts, and search tools from Microsoft. For more information see the
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=135506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>MSN Toolbar home page</span></a><span>. To install the toolbar, click the Terms of Use or Privacy Statement buttons and then read the statements.
 If you don't want to install the toolbar, clear the Install the new MSN Toolbar check box.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you see the successful completion dialog box, click Finish. Java does not require any additional settings or restarts. If you installed the MSN Toolbar, you will see it when you open a new window or tab.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Check the link “Install Java in internet Explorer”
</span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/59c3a93d-1342-43a6-a01a-f720c7a17ffc1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/59c3a93d-1342-43a6-a01a-f720c7a17ffc1033.mspx</span></a><span>

<h2>            Not happy - Win 10 Changed my drive letters</h2>
                    <p>Updated to Windows 10 today, and while I was looking around and getting familiar with it I noticed that it had changed 2 of my drive designations. I have a 256G SSD that I use as my primary C: and a 1T mechanical as a storage and backup drive. Win 10 has
 flipped these and I'm stumped at how to put them back the way I had them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me, please?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The order is determined by the order the disks are sorted in the BIOS. Many BIOSs allow you to change this order.</li><li>They are sorted by volume name. You can see the volume names by running this command at the Command Prompt (not at the Run box!):<br />
mountvol.exe
<p>This registry location might give you further clues: HKLM\SYSTEM\MountedDevices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>To change, add, or remove a drive letter </strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Open Computer Management by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Computer Management.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation. </span></li><li>&nbsp;<span>In the left pane, click Disk Management. </span></li><li>&nbsp;<span>Right-click the drive that you want to change, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths.
</span></li><li>&nbsp;<span>Do one of the following: </span>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>To assign a drive letter if one has not already been assigned, click Add, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.
</span></li><li>&nbsp;<span>To change a drive letter, click Change, click Assign the following drive letter, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.
</span></li><li>&nbsp;<span>To remove a drive letter, click Remove, and then click Yes to confirm that you want to remove it.
</span></li><li>&nbsp;<span>Notes </span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Some programs make references to specific drive letters. If you change a drive letter, these programs might not work correctly.
</span></li></ul>

            <p>Thank you for the information; this will be helpful. &nbsp;Before I start in that direction do you know if there are any files that I should move to the other drive?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach I've considered is to unplug the 1TB&nbsp;mechanical storage drive and see what happens. If the correct files to install Win 10 are on the SSD would it re-install on that drive thereby making it the C:? Then I could add the other and make it
 back the way it was - the storage drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've heard rumors that Win 10 is free for about a year and a half and then it must be purchased. Do you know if this is true or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Paul</p>
