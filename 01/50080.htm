    <title>Remove drive created with &#34;subst&#34; command&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove drive created with &#34;subst&#34; command&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One of my hard drives broke a few days ago and I tried to use the subst command to fix some problems. The subst command didn't work when I used it, instead it only worked after a restart. So now I suddenly have a new (virtual) hard driver which is assigned
 to the first partition of my OS hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick info:</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10 64 bit</p>
<p>The drive <strong>D:</strong> created with subst is showing up in My Computer&nbsp;and I'm constantly getting messages about it running out of space</p>
<p>OS hard drive is&nbsp;<strong>C:</strong></p>
<p>Broken (now gone) hard drive was&nbsp;<strong>D:</strong></p>
<p>New subst hard drive (which is on the first of two partitions on <strong>C:</strong>) is
<strong>D:</strong></p>
<p>The partition that the "subst D:" drive is on is the OEM partition</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advice I've found so far is to do&nbsp;<em>subst D: /D</em> but that is returning an error "Invalid parameter D:". Restarting my PC again didn't remove it. How do I get rid of this drive letter without accidentally destroying my OS?</p>

<br />Let’s try to remove the drive via cmd prompt: 
<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin
<br />
<br />Type: diskpart
<br />And hit enter
<br />
<br />then, 
<br />
<br />Type: list volume
<br />And hit enter
<br />
<br />make note of the volume number that is assigned to D. 
<br />
<br />Then Type: select volume #(that number)
<br />And hit enter
<br />
<br />Then Type: remove letter=D
<br />And hit enter 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this works!

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Update error 80070643 can happen for several reasons. The most common cause is a problem with the .NET Framework installed on the computer. I would
 also suggest you to follow the steps from the article below and check if it&nbsp;helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><strong><span>.NET Framework update installation error: "0x80070643" or "0x643"
</span></strong></p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>I would suggest you to run Windows update troubleshooter and check if issue persist. I would suggest you to check for the update history to look for any pending updates.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can follow the steps:
</span></span></p>

    <title>Upgrade install roadblock - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helpful55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade install roadblock</h2>
                    <p>I have a W7 64 bit desktop. I was losing the HD so I cloned it to a new one which will boot fine. This OS has never had anything done to tune it up and since it may have had some errors with the drive going bad I feel this is a good time
 to freshen it up before I do some program and personalization stuff. I wanted to do an in place upgrade install. I have a USB I made bootable that has all W7 versions. I have used this to reinstall W7 in a laptop just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I start up W7 then put in the USB and click setup. All goes great until it checks compatibility. It says I can’t upgrade 64 to 32. And the next line says I can’t upgrade 32 to 64! Along with some other info on some network drivers that
 may not work. Of course it won’t let me move beyond that screen. Right on my pc properties it says Ultimate 64 bit and I am selecting Ultimate 64 bit on the install select screen. If I change compatibility to vista I believe it has the same errors. I tried
 W7 for compatibility and that tells me I need W7 with SP1. Right on my properties screen it says SP1. I look through the list of updates in two different ways and it is not there, which is surprising since this pc was built for his family by a pc tech in 2011.
 I tried downloading and installing SP1 and it says it is already there. Getting weird. I cannot seem to get any way to make this work even trying uninstalling SP1 so I can reinstall it. (I had wondered if the builder had some kind of W7 install that already
 had SP1 in it so it doesn’t show as an update.) Any idea how to make this work? And please don't recommend W10. Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>IMHO...PhotoStory 3 is a better app for creating video<br />
slide shows if you are only using still shots and music.<br />
<br />
PhotoStory 3 For Windows<br />

(runs on XP, Vista and Win7)<br />
<br />
Now...to answer your question...<br />
<br />
The display resolution is reduced when viewed from<br />
the Timeline/Storyboard...this will not affect your<br />
completed project (especially noticable when viewed<br />
fullscreen). If you view the clip by selecting it in the<br />
Collections Pane it should look better.<br />
<br />
If your Published (saved) WMV video files are not the<br />
resolution you expected...you may need to use a Custom<br />
Profile:<br />
<br />
Personally, I find the following .wmv profile to be<br />
useful when saving movies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SlideShow-1024x768WMV9<br />
<br />
Download from the following site...<br />

<a href="http://www.papajohn.org/MM2-SavingMovies-CustomProfiles.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.papajohn.org/MM2-SavingMovies-CustomProfiles.html</a><br />
<br />
Right click / Save target as...drop it in the following Vista folder:<br />
C:\Program Files\Movie Maker\Shared\Profiles<br />
(you'll have to Create the Profiles folder if it's not there)<br />
Custom Profiles for Win XP Movie Maker will work with<br />
Vista Movie Maker 6.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 does not come for free; you have to buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7; try amazon.com.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Windows 7 Upgrade Option is available through participating PC manufacturers on selected PCs and through Microsoft on qualifying purchases of the Windows Vista packaged product. The Windows 7 Upgrade Option applies to Windows
 Vista Home Premium, Business, and Ultimate editions. Your Windows 7 upgrade will be to the comparable version: so you'll get either Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional (the upgrade to Windows Vista Business), or Windows 7 Ultimate, respectively.
 The Windows 7 Upgrade Option program runs from June 26, 2009 <strong>through January 31, 2010.</strong> Some Manufacturers may choose to shorten the Upgrade Option time frame.</span></p>

</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>

    <title>External monitor connected via Surface Dock does not turn on after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            External monitor connected via Surface Dock does not turn on after display is put to sleep.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Dock connected to my Surface Book. When connected, the Surface screen is turned off and the external monitor is the only one that is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works fine until the computer turns off the display after a period of inactivity. When this happens, moving the mouse or keyboard causes the computer to wake up but the screen doesn't turn on. The only way to get a picture back on the screen is
 to turn off the monitor and then turn it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experiencing this?</p>

            <p>I have this same problem. What monitor do you have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that my 4K Acer B286HK would not wake up after the Surface Book (SB) went to sleep and then waking up. Also disconnecting the DB from the dock would cause the monitor to not wake up when reconnecting. The little light on the monitor would turn
 on (blue) and it would look like it has sync, but it would never actually turn on. &nbsp;Just stays blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What sucks is that I took it to a MS store and every monitor I plugged into at the store with a dock would work. AAARRRGGGG. Took it right back to the office and it would not wake the monitor correctly. &nbsp;AAAAARRRRRRGGGGG AGAIN! The&nbsp;B286HK is on the list
 of monitors that is supported by the doc.&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-docking-station-surface-dock</p>
<p>
</p><p>I swapped monitors to the Acer K272HUL and it works. (Not on the list of supported monitors.) What's even more interesting is I plugged them both into the dock and the they both work. I can unplug the SB, put it to sleep, detach/reattach the tablet and it
 will sync with both monitors and it appears to work. (Still testing.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>So with the&nbsp;B286HK alone it does not work.</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;K272HUL alone it works.</p>
<p>With both the&nbsp;K272HUL and the&nbsp;B286HK it appears to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating! It's a sync issue with the doc because pluging in the&nbsp;B286HK (the one that does not work on it's own) directly to the SB always work. Doing it through the doc will now. Somehow the doc is not triggering the signal to the monitor to wake it up
 after it goes dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it really helps, but I think it's a combo of certain monitors and surface dock not working together. Even if it always works by directly pluging into the SB.</p>

            <p>I have the Dell P2415Q 4k monitor. It's connected using the display port cable that came with the monitor. One end of the cable is mDP and other end is regular DP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not a Surface Book problem specifically, it's definitely a Windows one. On my Linux machine, I can connect the same monitor and the problem never occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting that the problem never happened in the store. Were you using any type of adapter?</p>

            <p>Even with the latest round of Surface updates (April 2016), my external monitor (DELL P2415Q), connected to the Surface Dock, will not turn on when booting up the Surface Book. The surface detects the monitor and uses it but the screen is off. To make the
 monitor work, I have to power it off then back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Surface Book is off</li><li>Surface Dock is connected to Surface Book</li><li>External monitor (DELL P2415Q) is connected to the surface dock</li></ul>
<p>

<li>Surface Book begins booting</li><li>Windows Hello camera turns on

</li><li>Windows Hello camera recognizes me and logs in

</p><p>Can you please confirm if you are using Skype for Windows Desktop(classic version) or Skype for Windows 10(new version)? Is your audio device built-in or plug and play? Make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest version of Skype</a>. As a workaround, you may try to update your audio device. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Select the Windows logo/Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results.
</li><li>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver.</li><li>Select Search automatically for updated driver software. </li></ul>
<p>

If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program."http://www.memtest.org/#downiso"]Memtest86+ - Advanced Memory Diagnostic Tool<br />
<br />
*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
<br />
Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
<br />
Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise. Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 you can make a Startup Repair disk by going to Start....All Programs...Maintenance...Create a System Repair Disc - with Windows Vista you'll have to use your installation disk or the "Repair your computer" option at the top of the Safe Mode menu
 .<br />
<br />
Then, here's the procedure:<br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
<br />
Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen. Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers
 out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation (an estimate on my part).<br />
<br />
If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Mediocre 5 GHz Wi-Fi Performance with Surface Book i7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pec967  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mediocre 5 GHz Wi-Fi Performance with Surface Book i7</h2>
                    <p>I have new SB i7/16GB with Performance Base and the Wi-Fi performance is mediocre. The maximum throughput I see on Wi-Fi using Speedtest.net to my local ISP is 250 Mbps down (My Internet connection is 1 Gbps down and 50 Mbps up). This is using the performance
 base on AC power, &nbsp;10 ft line-of-sight from the router, and an AC1900-class router on 5 GHz with 80 MHz channel. In contrast, my three-year old Lenovo Yoga S1 gets 430 Mbps down (the Yoga has a 2x2 802.11ac WiFi card like the SB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone seeing better Wi-Fi throughput than 250 Mbps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

<h2>            Multiple different BSOD&#39;s on a new Windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My one-week-old custom PC has started crashing when I started playing newer video games, like Assassins' Creed Odyssey and Overwatch. Older games seem to work just fine. First error I got was SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, second PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
 (this one actually happened when I was browsing, not playing) and third one was IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. Then I ran driver verifier and DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION that was AMDRyzenMasterDriver.sys, which I deleted, but to no avail. I'm guessing this
 has something to do with drivers? I've downloaded all the latest ones though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are three latest minidumps that I've had: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UW47Jo6mLZMzqlPAN3bl8uQnKOkh5RRP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do, any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually downloaded it manually some time ago and it seemed to cause problems, so I deleted it. What do I need the software for if I'm not overclocking?</p>

            Hi Ugosha
<br />
<br />If you are not overclocking, you would not need that software, when you say you deleted it, did you uninstall that completely from Settings - Apps
<br />
<br />If you uninstalled that, I wonder how you are getting that BSOD referring to that file?

<p>I deleted it completely, yes, and after that BSOD's still kept occuring, but not referring to that file anymore. I stopped the driver verifier after I got that&nbsp;<span>DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION BSOD, and now I'm having
 BSOD's like</span><span>&nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL again.</span></p>

            Hi Ugosha
<br />
<br />Sorry, I was offline for a while, the newer Mini-dump files indicate a problem with your graphics card device driver, which may indeed have been causing the issue all along,which was being hidden by the Ryzen Master software
<br />
<br />Perhaps an older version of your Video card device driver may be more compatible with your system, or version of Windows, download and install a previous version of that driver, which should be available from the AMD website to see if that resolves this for you . .

<p><strong>This issue has been going on for about a month now, and has been getting progressively worse. I rely on my computer for graduate school, so I would like to solve this problem ASAP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This comp used to be able to handle whatever programs I threw at it all at once. I could play demanding games, while listening to music, and having various other programs open (Outlook, etc.) with no issues. Now it is slow no matter what is open.
 It also cuts in and out of this stuttering-slow state.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have run a deep scan using my antivirus program (avast!) as well as scanning for spyware (ad-aware), with only clean results. I downloaded "Process Explorer" to examine the processes a little further and discovered what appears to be the culprit
 of high CPU usage:&nbsp;ndis.sys!NetDmaAllocateChannel - 2 instances of this combined are consuming at some times over 75% of CPU usage causing my total CPU usage to spike to 100%resulting in "stuttering" and major slow-downs.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My laptop is an ASUS G71Gx (Best Buy build) with the following specs:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 Home Premium (version 6.1; build 7600)</strong></p>

<p>I thougth NVIDIA had that fixed as it was also the cause of what you are experiencing. Historical post:<a href="http://forums.nvidia.com/lofiversion/index.php?t18871.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.nvidia.com/lofiversion/index.php?t18871.html</a></p>
<p>More commonly the GeForce 6800 series.</p>
<p>Sometimes just moving the LAN card to another slot changes the IQR number and thus the sharing is gone. (You may need to try several slots). If that doesn't work then see if you change the IRQ number in the driver configuration.</p>

 and passes the job to it. When a Direct 3D render error occurs, DirectX is telling you that it was unable to relay the information to the Direct 3D API or the Direct 3D API was failed to compute the data.

<p>
</p><p>That didn't work for me either. For AMD I think you should download from the website itself and install that update manually. Also, you should try checking in dxdiag (Windows button + r then type 'dxdiag' without the quotations). If you have Display and
 Render tab. Check your Display Tab if it's really your default graphics card (Mine's Intel but it shows Microsoft adapter so I installed an update to in Windows Update and it did the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: I have nvidia graphics so I'm not certain about AMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: You can't manually update Intel they don't show the update in their website don't know why.</p>

<h2>            Remove windows defender icon from the tray on win 10</h2>
                    <p>Yeah, I know, topics with this question are exists thousend times. But my Windows defender entry is not in my startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a third party internet security program, and I want to controll my machine through that, so I truned off windows firewall and windows defender. This is how i want to use my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The annoying thing is that at here my workplace, the windos defender icon is shown on my tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on that, it tells me that the real time protection is handling by&nbsp;another program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cool, windos detected it. So I want to remove this icon. Every topic is about this is to go to Task Manager, Startup tab (my windows is not english, maybe the name of tab is different, but I guess you know what I am talking about), but there is no entry
 for Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am going to the first &nbsp;tab, Processes or what then there is the "Windows Defender notification icon" entry. If I am kill that, the icon removes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am going to&nbsp;<span>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup or go here throug shell:startup
 there is no entry for defender icon.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, is there any solution to remove this annoying icon? Anyway, where the **** from its come? Something is really bad in windows
 design if programs can start up without entry in common startup places.</span></p>

<p>Yeah, Destiny says that too for its individual expansions. It means that it is part of a bundle that can't be segmented into separate downloads. In short, if you want it, you have to buy the bundle that its a part of. Or that's at least how I understand
 it to work as at one point, you could buy the stand alone expansions.</p>

            <blockquote>... cursor disappears while typing. Have to reposition cursor when it reappears&nbsp;...</blockquote>
<br />
<div>I am a little confused by the terminology used in your post. The term <i>cursor</i>&nbsp;is typically used to describe the
<i>insertion point</i>&nbsp;which will move along with whatever is being typed into the document regardless of what program is being used to generate the document. I do not see how this would require re-positioning after typing has been completed.<br />
<br />
However, if you are referring to the mouse pointer, there is an option to hide its display during typing. Click
<i>Start</i>&nbsp;and type <i>mouse</i>&nbsp;but do not hit <i>Enter</i>. Choose <i>Mouse</i>&nbsp;from the list within the
<i>Control Panel</i>&nbsp;section of the list above. When the <i>Mouse Properties</i>&nbsp;dialog opens go to the
<i>Pointer Options</i>&nbsp;tab and uncheck the <i>Hide pointer while typing</i>&nbsp;option (second from bottom). Click
<i>OK</i>&nbsp;in the lower right to accept the changes.<br />
<br />
This latter option will not re-position the mouse pointer after you have completed typing, but the
<i>mouse pointer</i>&nbsp;will remain visible and the&nbsp;actual <i>insertion point</i>&nbsp;should remain where the last character was typed.</div>

            I am having the same type of problem. for instance when signing in here I would click the insertion point into the name, see the insertion point, then it would disappear, then I would click in again, then type a couple of letters, then the insertion point
 would disappear again, then type a few more letters, then the insertion point would disappear again, the i would click in again. Usually by about the third time the insertion point stays.<br />

            I find the same problem, what I notice is the screen above the window turns a&nbsp; light blue color.&nbsp; Once I left click the light blue color turns to a dark blue color.&nbsp; You may type a few letters and the screen turns a light blue again, it's like the cursor
 is on a timer, it blinks for a period of time then disappears.&nbsp; This too is driving me crazy.&nbsp; Any help?<br />

            <p>this worked well for me although my screen color never changed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix Stealing the Focus issue</p>
<p>Click on Start.</p>
<p>In the text box in the Run window, type regedit and click OK. This will open the Registry Editor program.</p>
<p>Locate the HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder under My Computer and click on the (+) sign next the folder name to expand the folder.</p>
<p>Continue to expand folders until you reach the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel registry key.</p>
<p>Select the Desktop key under Control Panel.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the screen, locate and double-click on the ForegroundLockTimeout DWORD.</p>
<p>In the Edit DWORD Value window that appears, set the Value data: field to 30d40. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Make sure the Base option is set to Hexadecimal when entering the DWORD value.</p>
<p>Click OK and then close Registry Editor.</p>
<p>Reboot your PC for the changes you made to take effect.</p>
<p>From this point forward, programs should no longer steal the focus from the window that you're currently working in.</p>

            I am having the same problems as described above - seems to be primarily when using AOL (I know, I should just chuck AOL!) &nbsp;I tried the regedit suggestion, but my data was already set to 30d40. &nbsp;So, I am still having the problem. &nbsp;Interestingly, I am having
 the same problem on 2 identical HP Elite 6000 Desktop PC's using different keyboards. &nbsp;I did not have this problem using either keyboard on other machines. &nbsp;I have tried to update keyboard drivers, but it says they are up-to-date. &nbsp;I have also deleted the
 keyboard from the Device Manager and let Windows find it again. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;This is a really frustrating problem!

            <p>This problem that is plaguing many users is certainly frustrating and thanks to many who have responded with the many possible fixes, but none have seemed to find a permanent solution. &nbsp;For me this disappearance seems to happen more when I first start up
 and then as time goes on it lessens. &nbsp;Not sure if this is just a coincidence or not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I mentioned my screen turning to a light blue then to a darker blue, I just meant that it turns to a lighter shade and only above the page I am typing in, one has to look closely to see the change, then when I left click on the page you can see again
 above the page I type in the chance from a lighter color to a slightly darker color.</p>
<p>The disappearance can happen anytime I am typing, I have tried every suggestion mentioned and no fix yet. &nbsp;As everyone has said it is a frustrating problem that will not go away no matter what we try to do.</p>
<p>we can only say that we appreciate the suggestion but keep them coming, there has to be a solution.</p>
<p>it just seems that there is a time out on the screen and left clicking on the page wakes it up again..</p>

            The best way to find out which program is 'stealing focus' and making your cursor disappear at random times is to open the 'Details' tab in Task manager and a notepad side by side. When the cursor disappears I am sure one of the program with top memory
 list will spike for a moment. Such a program for me was "adobe Creative cloud". I opened its file location and deleted it permanently. It definitely solved my problem. Hope it solves yours too.&nbsp;

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Do you get any error message while&nbsp;installing new version of Mouse and Keyboard Center?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, try to perform a clean boot and try to use the mouse and keyboard because,

<p>I am with 'Nightcaste' here - exactly the same problem. I run Win 7 64 bit and have had to dig out my old usb Trackball because of recurring carpel tunnel problems. At the beginning all was OK, I could programme the buttons of the Trackball then the M/soft
 Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center installed itself (yes) and now this keeps telling me the Trackball is not found/installed and I've lost all button functions except the basic ones. I've got the latest drivers, uninstalled then reinstalled this M&amp;K Center,&nbsp; but always
 the same issue now.</p>
<p>I have a Wacom pen pad also and I've completely uninstalled that to see if there was&nbsp;a conflict.</p>
<p>Is this some Microsoft ploy to get me to purchase the latest Trackball?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a solution or not ?</p>

I understand that you have similar issue with Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard center.<br />
<br />
But, I would&nbsp; suggest you to seek help from the hardware manufacturer and see if that helps because this issue seems to be with the hardware. Follow the link below:</p>

<p>MICROSOFT is the manufacturer of the hardware AND the software. &nbsp;My initial post that started this thread states that I did what you suggested before you suggested it, and as i said, your recommendations were irrelevant. &nbsp;The PC I built myself and has no
 other issues, and blaming it is a cop out that tells me you don't know what you're talking about. &nbsp;Please get me in touch with someone that can actually solve this problem.</p>

            <p>Attn: Nightcaste !</p>
<p>As this lady doesn't appreciate from our postings that we're not exactly computer novices and that her replies are contributing nothing to the problem - I've done some more digging around.</p>
<p>I've found a solution but you may have already tried this.</p>
<p>I now have restored all my Trackball functions by completely deleting this "Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center" and downloading Intellitype
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ver 8.2&nbsp;</span></strong> from:-</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/confirmation.aspx?id=26948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/confirmation.aspx?id=26948</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed it without deleting other mouse progs. Using the 'Mouse' in Control Panel it shows the graphic of my old Trackball and allows me to programme the buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, sorry if you've already been down this route !</p>

                    <p>I've tried everything from resetting the router in combination with xbox hard reboot and nothing I do seems to work all I get is "check your internet connection on a pc" all the computers in the house are connected no problem all the devices are connected no problem but my console won't connect at all it worked one time for a split second I was able to log in and see messages and friends than it instantly cut out again, this all happened out of the blue I was playing my game and it cut out. I checked my update status and it says update failed, but what update? I was never prompted to update, saw nothing about an update but yet my console is stuck offline. Whenever I check my connection it just says no teredo connection.... This is getting tiresome being run around in circles</p>

<p>Has anyone figured this problem out? I bought my console off someone else and they were supposedly in the program. I have been on the program since its beginning on my 360. Now my xbox one has been registered in my name and everything in my name but the
 app STILL says the console is registered under someone elses name with no option to change that. Meanwhile my console is still being updated to the newest preview OS with me not able to access the app</p>

<p>Hey there ThisguyNeil,</p>
<p>I split your thread from the other post since it was a bit older. We'd like to help with this, but we need to know what you'd like to be done. Are you looking to remove the console entirely from the preview program? Or were you wanting to register the console
 in the program under your Gamertag.</p>
<p>Please let us know!</p>

For the second time in a week or so, my PIN login option has stopped working for no explainable reason. After waking up from sleep, Win10 refuses to accept my PIN and says that the option is no longer available due to changes to the security system. I end up

    <title>Use function keys without fn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emmanueljuarez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use function keys without fn</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem. I am having trouble enabling function keys without holding the FN. It previously worked since I bought it. But this year I had to reinstall the operating system due to an infection I couldn't remove. After the reinstall, I realized that
 I can't use the volume keys and the brightness keys without using FN. FN is enabled. First I looked up the problem on my laptop's brand website, and they suggested me to download the appropriate application to enable this function. After I installed it, I
 couldn't locate it. It &nbsp;didn't even show up on Start menu, neither it showed on the search companions. Next I called the brand company's technical support. I asked the person to give me the path where the application's path, but he told me it was corrupted,
 which it's not because it shows that it's installed on the Programs and Features list. The support group offered me support with over $60, which I can't afford. He just asked me to looked up the problem myself online, but one of the solutions gave me alternate
 software to install, but it didn't work. Next I went to the Settings and I tried to find "Function Keys" but no result. I own Windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite C55.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who does know how to enable function keys WITHOUT using FN keys? I am really frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Sangeeta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either you don't know, or you are flat out lying. Every time Windows does an update it seems like it switches what keys I have to hold the Function key to use. How do I change this?</p>
