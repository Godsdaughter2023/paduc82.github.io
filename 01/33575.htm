<h2>            Mouse not working on windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>my mouse hasnt been working since the most recent update of windows 10, i have linux installed and works fine on there, and also lights up during bios. but as soon as windows 10 is loaded it just turns itself off, my keyboard works fine. before the update
 it only seemed to work in one usb port but i didnt think much of it until it no longer works in any port since the update. i have been able to use a wireless logitech mouse and works fine, all drivers are fine and up to date. anyone know the problem? Google
 doesnt seem to have the answer anywhere.</p>

            <p>i have found the mouse but its in 'other devices' and is an 'unknown device' when clicked on it shows that its called 'SAITEK Cyborg V.3 Mouse' so i tried installing the drivers for it which came to an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.<br />

<br />
The driver installation file for this device is missing a necessary entry. This may be because the INF was written for Windows 95 or later. Contact your hardware vendor.<br />
<br />
If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit its website and check the support section for driver software."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>should i contact my hardware vendor or is there another possibility?</p>

            Problem sorted, i figured out that downloading drivers from a similar design mouse seemed to work flawlessly, it appears drivers for thr old v3 mouse aren't available for windows 10.

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

    <title>Graphics Driver Crashes After Computer Wakes from Sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Graphics Driver Crashes After Computer Wakes from Sleep</h2>
                    
<p>After connecting to a smart board for the first time (I have no idea if this is the reason), my computer is unable to wake from sleep mode. It's not that it can't wake, it's that the graphics driver won't function after it wakes. The log in screen doesn't
 show up correctly and my computer crashes if I wait too long to log in. If I do log in, the screen flickers a few times with the background turning black and the icons and taskbar coming in and out of view, but the screen eventually turns black, followed by
 the blue "...to prevent further damage" screen. I've tried updating the drivers, but there apparently haven't been any updates in a while.&nbsp;My computer is able to recover from hibernate mode perfectly fine, but this is getting a little old. Any suggestions?</p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to uninstall any installed driver updates and update the latest graphics drivers from the manufacturer website to resolve the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1: Uninstall the Drivers software from Program and Features.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To &nbsp;<strong>uninstall the driver’s software</strong> follow the steps provided below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on start</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type”
 uninstall</span></span><span><span> a program” in windows search bar and press ENTER</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Search
 for the Graphic card software and uninstall it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also refer to the link provided below for more information on how to uninstall a program in Windows 7:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also uninstall the device drivers from Device manager. To do so follow the steps mentioned below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on start</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the windows search bar type Device Manager and press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Scroll
 down and search for Display Adapter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double
 click on the Display Adapter you will have the display device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Now
 right click on the display device and click on uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Restart the system after you uninstall the device drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to download the latest drivers for your chipset from the manufacturer’s website. You can also refer to the link provided below to update
 the drivers in Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Hardware Acceleration.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If updating the Video card drivers does not completely eliminate any graphics rendering problems, then it is a good idea to
 turn off the&nbsp; <strong>computer’s hardware acceleration</strong>. Not all drivers support disabling hardware acceleration. To disable hardware acceleration on your computer, perform the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>a)</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>Click
 Start, select Control Panel, click Appearance and Personalization, click Personalization, click Display Settings, and then click Advanced Settings.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>b)</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click
 the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change Settings.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>c)</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>Move
 the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of none. This is the basic acceleration setting.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>d)</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click
 OK twice, and then close the window</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player can not modify any MP3 or WMA metadata tags</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I updated my laptop to the latest version of Windows 10 (1803 build 17134.1 fr-FR), I can not anymore modify any MP3 or WMA metadata tags using Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All files are owned under my account, so there is not access problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player sees the files and can play them, but this application can not add album art covers, or any metadata for supported audio files like MP3 and WMA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is broken with the 1803 build 17134.1 fr-FR?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried to rebuild the database, but no way, do not improve the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>
<p>

            For what it's worth, the issue of the missing horizontal scroll bar can probably be fixed easily by clicking on one of the column headers (such as

Hide columns automatically</strong>, and pressing <strong>OK</strong>.

    <title>Problems with Windows booting after aniversary update with ubuntu dual - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Windows booting after aniversary update with ubuntu dual boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
So I run an ubuntu Dual boot with Windows 10, as its easier to finish several assignments with linux tools.&nbsp; My dual boot was working fine until after the aniversary update, which caused my computer to no longer be able to use the windows partition.<br />
<br />
I did a factory reset, and it worked fine for a week, before giving me a new error:<br />
<br />
0xc0000098 file:\bcd error code&nbsp;indicating that "PC needs to be repaired. Boot configuration data file doesn't contain valid information for an operating system.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I can do another factory reset, its kicking the can down the road, and also as a student, there are programs on that boot that I would need to obtain a new license for.<br />
I've tried some fixes, but would appreciate any possible fixes for this.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
Ubuntu works.&nbsp; I can mount any windows partition on ubuntu<br />
My computer is an XPS L521X<br />
Processor is an Intel COre i7<br />
Could anyone help?</p>

<h2>            The Pen for my hanvon tablet stops working</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a tablet for drawing and writing. It is an external which is connected through USB. Having upgraded to windows 10, windows report that my tablet works fine. And it is. .. because I can open the program associated with this tablet and I can also draw
 using my ordinary mouse to that tablet program. I also checked inside the hardware information in the windows. And every thing is also fixed well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the problem now, the pen of this tablet cannot be used anymore. I cannot draw using ordinary mouse. I need my pen badly. Can somebody advice me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh ya, I have also asked the windows to find the latest driver for this hanvon tablet. And the windows said after some minutes that the driver installed now in my laptop is already the last and the best one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            You posted in the section ‘Windows Phone’ which is about mobile phones based on that operating system. From you description, sounds like you are using Windows 10 for computers. Because the built-in driver update does not work for all manufactures: Are
 you on the <a href="http://www.hanvon.com/en/products/tablets/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest version</a>? If yes: What does Hanvon Support say about this?

<p>The issue with my desktop is very strange when i minimize a window i can't click on anything else, i use the shortcut keys or task manager to open and move tasks but, minimizing a windows leaves my desktop useless. When I'm on a window the task bar works
 but the same thing happens when i minimize something, cant click on anything, but if i click on the desktop view button on the task bar the desktop works it seems like the is something in the background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I Had the same problem a week ago. The cause was due to clicking on updating AOL in order for it to work. I meant to click on no and well, you know what happened.</p>
<p>I am sure there are other ways to fix it. But I ran my Super AntiSpyware Pro and the problem went away. Nothing else that I have fixed it.</p>
<p>Take care!</p>

<p>You might be able to download a trial Version. But I am sure it won't fix it unless you pay for it. I bought it a few years ago because I had problems with my computer and it was the only thing that found anything wrong and it fixed it. a friend let me use
 his code. So after it did fix it, I paid for my own code.</p>

<p>It is obviously some sort of Malware problem, as the above poster mentioned.</p>
<p>Use the following tools to fix it:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;These are all free:</span></p>
<p><span>Setup:</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>This will check for malware, AND registry key errors, or so most of the forums say. &gt;.&gt;</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>You can download the free version and it will check for spyware as well</span></p>

<p><span>This is a GREAT AV it works EXTREMELY well in conjunction for the above.</span></p>

<p>I have the same problem and it just started. I downloaded malwarebytes, but it found no issues. I have Norton 360 and also ran numerous scans with that.&nbsp; Also tried reinstalling aol, in case a file was corrupted. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p><span>You should not be paying for any antimalware programs, if in the first place you have reputable programs like KISS, ZASS, EST NOD32, and Symantec Enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me that the problem is with your AOL installation. o.aolcdn.com is AOL's update site, which I think would not allow any other program to connect except AOL.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are two proposed solutions:<br />
<strong><span>Solution-A:</span></strong><br />
(1) Seek help from AOL Tech Support. Ask them how to properly and completely remove AOL and re-install.&nbsp; Ask them if they have a Script or Uninstall Program<br />
<strong><span>Solution-B:</span></strong><br />
(1) Go to Control Panel, Add\Remove Programs. Uninstall AOL.<br />
(2) Remove all traces of AOL from Registry <br />
(3) Remove all AOL files from locations such as: (a) windows\system32\drivers (b) Windows\System32 (c) Program Files (d) Program Files\Common Files (e) %Userprofile%\AppData<br />
(4) Restart the computer and see if there are any missing locations that you forgot to remove AOL files<br />
(5) Backup registry using <strong><span>ERUNT</span></strong>:<a href="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/</a><br />
(6) <strong><span>Re-install AOL</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>You can use RegAlyzer to quickly find AOL entries in Registry:<br />

    <title>Windows 7 search does not find one particular file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radiophile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 search does not find one particular file</h2>
                    <p>I have a file that Search just won't find. I can view the file with Windows Explorer and type its exact filename into the Explorer search box; it says "No items match your search." But I can see the file right there in front of me in the Explorer window.
 The folder that contains this file is indexed. I can find other files in this folder by either filename or content. I've Googled a bit to find a solution without success. Here's what I've tried or looked at:</p>
<p>- I've rebuilt the search index (from the Indexing Options dialog)</p>
<p>- I've looked at the file's properties dialog. The Security tab has SYSTEM in the 'Group or user names' list. Security tab &gt; Advanced &gt; Owner shows that I am the owner. (The current owner string, 'John (John-E6410\John)', exactly matches the string in other
 files that are successfully searched.)</p>
<p>- I've moved the file to another location (my desktop, which is indexed). Search couldn't find it there either. I moved it back to its original folder and Search still can't find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one thing that happened to this particular file that just might be a clue, but I would've thought that what I've checked above would have revealed any problems. The thing is, this file has taken a little trip. I emailed it to my spouse, she modified
 it and emailed it back to me, whereupon I put it back in its original folder. I recall that after doing this, the Properties dialog had a warning: "This file came from another computer and might be blocked..." I clicked the Unblock button right next to this
 warning, and rebuilt my Search index again. Search will still not find this file.</p>

            <p>The search and indexing troubleshooter said "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already found the page <em>Why aren't files from an indexed folder showing up in search results?,</em> which advises to make sure SYSTEM has permissions for the folder.&nbsp;System permission was already there when I checked, and anyway, the problem is
 not with the folder, it's with <strong>one particular file</strong> in the folder. As I said&nbsp;in my first post above, other files in this folder are found successfully by filename or content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sfc /scannow finsihed with "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations." But I rebooted anyway, per your instructions. It didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Syed for trying to help and taking the time to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But wait!</strong> I found another clue to this problem. I keep a synchronized (with SyncToy 2.1) copy of all my data directories on another PC. I just now tried this search on that other PC, and<strong> Search can't find this file (and, again, only
 this file) on that PC either</strong>. So this test would seem to prove that the problem with Search finding this file is related to some characteristic of this particular file, and not the PC. Still, I've looked at some of the file properties and they seem
 okay. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on other properties of this file to check. Something is causing Search to ignore this file completely.</p>

<p>2. I did as you instructed. Here's what was displayed"</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\Documents\Excel\Test12341234.xlsx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it. Just that one line. I did a "help attrib" and see that this line tells us that it does not have system, hidden or not-content-indexed attributes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I also did one more troubleshooting step. I took this file, and another .xlsx file from this folder that is searchable by filename and contents, and right clicked on them both, bringing up each file's Properties dialog. I positioned both Properties
 dialogs side by side and compared them, every tab, every "advanced" button, etc. I looked at all the words in all the windows and fields displayed. They are identical in every respect (except the filename itself). I was pretty careful, and I don't think I
 missed anything.</p>

            <p>It would appear that I have stumped the experts. I'm disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my last post, I got a new computer, also running Windows 7 except this time the 64-bit version. I copied over all my data files manually. After using the new computer for a few days so Search would have time to build its new index, I found that the
 problem persisted as before. Search would never find this particular file, by filename or content, even when I was staring right at it in the Explorer window, even when it would find all my other files in this and other folders without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I used Excel to make a new blank file with Excel, and I gave it a similar name. I copied the contents of the troublesome file into it. Search finds this new file, by filename or contents, without a problem.</p>

<h2>            Copy and Paste only works intermitently when copying files</h2>
                    When I am copying files from one drive to another or even one folder to another using File Explorer sometimes copy &amp; paste works and sometimes it doesn't. I highlight the files I want to copy and right click and select copy and sometimes the paste button
 on the toolbar at the top becomes active and other times it stays grayed out so when you go to paste the files to the new folder paste is not an option when you right click. There doesn't seem to be any set of&nbsp; circumstances that I can identify that causes
 this to happen one time and not the next.

<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this,

<p>I ran the sfc /scannow and it did not find any problems but restarted anyway and it is working right now but almost always works after restarting, just would like to find out why it doesn't work consistently as often it is a hassle to have to restart if
 you are working on a few different things at the time. Next time it doesn't work I'll try running the other commands you posted or do you think I should just run them now considering the first one did not find any issues?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just copied a very large number of files to a USB drive and now was going to move some of those files from one holder to another and again the paste does not become active and stays grayed out. I'll try the other command above to see if it finds anything
 unless you have another suggestion.</p>

I will try the above suggestions. If I understand correctly the repair upgrade will not affect any data and more importantly will not require reinstallation of all of my programs/apps? I understood there were two options, a clean install or a reset which would
 keep your data but not the installed programs/apps, so is this repair upgrade a&nbsp;fairly new option as from everything I have read there is no way to essentially reinstall without losing your installed programs? The main reason I ask is I have another computer
 experiencing an issue where it will start to boot just fine&nbsp; but after the Windows logo goes away during the boot and just before you would expect the desktop to appear it freezes. I can get into safe mode and have tried numerous things to try to solve this
 problem so wonder if the repair upgrade would fix this issue? The problem started after an upgrade last Nov or Dec and have not had a chance to do anymore with it. Sorry to kind of hijack my own thread but perhaps I can solve two problems today.

</p><p>Just another question, if the clipboard was not clearing itself, would the paste button not stay "lit" indicating there is data of files on the clipboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to add something that occurred last night and may or may not provide more information to help diagnose the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hard drive with a large number of folders and files as well as videos and pictures. I copied the entire contents of one of the folders which had several folders and about 15,000 files and 900gb of data and it copied and pasted just fine. I then
 wanted to move one of the folders from within this folder to another folder on the drive however highlighting it and either selecting move or copy did nothing and the paste stayed greyed out&nbsp; I then went back to the original drive I copied from and selected
 that folder and copy and went to the new drive and selected paste and it worked just fine so found that very odd. Of course copying it from the original drive would copy all of the files again which are already on the drive just in a folder that I do not want
 it in and to be able to move it from one folder to another folder on the new drive would only take a couple of seconds as it does not require actually copying the files a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried the repair upgrade on my other computer that has been having the issues and received the message shown in the attached screen capture. I would have to assume at least some of the Windows installations that have issues that need to be repaired would
 not be able to boot into Windows so why the repair upgrade would not repair those operating systems seems rather odd. If I can boot into windows there are other utilities that can help you solve your problems like sfc and dism but when you cannot boot into
 Windows you have very few options so installing a repair upgrade from installation media would seem the logical solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can boot into safe mode but this disk will not do a repair install from safe mode. I can't boot into safe mode with networking so can't try uninstalling the current update that originally caused the current issues. Is there anyway to download updates that
 have been released since the one that caused the problem last Dec and install them from a flash drive and see if that corrects the problem, or is there anyway to uninstall the update that caused the problem remembering I can't access the internet? I tried
 going to windows update and it just&nbsp;keeps showing checking for updates and 20 hours later continues to show&nbsp;checking for updates so not sure how I can use it to uninstall the update that caused the issues. I also had created two restore points before updating
 and it wiped out all of the previous updates with the exception of one that it created AFTER doing the update. It wasn't just that computer that had all of it's restore point wiped as I checked my laptop after discovering the restore points were wiped and
 it was the same with my laptop.</p>

<h2>            Bandwidth Usage</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not sure if it is a glitch in the Bandwidth Usage screen, background downloads or updates ( I have nothing in the Download Queue that i am not aware of or another issue, but my xbox one has been using an extremely high amount of bandwidth in the few
 days ( at least 2-3GB in the last 12 hours alone )whereas a month ago i used less than that in a week. I haven't really been playing all that many games online( Mainly just Warframe but I don't have a way of checking how much it is using), i don't stream video
 or music and i haven't been downloading anything. Is this abnormal or am I just noticing this just now? I thank anyone in advance for reading and replying to this, and apologise if i posted it in the wrong section of the forums.</p>

<p>Is there any way you can check your ISP or router information to see how much bandwith you use? (for example I have this website of my ISP and on that website it tells me exactly how much bandwith I have used). Or maybe contact them on the phone to find
 out. That way you can check if it's a visual glitch.</p>
<p>If it's not, it is indeed weird that your Xbox uses so much bandwith IF you aren't doing anything at all. If you are then it is completely normal. I have used hundreds of GB of bandwith already just by watching Twitch alot.</p>
<p>It might also be that you are using internet while running an app or game of multiplayer in the background. If you play a game that uses internet and you press the home button and go ahead and do something else on your Xbox, that game still runs without
 you noticing and it might eat bandwith. To stop this, hover over the app or game, click start (a list of options appear) and press close app/game.</p>
<p>One more tip I can give you (if you haven't already) is to put the Xbox on Energy Saving mode instead of Standby Mode. That way the Xbox doesn't use internet while being turned off.</p>

    <title>How to stop Windows 10 from automatic updates and automatic restarts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kibler22  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Windows 10 from automatic updates and automatic restarts</h2>
                    <p>I have been a Microsoft supporter for years but I'm about fed up with Windows 10 automatic updates and automatic restarts.&nbsp; I have to turn the networks I'm usually on to "metered" connections so I don't get automatic updates but then my outlook doesn't send
 work related emails because I need to click on an option to send my email even on a metered network and if I forget then my clients do not receive time sensitive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I do a lot of multi-tasking so I have many windows open and have multiple art files open, and when a stupid update gets downloaded and restarts my computer I lose HOURS of information from the reboot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm honestly pretty fed up with Microsoft FORCING me to download an update but moreso because it FORCES my computer to restart.&nbsp; Is there an answer to I can disable the automatic restart?&nbsp; If not, my 20 year dedication to Microsoft is over and I'm moving
 everything to Mac.&nbsp; I'm severely disgusted at the lack of user control on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure there are forums that address these but unfortunately I do not have time because I need to put it into re-doing everything I lose from these stupid restarts and updates.</p>

<p>I stumbled on this question 3 minutes ago after Windblows update rebooted in the middle of a 26 hour 3d print and seriously screwed up my z axis motors and print job due their FORCED reboot, anyone know how to shut it off?.&nbsp; I too was an ardent MS supporter
 since Windows 3.1 and a VB VC VS SQL SERVER programmer since 95...&nbsp; Now I am wondering if it's finally time for a look at Linux or something else.</p>

            I have to agree although Windows auto updates don't affect me negatively. I understand the vast ecosystem of Windows users. Many who have differing needs that require updates to be delayed sometimes given their needs. This one size fits all approach is
 not allowing for users to decide how they receive updates and when they should upgrade to a newer version of Windows 10. The end result is frustration and even upgrading to Win 10 Pro doesn't solve every users needs to control updates. For myself the updates
 have not created much problems but minor issues, but have worked with clients who have experienced significant issues with forced updates. Going back with regression options does little because Windows update will just force the updates again. Leaving little
 options but to try Win 10 Pro, or move back to Windows 7 for more control with updates. For some users its come down to moving to Mac OS or a Linux OS to simply move past Windows altogether. I got Fall Creator update on one PC that wasn't even approved to
 get it or support it by the PC maker. How is it I get the update when the PC doesn't support it? Obviously if the PC maker will not support it fully, then any issues with it will result in the PC maker telling me to uninstall a unsupported version of Windows
 10. How can I do that if it will only install it again in a update? <br />

</p><p>Hey there... I just ordered a used computer on ebay with Windows 7 on it to run my printers, WAY WORTH the $100.&nbsp; I also just bought a hard drive for another to install Linux on, stay tuned.&nbsp; BTW, I hate Linux more than hell itself, but in this case there
 are no other options.&nbsp; Funny that MS can sell the OEM hardware Win CE flavors to companies but not individuals.&nbsp; Can you imagine if they blew up an entire manufacturing facility with one of their excrement loaded botched updates?</p>

<p>On the 23rd October what was said** to be&nbsp;Fall Creators &amp; other WUs were installed. Immediately afterwards I had the&nbsp;BSOD (not that I'm blaming it - that seems to upsets some experts here). Thankfully I had just bought a new cheap laptop as a backup in case
 this happened, so I was able to get help using that and a Clean Install was recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still frantically reinstalling my programs - sorry, an age thing, my Apps - and all my lost&nbsp; documents (lost but still the in clouds and on File History).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the last thing I want at the minute is to be "rescued" by Patch Tuesday's Cumulative WU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've accidently found a low-tech way to stop the CWU - I have a slideshow running on my desktop. It seems that this keeps going 24/7 and has kept the CWU at bay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, low tech but it's still working for me! Try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>** PS AN MS-badged employee has told me he thinks that I didn't get Fall Creators (or what was called Creators Fall WU) but a test version. Test version??? Cripes.</p>

<p>I typed this reply 3 times, my browser keeps crashing because answers.microsoft.com runs some @#*&amp;$#$ script that hangs and redirects infinitely so it takes my browser with it and because the site doesn't just show a text box there is no text to restore,
 because if you ever do a site that takes user input make sure it's built with concepts like looks and style in mind, not users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reduced to Ctrl+C every 30 seconds. Like in 1995. Because simply putting up a phpbb would have too many features. Who rolls out a site that locks up Edge, Chrome and Firefox?
<strong>ANYWAY</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) You can use Global Policy to disable updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Advantages: Legal, kinda works.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Disadvantages: Microsoft sees that you told it not not install, but will install anyway if there is a major update because middle finger to anyone who paid money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If you can live with a restart every 6 months or so, this is the way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; - GPEdit.msc</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Notify before downloading</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Notify before installing</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Do not restart while user is logged on. (All named ironically, I assume)</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Advanced. Kill Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Advantages: Will not update.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Disadvantages: May have minor side effects, like not updating drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; - Disable Windows Update and BITS services. (Guides abundant; Google "Disable Windows Update service", use registry the latest version ignores policy)</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) Master: Kill access to Windows Update Services</p>
<p>&nbsp; Advantages: Will not update, period</p>
<p>&nbsp; Disadvantages: May encounter random xxxxx005 errors in your logs as it tries to desperately bypass what you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; - Look up online "Disable access to wuauserv.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) Grandmaster: Kill them in the firewall</p>
<p>&nbsp; Advantages: No patching will fix that. As long as you don't update again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Disadvantages: Almost none. May complain it hasn't been updated every few months. You can disable the notification. Google "Disable Windows Update firewall"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Warning: On-site cheap firewalls use Windows Filtering Platform to filter packets and Microsoft may just bypass that because they have no concept of respecting user
<del>settings</del> suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) Guru: Malform local storage to think it's up to date</p>
<p>&nbsp; Advantages: Windows update, as annoying as it is, is such a fragile thing. You learn a lot as an admit trying to fix it and a nice database corruption simply can't be fixed unless you actively debug it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Disadvantages: None. Windows Update components run, look for updates, find nothing, hum along.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is too complex to attempt on your own via a forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; But whatever you do, do NOT risk your genuine Windows installation by installing some tune that fixes Windows Update by some guru. That would be a silly risk to take. An installation not built by Microsoft may send data to other parties, watch what you
 type, track you, serve you ads and simply ignore instructions to uninstall, as opposed to the genuine article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Remember: Just because you purchased a product and they can change it after you paid doesn't mean you can revert it to what it was when you purchased it. That is immoral and against TOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; It may work well on the surface, and it may be ideal for virtual machines, cloning, mission critical boxes and routers and services, but the risk is huge.</p>

<p>Well, all wanted to tell you the trick, not sure if it works for you the way it almost working for me since a long term.</p>
<p>But let me describe a review before saying a solution. Actually i'm&nbsp;<span>fed up too badly, I bought new system today, installed fresh 1703 updated till oct from USB. it was all good trust me, But unfortunately my system's Video controller was missing and
 I searched but found nothing, so I thought let me give it a try to update windows to get that driver, My bad, this is my bad, I was useless I was hopeless I was sitting infront of desktop like a stupid who keep sucking his fingers for entire 5 hours to get
 a 40MB video controller thing with a good internet connection. Honestly when I saw updated history, the driver was updated at 4th minute when updating was started and entire 4 hours and 56 minutes was wasted to get stupid 1709??? It's overall storage nearly
 6GB. that's insane!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So now we are going to keep both OS'es into System partition and 1703 shall stand useless???? I mean what does it mean to Lose storage and keep that 1703 along with 1709 if 1709 going work overall???? Any answer Microsoft??</span></p>

</p><p><strong>And why didn't you Stopped 1703 where it was last updated. And release Standalone 1709 to keep your experiments on and release new updates. My opinion, MS should leave 1703 separate from 1709. and if they keep giving touch to huge updates then better
 to Release new OS. That's all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How disable Updates:</strong></p>
<p>1. Go to &gt; control panel &gt; Administrative tools &gt; Services &gt; Find ''Windows Update'' &gt; Double click &gt; Windows Update &gt; General tab &gt; Press Stop &gt; Disable Update from drop down menu &gt; Click&nbsp; Apply &gt; Recovery tab &gt; Select &amp; mark &gt;
 Take no action &lt; from top 3 options list. and Insert &gt; 0 &lt; into &gt; Reset fail count after. Press Apply &gt; Ok. That's all. I'm sure you will see the difference!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember me in your prayers! Good luck!</p>
