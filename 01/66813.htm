<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><i>Hi, I am currently running Vista Business with sp2 installed and for reasons I won't go into here, I need to upgrade to Vista Ultimate.
</i></span></p>
<p><span>I have a copy of Vista Ultimate full retail version with SP1, but when I try to upgrade, it only offers me the clean install option, because it says the Business version I'm currently using is actually newer than the Ultimate I'm trying to upgrade
 to.</span></p>
<p><span>Is it as simple as uninstalling the SP2 from my Vista business, and trying the install again, or would it be simpler using the specific Vista Business &gt; Vista Ultimate upgrade pack?Help!</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It tells you that you have a newer version already installed because of the Vista&nbsp;Business Edition already having SP2 installed (that is the newer version).</p>
<p>If you uninstall SP2 &gt; do the Upgrade to Ultimate&nbsp;&gt; then reinstall SP2, that should solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Hello, and thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>I'm guessing from what you've said that it will have no problems upgrading from "same age" updated systems, ie Vista Business sp1 to Vista Ultimate sp1.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>To be quite honest with you ,&nbsp;I have never been a great fan of uninstalling / reinstalling Service Packs to Upgrade; just in case of problems. But, in most cases it does work correctly and unless you want to clean install again right from the start&nbsp;uninstalling&nbsp;SP2&nbsp;is
 the way to go.</p>
<p>And yes if they are both the same Service Pack number, it should upgrade with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have had Vista Business installed for a while I would make sure you do a Backup first; which is a standard recommendation when you do any major work&nbsp;on an Operating System</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Microsoft does not make the images available for download for the general public and I don't recommend a pirate site.&nbsp;Vista with SP2 integrated is still available to MSDN and TechNet subscribers but that probably doesn't help you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you have Vista Business retail dvds then you can try removing service pack 1 as well and then use the dvd to do a repair install.&nbsp; It is likely some catalog file is corrupted and a repair install is one way to fix that.&nbsp; That would not require reinstalling
 everything after the upgrade.</p>
<p>If your copy is OEM you can only use the recovery disk and that requires reinstalling everything&nbsp;after the upgrade to&nbsp;Ultimate.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, with Ultimate reaching end of support on April 10th,&nbsp;is there any&nbsp;way that you can avoid doing the upgrade?&nbsp; Vista Business will continue to receive updates&nbsp;into 2017.&nbsp; If you require Ultimate for Bitlocker or multi-language support
 then have you considered Windows 7 Ultimate instead of Vista Ultimate?&nbsp; My concern would be about not getting any more critical security updates after April.</p>

<p>Are you sure that you are using the same "bit" version for both Vista Editions?</p>
<p>And look at Start &gt; right click Computer &gt; left click Properties to make sure that it now&nbsp;says Vista Business Service Pack 1.</p>

<p>In answer to your Ultimate SP2 question,if you have a tech savvy mind, you can slipstream SP2; it is a bit complicated:</p>

<p>Or save your Data &gt; do a clean install of Ultimate as you have a full Retail License for it.</p>

            <p>Well firstly, thanks for all your replies. </p>
<p>To answer one or two queries, I don't have the original install Windows DVD, but I do know for sure it was&nbsp;a&nbsp;retail version of&nbsp;Vista business with SP1.</p>
<p>We are absolutely dealing with 32 bit in all aspects.</p>
<p>Having uninstalled SP2 with no issues, I can confirm my "system" now shows as Windows Vista Business SP1.</p>
<p>The reason I&nbsp;wish, or need to upgrade, is to keep hold of a working program within my original system for which I have no media. If I get really stuck, my fallback is to upgrade to 7 Ultimate,&nbsp;but several programs I&nbsp;use daily&nbsp;are not supported in 7, which
 would mean&nbsp;creating a multi o/s hard drive. I am considering this, but to just go from Business to Ultimate within Vista would be the ideal answer.</p>
<p>I know people slag Vista, but I use it at work, and providing you have all the updates and security patches, I find it works with no issues.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for your help,</p>
<p>J.</p>

<p>As to why it is not working; it is a mystery.</p>
<p>Microsoft's standard replies to this would be to disconnect all peripherals, printer, etc only leaving Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse connected, disable or even uninstall your Anti Virus and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;Colin Barnhurst's advice&nbsp;about a problem with the files in your Vista Business that is preventing the Upgrade, you could&nbsp;try a Repair Install for that Vista Business Installation and see if that fixes it.</p>
<p>The Retail License Disk will contain files to reinstall the different Vista Editions (Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate.</p>
<p>The Product Key determines which Edition gets installed.</p>
<p>Here is the way to do a Repair Upgrade Installation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: you may have to do a phone Activation after doing the above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be getting more complicated whereby you may run into more problems&nbsp;and I have run out of ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't you contact the Manufacturer and ask them to send you Media for that particular Program?</p>
<p>If you can:</p>
<p>There are ways to run non compatible Windows 7 Programs in Windows 7, but we don't get into that in Vista Forums.</p>
<p>If you wish to enquire about Windows 7 and that particular Program's ability to work in Windows 7, you could ask in&nbsp;this Forum:</p>

<h2>            windows live mail keeps prompting me for password but password is correct</h2>
                    One day Windows Live Mail started prompting me for my password. It never did that before. Now I cant&nbsp;send or receive e&nbsp;mail because it doesnt recognize the correct password. The pop up box keeps coming up over and over asking me for my password even though
 I keep entering the correct password each time. Microsoft wants $99.00 to fix it. I am running Windows 7.&nbsp; Is this program a piece of junk or what? Is there another comparable program I can run besides internet mail? What is the fix for this problem? Microsoft
 has the fix but wants $99.00 for it.

<p>So you say. I haven't in all the years I've been helping users with this program come across a case where Windows Update has caused sign-in or log-on problems in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;I have no personal experience of the program on Vista or W8.1, but since
 the support newsgroups and forums have always been OS-independent, I think I'd have heard if this was a&nbsp;known problem. It doesn't sound as if there's anything for Microsoft to find a solution to.</p>

            No, Firefox does not have such a feature. &nbsp;The Mozilla development community is more than welcome to create this feature if they want to though, nothing in Windows blocks them from doing it the same way IE does.

Avoiding Such Corruption in Future:</p>
<p>- Don't use Inbox or Sent Items to archive messages.&nbsp; Move them to local folders created for this purpose.</p>
<p>- Empty Deleted Items folder daily.</p>
<p>- Frequently perform a manual compact of all OE folders while "working offline".&nbsp; More at
<a href="http://www.insideoe.com/files/maintain.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.insideoe.com/files/maintain.htm</a></p>
<p>- Do not cancel Automatic Compacting, should it occur, and do not attempt to close OE via Task Manager or shutdown your machine if Automatic Compacting is taking place.</p>
<p>- Disable email scanning by your anti-virus application.&nbsp; It can cause corruption (i.e., loss of messages) and provides no additional protection:</p>

<p>Caroline SC'Has anyone answered your question about how to restore .dbx files?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
The two most common reasons for what you describe is disruption of the compacting process, (never touch anything until it's finished), or bloated folders. More on that below.</p>
<p>Why does OE insist on compacting folders when I close it?:<br />

<p>Recovery methods:</p>
<p>If you are running XP/SP2, or SP3, and are fully patched, then you should have a backup of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, (or possibly the message store), copied as bak files.</p>
<p>To restore a bak folder to the message store folder, first find the location of the Message Store.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, the .dbx files are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>Close OE and then in Windows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the missing, or empty, folder and drag it to the Desktop. It can be deleted later once you have successfully restored the bak file. Minimize the Message Store.</p>
<p>Open OE and, if the folder is missing, create a folder with the *exact* same name as the bak file you want to restore but without the .bak. Eg: If the file is Saved.bak, the new folder should be named Saved. Open the new folder and then close OE. If the
 folder is there, but just empty, continue on to the next step.</p>
<p>First, check if there is a bak file already in the message store. If there is, and you removed the dbx file, go ahead and rename it to dbx.</p>
<p>If it isn't already in the message store, open the Recycle bin and right click on the bak file for the folder in question and click Restore. Open the message store back up and change the file extension from .bak to .dbx. Close the message store and open
 OE. The messages should now be back in the folder.</p>
<p>If the messages are successfully restored, you can go ahead and delete the old dbx file that you moved to the Desktop.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you do not have bak copies of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, then:</p>
<p>DBXpress run in Extract From Disk Mode is the best chance to recover messages:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p>And see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4</a></p>
<p>A general warning to help avoid this in the future:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Startup - screen flicker, no advanced options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Startup - screen flicker, no advanced options</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Apologies if this is listed in the wrong sub-category. It seems to be multiple categories)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Envy 15. I updated several days ago to the Windows 10 creators update with no issue. I use HP Simple Pass and have a biometric scanner on my laptop. Since the update, on initial startup, the biometric scanner worked fine. But since the Windows
 10 features update if I put the laptop to sleep, the scanner wouldn't work. I updated the biometric drivers (Validity Sensor Drivers), this had no effect. I updated HP SimplePass with no effect. I then troubleshooted using HP Support Assistant which suggested
 I download the HP Identity Protection software. I did so and restarted my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The startup takes far longer than it should. When it starts up, the lock screen appears normal. When I click the screen to go onto the login screen, my account photo does not appear, the password field does not appear and I have no login options (use fingerprint/use
 PIN). The screen repeatedly flickers between lock screen, that same login screen, and a blank screen (which would ordinarily be the windows blue colour, but I changed the customisation settings so it is now red).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two different Microsoft support agents have tried to help me start my laptop in Safe Mode. I cannot get to the Safe Mode/Advanced Startup Options. I have tried pressing Shift+Restart, Ctrl+shift+restart, and looked through the HP Startup Menu options. I
 have a Windows 10 ISO file on a 16GB USB but the HP Boot Options do not have it listed as an available boot option - I have the OS option and Boot from EFI File. I cannot press 'restart' most of the time because before I am able to, the screen changes to the
 lock screen/blank screen on its own before I can press restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing this issue and how on earth do I fix it? At most I'd like to just resume using my laptop and have it work normally but, at worst, how can I move my files from my laptop to a USB so I can reset my laptop to factory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Grif,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate you providing us those very helpful information.<br />
<br />
Since you can use your ISO file, let's get your BIOS setup be changed to make your USB ports as the primary boot. This will enable your PC to use the flash drive with your
<strong>Media Creation Tool</strong> to be able to restore your PC. You may contact your laptop manufacturer for assistance on the "changing your BIOS setup" part.<br />
<br />
While you can then click the "<strong>Use installation media to restore your PC</strong>" from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow the steps on how to create the installation media or the
<strong>Media Creation Tool</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens next.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.
        </p>

<h2>            Left 4 Dead or Dead Rising&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just started playing Xbox only a few months and just joined Live. I was wondering which Zombie game series was better, Left 4 Dead or Dead Rising? I've heard good things about both, but can't decide. Any suggestions/comments? Also, I'm looking for new
 Xbox Live buddies, so feel free to send me an add request :) Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Welcome ShadowKiss93! &nbsp;Left 4 Dead or Dead Rising? I would choose Dead Rising. You should also look up a game called Dead Island, looks like another fun zombie game.

<p>I own both games, and both games are great. L4D is a online experience, and dead rising is more a single player game. If I had to pick one, I would say L4D.</p>
<p>It has been awhile since i have played L4D, so I am not sure what the community on there is like, but I have been thinking of playing it again. I enjoyed both L4D games. Dead Rising had its pros and cons. I like it, but know a lot who did not like it. &nbsp;Dead
 Rising 2 does have 2 player co op online, but that is it.</p>
<p>L4D is a much more intense zombie game, which requires teamwork to survive. Playing on expert is the ultimate challenge, and a lot of fun with a good team. I have met a lot of good people, but like any online game, there are a lot of idiots on there as well.
 You can get both now pretty cheap. I suggest get L4D and later down the road get DR.</p>

<p>Left 4 dead 2 is a good multiplayer shooter much better than playing CoD although i did eventually get a bit bored of it and took it back (though i sometimes feel in the mood for a game) and Dead rising 2 is a great single player/co-op zombie slashing game,
 theres not much of a story (more than L4D) but its fun to just go around killing zombies with anything you can get your hands on. i also took DR2 back aswel but i will be getting DR2:OTR when it comes out.</p>
<p>Personally i would suggest Dead Rising 2, but its also worth picking up L4D2 aswel there both pretty cheap now any way.</p>

<p>You want zombies? What about Alien Zombies? Try <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Dead-Space/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80245410857?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

2</a>. These are my favorite games on the xbox, there is not a single thing about either of them that I
<i>don't</i> like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They do have a story, so it would be nice to play the first one, well, first. It would help you understand more, but if you really must get 2 before 1, it would still be a great experience.</p>

<p>I loved the minimal quest markers...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am just glad they didn't go as extreme as Dark Souls was with the "no handholding" I was so lost in Dark Souls for the longest time...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This game had the right amount of verbal hints and info logged in the journal to figure out everything you need to.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>About those quest markers...I've noticed several times now that the quest marker on the main map, and the arrow on the mini-map, indicate that I need to go in completely different directions.&nbsp; It seems like the icon on the main map sometimes gets stuck and
 doesn't update to the real location of where I need to go, until I start walking in the general direction of where the arrows are pointing on my mini-map.&nbsp; Then after a minute or so, it'll update with the correct location.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Speaking of the mini-map, I've also had it where I've been in a cave, and when I come out of the cave, instead of the mini-map updating to show me the main overworld surroundings, it stays stuck on the cave map.&nbsp; Only way to get it to change was to save
 the game and reload it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But these are really just minor issues...overall I'm absolutely loving the game.&nbsp; I think it may just be the best and most engaging storyline of any RPG I've ever played.</p>

<h2>            Desktop windows manager disabled&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>After i installed a game and Vista theme on my windows 7 , the aero was disabled.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I tried many solutions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. uninstalled the Project IGI game and also the vista theme.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. tried RegEdit and then CMD with UAC.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. tried services.msc, but WDM is already enabled.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; the above all processes were in vain. Is any body here to help me now.</strong></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A little suggestion, Did you try a system restore? Before the problem arised and see if it resolves your problem? Perhaps the vista theme you installed messed up a bit with your registry or something like this.</p>

<p>Did you try to do new system rating?</p>

<p><span>Have you looked in Event Viewer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the

<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>

<h2>            Brink - What do people think&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Got this game yesterday and first impressions were good, played the first game not really knowing what i was supposed to do but soon got used to it, there's a bit of a learning curve but nothing to difficult. Played through it with one other person against
 bots. Can see this game will be a lot better with 2 full teams.</p>
<p>There's 2 things that have stood out that i wasn't impressed with</p>
<p>1. The AI, at one point my whole team were just standing still doing nothing, when your 20 min into a game and trying to take on a whole team by yourself it can get annoying.</p>
<p>2. Its short, Already i have finished one of the stories, think it much have taken around 4 hours for one story to compleation, even the What if missions.</p>
<p>Overall, its a good game but short, deffinatly worth a rent, not sure if i'll be playing it this time next week tho.</p>

<p>Played a bit last night and loved it, although it took quite a bit of getting used to, I am still confused this morning!! :)</p>
<p>This really is a multiplayer only game, if you want to play it for the campaign, I wouldn't bother, but when playing with friends it is great. &nbsp;We played a few online matches and I had crazy lag in one but the rest were fine, didn't notice any trouble with
 the AI, so far so good. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I couldnt get on with it at all to be honest. Normally I keep on at games until I like them but had to give up this one. Put it on ebay this morning and it sold within 3 minutes at a loss to me of £4. I will now await for LA Noire :)

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">Here is a write up of the game in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Challenge mode. <br />
Works very well. There are 4 sets of challenges, Objective, Parkour, Escort and Tower Defence. This mode teaches you the 3 core objectives of the game and teaches you the SMART system. You also unlock most of the weapons by completing these.<br />
<br />
Campaign. <br />
Campaign online is good fun, you can either play up to 8 people VS bots and work together to beat the mission or play 8 v 8 people. The singleplayer alone is rubbish but with co-op its alot more fun. It is also a good way to learn the ropes with more detail
 than Challenge mode.<br />
<br />
Online. <br />
This was laggy at first but then It stopped and hasn't lagged for me since. Either side is well balanced with Defending or attacking, if the enemy builds a good attack team you will need to build a good defence to stop them. So far I've played without a mic
 and everyone seems to know what to do, people throwing revives, ammo and buffs without having to ask/hit them. There are 8 maps but with 2 sets of objectives on each side, so in theory 16 different levels to play through.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts; Don't be put off by the reviews. This game has been more fun to me than the previous Halo and COD combined. But note, It is all about working as a team. Lone wolves need

<p>Thank you. When he turns his xbox on all the links on the home page are to the uk gold site, with the uk gold offers (£1 for 1 month). In the setting our location is still the uk. Will ab uk subscription still fail to work? Thank you for your help!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and this may sound like a silly question. Can he play with people in the uk while on a switzerland gold subscription?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Third Time Seeking Help - Skype signs itself out at random - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> revvosnow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Third Time Seeking Help - Skype signs itself out at random</h2>
                    <p><span>This concerns Skype classic, not the version specifically built for Windows 10 --I refuse to move to this version because it is overly simplified and cuts out a lot of features and interface options that makes Skype
 so familiar and useful to me. Across Skype ver.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;7.40.0.103 and now ver</span><span>&nbsp;7.40.0.151 I have had the following problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since easily before November 1st my Skype has had a persistent and seemingly random problem of signing out without prompt. I don't even need to have Skype maximized for it to randomly sign me out --inactivity, time of day, internet connection stability,
 CPU usage, nothing seems to factor into why it may do this to me, but seeing as this is my third time posting to get help with this and I've spent countless hours trying to find solutions in other ways via google and this very community forum (NO ONE seems
 to be having the exact problem I am).. Enough is enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, a handful of times that it has signed me out, it has displayed my contact from my latest conversation as no longer being my contact --prompting me to send a friend request in order to be able to talk to
 her again, though she claimed not to have removed me any of those times nor even received a contact request ANY of the times I was prompted to on my end.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This wouldn't be so bad, if I didn't use Skype for more than text-conversations pretty much every day. I'd just stick to my phone (which has had zero problems). I use it for calls every day, and it's an extreme hindrance
 that it can just sign me out and end the call whenever it likes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done as much digging as I can/am savvy enough to try and have come up fruitless. I've ruled out foul play --changed my Skype password and the password to the email associated with it. Nobody is logging me out of my account remotely --not even myself,
 because being signed in or out of Skype mobile has not had any effect on when or even if this auto-sign out occurs. Furthermore I have tried deleting the %appdata% folder, uninstall/re-installed,&nbsp; now have updated to the latest version, and as far as I'm aware
 Skype has not been fitted with an inactivity log-out feature. My first time posting a question for a solution, I got zero help. My SECOND time I was given the following response:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(74, 74, 74, 1)">https://i.gyazo.com/7c21d6fca5e054a1dfc168a6af505958.png</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(74, 74, 74, 1)">Now you'll see a few problems here. (I am on a laptop for the record,
 not an actual desktop but its still Skype Classic rather than Windows 10 Skype, so I didn't think it would effect much)</span>One
 is that the link they provided deals with Skype CRASHING when I sign in. THAT IS NOT MY ISSUE. My Skype will SIGN OUT at random. As in back to the login but the app remains open and functional. So that alone offered no help at all because they were telling
 me they were aware of "my issue", but weren't. Moreover, I stated in my previous two help bills that I DO NOT want to move to Skype made specifically for Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, their answer was to make a NEW windows login for my computer? Are you kidding me? They know so little about their own program they can't tell me what the problem I'm having is?? I have not tried their solution, because frankly I should not have
 to --especially when this employee clearly did not understand what issue I'm having to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with this, once and for all. Once again ANY and all feedback or insight would be monumentally appreciated. If someone could help me understand why the program is behaving this way I may feel more comfortable accepting haphazard solutions as a
 last-resort.</p>

            Before I go sharing such a thing, what is the diagnostic purpose of this? If there's a specific part of the file you need to see I can isolate it/them for you so nothing in excess needs sorting through.

<p><span><span>I'm not sure if an unique solution to your issue can be provided, so you may need to experiment with several approaches.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The issue can be caused by instability of your
<strong>Broadcom Wi-Fi Adapter</strong></span><span>. A more recent version of this adapter driver is available from the HP site.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.hp.com/ca-en/drivers/selfservice/swdetails/hp-pavilion-15-ab100-notebook-pc-series/8499302/model/9112008/swItemId/ob-165331-1?sku=N5R36UA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.hp.com/ca-en/drivers/selfservice/swdetails/hp-pavilion-15-ab100-notebook-pc-series/8499302/model/9112008/swItemId/ob-165331-1?sku=N5R36UA</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try to connect your laptop directly to your router/modem using a wired connection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You have
<strong>Avast SecureLine VPN</strong></span><span> software installed. VPN connections may interfere with Skype Internet connection. Try to disable this VPN software.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You have
<strong>Clownfish</strong></span><span> application installed. I don't know which functions of this software are you using and if it is connected to Skype, but from the past cases we know that Clownfish can really create big mess with
 Skype. I would suggest to uninstall this application.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Finally, your Windows lacks the recent updates. Since the last June 14393.1378, which you have installed, several other updates were released, incl. the major
<strong>Creators</strong></span><span> and </span><strong><span>Fall Creators</span></strong><span> Updates.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should try to install these updates, as they can also resolve several of the other issues you have with your computer.</span></span></p>

<p>Alright, after a long, arduous process... I've done just about everything recommended except disable the VPN. I have severe doubts that it's internet related because the call quality nor my connection stability to anything else is effected at the time of
 being suddenly signed out. And I experience no issues remaining connected to any other device or program, so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regardless, I have updated virtually everything I can think of. I've done all my Windows system updates, which required me to update my BIOS of my own accord. I've updated the Broadcom driver, and at the same time was even prompted to update my 3D DriveGuard.
 Clownfish has been uninstalled and wiped from my system and I even went as far as creating a new Windows profile with which to log into my laptop (switched from a Microsoft account to a Local Account because the Microsoft login for my computer is a different
 one than what I use for my Skype, just wanted to rule that out.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I've modified everything but the kitchen sink, so to speak. I won't know if it fixed the problem until I can go an extended period without being interrupted in my Skype usage --so a day or longer. But rest assured, you'll all know if the problem persists.
 I NEED this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for taking the time to be thorough with my case, it's been difficult getting attention to this problem.</p>

<p><span>You can try to install the application, by following the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right click on the setup file.<br />
</span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the options, “Run as administrator”.<br />

            <p>Hi Betty, </p>
<p>I am afraid you cannot perform clean installation using the upgrade package. You may have to restore the computer to its factory settings and perform an upgrade installation of Windows 7.

    <title>Too large virtual memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjn d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too large virtual memory</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use some workstations as network render nodes. (I use Autodesk 3ds max and Vray.) Last week, I rendered some images from a large file, which includes large amount of proxy files. Proxy files require large amount of ram for render. After I completed the
 job, I have noticed the virtual memory amount of all workstations increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two of the workstations have conventional hdds and 16 gbs of rams and one of them has 32 gbs of ram and a ssd. The ones those have 16 gbs ram have 96gbs and 48 gbs virtual memory (seems extremely large) and the one has 32 gigs of ram has 26 gbs of virtual
 memory. All the virtual memories are adjusted by Windows 10 automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.if I leave virtual memory settings as they are, Will Windows decrease them &nbsp;automaticaly (as increased them automatically) or should I decrease them manually?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.If I adjust them manually and set some lower value, and then re-check automatic adjustment box &nbsp;(whatever the name), will the Windows be able to re adjust the required amount itself?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>In Addition to Mikes reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If things are running slow, that's when you want to increase virtual memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>f you receive error messages that warn of low virtual memory, you need to either add more
</span><strong>RAM</strong><span> or increase the size of your paging file so that you can run the program on your computer. Windows usually manages this automatically, but you can manually change the size of virtual memory if
 the default size isn't large enough for your needs.</span></p>

<p>Windows in my experience takes a while, maybe 30 days or more before it will automatically adjust the size of the page file. &nbsp; 16gb ram here on my i7 laptop will settle down to about 1gb, its often around 8gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can manually lower it if you want.&nbsp; It wont affect the automatic except for maybe the next thirty days or so and if it needs more it will grow.</p>

    <title>Lowish quality sound coming from Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeldodds25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lowish quality sound coming from Windows Media Player</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am having problems with sound quality from Windows Media Player 12.&nbsp; It's hard to describe but when I play a track using Windows Media Player I have an effect over the top of the track similar to the sound of, let's say, if you cover over a small
 speaker and uncover it really quickly repeating that action over and over again many times a second.&nbsp; I use Spotify as well and I do not get this effect when playing music from that.&nbsp; The sound is faint and sometimes hard to pick up but it is&nbsp;enough to be
 noticeable and annoying.&nbsp; I'm not sure but I believe that I have had this problem since I got this laptop but once again I stress that no other program that emits sound exhibits the same problem.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

<p><span>Hi MichaelDodds25,</span></p>
<span>
<div>- Does this issue occur while playing&nbsp;audio or video or both?</div>
<div>- Does this issue occur while playing CD or from files on the local computer?</div>
</span>
<p><span>Windows XP currently can run Media Player version 11. So could you please confirm your&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/190990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>version
 of Media Player</span></a>?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows XP by default comes with Media Player version 9. If you have upgraded to a different version of Media Player, let us know about the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Try plugging in a different set of speakers and check if it's the same. This is to make sure that the issue is with Media Player only.</span></p>

<p>Hello Divya,</p>
<p>Apologies for my lack of technical specifications there.</p>
<p>Iam currently running Windows&nbsp;7 on an HP G61-110SA Notebook hence the reason I am running WMP 12 as it is only available with Win7.&nbsp; My WMP version is 12.0.7600.16667&nbsp;hence the reason I am running.&nbsp; This effect I&nbsp;think occurs only when music plays but I
 am unsure if it applies to video as well due to the fact sound does not always constantly occur in a video.&nbsp; My laptop is fitted with Altec Lansing speakers as standard&nbsp;(not sure if that helps).&nbsp; In regards to using a different set of speakers,&nbsp;I used some
 headphones and the problem appears to be non existent with them.&nbsp; This could indicate that it is my speakers but I emphasise from my previous post that this problem does not happen when I use Spotify either.&nbsp; Could there be a problem with WMP 12 playing over
 the speaker system of my laptop?</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

</p><p>I tried going directly to the Control Panel to change it but nothing shows up except for themes; when I click on my preset theme from Win 8, nothing happens and when I right click, the only options are to save the theme and share it.&nbsp;I've also tried directly
 searching up 'Personalization' in the search box but it just redirects me to the image below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upgrading from Windows XP?</p>
<p>Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).</p>
</u>
</b>
<p>More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.</p>
<p>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files
 you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.</p>
<p>3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.</p>
<p>4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."</p>
<p>5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.</p>
<p>If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.

                    every time I try to download something the yes or no box pops but it says that I need an admin username and password but there's nowhere to type it. I don't know what to do because this just happened yesterday and I'm pretty stressed out and pissed. plus
 I don't know how to log in as an administrator.<br />

<p>Your first situation is easy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you download something to <em>your own</em> user account, you won't be asked for a username or password. You'll only be asked if you try to download to a
<em>different</em> user account. Tell me which browser you are using, and I'll show you how to download to your own user account by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other situation is much more difficult:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The User Account Control has no place for an Administrators username or password because you (or someone who used your computer) unwittingly removed the Administrators account. Now you're stuck, because you can't do anything on the computer that requires
 elevated permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, Windows has a lifeline for this situation. There is a system account called Administrator (no 's') that is normally hidden. It's not a user account, so you can't use it like a regular user account. Its purpose is to allow you to create an Administrators
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2014/11/12/how-to-enable-the-hidden-windows-10-administrator-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This article</a> from the well-known Martin Brinkmann (he's a
<em>real</em> expert) shows you how to un-hide and hide the built-in Administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After un-hiding the Administrato<em><strong>r</strong></em> account, use it to create an Administrato<em><strong>rs</strong></em> account. Then, hide the Administrator account and leave it hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you have an Administrators user account. This is&nbsp;<em>not</em> where you do your day to day computing. You do that in a Standard account, which is also where you store all your personal files. You almost never need to sign in to your Administrators account
 - only when you are performing tasks that can only be performed in an Administrators account.</p>

</p><p>When I open the Xbox App it loads the screen to "Sign In" or the "Needs Help" option. When I click either option, it looks like it tries to open an Edge window but the browser window immediately closes and I end up right back where I was. I don't get any
 error codes or anything like that. Troubleshooting Xbox, Edge, or the Update Installer does not find anything. I run into the same issue when I open any game apps.</p>

<br />
<br />Right-click Start, click Run, type 'regedit'. Always backup registry before making changes.
<br />
<br />Locate: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\xbgm
<br />
<br />Change Start REG_DWORD----&gt; (by right-clicking Start 'change binary') then change the first 03 to 04 ----&gt; the value will update from 0x00000003 (3) to 0x00000004 (4)

<p>Thank you for the tip on the regisrty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the value from 03 to 04 has changed it to disabled. The drop down list order is
</p>
<p>1) Automatic (Delayed Start)</p>
<p>2) Automatic</p>
<p>3) Manual</p>
<p>4) Disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the value to 02 has changed the Game Monitoring service to automatic <del>
but I am now having the issue that when I set Game Monitoring to automatic, XBox Live Game Save goes Manual, and vice versa</del>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever was causing them to flip flop has stopped as I now have Game Monitoring, Live Auth Manager, Game Save, and Live Networking Service all Automatic and running, but I am still having the same issue getting the Xbox App to let me sign in.</p>

<h3> jaymt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I still upgrade from Win 7 Home, to Win 7 pro or ultimate using anytime upgrade, or will it automatically change to Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Question is as above. I am not willing to change to 10 yet,&nbsp; although I know I will have to when microsoft ceases to support Win 7. Meantime I want to upgrade to 7 pro or ultimate. Rather than do everything necessary to prepare for upgrade to Win 7 Pro,
 then find it's not possible, I prefer to ask first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is possible, how much does microsoft currently charge?</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for your response. I avoid being 'farmed'for data collection in every way within my means that is not way over the top. I had intended to transition to Linux, but since discovering that it's a less secure system than it's promoted to be, I
 am a bit 'stumped'. I would have given up and just gone back to windows if Windows 10 didn't have so many personal data collection features built in. I think it's poor behaviour on the part of Microsoft when so many people won't have the savvy or the patience
 to turn off as much as possible. </p>
<p>Having Microsoft farm users for their data is as bad as having cameras installed in your house by people spying on you to see what they can sell you', and selling the information collected.. Mac is expensive, limits users in annoying ways, and is also jumping
 on the data collection bandwagon, I think.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my laptop was obviously on it's way out, and I was gifted a hardly used laptop with a basic version of Win 7. I would like some simple extra aspects of functionality, and will stay with Win 7 until it's no longer possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there you go...probably 'more' than you bargained for.</p>
<p>I realise there are disadvantages and concerns about staying with an older OS, but it will do for now.</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for your response. The link you have sent me is to information dated 7 years ago. Are you sure that the process described in this link is still available? &nbsp;I asked the question on this forum because taking it for granted that such old information
 is still current, is often unwise. I am afraid of getting stuck with a system running windows 10. Is it simple to rollback to 7 if anything goes wrong?</p>

            <p>p.s the link you sent me is also from a private site, it's not official microsoft up to date advice....</p>
<p>I looked on the Microsoft site, and only came across old information.</p>
