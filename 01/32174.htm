<p>bonjour</p>
<p>je trouve cela dommage que le glitch qui apporte masse et énergie gratuitement dans ce jeu ne soit pas corriger car cela encourage les joueurs à tricher et à gagner malhonnetement d'ailleurs c'est ce qui fais en partie fuir les gens du multi que peut faire
 microsoft ?</p>

<h2>            Lost Edge and now get - explorer.exe  class not registered when I click on it</h2>
                    Did a system restore and believe I may have shut down the computer, because of a black screen. too soon.&nbsp; I went back and reversed the restore, but everything didn't come back.&nbsp; I can't use the start button in the bottom left corner, can't type in the
 search box, all my&nbsp;shortcuts on the desktop are gone although I was able to get&nbsp;some into the toolbar at the bottom, and the Edge icon gives me the explorer.exe - class not registered when I click on it. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 PC desktop on Xbox one.</h2>
                    
<p>I like pc's and i like xbox one as will. i hate having to start up my PC to use windows progrems like Office or Window Media Player. I would like my xbox to be my pc as will as an xbox. with microsoft making windows 10 on PC, Phone's and xbox one and with
 it being the same on whatever it is installed why can't you use windows 10 the way the user wants and not how we are told? We need ot tell microsoft what we want as users</p>

<h2>            Wireless mouse not recognized after waking up from sleep&#47;hibernate mode</h2>
                    I have a brand new elitebook running Windows 7 and&nbsp;wireless mouse. It works wonderfully the only hang up is that when the notebook goes into sleep mode and wakes up, the mouse driver is not recognized at all. I have taken the USB connection disconnect
 it and move it to another USB port, the notebook will not recognize the connection. I have done an update for windows and hardware. The only way that the notebook will recognize the driver is to restart the computer.

I have a brand new elitebook running Windows 7 and&nbsp;wireless mouse. It works wonderfully the only hang up is that when the notebook goes into sleep mode and wakes up, the mouse driver is not recognized at all. I have taken the USB connection disconnect it and
 move it to another USB port, the notebook will not recognize the connection. I have done an update for windows and hardware. The only way that the notebook will recognize the driver is to restart the computer.</blockquote>
<br />
<div>Install the full driver for the mouse and see if it improves.. drivers should be available from the mouse manufacturer website..</div>

<h2>            Computer crash diagnostic and repair</h2>
                    <p>My computer blue screens st least once a day. i have tried to diagnose and fix the problem myself but i'm not as tech savy as i thought. I followed the online steps to create, locate, and upload the dmg and system spec files that were requested but i do
 not know how to formally request technical assistance to have a member of the microsoft team to review the files and get back to me with a possible solution. Currently the files and my contact information are loaded in the same folder and the folder has been
 uploaded to my onedrive account.</p>

<p>Hey Romel Ram, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked through the link you provided that was geared towards making sure that the latest version of windows 10 (1703) was installed and i ran through the installation process and it told me that i'm already currently running the
 1703 build of windows 10. As for the page that referenced upgrading my drivers, at least once a month i go to my device manager and regularly and painstakingly go through every single drop menu and all of its components and one by one click "update driver"
 and select the search automatically online option. I'll go through and update everything again but the problems I am experiencing have happened before and after completing this task on my own every once in awhile (not directly before or after but at different
 times indicating it might not be the driver software that's causing the issue). Usually the message on my blue screen says something about a memory error, but the latest blue screens i have had all refer to the verifier tool that i was instructed to enable
 in another forum. I've since disabled the verifier tool as instructed by the forum and uploaded those minidump dmp files into my one drive, should i wait until my usual blue screen happens again to upload the report for that specific instance? I'm only asking
 because that's the screen that has been popping up every time it crashes, after using the verifier tool it seemed that the blue screens only had data on the driver stress test and not information of the original problem that is no doubtedly still there. Another
 note is that i had personally upgraded the stock 1TB HDD in my asus Q551LN-BBI706 laptop to a 500GB samsung 850 EVO SSD about a year ago and that seemed to be when the problems started. I also recently removed the SSD and plugged it into a sata controller
 that had a usb interface and plugged the SSD into a computer owned by a friend of mine and fully formatted the drive (via un-selecting the quick format option) to ensure the drive was entirely clean before reinstalling it into my laptop. From there i used
 the same friends laptop to download a windows 10 installation media onto a USB flash drive and booted and installed windows back onto my computer with a clean slate, but even that did not seem to fix the issue. Prior to all of this i ran a windows memory test
 to test the health of my RAM cards that came with the computer and it took two days for the tool to complete and yet it didn't yield any results. Do you think that it might be a possible issue/failure in my stock ddr3 8GB (4GBX2) ram that the diagnostic tool
 could not detect? Or do you think it could possibly be a that the 500GB samsung 850 EVO that i installed might be faulty in some way? The SSD, from what i can tell, functions flawlessly and gave a huge improvement to my system boot time and overall performance
 so i am really hoping that the SSD isn't the issue. I really appreciate the help and feel that i've done everything that I myself know how to do and feel a bit lost about how to proceed. I really appreciate the help and i'm very thankful that microsoft has
 such a dedicated team to assist their clients, I apologize for being such a hassle to you guys, this whole issue is really stressful for me as well because this laptop is my only one and its vital for me and for my classwork here in college and also holds
 high value to me for entertainment purposes since i very much enjoy the few games that i do play on this device. please get back to me soon with any thoughts or ideas of how to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely, Ethan Atkisson</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another note: i just ran windows SFC &amp; DISM as an administrator from my command prompt and both functions completed but did not show me any information of their results or weather or not any issues were actually resolved</p>

            If you have already performed a clean install of Windows 10 and the issue still persists, there is a possibility that a certain hardware is having issues. We recommend contacting your computer manufacturer for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post again if you have other concerns.<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Managed to solve the problem by cutting the power to the console. Restarting eas not enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interface changed a little (the «cursor» is now orange) so maybe there was some upgrade that needed to be installed that caused the error, not that I changed the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks for that feedback.</p>

                    Okay, Ilike to make videos from windows movie maker and I have always been getting vids in a different format. I use a video convertor it convert it to .wmv files and when I import it to.wmv it goes smoothly but when I download the video as a .wmv file
 for some reason its not working. When I split the movie, and i press play it wont play. Or when i watch the video I have to watch it from beginning to end without interruptions (meaning i cant skip some parts without it freezing). The vids just dont unless
 i just want to put in whole videos at a time (but really....thats not what windows movie maker is for right?) so please help!

====================================<br />
It's possible that the .wmv files you are downloading have<br />
some type of corruption. It may be worth a try to import<br />
them into your converter and choose .wmv as the output <br />
format. If that fails to correct the issue...you might try<br />
Windows Media Encoder to resave them in the .wmv format.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Encoder<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/encoder/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/encoder/default.mspx</a><br />
<br />
How to convert&nbsp;.wmv to .wmv<br />
using Windows Media Encoder<br />
<br />
Open Windows Media Encoder<br />
<br />
On the New Session screen / Wizards tab...<br />
choose...Convert a file / OK<br />
<br />
On the File Selection screen...browse to the<br />
.wmv Source File you wish to convert<br />
<br />
Also browse to and select a save folder and<br />
enter a name for your converted file /<br />
Save button / Next<br />
<br />
On the Content Distribution screen I usually<br />
choose 'File Archive' / Next / Finish.<br />
<br />
When you see the 'Encoding Results' screen<br />
the task is complete. <br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

    <title>I have been told that my .NET 4 Framework is corrupt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bookervandal  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have been told that my .NET 4 Framework is corrupt</h2>
                    On a .NET Framework Website I asked for help because whenever I turn on the computer I get a pop up message titled "Garmin Lifetime.exe.-.NET Framework Initialization"&nbsp; and then goes on to state " To run your application you must first install one of the
 following versions of the &gt;NET Framework: V4.0.30319. Contact the publisher for instructions about obtaining the appropriate version of the .NET Framework." A person on this website reviewed my 'tool output' from my computer that I posted and said the .NET
 4 Framework is corrupt and said I needed to uninstall it. But it is not listed on the programs shown on the Uninstall list. How do I find it if it is not listed? I have tried and tried to install the .NET 4 Framework and it will not install.<br />
They also said it could be a bug in the OS which is Windows XP 2003 Home Edition. I have the original CD can I just install it over the top of the existing windows OS program?<br />
Can anyone help?<br />

I do not know where the .NET Framework came from or where to find it. I assumed that it came with Windows. By the way, I am not a computer person so following preprinted articles are difficult without a more detailed fix. I hope you can help.<br />

<p>First, go to microsoft update, check review update history and see if .net 4 was installed.</p>
<p>(if it is not listed in add/remove I would not think that it has been)</p>
<p>Then run scans your antivirus, SAS, MBAM </p>
<p><strong><u><span>Check for malware:</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</span></p>

Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</span></p>
<p>Then do below listed fix.</p>
<p>1. clean up tool</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is time consuming but I have done this a couple of times.</p>
<p>First download the cleanup tool and 2,3,+4 to your desktop.</p>
<p>Then disconnect from internet, apply in order. The cleanup tool should remove all versions of .net installed.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi T Vasilis,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Are you using a DVD drive or a CD drive?<br />
2. Have you checked after inserting a different CD or DVD?<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong><span><span>You may also open the playing and burning CD/DVD troubleshooter and check if lists and fixes any issues for you-<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>You can even perform a system restore to an earlier point when the issue was not present and check.<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span><span>The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point
 in time in which you did not experience the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note: When you use System restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed
 are removed.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To do this, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the below links for assistance on performing a system restore -<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</span></a><br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorry to ask again, but i am not sure whether lovefilm is playing up</h2>
                    
<p>HI, my problem is as follows, i signed up for lovefilm, as some may know from yesterdays post, and i was advised that it usually takes the next day to post, and not very long to at least tell me the items are awaiting despatch. so this is the email i sent
 to them</p>
<p>Hi, i have just paid and signed up for a love film account, and i added about 11 games to my list, (my package allows two per time). alot of people say that , including your website, it takes over a day to dispatch, mine does not even have the awaiting despatch
 text next to them, yet when i clicked rent, it didnt say RESERVE, thus indicating that if it didnt have reserve, it was instock?, and ready to be despatched, i was just wandering how long it will take, as i dont want to pay £15 to get a service that doesnt
 deliver my games quickly, thanks<br />
James</p>
<p>If it helps the problem it says 11 unique titles added to the list, my question was, it it says rent and not reserve, then surley its in stock, thanks.</p>

<p>Surely a question for LoveFiLM themselves? However just because you have games in your rental queue does not mean you are going to get them. Popular titles especially may all be out.</p>

    <title>Cuphead for Windows 10 automatically closes itself as the dialogue box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aidanmalone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cuphead for Windows 10 automatically closes itself as the dialogue box to sign in appears</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I have actually had the game since I had bought it back in December. I originally bought it on Xbox with the idea of using Microsoft's Play Anywhere function. I just recently wanted to play it on my laptop running Windows 10 and
 the game boots up normally. The problem that I'm getting is that when the dialogue box to sign into my account pops up, the game just stops for about two seconds and proceeds to immediately close before the sign in screen even loads up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've looked around and seen that Windows Play Anywhere is pretty buggy right no, but the oddest part is that the game launches perfectly and only proceeds to stop as I attempt to press any button on the title screen. Is this just
 a hardware based issue or is there a bug with Microsoft's early service?</p>

    <title>Win 8.1 won&#39;t install updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewpenny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 won&#39;t install updates</h2>
                    <p>This has likely been covered in another post, but for the life of me I can't find it today.&nbsp; Send me A link if you can.</p>
<p>I have a windows 8.1 computer that has decided to stop installing updates.&nbsp; Except for the Windows Defender program.</p>
<p>the error code is 80073712.</p>
<p>The support pages describe how to use the CMD to use the DISM to clean up the image.&nbsp; Well, that would be great if I didn't keep getting the line from CMD that the option is not known.&nbsp; (DISM.exe/Online/Cleanup-image/Scanhealth) error code there is 87.</p>
<p>Thus windows update tells me that I can't update. with the looming "gotta have it" update for win;8.1 that humungos file, I need to be able to do this.</p>
<p>The CMD is in the Windows\system32 directory.</p>
<p>The updates that hang are the explorer 11 KB2936068 and the 8.1 update KB2919355.</p>
<p>So, I'm missing something here and I just know that when 8 was new we had a similar issue.&nbsp; I should have written that down.</p>
<p>any help before I go further off the pier would be much appreciated</p>

            <p>Here is what I found out.&nbsp; A great number of machines running windows 8 are having a serious issue with a patch or one of the updates.&nbsp; apparently, the patch may be responsible for the corruption of the part of the OS that handles updates.&nbsp; That is what
 our local tech company told me. As I had been running windows 7 and had upgraded that machine to 8, that was an issue. The update to 8.1, done some months ago made the DVD's I ordered for backing up 8 were "invalid" the image I made April 8 did no good.&nbsp; When
 we then tried to use the instructions to roll back to 7 pro, the corruption followed along. Thus we had to do a clean install of windows 7 pro.&nbsp; Which leaves me with a machine running windows 7 pro and the loss of win8.&nbsp; We are suggesting to clients that they
 do not update from win7 to 8.1 yet. And if they wish to do so, do it&nbsp;buy purchase of a new machine or via a new fresh clean install rather than an upgrade. While it is unsure if the upgrade process is the culprit, this has been observed on upgraded machines
 and no so much on machines that came with 8 or 8.1 as the original OS.&nbsp; To track this would be neat.

<p>An excellent suggestion. I assume MS is totally befuddled based on no official response from the company except for the &nbsp;torrent of comments and suggestions on the community forum none of which are official MS announcements. Such comments and suggestions
 (and the time spent by users trying such suggestions) does at least buy some time for the company to fix this mess, assuming they choose to do so. At least the company can rely upon the fact they are not responsible for any community "solutions" or "fixes"
 because most of the posts are made by volunteers and not MS employees with authority to make such pronouncements on behalf of the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>FYI my machine was purchased with Win 8 and upgraded to Win 8.1 so perhaps it is is not related to upgrades and is more related to this particular update to Win 8.1 which seems more likely based on the posts on the subject.&nbsp;</em></p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This not my situation.&nbsp; This is a new (six months old?) Lenovo Edge which came with 8 pre-installed.&nbsp; I foolishly upgraded to 8.1 although I saw no positive benefits from doing so!&nbsp; I wish I had stuck to v8.&nbsp; I am still trying to fina a solution.&nbsp; I found
 a site yesterday that offered a solution by downloading &amp; installing the updates seperately but I don't think this worked either.&nbsp; Automatic updates still insist I need to download the update but the size of the file has changed from yesterday!&nbsp; I have also
 found another post this morning on this forum that suggests this is a problem related to the size of the reserve partition and I am about to explore that!</p>

            <p>HI:</p>
<p>read the posts on kb2919355 failing to install and the idea of a corrupt win file in the system reserved is intriging to say the least.</p>
<p>The reality is there.&nbsp; When we did a system refresh on the Win 8.1 unit to put it back to Win 7 pro, the corruption in the update files followed. thus a complete reformat and reinstall was the only solution. And, even with backups there is something always
 lost with a reformat.&nbsp; In my case, months of the actual emails and the entire address book. Even though windows backup was instructed to back those things up as was my other third party backup software.&nbsp; (curse ^%$)</p>
<p>Windows has not taken any responsibility for this issue.&nbsp; In fact, we set the units up to do the automatic updates (Wed at 3 am) and for the most part they did.&nbsp; This issue arrived on April 9th, or so, with the updates and the&nbsp; demand that all 8 users move
 to 8.1.&nbsp; Even with the millions of variables across platforms, this is simply not good performance.

            I also have exactly the same problems and receiving the same error codes.&nbsp; Asked for a call from MS support techs which was suppose to be 3 minutes - that was 15 minutes ago and no call.&nbsp; I have read that having 64 bit version of 8.1 with MS Media Center
 installed is part of the problem.&nbsp; Sad there is isn't better support.

                    Let me be clear:&nbsp; I am not upgrading from an earlier version of Windows to Windows 10.&nbsp; My system already has Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; About a week ago, Microsoft released a major update for Windows 10.&nbsp; I have tried installing it twice, and both times it gets
 stuck at 86%.&nbsp; There are no error messages.&nbsp; The screen keeps insisting that I should not turn off my PC, and for hours nothing happens.&nbsp; I have no choice but to&nbsp;power off&nbsp;the PC off and reboot.&nbsp; It reverts back to the version of Windows 10 that existed before
 the update.&nbsp; Has anyone solved this problem?&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few factors that can contribute to the issue you are facing. The update getting stuck at a given point could indicate that the download is having an error or some files in the update are corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you run Windows Update Troubleshooter by downloading the program through this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. This will check for errors that could affect the download and the installation of the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further queries, feel free to reach out to us.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Account &#38;amp&#59; Console hacked into&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>&nbsp;My son came home this afternoon and turned on his Xbox 1 and his dashboard was full of new games and there was one in the process of downloading right then. We removed CC info right away, called and reported CC stolen. Then
 my son called customer support at Xbox to tell them what happened- he wanted to take care of the problem and "fix it". I listened to him go back and forth with CS giving them the info they were asking for, and him telling them how he was not here today he
 couldn't have made these purchases. I let this go on for about 30 mins, but when the CS lady told my son that he just needed to "man up" and take responsibility and admit that he made the purchases- and my poor son was so frustrated I took the phone and told
 the CS----</span> <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT YOUR SAYING THAT MY SON HAS BEEN SITTING HERE WITH HIS CONTROLLER IN HIS HAND MAKING THESE PURCHASES AND DOWNLOADING THESE GAMES
 TODAY. SHE SAID YES THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED. I SAID I CAN PROVIDE YOU VIDEO PROOF THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN HERE TODAY WHEN 3 OF THESE PURCHASES WERE MADE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER ALL DAY. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;At&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">that point we were finally given a case number and told there would be an investigation, but they really don't
 believe that he was hacked since the games were downloaded to his console. So now I (mom) am trying to figure out how this happened and how to fix it. Any suggestions? BTW- All ready tried to ask my cable company for help in tracking the IP address ect....,
 no help there.</span></p>

<p>The CS lady wouldn't believe you I believe you because that is strange games downloading and have been purchased I believe you 100% that your sons console was hacked the best you can do now is just maybe get rid of the console what else was downloading well
 the console was downloading games.</p>

<p>First of all, though it happens, it's very unlikely that your console was hacked, and all of these games were being downloaded to the console. Accounts can be hacked into quite often--we hate to say it, but that does happen. No hacker would hack into a console
 and download their desired games onto that console. It wouldn't accomplish anything, as now they'd just have a bunch of games they can't play.
</p>
<p>It does sound to me like your son was the one making all these purchases. It's possible he may have made the purchases from a computer.</p>
<p>Plus, if the console is not on, downloads will not proceed. </p>
<p>You may want to have a stern talking with your son. I know no one wants to believe that they child made any purchases without their child's consent, but it does happen.

<p>The best proof you can have is to go to <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and have your son log in with his account information. If he made any purchases, you'll be able to see them right there, and know it's him.

<p>Okay, this is Anthony, the owner of the account. The fact that you say that I am doing this, WRONG! I don't have the BALLS to do that to my dad. I fear my dad okay? And second, like my mother said, VIDEO PROOF, that I was at Wal-mart. And you saying, what
 benefit does this person have, I don't know! But there is something going on. I would not do this, and you can say that I would all you want, but Im not that person. Don't assume, because you apparently can not read what was posted. You can express your opinions
 all you want, but read the words of the original post, before saying this. And my mother has already reviewed the transactions, which is that link that you included. Please get your facts right before making assumptions like this. Thanks for not helping and
 wasting my time to read your dumbass comment and have to reply to this because you don't know how to read.

<p>If you were not the one to make the transactions, then someone else in your household was. It's simple as that. What the customer service support agent said is true: The only way this could have happened was if you (Or someone else in your house) purchased
 and began downloading these games. It's not possible for a hacker to download games onto your console. The only way to do that, is with a controller in your hands, your eyes on the TV screen.</p>

<p>When someone starts making unauthorized charges on a credit card you have on your account it is a possibility that the card information was taken and is being used to make purchases of Xbox content, but if that were the case then the charges would not be
 showing up on your personal account, it would be showing up some where else, that is considered fraud and the approach you took but contacting the card provider and informing them of what is going on is the correct thing to do.</p>
<p>The only thing that is weird is that if someone was making these purchases and downloads, it would be showing up on that particular console, not yours. Like Tenth said, no one taking your account and card information would do all that and give you what they
 bought, they want it for themselves. If customer support informed you that all the charges were showing up on your account, on that credit card and your account is the only account that your credit card is on, those purchases were made from you console, on
 your account, not anyone else.</p>
<p>If you want to pursue it further then I suggest contacting customer support again, telling them to check for fraud and unauthorized charges and they can tell what is going on. They may be able to send your case to the customer advocacy team for a more thorough
 investigation and they will be able to tell where the charges came from. They will probably need information from your console like the console ID number and serial number so they can trace if the purchases were made from your personal console or from somewhere
 else like you say. They will be able to ell if your account was stolen and hacked, or if you are the one who really did it and are saying other wise.</p>

<p>TenthStreetRed- the only people that were in the house at the time of these purchases were myself (the mother) and my other son who is 5 yrs old. Neither one of us had access to the account to do this, and not to sound stupid but I have no clue about any
 of these "gaming" devices to begin with and I highly doubt my 5 yr old could have figured out how to do all of the things that were done. Also the console was turned off all day. So I am sure it is hard for you to wrap your brain around but a hacker has found
 a way to do the so called impossible. And did you really think it wouldn't happen? With this day and age and people hacking into medical files and banking files and sharing so much on the internet any company is stupid to believe that it can't happen to them.
 The funny thing is I/we are not blaming the people at Xbox we are asking for there help in finding this person so we can make him pay for what he or she has done. And the only reason I put this post on this forum was one to try and get a little help, but also
 to let other people know so that it doesn't happen to them. I would really hate for anyone to have to go through the things we are going threw right now.</p>

<p>I'm going to tell you right now that you yourself would never find out who hacked into your son's account, if that actually happened. Even if you were to do as Rip said, and contact Customer Support again and have them send your case to the Customer Advocacy
 team, they would never tell you who did it or how. </p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that although you apparently had very good intentions, there's no way to really avoid this sort of situation, aside from watching what sort of people your son interacts with in his games--particularly GTA and Call of Duty: Ghosts.
 I have seen people be kicked offline and have their accounts stolen (But never their console hacked into) just from messing with the wrong person. That's going back to my early comment of "Though we hate to admit it, it does happen".</p>
<p>That in mind, if you are so convinced that it was not in any possible way your son that did this, I would follow Rip's advice. Call Customer Support and have them take a look and escalate your case. The Customer Advocacy team will be able to tell exactly
 what's going on.</p>

<p>Srry i can help with this mess! &nbsp;The console was not hacked into, the account was. With (Xbox One) &nbsp;if someone is downloading content with ur sons account , games or dlc will download in background as soon as he signs into his xbox. It will be shown under
 my games and apps section. Its basically your download history section, like xbox 360 has.</p>
<p>I do believe u ur son was hacked but not his xbox but his account was. They are probably using the My home xbox setting, its new to xbox . As long as u change it back to ur xbox as home, the hacker wont be able to play these games. &nbsp;But u wont be getting
 ur money back in any case , srry for &nbsp;your problem cause i was too ive been hacked before so i know how this works. And about being hacked he probably signed into a fake site n signed in with his xbox live info, and thats most likely how he got hacked.</p>

<h3> rodimus75  say:</h3>
<h2>            unreleased xbla titles</h2>
                    
<p>so whats going to happen to all of the announced xbla games that have a gs of 200? if as of june 1st it is mandatory new games have 400 gs, obviously there isn't going to be a flood of releases in the next couple of weeks. does this mean the developers have
 to go back to add more achievements? one example could be the new sega vintage collections. the alex kidd and co. and monster world collections have a gs of 200, but the streets of rage and golden axe collections have a gs of 400. as far as i've seen on the
 arcade release list on this site other games are slated for the rest of may. i hope these titles don't get lost in the shuffle.</p>

<p>Ah it was the amount of achievements that have a maximum limit. Got the two mixed up. I'd say if the game was already complete before the 400 GS change took place then they won't need to change it. Just guessing though</p>

<p>but the question is what will happen to unreleased games like Warlords HD, Sega Vintage Collection: Alex Kidd &amp; Co., Sega Vintage Collection: Monster World, Jam Live Music Arcade and Babel Rising as of june 1st? all of these titles as of now have a GS of
 200. will Microsoft force their new policy, or let the games be released with a GS of 200 or will they just fade away? guess we wait and see.

            <p>Thank you for your reply. Since both operating systems, XP &amp; Win 7 are installed on separate HHDs, I should be able to have a dual boot option. It appears that I don't have keyboard input (Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, USB connection) at startup, so
 I can't get into the bios screen. I don't have a dual boot option at startup, if I remember correctly, I need to get into the bios to have a normal startup, not a quick one. Do I need to connect my keyboard the old fashioned way (round plug) to have access?
 Thanks again for your help!</p>

            <p>Well, I followed all of the instructions to install XP on another partition, but I have another problem. I have tried three times to install XP, but when it does the first restart of the computer, it locks up at the boot from CD command. When I press any
 key to boot, nothing happens, so XP can't finish installing. I have to use my Windows 7 CD to boot my computer and use the command prompt to fix the boot record before 7 will start. The odd thing is that on the line that says verifying DMI pool, one of the
 dots following has a dropped red number from one of the lines above, always the same line, the number 4. Any idea what that could mean? Is my Win XP disc bad? I bought it last summer, it has SP3 on it. So right now, I am stalled out and stuck with Win 7 and
 no software compatible with it...another story, of course. Thank you for any help you can provide!</p>

            <p>My problem is that XP won't install. I have a clean, formatted partition to put in on, and installation progresses normally until the first reboot, after it has copied files from the CD, but restarted before the actual installation. It locks up at the press
 any key to continue, I leave the XP install disk in but it won't continue. That is why I am wondering if my new XP disk could be bad. What do you think?</p>

<p>The CD is probably bad, but there is no way for me to know that. Have you tried cleaning it? I've used just one drop of dish washing liquid and warm water to wash my XP disc, gently rubbing in a circular motion and thoroughly rinsing afterward. Dry with
 a soft dry cloth and try again, to install.</p>

            <p>Hi XP ROCKS. Continuing saga...I washed the disc, and this time I installed XP with the HDD containing Win 7 disabled. XP installed just fine, but when I hooked the Win 7 HDD back up, the only system that would load and run was XP. So I disabled that drive,
 but 7 was trashed. (No idea why.) I reinstalled 7 and finally got a dual boot option at startup. It doesn't say XP but instead offers "earlier version of Windows" option. The only trouble is that XP wouldn't load, I get a boot.ini error message. It wants a
 reinstall of the Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe file. Did that. Still same message. So I reinstalled XP from scratch, but again, when I try to load it at startup, same error message. But this time XP isn't even finished installing because it can't load at restart
 due to the boot.ini error. I am nearly ready to quit, but I'm pretty stubborn and hate to let the machine win. Any more ideas? I really appreciate your help, hate to be a pest, but this is ridiculous...it shouldn't be this hard! Thanks! WindDance</p>

            <p>&gt; msconfig &gt; Boot tab.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You new to look @ what boot path is being used.<br />
<br />
You are getting a conflict between the boot mgr for 7 &amp; for XP.&nbsp; OR one is taking over the other.&nbsp; I dual booted between XP &amp; Vista while Beta Testing Vista &amp; for a while after.&nbsp; That would be no different than what you are trying to have... each on their own
 drive.<br />
<br />
You can, also, look @ Startup Repair.<br />
<br />
If I recall (been a few years) install 7 first, then, XP on the other&nbsp;remaining HDD.<br />
<br />
You end up (again, check in msconfig) where the dual boot using the Win7 boot mgr.<br />
<br />
Don't try installing one from within the other (OS).<br />
<br />
