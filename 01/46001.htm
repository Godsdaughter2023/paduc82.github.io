    <title>Windows 10 Facebook app won&#39;t load - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Facebook app won&#39;t load</h2>
                    I've installed, and uninstalled the Facebook app several times, researched the problem everywhere I can think of, but it still gets stuck at the sign in screen. I can't type my user name or password. Any ideas?

            Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately the troubleshooter reports that it can't identify the problem. I've also tried CCleaner to clear any problems on windows, applications, and registry with no results. I did find some suggestions to make changes to the
 registry, but hesitate to make manual changes in the registry. Funny thing is all my other apps work great! I'm just frustrated that I can't utilize the live tile in Facebook.

            <p>Ok, I figured out what was going on in my case. I have a Dell XPS 13 9350 i7 Skylake touch screen. The native resolution is 3200 x 1800. That resolution is spectacular for video and photos. &nbsp;But the text on web pages and in email is miniscule. I was trying
 to set 1920 x 1080 which caused the Facebook app to not work. I discovered that if I set the laptop at it's native resolution and changed it in the Intel HD Graphics menu it works. The Facebook app wasn't the only one that had that problem. Some of the other
 live tiles would work when opened, but wouldn't update on the desktop. Now all tiles update and work properly and I can read all the text with no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank everyone who offered suggestions and help, you've all led me in the right direction.</p>

    <title>Did Microsoft sell me a fake Product Key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Did Microsoft sell me a fake Product Key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>On Sunday 11/22/2015, received the long awaited for Windows 10 upgrade as an update for my personal desktop, as I want to see if the update was different from the digital download/DVD/USB drive method.<br />
<br />
Decided to download and install the upgrade to the installed Windows 8.1, thought this, based on experience with Windows 10 upgrades, this take about 4/5 hours, was I wrong!<br />
<br />
It became an unholy disaster, after installing, everything was working fine except that Windows 10 could not download any Microsoft updates, or would activate, the MS updates kept giving' Unable to connect to the internet etc, etc,' error and activation kept
 repeating 'Try again later...'<br />
<br />
Oh joy, said I and pushed the Flag + X keys, to have MS activate it, the first Indian Techie stated, after while, there was an issue with the Windows 8.1 product key and he was passing me over the MS's 'Up and Running' Team', after being disconnected several
 times and having answer a survey about my experience.<br />
<br />
When I final was able to speak to a Lady Techie, also from India and had to give the product key using the Military Phonetic Alphabet several times, as she could not understand my accent, taking many, many extra minutes.<br />
<br />
She then informed me the product key was faked, aka pirated and I would need to buy a new one.</p>
<p>That's strange said I, because I'm looking at an Invoice from Microsoft, dated 1/16/2013 showing I purchased the Window 8 Professional for $39..99 from them and has the exactly the same product key noted on it, you said is pirated and until now has never
 been any issues with.<br />
<br />
Answer, was to check the key on the operating system DVD, cannot do said I, as the shipping method for the Windows 8 was Digital Delivery, as noted on the invoice.<br />
<br />
Then the line went dead, guess the nice Techie, hung up on me.<br />
<br />
So, I revert the system back to Windows 8.1, without any issues from activation, or anything else and am using same desktop now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though out all this I kept my 'cool', never raised my voice and was always very polite.<br />
</p>
<p>Now I'm trying to figure out what my next step, will be!<br />
<br />
A point of interest, at the same time I also purchased more copies of Win 8 Professional, at the same excellent $39.99 price and these have all been upgraded to Windows 10, without any activation issues, it was automatic on completion of the installation.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, I apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>Did you install Windows 10 through Microsoft Media Creation tool or other third party application?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that if you install Windows 10 through Media Creation Tool and faced the issue stated above then this may have been triggered if the copy of the OS was corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To address the issue with activation, I would suggest that contact our sales and billing team to rectify if the product key is genuine. To do so click on the link provided below:</p>

</p><p>No third party applications were used, the Windows 10 upgrade was&nbsp;send to me, as part of&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Updates on 11/22/2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to installing the update, I ran sfc / to check Win-8.1 for any errors/corruption and no errors were found, also a check for any virus, none were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try your Sales and Billing team, but I hope that I do not have the same experience, that was&nbsp;received from your so-called 'Up and Running' Team'.</p>

</p><p>After several more calls to Microsoft, I finally received an explanation from Microsoft's Activation Team, after&nbsp;calls to their Customer Sales&nbsp;Team,&nbsp;and giving the purchase invoice details.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The reason, said to me, was because the W-8.1 Pro and Key, that's installed is an upgrade version from W-7, therefore the&nbsp;product key will not allow activatation of the free upgrade copy of W-10.<br />
<br />
Their advice is to reinstall W-7, than upgrade to W-10, using the Windows 7 product key that should activate the upgrade, without problems.<br />
<br />
Somehow this does not sound right, as I've already exactly the same W-10 Pro upgrade with the same software versions in another desktop, without any issues.<br />
<br />
Sounds like that's all the help I will be receiving from Microsoft.&nbsp; <br />

</p><p>Adding to my last post, I&nbsp;still receiving daily, via Microsoft updates, the windows 10 upgrade downloads, also reports, stating&nbsp;that 'You're good to go', and your PC meets all requirements using the current Windows 8.1 operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only item that's not compatible is 'You won't be able to use the Guest Account on windows 10'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have not received any satisfaction from Microsoft, other than saying to revert to Windows 7 and upgrade to Windows 10 using that platform, this makes a mockery of all the current upgrade&nbsp;information being sent daily to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that the various&nbsp;Microsoft Techies I've spoken to, either lack the knowledge to help, or are not being truthful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>First, I tried reinstalled Win 7 and upgraded to Win&nbsp;8 Pro, using the version that Microsoft sold me,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;trying&nbsp;upgrading to Win 10 Pro, with exactly the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, wiped the hard drive and perform a clean reinstall of Win 10 TH2 upgrade, that was first downloaded from Microsoft and installed on a thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when the product key was requested, first used the Win 8 key, that was rejected, followed this by using the Win 7 key, that was accepted, completed the installation and Win 10 was activated without any issues automatically.</p>

<p>Your "skilled staff" have over ten years of clan experience? In what way?</p>
<p>I've been with clans (including being paid to work for some in my spare time) for about ten years of my life, but I don't class myself as "skilled with clans".</p>
<p>Coming from experience; if you have a clan and you're looking to expand, you just need to invest some cash into your clan. That way, you pay for advertising, merchandise, (gaming) servers, web hosting, staff (only if you need some), and projects.</p>
<p>If you have advertising and a reason for existence, then you're pretty much set.</p>
<p>Then just get some traffic and an Adsense account, and your clan will take off like a rocket.</p>
<p>If you are sponsored by someone powerful like a game dev department (for example, back in the days I was in a clan sponsored by Lucas Arts on SWBF2), then you're in business.</p>
<p>No offence to CommandoGaming, but they don't seem that amazing...</p>

<p>Our over 10 years of clan experience rank back to 2001 and the early Halo days, however the big move was in 2005 with Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, gaining 547 wins in a tiny little clan most Battlefield Veterans know as UAF or United Allied Forces, beating
 the likes of DC5, COA, SnH and yes even the best clan ever to play Battlefield, TGB. From there I myself branched out to GRAW2, Rainbow Six Vegas 1 &amp;2 and ofcourse COD. Most of my staff didnt get into gaming until 2008, with most of their clan experience being
 with COD and Halo. Thats just my 10+ years of clan experience, if I wanted to really get technical I could say our whole staff has over 20 years of experience together, but I dumbed it down a little for you not so smart folk that cant count that high.
</p>
<p>Now if you took the time to actually read my post it states "What we can offer clans is everything they need to get noticed and eventually get you to a paying sponsorship", meaning we're not a big name sponsor. In my many years of running clans there comes
 a time when you need to hang it up, so I did, and now I focus on helping out smaller clans, those without websites or any knowledge of how to get a clan running. Do you assume every clan out their automatically has a website, they dont. Some clans out their
 need a direction and someone to tell them how to do this, where to get that, and what to do next, and thats where CommandoGaming comes into play. If you already have a website, advertisement, merchandise, etc, than you obviously dont need us, but newsflash,
 not every clan knows how to get that and where to get that.</p>

<p>Wow don't dig at me, I'm not being a smartass, I'm just giving constructive knowledge.</p>
<p>If you had read my post properly, I wouldn't feel the need to reply but nobody reads nowadays do they...</p>
<p>Most clans do actually have websites, but indeed, not all of them do. This is where I realise you will get most of your "business" from.</p>
<p>Then when you think about it a little deeper, you realise something interesting: In this day and age where CoD and Battlefail 3 dominate the market, what target market buys into these games and makes the most "clans"? The answer: Twelve year olds!</p>
<p>Not literally of course, but you see what I'm getting at?</p>
<p>There are too many clans out there to count that are run by kids, and I personally am yet to see one become a hit success, even through sponsorship and help like yourselves.</p>
<p>Not gonna happen :)</p>
<p>If a clan wants to get itself recognised these days, they use a simple thing called the internet, and (as I've said) a fair bit of money usually helps.</p>
<p>Try it out, might get yourself noticed.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just saw this on the recent posts bit yesterday and thought I'd check it out to see how scammy it was- I was wrong in thinking that, but still don't see much, if any potential with this. All I'm saying.</p>

<p>Changing your profile picture in Skype for Web can be accomplished by clicking on your old profile picture. It will bring you to the screen below. Simply click on your old profile picture (where the camera is displayed), to upload a new profile picture.
 If that does not work, try another web browser or the full Skype client.</p>

<div>Please answer the below question(s) for better diagnosis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Is your Windows 10 activated?<br />
2. Can you provide us with the screen shot of the issue? To know how to include a screen shot in your post, please refer the below link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4</span></strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, Double check to make sure that it's set to show the image for backgrounds instead of a solid color. Please refer the below methods.<br />

<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/why-activate-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/why-activate-windows-10</span></strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            well if your recovery partition is gone and you did not make recovery media you likely will have to purchase recovery disks from your manufacturer.

LOL ... The first thing I do when I buy a new laptop is register it and make sure the warranty is intact , once that is done I do an update of the system . Afterwards I install Acronis and clone the drive . Once that is done I use the clone done and make a
 backup image .&nbsp; I never use the original drive , only if I have a hardware or software problem , beside that the clone drive is used 99% of the time . I can't trust MS when it comes to their software ..... I never had a problem yet getting my system working
 and Acronis has never fail me yet <br />

I try to give this a try and it does not work . When I did the installment of 8 upgrade I choose the custom install were I was able to view my 2 partition . One where windows is installed and the other where my recovery drive is . I choose just the drive were
 my windows was and started doing the upgrade . Afterwards once I loaded 8 I wanted to see if my recovery drive was still there and it wasn't WTF. I still have windows old . So I thought I could still go back WRONG!!!! WHY MICROSOFT DID YOU DO THIS ???<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Black Screen after Safe mode Boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently tried to boot my hp envy dv6 into safe mode on Windows 10. When I attempted to do so via msconfig.exe, the computer restarted and is now stuck at a black screen with no cursor. I waited for several minutes and nothing happened. I checked if other
 displays such as the TV were receiving input and I also checked if the windows key with the p &nbsp;key would be able to bring back the display but it did not. Hitting the power button turns off the computer and hitting it again brings me back to the same black
 screen. I have turned the computer on and off this way several times to no avail. Please let me know what else I can do in this situation. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I request you to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</li><li>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video. </p>
<ol>
<li>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video </li><li>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters
<ul>
<li>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable the integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</li><li>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver. </li></ol>

            <p>I have a similar issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Win 7 upgraded to win 10, intel i7 920 2.67ghz cpu motherboard asus p6t delux v2 and NVidia 680 gtx
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to have graphix driver issues where win 10 would not recognize my video card drivers. Tried to re download the drivers and windows kept blocking it for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I booted into safe mode with networking doing the recommended msconfig. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm stuck in a black screen for safe mode but my mouse works and shows "safe mode" in all 4 corners of the screen when I move the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is no way I can get back to normal windows mode since its just stuck on the black screen and will not load. Ive changed from dvi to hdmi and same problem. I can see the boot menu that my computer does before window start and it all looks normal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I was in normal windows before I could see everything but could not play any video games because of the driver conflict that started recently.&nbsp; I ve had the upgrade working fine since the free download was given&nbsp;&nbsp;for win 7 users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other way to get back into normal windows ?? besides reinstalling win 10 and since it was a free upgrade I don't have the win code? or my last option is to go back to win 7 and wait for win 11</p>

<h3> adikted2astronomy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have to boot my computer twice to start it up - none of the recommended methods have worked</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from 7 Pro and I found that at the initial startup, the computer would freeze on the windows logo screen with circling blue dots. I power down the computer and start it again and magically, it boots fine. So, there are
 a lot of discussions about this problem and for most people, turning off fast startup does the trick. Well it didn't for me. So, I just completed a clean install of windows 10, immediately tried a reboot and - it's of course my luck - it DOES THE SAME THING.
 So, I went back into power options and turned off fast startup again and still the problem persists. Tried Startup Repair after upgrade and clean install; nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To say this is aggravating is a world-class understatement. I don't want to sound arrogant but my computer is *****. Lots of power, lots of cores, and LOTS of RAM, which all requires lots of power. The power supply for this thing is around $400, so I would
 rather not have to buy a new one in the near future. Is there ANYTHING else I can try? I've gone into the BIOS boot settings and made sure everything is ok (I've done it several times), so I'm at a loss. I was a die-hard windows 7 fan but I'm really liking
 windows 10 and I don't want to go back. But, I also don't want to damage my computer. If I can't fix this, then I have no choice. I built this computer 3 years ago with all-new hardware and I've never had a problem with it until now. I could really use some
 help; any would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only 2 options I've found (that make sense anyway) are the Fast Startup method and a clean install. I cannot find anything else. The OS is current, all updates have been installed. This problem started only after moving to Windows 10. The main hardware
 components are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabyte GA-7PESH3 motherboard</p>
<p>2 X Intel Xeon E5-2630 v2 processors</p>
<p>128 GB Kingston Server RAM</p>
<p>EVGA GTX 780Ti Video Card</p>
<p>Samsung EVO 840 and 850 SSDs</p>
<p>Dell U2414H monitors</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could any of this hardware be the culprit? I highly doubt it but I'm just trying to figure this out. The PSU is a Thermaltake 1300W I believe. Some discussions say the PSU is probably bad but that's idiotic, especially since it has never happened when running
 Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem lies with the system hardware. Try running Memory Diagnostics Tool once to see what it results. Generally if there is a problem with your computer’s memory then the system will prompt to run the Memory Diagnostics
 Tool. You can also test memory manually. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>In the Start Search box type in <strong>mdsched</strong> and press the <strong>
Enter </strong>key. The Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool will be launched. Reboot your system and press the
<strong>F1</strong> key when Windows Memory Diagnostic is launched.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Test mix:</strong></span> Choose what type of test you want to run from Basic, Standard, and Extended. You can click on each option to go through the description so that you can select the desired one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Cache:</span> </strong>Choose the cache setting you want from Default, On, and Off for each test.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Pass count:</span> </strong>Set the total number of times the entire test mix will repeat (Max = 15).<br />
<br />
Finally, press <strong>F10 </strong>to launch the test. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now check and see what it results. Also try to run <strong>chkdsk. </strong>It will checks the file system and file system metadata of a volume for logical and physical errors. If used without parameters,
<strong>chkdsk</strong> displays only the status of the volume and does not fix any errors. If used with the
<strong>/f</strong>, <strong>/r</strong>, <strong>/x</strong>, or <strong>/b</strong> parameters, it fixes errors on the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer below link to learn running <strong>chkdsk</strong> for system partition. The same applies for Windows 10 too.</p>

            <p>Sorry, no problems with memory using the memory diagnostics tool and 0 problems found using chkdsk . I do have another SSD that I keep just in case something happens. Should I try to install and run windows on that instead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I could try is repair the master boot record. I found a link describing the process. I'll try that before I install windows on my other hard drive. Other than these two options, I can't find anything else that could be wrong. I REALLY
 don't want to go back to windows 7, even though it is the best OS I've used for my PC. There has got to be something I'm missing.</p>

            <p>I tried fixing the master boot record and once the computer restarted, the same thing happened; had to shut down and start again. But, this time, it went through automatic repair and "chkdsk /f" because I asked it to the next time it booted up. Windows started
 and I shut down at the end of the day. I came in this morning and it started correct the first time; no reboot. So far so good, but I'm not counting on it to stay this way. If the problem pops up again, I will use my spare SSD and install windows on it, then
 use this one for backups or storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever happens, I'll keep this site updated in case anyone else has a problem like this.</p>

            <p>Well, I reformatted my SSD and even tried using my spare SSD and still have the same problem. I hate to go back to Windows 7, but I'd rather do that than risk screwing up my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A question though, after I reformatted my SSD and reinstalled windows 10 on it, it automatically used the background picture I had before, even though that picture was not installed in the system yet. How do I completely reformat the hard drive and have
 it erase everything off of it for a really clean install? Some of the settings were kept as well, which worries me a bit. Maybe the settings and background were saved online and windows just imported them after it was reinstalled?</p>

<h2>            Printer Keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>For the last several weeks my Brother HKL-2270DW wireless printer will expectantly not be able to connect.&nbsp; Each time this happens I go through a series of attempts to reconnect and normally ended up having to remove the printer, uninstall the software and
 start over again.&nbsp; Each time I manage to get it back on line and connected it has a different port. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This all seemed to started when update 1803 was downloaded and installed. The advise from MS was to remove 1803 which I did and got it working that one time.&nbsp; Ever since then this problem happens, it disconnects and the whole process of trying to get it
 back on line begins. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the latest driver, but it runs with win 8 software "HL-2270DW-inst-D1-win8-useu". &nbsp;</p>
<p>When this happens our other computer, which is on Home Group, is not affected and the printer works from other computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Nvidia Geforce Go 7950GTX driver</h2>
                    I have just been upgraded to Windows 10 and my Nvidia Geforce Go 7950GTX is not working. In windows 7 Ultimate I had the driver 8.17.12.5947 and I understood this was for Windows 8 and should work fine on Windows 10. I have the driver on a USB stick but
 my problem is that the 7950GTX is not shown on the list of installed hardware in Device Manager so I can't right-click and select "update driver". I have tried using the "setup" application in the driver but, although it shows the Nvidia background and seems
 to be working, it ends up with a message that the driver was not installed and no changes have been made to my system. Is there another driver available for the Geforce Go 7000 graphics cards and, more importantly, how can I get my card to show in Device Manager?

<h3> friedpixel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection Xbox Live Error</h2>
                    
<p>I have several Microsoft games that connect to Xbox Live with Windows 10. Microsoft Solitaire Collection gives me a message that says 'We couldn't sign you in to Xbox Live. There's a problem with your account. To fix it, go to Xbox.com and sign in.' The
 error code that appears is 0x87DD000E. I have searched for this error code and got no results for it.</p>
<p>At first I though it was cause Xbox Live was down. However Microsoft Jigsaw, Microsoft Mahjong, Microsoft Minesweeper and Microsoft Sudoku all connect to my Xbox Live account perfectly fine. Just that Microsoft Solitaire Collection doesn't want to connect
 and I am not sure why.</p>

            Our PCs and printer were all on the 5G wifi from our provider and then suddenly last week none of them can see the 5G network. Our phones and our laptop still see and are on the 5G. So we know the 5G is still there, but for some reason neither PC see it.
 So therefore we are having connection problems nearly every day.&nbsp;

    <title>removing microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liamwells1  say:</h3>
<h2>            removing microsoft account</h2>
                    I have had parental controls on my Microsoft account that I use on my school computer and Microsoft support has failed to actually help me and remove these parental controls despite the fact that I am not in a family account. so in knowing this I have
 decided to remove the account from my laptop and use a local account instead. I have looked for a way to remove the account from my laptop and have not had success. I have seen pictures saying that there is a link on the account page in setting to remove the
 account from the pc but my account page does not have such a button and I am stuck for a solution to this problem. I need help for this because I have school work that I need to complete and I am unable to do so because of the needless restrictions imposed
 on me that prevent access to certain sites like my school Wi-Fi access page and to other browsers like chrome and Firefox.

            Create a new local admin account so you can do your work.
<br />To do this see link below.
<br />Before you add your microsoft account to the new account make sure the restrictions have been removed from <a href="https://accounts.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://accounts.microsoft.com</a>
<br />
<br />Once you do this login with that account and you should be able to remove any unwanted accounts.

            There are no restrictions listed at&nbsp;https://accounts.microsoft.comYet when i try and acces chrome for instance it wil send a request to the "parent account" of which none exist and then give an error when there is no parent account to request from. I have
 done as was suggested by another microsoft employee and added myself to their family and removed restrictions and removed myself from the family again but as i said in the question, i still have the restrictions in place and microsoft has not given any real
 help with my issue short of what was previously listed.

            Why cant microsoft fix an account using their own service? That sounds like they just dont care about their consumers enough to put these tools into place. If i were to make another microsoft account would i the. Have to use a different email or couls
 i use the same one because i have everything i ever use linked to this email.

            Contact them again to see if they can remove the parental off of it.
<br />I agree they should be able to fix this.

    <title>IExpress Wizard shouldn&#39;t be Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guaumma ceienne  say:</h3>
<h2>            IExpress Wizard shouldn&#39;t be Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I'm running IExpress Wizard (<strong>C:\Windows\System32\iexpress.exe</strong>)&nbsp;to create a self-extracting / self-installing package. However, I discovered that Product name property of
<strong>iexpress.exe</strong>&nbsp;was "Internet Explorer" (the same as that of <strong>
C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</strong>). I'm wondering whether this application in Windows 95 is designed for Internet Explorer (Perhaps this is the first version of Internet Explorer still remaining in Windows 10! :D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or please modify
 Product name property of <strong>iexpress.exe </strong>in the future build of Windows 10 if it is an error someone caused by accident. Thank you!</p>

    <title>Safely remove hardware tray icon refuses to eject USB media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r. hansen_690  say:</h3>
<h2>            Safely remove hardware tray icon refuses to eject USB media</h2>
                    <p>I can no longer eject a USB key drive from my computer using the "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media" tray icon. I don't know what version or patch level this started with, as I haven't used the tray icon since the last time I made recovery sticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I made a new recovery stick, and could not eject it with the tray icon. It reports "Windows can't stop your 'Volume' device because a program is still using it. Close any programs that might be using the device, and then try again later." I tried
 it with other USB sticks, thinking the stick was faulty, none of them will eject. The eject cycle just pauses for a few seconds, and then the error message pops up.<br />
<br />
There is no program using the device. I checked with SysInternals Procexp. I have closed Explorer. Explorer windows run in their own thread. I have gone in and killed the explorer thread running in the background. No love.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's totally bizarre about this is I <em>can</em> open up Windows Explorer, right click on the device in "This PC," and choose "Eject." This immediately ejects the hardware, just like the tray icon used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running x64 Windows 10 Pro v1803, 17134.285.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that having Taskmanager running will cause this issue...</p>
<p>Closing it and waiting a few seconds will resolve the problem, at least on my machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another program called Ultimate Windows Tweaker will also cause this...</p>
<p>I'm sure there are others...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything that monitors the HDD\Flash Drive, etc. could cause this...</p>
<p>This would include any type of automatic backup utility...</p>
