<p>Na hora de sair, você tem que pausar o jogo e clicar em salvar e sair, assim ele salva o checkpoint.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Para continuar o seu jogo entra no menu campanha e navega nas missões para ver qual não tem o ícone de concluída. Assim é só começar a fase e depois salvar confome falei acima.</p>

                    <p><span><span>Each time when I open the different programs that I have installed in my system, then upon opening the programs, windows 10 doesn't remember the size of the window of those programs also that they were placed at what position on the screen last

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when the computer doesn’t work properly. However, we will need some
 information from you:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you facing this issue with all the applications or with specific application?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p><span>You can change the size for opening of the program as Normal Window, Maximized or Minimized. Please follow
 the steps mentioned below to change the settings:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the icon of the application and click on Properties.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Under
<strong>Run</strong> select the size of the window from the drop-down list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now, click on
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p><span>Ideally, the applications are opened on the same position on the screen as they were closed last time. This
 issue may be due to a profile corruption. Hence, in order to eliminate possibilities, I would suggest you to create a new user account, and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps from the article
 to create a new user account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>

<h2>            Does having a large number of folders, videos and pictures on the desktop affect bootup and or performance&#63;</h2>
                    I have windows 7 ultimate and a large dell u3011 monitor and i use the desktop screen of my monitor heavily for many items so they are in full view. I just posted a question if wallpaper and or screensavers affect booting or operation of the computer since
 they are on the screen and always visible thus always working???
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have noticed off and on over the years that if i drag and drop multiple folders or other items on my desktop into one or 2 folders on the desktop it MAY make booting faster but cant be positive. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>also sometimes i download and let programs open and install onto the desktop--would that make it where on bootup possibly even while using the computer that its constantly reading and refreshing a massive amount of data 60 times a second--or does it have
 zero effect?? &nbsp;thanks</div>

            <p>Not so much boot up, but definitely&nbsp;resources have to be used to maintain everything on the desktop afterwards.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is not and never has been good practice to use the desktop like you are doing, but you are by no means the first. I have seen this a lot over the years.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The essence of the Start menu was that the user could easily find stuff, and that it could always be accessed regardless of what is on the desktop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should move the installation files,&nbsp;videos and pictures into&nbsp;the respective folders under 'Documents' that Windows creates and put shortcuts to the folders onto the desktop. This reduces the loading on the resources required to maintain the desktop and
 all that is on it..&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 9x used to really squirm if the desktop was full. XP changed the limits but there still are limits.&nbsp;</p>

            [EDIT: Didn't notice Mike had responded already while I was writting, but to elaborate....]<br />
<br />
Basically anything that loads when Windows launches, particularly&nbsp; Startup programs, but also<br />
large files such as photos, or a very high resolution wallpaper that you may have on the desktop
<br />
will slow Windows boot time to&nbsp; some degree.<br />
<br />
The number of Startup programs can also slow Windows performance, so it is generally advised<br />
to limit the number of Startup programs to those that you really need to have running when<br />
Windows has loaded.<br />
Similarly if you have setup Windows to re-open the files you are working on when you shut<br />
Windows down this will impact on performance to some degree.<br />
<br />
It comes down to how much system RAM and cpu cycles is being used by whatever processes
<br />
you have running at any one time.<br />
You can monitor how much various processes use your system resources with <br />
<i>Task Manager\ Resource Monitor</i>, but programs such as&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Process Monitor</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; are more detailed.<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns for Windows</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; is also a good tool for detailed information of Starup programs .,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The refresh rate of your monitor is more to do with the monitor itself. <br />
A monitor with a 120Hz refresh rate does not stress the machines resources any more
<br />
than a monitor that refreshes @ 60Hz.<br />
However, a monitor with higher resolution will use more graphics processor resources,
<br />
particularly the VRAM .<br />
- A U3011 with it's&nbsp;&nbsp; 2560 x 1600&nbsp; resolution would certainly use more VRAM than a
<br />
monitor with 1920x1080 resolution when dealing with open Windows and photos.<br />
When running 3D applications such as games a resolution would&nbsp; add far more <br />
load to the gpu as well.<br />
.<br />

            thanks i will start toning it down on my desktop. wallpapers changing every ten minutes or so i mostly do to impress company. i did open process monitor and watched it jump up on the memory as i clicked on each wallpaper to change. &nbsp;so if i was surfing
 or doing something as it changed i see that it could reach 100% for a couple seconds possibly causing glitches or fast freezes. &nbsp; also i have about 90 processes running many of which cannot be closed. such as i use photoshop and close it and move on then later
 i check the process manager and it shows there it is running. also stuff like itunes helper and bridge and this and that. &nbsp;i kept ending process to see if my memory would drop down lower from the one third it seems to stay level at but got little results..
 &nbsp;the computer is not crashing or causing real problems but i see where massive megabyte screensavers and many items on the desktop can cause problems. &nbsp;however if there is a folder with for example 100 pictures in it --im not quite clear why that being on
 the desktop--how or why the computer would be looking into and reading files, movies or programs. &nbsp;the wallpaper issue aside--if there are folders or tiny icons of pictures does that mean the computer boots up or as its running is reading and secretly running
 all those icons and programs even though they are just sitting there?
<div><br />
<div>someone also replied about a clean boot. not safe mode but the clean boot--i need to find that reply and do it--there should be no reason why process manager has 90 process ALL that say RUNNING. &nbsp;if i close photoshop i expect it to be closed. &nbsp; &nbsp;thanks
 for the excellent info</div>

            <p>Ninety processes is not unusual and many are doing relatively little anyway. Relatively little does NOT mean unimportant, by the way..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When Windows 7 is installed, the only item on the desktop is Recycle Bin. The OS is lightning fast.
</p>
<p>Anything added to the desktop will put a loading on the system and graphics card. If you want easy access to files, use shortcuts to the file locations. A shortcut is just 1k. A file holding photos maybe 10mb and installation files, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Install stuff and now it starts to slow but is still very quick. Add a few start-up items and that will take a little out of the boot up time. Everything takes a little bit out but so far, it is all productive stuff and that is ok..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hard drive access gets slower as they fill up. Always try to keep at least 25% free space. Also, as they get old, clusters start to fail a few at a time, and Windows has to shuffle files off as it detects the bad clusters and move the data to good clusters
 and reflag everything.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We still have a productive and fast system, but now lets add the fun stuff. Wallpapers provided by Windows are quite simple and are designed to keep the resource loading low, but photos of family groups, complex photos with lots of shading and complex shapes
 are not. I use a&nbsp;solid black background which uses virtually nothing and I get to easily see icons on the desktop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Screen savers may not be active on the desktop too much, but if you have one set to run, Windows is monitoring down time, ever ready to put it up on screen. The worst is that PC monitors have not needed screensavers since the early 90's..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Gadgets can be a killer, especially if they are forever updating the shown info. Culprits are network monitors, CPU monitors, HDD monitors, clocks etc. And as for slideshow backgrounds, what can you say.. :-)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Keep it simple if you want performance or buy a mega games machine if you want fun. There is a balance somewhere in between..

When you just want to limit the number of Startup programs, instead of running in&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a>&nbsp; <br />
you can just go to System Configuration \ Startup and check what's loading with Windows.<br />
(type&nbsp; msconfig&nbsp; into the Run command or Start menu&nbsp; Search bar).<br />
Clean Boot is more useful for troubleshooting conflicts.<br />

I average around 60 processes when doing something such as these forums, but I don't do<br />
much multi-tasking. <br />

            thankyou that was excellent info. I have a minor problem now since i cleaned up the desktop and moved &nbsp;folders. One i was expecting &nbsp;because i knew it my my outlook pst files in it. &nbsp;a folder has self created itself in the past week or so "My documents"
 including the space--which i know not to have or name folders that match important names ESPECIALLY anything to do with documents or that name in which the computer often refers to them in its searches and operation. I had the problem i couldnt rename it or
 email would then not see it--but i also couldnt move it. so i emtied the recycle bin first and also copied the files into a different named safety reserve folder for triple safety. I knew the error outlook would give and was ready for it and when it said "path
 not valid" i did the click so that the other window came up and i navigated to the new folder during multiple tests and clicked on the folder plus each file itself which made my emails visible but now i can send but not recieve and on my mail email when i
 click the green bar shows trying to recieve them errors out "send recieve error". (only on my main email--i have a backup old email which when i hit send--it sends and the outbox 1 blips away fine in a couple of seconds. I will continue this morning to fix
 it and those files are safely saved in multiple locations as i do. if i should somehow reset things i would lose a big list of important emails ive recieved. &nbsp;so i will juggle and keep clicking on those files till it recieves incoming mail. &nbsp;i clicked on the
 link in the email notification of the reply to my question about the desktop--and the link did go online perfect to this location but the reply now i will not see. my backup email is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>as soon as i get it fixed i will pop back here and delete this post</div>

            yes i usually use a black picture such as zooming up on a space picture that maybe has a couple faint stars.. &nbsp;cleaning up the desktop i moved my outlook pst data files but backed them up multiple times also on external drive so they are safe. &nbsp;however
 now when outlook gives its error invalid cannot locate data file--no matter how i navigate to them and keep clicking on them nothing works other then to show my emails up till last night as i cleaned up desktop. &nbsp;it now wont recieve on my main *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 &nbsp; but i can send and recieve on my backup email &nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
<div><br />
<div>i have had this same problem a few weeks ago and succesfully recovered quite quickly by navigating to the correct folder that had been moved. &nbsp;this time no matter what i do nothing corrects the send recieve error or my main email. &nbsp;i may have to log out
 of this help site--the log back in using my old backup email.--otherwise i dont see the replies. &nbsp;however i can go on line fine. &nbsp; such as to navigate to this string to see if anyone has replied. &nbsp;also this email issue is now an emergency--all very important
 emails and contacts are based upon *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp; business--everything--not just friends</div>
<div><br />
<div>best way to summarize is the pst data files are there--more then one. including the one thats several megabytes with all my emails in them &nbsp;however i cannot recieve NOR send--from that email.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i clicked on settings to even try setting the correct folder with the files--this time nothing works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>so i may log out and back in using my only working email now and create a question about this outlook problem &nbsp; thanks. &nbsp; its somewhat of an emergency as i am moving back to spokane 3,000 miles and need to send and receive highly important emails.</div>

            Yes, you have to be especially careful about moving folders with data that is linked to a software
<br />
as the&nbsp; 'path' to that folder is set by the software in question when it installs.<br />
So when that software goes looking for files in that location and can't find them - trouble.<br />
<br />
As an example - Make a short-cut to a folder and then move that folder to another partition,<br />
or put it in another folder. Or, make a short-cut to a file and move that file to another folder.
<br />
The result is a&nbsp; borked short-cut.&nbsp; <br />
In all these examples you can change the path in the shortcut to suit the new location, and it will<br />
work again (or, obviously,&nbsp; make a new short-cut from the new location),<br />
but it's not always so easy to make a software look elsewhere (registry edit).<br />

            yes ive always tried to be carefull about that but preparing for my move and a 4,000 mile drive i cautiously cleaned up the desktop. &nbsp;the outlook files for my high power email i was especially carefull with but now it wont receive. &nbsp;also i tried to do
 a system restore and it wont do it since it says it cant extract an odd file for my cannon camera. &nbsp;i saved on a thumbdrive that folder then deleted it and tried a system restore and it gave the same error. &nbsp;except for the email now corrupt the computer works
 fine however its scary that in the future i apparently cannot do a system restore.. &nbsp; i knew the system restore would not correct the small email problem--it cannot restore itself and actually create files that have been moved. &nbsp;the pst outlook files i DID
 save and multiple back them up--then navigated to them again using the prompts. &nbsp;but the no recieving error simply cannot be fixed. we even tried with att on phone and the test email said "completed" perfect--like usual but then closing all the windows and
 sending a real email it dosent recieve. &nbsp;for now am running out of time so will worry about it after my relocation.
<div><br />
<div>i dragged and dropped folders that had nothing but pictures in them into a main folder then i backed it up onto an external hardrive but now there is no way to remember and replace each folder correctly. &nbsp; the computer actually is doing well so when i
 arrive i may have it professionaly wiped and reinstall my disks and software. &nbsp;after about 5 years its likely a good idea. i have a question. do computers still have the feature to "lock the hardrive" in preparation for moving where little arms come out and
 lock down on the plates to stabilize them? &nbsp; &nbsp;i remember that from a long time ago but havent since.&nbsp;</div>

<h3> torquemod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is there no option to quit Skype in Windows 10 as of June 2019&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok this is frustrating to the Nth degree. For whatever reason Microsoft has decided to remove the option to Quit Skype. It used to exist so I know it's been removed. As of June 2019 though, there's no option to get rid of the program short of uninstalling
 it. You can't quit the program while it's running, you can't quit it after signing out. It just sits there forever. This is completely unacceptable and more akin to a virus than a useful piece of software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like Skype. It works well, it's affordable as a VOIP option for long distance phone calls, but if you take away my ability to control when I want the program running, I'm going to cancel my service and delete the program forever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Microsoft do you make such stupid decisions as this?</p>
<p>Please, cut the BS and give me back control over the programs I run!</p>
<p />

 also tried creating one in the hotspot settings but it requires a password. There must be way surely?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10's mobile hotspot password is based on the source of your connection. You may need to directly remove the password of your Wi-Fi or whatever your source is to make it open to other devices.</p>

            <p>Hello, Additional information below.&nbsp; The recommendation did not address the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>T<span>he printers in question have been removed from the printers and devices.&nbsp; They do not exist on the list of devices. If I do what you recommend, these printers are not in the list of devices and printers. &nbsp; However, these printers
 continue to be listed on the list of printers when trying to print from internet explorer.&nbsp; In other words, in the browser if I want to print a page and select print, then a list of available printers comes up in a window.&nbsp; This list contains all of the printers
 which have been deleted in the control panel's list of printers and devices.&nbsp; The same exact list of printers exists when I try to print from Firefox. There must be some other source of printers that the browsers are creating the list of printers from.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi, I just recently purchased an Iphone and my acer aspire 3680 laptop does not recognize it. I went through alot of solutions to fix this problem and i've determined the problem was that my driver is not updated for it. When I click on "update driver" for
 the Iphone my laptop goes to a blue screen and restarts. I've taken a picture of the error screen along with the error code, here it is. This is Windows XP by the way. If you need anymore info please ask me.</p>

            Hello Jamie92, welcome.<br />
<br />
The problem appears to be driver related. Here are the steps I would try first:<br />
<br />
1. Boot the computer up into Windows without the iPhone plugged in<br />
2. Click 'Start'<br />
3. Click 'Control Panel'<br />
4. Click 'Add &amp; Remove Programs'<br />
5. Find Apple Mobile Device Support and uninstall it<br />
6. Find iTunes and QuickTime and uninstall them both as well<br />
7. Do not restart the computer after the uninstall process<br />
8. Click 'Start'<br />
9. Click 'Run'<br />
10. Type 'msconfig' (without quotes) and press enter<br />
11. Go to the 'Startup' tab<br />
12. Uncheck any entries that have the words 'iTunes, Apple, Mobile Device, or QuickTime' in them<br />
13. Click 'Apply' at the bottom right<br />
14. Restart the computer<br />
15. Go to the Apple website and download the latest version of iTunes, which should be 9.x<br />
16. Once downloaded, run the installer and after the application is installed, restart the computer<br />
17. Once restarted, open iTunes, follow the setup process, and then plug in your iPhone<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps,<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            There is actually 4 versions of the game:&nbsp; Windows Phone, Windows 8, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP).&nbsp; Seeing the game twice is not an error or issue if you are playing it on 2 different platforms, it is by design in the achievement structure.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<ul>
<li>Which version of Windows Operating System are you using?</li></ul>
<p>You may refer these methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run this fix it and check.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</p>
<p>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
</p>
<p>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your
 first troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />

<h2>            I disabled my Surface Pro 3 Touchpad. I cannot enable it after I upgraded it to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 8.1, there is an option for turning the Touchpad on or off. No such an option exists in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off my Touchpad back when this machine ran Windows 8.1. After I upgraded my system, the option is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the touchpad is still not working even after I had the surface keyboard replaced, I guess it has nothing to do with hardware malfunction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if there is a way to enable my Touchpad again.</p>

<h2>            Echo of Soul and Windows 10</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10, I find that when I try to play Echo of Soul online, the connection drops after 3 minutes of game play. Other games, such as Stronghold Kingdom, on the same Aeria Games platform I can play for hours with no problems. Anyone
 else find this?

<h2>            Need disc to play on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the game disc for RS: Vegas and Vegas 2. I installed both of them on the One but when I try to start RS: Vegas, it asks&nbsp;for the disc even though it says the game is installed on my system. With Vegas 2, it doesn't ask for the disc. &nbsp;Can I not play RSV without the disc?</p><p><br /></p><p>On another note, $20 for&nbsp;the digital download&nbsp;of this game? Really Microsoft? It's a 10 year old game that I&nbsp;can pick up at GS for under $5. How about lowering the prices of older games to a reasonable price,&nbsp;if you're really interested in selling and making money off them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Gears of War 2 boots up to black screen</h2>
                    
<p>This has happened in the past 4 days. I thought because gears is an old disc it needed replacing. I have a new one, but it comes up with the same issues. The splash screen appears then black. Anyone else experienced this. My Xbox is an Elite.</p>

<p>I've had a few problems with corrupt game saves when I moved between 2 consoles which had different versions of the game. (That is, the second console had not downloaded the title update yet)</p>
<p>I had to start over and some of my achievements are still screwy.</p>
<p>Back up you game save to a USB, then delete it. Then see if starting over fixes your problem. If so, you're doomed to start over!</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. This utility might help in repairing the files if corrupted:</p>
<p>http://www.oehelp.com/WMUtil/</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Try this suggestion:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Go to the directory with those EML files in it via the Command Prompt (start &gt; run &gt; cmd) and type<br />
<br />
rename *.eml%* *.eml<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Check to see if that helps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Alternatively, you may have some 3rd party program interfering with the files. <br />

<p>You could also try posting in the Game Forums to see if other users have experienced this. Have you tried to completely remove all installed Oblivion content (not saves) and then reinstall? Steps on this process can be found in our Download Sticky.

            Hi Bill
<br />
<br />Drive H is not actually a drive, it is only 96MB in size . . .
<br />
<br />That is just your boot partition, which you should not be seeing . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume H
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=H
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Your Home Premium is actually a hidden pro Version. Just not all Funktions are enabled. With the Upgrade you can keep all your stuff. The Key will entitle you to Upgrades to Win10 pro as well, as long the time hasn't run out.<br />

            <p>Your best option would be to purchase a retail upgrade or full version Windows 7 Professional license, then use the product key from the package with the Anytime Upgrade wizard in Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>If the license for Windows 7 Professional you have access to is either a retail upgrade or full version, you can use the product key and Anytime Upgrade to move from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Professional. First, make sure the edition of Windows
 7 you are upgrading from is already activated (if its not you will run into complications and you might have start all over by doing a clean install).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type Anytime Upgrade, click the option to enter a key, enter the Windows 7 Professional key when requested, click Next, wait while the key is verified, accept the license agreement, click upgrade, wait while the software upgrades, (it might
 take 10 minutes or more depending on if updates are needed), your computer will automatically restart, after restarting, Windows 7 will notify you its updating the computer, the computer will restart one more time automatically and the upgrade will be completed,
 a windows will pop up notifying the upgrade was successful and your computer is ready to use, click close, you should be upgraded to Windows 7 Professional your files, programs and settings preserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, you cannot do this with OEM System Builder product keys, it must be a retail box license.

<p>Even if you do see one it would be so overpriced it would be easier and cheaper to clean install a oem/ system builders copy</p>

<h2>            Removing Local Address Book</h2>
                    <p>I really do not like the latest update of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How the heck do I remove the local address book from my contacts list? I really do not like them showing up in Skype. I have lost control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had Skype for decades and it was a useful business tool, now it seems to be aimed at vulnerable kids. I am starting to hate Skype and Microsoft for all their efforts of trying to make money out of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was a Skype lite version that was like the original Skype, the good old days where data was not king.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And whilst I am at it, if I delete my Skype account does that really mean I delete my Mircrosoft account as well?</p>

<p>Hi Julie</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the desktop client. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned that if I delete the application, it will also delete my Microsoft account. Seems crazy, but is it true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype used to be a great way of chatting, but now it seems about monetising it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How and why did it bring in all my contacts? I bought something on eBay and talked to the chap, even his number has come in and I don't know him from Adam. Crazy situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to your advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps I didn't know there were other clients, all this is a big turn off.</p>

<p>I too am fed up with MS ruining Skype with all this extra stuff where I have e-mail contacts I wrote to once years ago still in my address book.&nbsp; Why can't I just delete them??&nbsp; Why are they always there??&nbsp; I've tried what they say to do but they are still
 there.&nbsp; I'm not a computer geek but just a person who wants to use Skype.&nbsp; The inability to add a phone contact without having to go to something called "people" which now only wants to add #'s to my g-mail acct.....wtf!&nbsp; I've tried for hours to delete my
 local address book and still it's there with all those useless e-mail addresses I'll never use again.</p>
<p>Anybody have an answer?</p>
