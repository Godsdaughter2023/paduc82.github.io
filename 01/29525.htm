<h2>            Audio&#47;Microphone Not Detected</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Turtle Beach PX22 Headset until i noticed the microphone was not working. I checked the Sound in Control Panel and it used to say Turtle Beach Headset but now it only says speakers. Sometimes it will say Headphones, sometimes it would say Headphones
 but its not connected. Sometimes it won't detect my headset at all. When I'm on the Speakers for audio, it plays through the headset fine (though some sounds were noticeably different than before) and like before, it wont even detect my headset sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched online for hours and 1 way i could not do was to disable the front panel jack detection in Realtek HD Audio Manager. However, I cannot find the Audio Manager and any attempts to download it (http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspxLangid=1&amp;PNid=24&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false
 &gt;&nbsp;64bits Vista, Windows7, Windows8, Windows8.1, Windows10&nbsp;Driver only (Executable file) I don't even know if this is it.) have been unsuccessful. Any other attempt to solve the issue or download it from another program (Ex : Driver Easy) was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help if anybody can, and I can try to answer further questions like more info on certain things.</p>

            Hi Ivan.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recognize-headphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recog...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0x803F8001&#59; cannot reinstall Minesweeper</h2>
                    <p>Minesweeper stopped working and I uninstalled it but it will not reinstall.&nbsp; It gets as far as 'Acquiring Licence' then reports error. Other games such as Mahjong and Spider work fine.<br />
I've tried these three suggested fixes but none of them individually or collectively make any difference.&nbsp; I tried both with and without reboots between mods and trying to reinstall, all equally without success:<br />
1. Delete %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\TokenBroker\Cache <br />
2. wsreset.exe in Command window (admin) then uninstall Xbox in Powershell (using Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxPackage), followed by reinstalling Xbox from the store (no problem)<br />
3. In Command window (admin) {PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"}</p>

<p>Hi there Reed,</p>

</p><p>I cannot help you with the issue but it seems to me you are not running any Insider build and thus entitled to 'MS Helpdesk Help'. Why not move your post there?</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 stuck on Automatic Repair Loop, keeps restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> themasterpiece1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 stuck on Automatic Repair Loop, keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>I have read all the posts with the automatic repair loop problem however, my issue is a bit different. &nbsp;When I turn my computer on it goes straight into automatic repair, however, it jumps to a screen saying repair was not completed and your computer must
 be restarted. &nbsp;It does this automatically in a matter of 5-10 seconds. &nbsp;It does not give me the option to go to advance options and try to restore or repair my computer. &nbsp;It then proceeds to restart and then does the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases that I read online, after automatic repair fails the person gets to go to an advanced option menu. &nbsp;My computer does not let me do that as it restarts right away.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was running fine this morning before I went to work. &nbsp;I unplugged everything except my keyboard and mouse. &nbsp;Not sure what the problem could be. &nbsp;I installed windows 8.1 on this computer through a bootable USB so I do not have the Windows 8.1
 Install CD. &nbsp;Has anyone experienced this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a desktop I built on my own and has been working great. &nbsp;Windows 8.1 has been installed on it since it came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did some research and the error I get is Machine Check Exception. &nbsp;So the computer goes into automatic repair mode, then I get the blue screen with machine check exception, then the computer reboots. &nbsp;This process repeats over and over. &nbsp;I custom built
 this system and it has been working for over 2 years. &nbsp;I took out all the RAM except for one stick, the processor (i5 2500k) is also on it's regular stock speed, I took out the graphics card (so I am using the onboard intel graphics for now). &nbsp;I am not sure
 what my next step should be. &nbsp;Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Issue finally resolved. &nbsp;The processor was dead and I had to replace it. &nbsp;I thought processors were very hard to "kill". &nbsp;</p>

            So I finally fixed the issue. &nbsp;The processor was dead. &nbsp;I had to replace it with a new processor and everything went back to working perfectly. &nbsp;Wish there was an easier way to test whether a processor is good or not.

                    <div>I have a Hotmail account (that is, live:my_username) from which my contacts usually share images with me and sometimes I bookmark some of them for later viewing (usually they are links like https://api.asm.skype.com/v1/objects/0-eus-dx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/views/imgpsh_fullsize
 that I use to enter directly). From time to time I check them but recently I discovered that I can not access the images sent to me more than a year ago when it was possible before.</div>
<div>It's worth mentioning that the most recent ones I can still see but with the older ones I get a 404 error. Are you deleting or hiding the oldest shared images? Is there any way to access them?</div>
<div>It's not a client problem because I usually use Skype Web and when I check the images I am logged in, so it's not a problem with the session either.</div>

    <title>Removable Disk shows as hidden, unable to access any files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pc girl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removable Disk shows as hidden, unable to access any files</h2>
                    <p>I have a flash drive that I'm no longer able to access. When I plug it in, I hear the sound that Windows has recognized it. But it doesn't automatically open (what I've changed my default settings to for mixed content). When I go into the Devices and Printers,
 it shows up but when I right click it and select Browse Files, the option to go into the flash drive is grayed out. When I go into My Computer, the flash drive doesn't show unless I check the option to show Hidden Items. When I double click on the drive, I
 receive the error: Please insert a disk into Removable Disk (G:). I also went to the Command Prompt and typed in vol g:. I received the error: The device is not ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on Properties, there is no name in the top box and when I type something in this box, I receive the error: The volume label is not valid. Please enter a valid volume label. Also, it shows that the Used space is 0 bytes and the Free space is
 also 0 bytes. This is an 8 GB flash drive and has about 2 GB of data on it. When I clicked on the Tools tab and Error Checking, I received the error: The disk check could not be performed because Windows can't access the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed my flash drive then went into the Device Manager and deleted all of the excess hidden drives as well as the drive for my flash drive. When I reinserted my flash drive, it reinstalled and is now showing up in the device manager. When I click on
 Properties, it says that the device is working properly but I am still unable to access anything. I then went into Disk Management so that I could try to reassign the drive or name (Change drive letter or paths) but the option is grayed out and inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to format the disk (knowing that I would delete all data but be able to recover most if not all of it) but received the error: There is no disk in drive G:. Insert a disk, and then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use a recovery program - in case I had accidentally deleted all of the files (EaseUS Data Recovery) but it doesn't recognize the drive. I've downloaded a couple of programs claiming to be able to recover this disk but have had no luck thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on an HP Pavilion G6 Notebook (I have also tried this flash drive on my desk top but had the same results), with Windows 8, 64-bit operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide screen shots of everything I've tried, if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outside of taking this to an outside company, is there anything else that I can try? I really, really, really need the files on this flash drive. My job depends on it.</p>

<h2>            Gift card email not received.</h2>
                    <p>I ordered an Xbox One S bundle last Friday, which promised a $25 gift card, which was to be delivered by email. Five days later, I have received my Xbox from the mail, but still no email for the gift card. I tried using the support chat, but it was, to put
 it bluntly, absolutely no help whatsoever. I think the forums are a better bet.</p>
<p>Sorry I put this in 'Gaming on Windows 10', but there was no category that even closely related to my issue.</p>

<p>Hi Arnav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Antimalware Service Executable process plays a significant role in Windows Defender. It allow you to monitor your device for potential threats and provide real-time protection against malware and cyberattacks. Hence, in some computers, this process may
 result into a high CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've seen the photos and it's possible that you will not be able to click the Exclusions option since you're tying to open it in the Setting app. To open Exclude option, click the Open Windows Defender Security Center&gt;Under the shield icon click Add an
 exclusion. See the photo below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2469fd11-9cce-4f0c-8887-7286f2284483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2469fd11-9cce-4f0c-8887-7286f2284483" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use the Microsoft Safety Scanner tool to remove malware from your computer. You may refer to this

<h3> skpr77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal microphone is not working</h2>
                    <p>While setting up for a Skype job interview, I discovered that for the first time since I had my laptop, my internal microphone did not detect my voice during the system check.</p>
<p>I have spent hours trying to trouble shoot this, but every thing I check, says that it is working properly. My driver is up to date. I downloaded the newer version of Skype, I have gone into the Audio settings and everything is working fine. Under microphone
 settings, it shows that I have everything set up correctly, but when I go to Sound Recorder, it says "Audio Recording Device Not Found". I tried downloading a different sound recorder, but nothing is compatible with Windows 7.</p>

            I have tried this several days ago, and as I mentioned, all the settings are correct, and the device says it's working properly. I had uninstalled the driver, and after re-boot, the system automatically re-installed the initial driver. This seemed as if
 it had fixed the situation, and it will record my voice, but during playback, the volume was unrecognizable. I went into the settings once again and turned the levels up, and still didn't change the volume of my voice. All other volumes worked fine, just my
 voice was incredibly low. I then update the driver, and it gave me the Realtek version. But now i'm back to square one, because Realtek doesn't allow the microphone to record anything. Complete inoperable, and once again, all settings are correct.<br />

<p>Thank you for the update. Have made sure that the driver you've downloaded and installed is for the device you're using? It may be possible that there is a driver that is specific to your device for it to work properly. Please verify this by visiting your
 laptop manufacturer's website. You may also try using an external mic to be sure that the issue is not with your internal mic just to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

            Hi myrtleblowers1,
<br />
<br />Can you please explain in more detail what you need to do with a photo
<br />
<br />If you want to edit a photo at a low level like editing pixels, you will need to download a 3rd party application as the apps in Windows will not really go down to that detail
<br />
<br />The free application GIMP is a good free Image editing application:

    <title>Transfer purchased games from new account to my original one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> touchmynubbin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer purchased games from new account to my original one</h2>
                    
<p>I've had an xbox live account since 2008 and I played on it for years until I didn't have enough time to make paying for gold worthwhile. When halo 4 came out I bought it and tried to get my old account back on xbox live. Apparently during my absence from
 xbox live they (microsoft) put a ton of security features in place for everyone's accounts. I wasn't able to access my original account due to these new features (i'm guessing because the last xbox i played on with my original account was different from the
 one I tried to start again on after my xbox live hiatus), and I really wanted to play Halo 4, so I created a new account (this one) and bought xbox live for it. In the months after this, I purchased a game and an expansion for another game on this account.
 Since then I have gotten control of my original account and was wondering if it was possible to transfer my purchases from this account to my original one before i delete this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Modern Warfare 3 and Trials Evolution on my original account, and the Origin of Pain DLC for Trials and Minecraft on my newer one. I own three different xboxes in three different rooms, and it's becoming a real hassle to license transfer every time
 I want to play my new account's games on my original account, especially with the limit on license transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just wondering if there's any way to permanently transfer the licenses or w/e legal jargon from this account to my original one. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Could not Enable File History - but Indexing takes too much of system resources</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to become proficient in setting up windows 10 for office staff level users, and amongst the fun I am having, there is File History - From the description seems like it could be a very useful facility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried enabling File History - as I prefer to use a facility MS has provided as part of the windows 10 environment, however I have had to turn off Indexing as it kept hogging system resources to redo the index - at least once after every boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how can I&nbsp;have the MS provided File History process work without having the PC throughput crippled by the persistent running of the index process.</p>
<p>I have started Task Manager and found fhsvc was stopped. </p>
<p>Services show it is has a "Start Type" setting of&nbsp;"Manual Trigger Start"&nbsp; </p>
<p>so I started it - as, apparently was needed according to the error message when I tried, via "Control Panel\System and Security\File History"&nbsp;to get the facility to run.</p>
<p>However, when I looked at the fhsvc service status - I found it had stopped itself
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I can see a selection panel to Exclude folders, but how do I get to the&nbsp;option to Include folders.</p>

            <p>Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for that, I'll be looking at that soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re Getting File History running - </p>
<p>with the index running, the File History service is also running. It backed up the libraries yesterday - and I set the backup to run at daily intervals (Remember to "Save Changes")</p>
<p>This morning I powered up the PC </p>
<p>without the second drive installed and there were no complaints.</p>
<p>Considering the facility again, I may run it with a 1 hour interval as,&nbsp;reading the details at the links below, so far I believe the File History will hold new file backups on the OS partition until the USB drive is plugged back in (tomorrow). I'm not sure
 if all versions will be put onto the USB drive, or just the latest one of any file I have changed.</p>
<p>Also got to see if it recognises files moved between folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(My home-grown facility doesn't as it works solely on the file date - so&nbsp;it's current version from where it is, if the date is later than the last backup to the USB drive - Autoplay runs my script)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re other folders - seems to be joining the folders into a library is the trick.</p>
<p>I found the 7Tutorials when looking for details of the store maintenance - </p>

</p><p>Tried that - seems to be a slightly different procedure on my PC as setup (win7 upgrade to win 10)</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Troubleshooting or troubleshooter or&nbsp;gets me a web link rather than an actual program to run -
</p>
<p>and that takes me to a Bing search page</p>

<p>gets me some links with the following one applying to windows 10 </p>

</span></span><span><span>
<p>Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter by right-clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Search and Indexing.
</p>
</span></span><span><span>

<p>
</p><p>Select the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Advanced</p>

</p>

</p><p>Next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select "Slowing down the computer" and get </p>
<p>No problems Identified</p>
<p>Select "Explore additional options" takes me to a select a search page -
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - While that is not "The Answer", it is a&nbsp;very helpful link&nbsp; - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had indexing turned off under win 7 as the system kept using almost all CPU power, and memory - and the recommendations from various forums was no solution other than to turn off indexing.</p>
<p>And - with it on, I can see the drive use light flashing on lots while I am doing nothing on the system&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Task manager indicates:</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Search Indexer is occupying the system, </p>
<p>&nbsp;- only 25% CPU and 50% memory,&nbsp;so not as aggressively as it did under Windows7.</p>

</p><p>Back again -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re adding folders - </p>
<p>Once you have File History running, but apparently only&nbsp;after&nbsp;there are folders/files backed-up&nbsp;-&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Win key - Settings - Update_and_Security Backup </p>
<p>More_Options under Using File History </p>
<p>shows a panel entitles Backup Options that shows details of/for File History</p>
<p>Space used, partition size, last run, frequency and folders backed-up, with the options to</p>
<strong>
<p>Remove any of those folders from the backup</p>
<p>Stop using this drive ( as in Switch to a new drive?), </p>
</strong>
<p><strong>ADD Folders</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>or select Advanced - where there is the option to </p>
<p>"Run now"</p>
<p>or use "Advanced" to get to the logs</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Now, while I can get to the filestore of my files as a sub-folder under</p>
<p>G:\FileHistory\My_userid etc....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is - while I can open, (not update - they are read-only), delete (undelete) the files with date and timestamp values appended to the name, what will that do to the File History usage of it's "Configuration\Catalog" entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also - what about long filenames - as in 250+ characters in the normal folder, in that it seems that the File History facility needs at least 53 characters + the length of your %username% + the length of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %COMPUTERNAME% within
 the limit set for the FullFileFame (in my case 80 characters) for it's own use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - that seems that for a file to be included in the 'History" it has to&nbsp;have a maximum of 113 chars for the name of a file on the desktop (80 + the fullname of the desktop folder itself+ it's 53 characters).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Or - does someone know different</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>And - OK, 40GB of files may be a lot for many users, it does take over 10 minutes to "Run Now" so should that be a consideration when setting the process interval
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Considering this 'product' has been part of Windows since Windows 8 or is it 7, I wonder - did Microsoft follow pseudo-government practice -
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">&nbsp;Sack them for slowing down the project.</p>

            There is another aspect to this issue for user systems with SSD's.&nbsp; Turning on indexing service is not recommended.&nbsp; The search facility, in addition to using tremendous amount of CPU resources does needless writes to the SSD which will result in shortening
 the life of the SSD.&nbsp; There is NO reason that a file history facility needs to depend on index searches.

            <p>Yup, </p>
<p>But you really do need to have the content of all your files indexed - Well you will surely need to find the .exe that contains the phrase "Failed Error code"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And - note the indexed option that is pre-set as on for&nbsp;NTFS partitions - I always set that OFF as soon as the partition is 'formatted' to use the NTFS file system, - see Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT - consider my earlier posts - File_History doesn't save copies of all the files, even if it has not stopped running&nbsp;and the copies of those it does save are accessible (readable, delete-able, and even changeable,&nbsp;by all users who have access to the partition
 containing those backups.</p>
<p>Basically, File History is not safe to use, and certainly not safe to rely on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look a Bvckup - and get a copy before someone at MS, or Symantec notices it is a product that actually does the job users need doing, and they have the&nbsp;product&nbsp;bought-up and then wrecked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Automatic, Surprise Shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icampbell1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic, Surprise Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Problem I'm having is:</p>
<p>When I leave my personal laptop on the lock screen during the day while I'm in work, I come home to it in the 'off' state. Starting it up, it starts up as from any other boot from a normal shutdown would. However, I always open Chrome and receive the 'Restore
 previous session?' prompt - since of course, the laptops has, at some point during the day, shut down of its own accord, irrespective of what programs I have had running at the time. It's happened many times, and I'm at a loss to explain why. The laptop is
 a Lenovo Y500 running Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, which was previously upgraded from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried already that hasn't solved the problem:</p>
<p>1) Ensuring 'Notify to schedule restart' is selected in 'Choose how updates are installed'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Ensuring that the power settings are set to never sleep, never turn off the screen, turn off the hard drive after 20 minutes, never hibernate and never allow hybrid sleep.</p>
<p>3) Performing a full virus scan with a fully updated Kaspersky and Malwarebytes Anti-malware.</p>
<p>4) (To the best of my knowledge) disabling Lenovo Energy Management, in case it's doing anything funny in the background.</p>
<p>5) Checking the system logs in eventvwr.msc - System - filter for source 'User32' and event '1074' (shutdown) or event '6008' (unexpected shutdown). I've never found any 1074 or 6008 occurring on the day I've experienced the surprise shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched this community but found nothing that solves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help?</p>

    <title>White &#34;Pressure&#34; Spot in SB2 Screen, again&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outwright  say:</h3>
<h2>            White &#34;Pressure&#34; Spot in SB2 Screen, again&#63;</h2>
                    After having exchanged a SB2 for "true" hardware defects, I noticed one small white-ish spot in the screen that is different to a dead pixel, rather like a highly illuminated set of pixels with a fuzzy outline.<br />
<br />
What is the likelihood of having one of these spots in a brand new surface book 2?<br />
I know that at the end of 2 year, I recognized a similar spot in my Surface Pro 4, and was Ok with it as it has been 2 years.<br />
Now I got one after less than 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
For such a high-price product, this is simply ridiculous. I never noticed such spots in other manufacturers.<br />
<br />
Should I replace the Surface book 2 for a new one again?<br />

<p>I have returned the SB2 at the retail store where I bought it. I ordered a new SB2, this time the most expensive model just to find out whether there are better quality standards. Replacing SB2 at retail stores (here Media Markt, Microsoft stores are not
 nearby or even existent in Switzerland) is a pain, as i would have to come up with the price difference when SB2 are sold at higher prices than before when i bought it. Ridiculous.<br />

                    <p>Xbox one S has been freezing every now and then and during updates. It will go to a certain % of update and stops working. After reading MS support, I tried to do a factory reset using BInd button. that worked for a while saying console in process till about
 50% and stopped there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do a factory reset and get the system working again?</p>

<h2>            More than 20 000 Rewards points not depositing for over a month</h2>
                    <p>Last month, around March 16th, I've made a request for an early deposit of more than 20&nbsp;000&nbsp;Rewards points. According to my billing history, there was a deposit made on March 28th, but none of the 20&nbsp;000 points were deposited. To this day, they sit on my account and nothing is happening. I'd like to know if this is caused by the incoming Microsoft Rewards transfer or if the points are somehow truly stuck. The option for early deposit is not there anymore and right now I&nbsp;have 20&nbsp;525 points just sitting there.</p>

  </p>
<p>Your deposit is being prevented due to a mismatch between your UK Rewards Account region and your Czech&nbsp;Microsoft Account region. When you register into the Rewards program, we create a Rewards account based on your Microsoft Account region at the time of registration. Since your Rewards Account is a separate entity from your Microsoft Account, migrating your Microsoft Account region will not also change your Rewards Account region. Therefore, when your Rewards Account attempts a deposit in one regional currency, it cannot complete when your Microsoft Account is of a differing currency.
  </p>
<p>However, this issue can be fixed by heading over to the Microsoft Commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) to update your Microsoft account to match your Xbox Live Rewards location.</p><p><br /></p>

Your going to need a picture editing program. Take a look around and see if <br />
you have Microsoft Office Picture Manager on your machine it has limited <br />
abilities to lighten images.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 can see my bluetooth mouse &#40;Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 8000&#41;, but cannot pair with it.</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
Just installed Windows 7.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; Only problem I'm having is with bluetooth and my mouse, the Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 8000.&nbsp; If I go the "Add Device" route, Windows 7 sees my the mouse, but as soon as I try to pair them, I have no luck.&nbsp; I
 have tried all three pairing options (generate a passkey, enter a passkey, and use no passkey), none of which seems to get this working.&nbsp; I even tried installing IntelliPoint for Win 7, but that hasn't helped either.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what to do?&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>Have you looked for support for your Dell 355 Bluetooth device on Dell's support site?&nbsp; Try that, because often they have firmware updates available, especially if the drivers support Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Also, please check the Event viewer (start eventvwr.msc, enter)--Windows Logs\System and sort by Source.&nbsp; Look for bthusb and report on any errors that may be reported there.&nbsp;

<h3> tmanz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyone experiencing Bluetooth issues post upgrade to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrade from 8.1 Pro to 10 Pro, all my connected Bluetooth devices were working
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">until</span> the first power-off. Since then, the&nbsp;PC's&nbsp;Bluetooth hardware device showed an Error Code 10 in Device Manager and Bluetooth was missing from the connectivity options. After another power off (from the wall
 outlet this time) and power on, the error is gone and the Bluetooth option is available. However, I had to reconnect my Bluetooth devices (mice/keyboard/phone), but trying to do this yields no results in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;discovery window. Other Bluetooth devices&nbsp;(Laptops/phones)&nbsp;can
 see my PC, but&nbsp;the Win10 PC&nbsp;doesn't see the other devices. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like a Win10&nbsp;Bluetooth driver issue... I have the Intel 7260-AC chip. I have tried re-installing 8.1 drivers with no success, I might have to wait for a solution from Intel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall I am disappointed this wasn't picked up in the Win10 compatibility check. I guess this is why a Windows update never goes as expected...</p>

            <p>It seems Intel has uploaded their Win10&nbsp;drivers after much complaining from the community, and it seems they have dated there release as of the 29th (sneaky sods, it definitely wasn't up by then... I checked). Anyway hoping it solves my Bluetooth issues.

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in order to get&nbsp;the&nbsp;Intel 7260&nbsp;to work for me I had to do the following to ensure Windows wasn't picking up the old drivers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall 'Intel Wireless Bluetooth' and 'Intel PROset/Wireless Software' in add/remove programs.</p>
<p>2. Check that this removes the driver files for Wireless and Bluetooth from Program Files &gt; Intel and Program Files(x86) &gt; Intel</p>
<p>3. Uninstall the driver from Bluetooth &gt; Intel Wireless Bluetooth and Network Adapters &gt; Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260. In this step uninstall the files from the computer if prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you have a clean slate to install the Win10 drivers from Intel. Do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install the Win10 Bluetooth drivers in: WP-BT_17.1.1529.1613_t64.exe</p>
<p>2. Install the Wireless drivers in: Wireless_18.12.0_t64.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above reference the drivers for Win10 64 bit. Now Bluetooth&nbsp;Win10 should be working from a clean install. This has worked for me and I am able to pair my Bluetooth mouse, which previously wasn't being detected. A similar strategy may work for other cards,
 i.e. remove all instances of old drivers and install your manufacturer's Win10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Well, I did the same and it worked. But for some reason or conflict between Windows 10 pro 64 and Intel Bluetooth, it keeps crashing and disappearing from time to time. Very annoying as the only way to make it visible and working again is to restart the
 full process you already explained. </p>
<p>Intel support is useless in this field at the moment. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact error message that you get?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When was the last time the computer worked fine?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you facing the issue with sound only while the system is shutting down?</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue&nbsp; may occurs if the .wav file that is associated with the Exit Windows program plays for longer than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, configure the Exit Windows program to use a shorter-playing .wav file. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click
<b>Start</b>, type <b>sound</b> in the <b>Start Search</b> box, and then click <b>
Sound</b> in the <b>Programs</b> list.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click
<b>Continue</b>. </p>
<p>2. Click the
<b>Sounds</b> tab, and then click <b>Exit Windows</b> in the <b>Programs</b> list.</p>
<p>3. Click
<b>Browse</b>, locate a .wav file that plays for less than 10 seconds, and then click<b>Open</b>.
<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b> By default, following file is used for the Exit Windows program:</p>
<p><b>%windir%\media\Windows Shutdown.wav</b></p>
<p>4. Click
<b>Apply</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface Pro Type Cover Humidity Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynekarlen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Type Cover Humidity Failure</h2>
                    <p>Last year I had a type cover keyboard failure where keys would be misrepresented&nbsp;- it was intermittent and&nbsp;would come and go and made it very frustrating to type a letter.&nbsp; I was able to prove I could use another type cover keyboard without this error so
 Microsoft replaced the keyboard.&nbsp; Took so long that I bought a touch cover to get by with for my travelling.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week my replacement type cover started having a similar problem&nbsp;but was not intermittent and instead grew with severity in time.&nbsp; I was travelling but had access to a&nbsp;USB keyboard to tide me over.&nbsp; It was warm (33C) and extremely humid (&gt;90%) where&nbsp;I
 was at the time&nbsp;so it hit on me that perhaps the problem was humidity and condensation from the air in the keyboard circuitry.&nbsp; I left the keyboard in an air-conditioned room for a bit and the problem&nbsp;disappeared and now works fine&nbsp;while I restrict its&nbsp;use&nbsp;to&nbsp;less
 than high&nbsp;relative humidity environments.&nbsp; Moving from an air-conditioned or cold environment into warm surroundings might cause a problem even with medium humidity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a limitation with the type keyboard.&nbsp; I will try the touch keyboard next time in the high humidity conditions - it looks to be sealed and may not allow condensation in the internal circuitry.</p>
