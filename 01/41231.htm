<h2>            Installshield le fails to install even though requirements are met</h2>
                    <p>I just tried to install InstallShield into my Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate. The InstallShield installer fails, stating the I needed Visual Studio 2010, 2012, 2013 or 2015 Professional Edition or greater, which I have (see below). How do I get InstallShield
 to install correctly? I already tried running the installer as Administrator.&nbsp; Thanks...</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have mentioned that I am running under Windows 10. The clean boot instructions provided only included up to Windows 8.1.&nbsp;I used msconfig to select a "diagnostic startup" as shown:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90daa5f7-4439-4b32-b456-028809f1a070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90daa5f7-4439-4b32-b456-028809f1a070" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Installshield install again with the same results. It does not detect my Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, and failed to install. When I downloaded originally, I assume it did detect my Visual Studio, since I did the download from Visual Studio, and
 it provided a license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas or suggestions are most welcome. Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            User Account Control keeps turning off</h2>
                    My [User Account Control]&nbsp; keeps turning off every time I turn my pc on. I can not find out what the problem is.

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Go to Start / Search Box and type msconfig.exe and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the Tools Tab.&nbsp; Click on the Enable UAC (or UAP) line and then click on Launch.&nbsp; Then click Apply and OK.&nbsp; Reboot.&nbsp; UAC should start with
 startup.</p>
<p>But perhaps that's already true and it simply turns itself off after starting.&nbsp; Does it do so more or less immediately (while startup is still happening) or does it do so later (a few minutes, an hour,...)?&nbsp; How are you notified this&nbsp;occurred (do you get
 a notification message from somewhere {and what does it say EXACTLY word-for-word} or do you only realize it when you do something that would normally trigger a response and don't get one)?</p>
<p>Go to Start / Control Panel / User accounts / Turn User Account Control on or off and make sure the box is checked to turn it on.&nbsp; If this box isn't checked, it's possible startup is starting UAC but when it gets to the specifics of your user account that
 is turning it off.&nbsp; Anyway, it's worth checking just to be sure.</p>
<p>One it turns off, we should try to enable it in such a way that it fixes the problem at the same time.&nbsp; Check out:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969417</a>.&nbsp; Try the Mr. Fix-it and if that doesn''t work do
 the manual procedure.&nbsp; Let's hope that resolves the problem and isn't required every time you boot until we figure out what is happening.</p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You
 may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At
 this point, lets reassess the situation.&nbsp; Please post a reply with the results of what you tried and answers to any questions asked.&nbsp; If the problem persists, we can try some other alternatives.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I
 hope this helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Good
 luck!</span></span></span></p>

            Hi James,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />It's pretty simple, in This PC (the folder), you should be able to see the external hard drive. If you do not see it, show me a screenshot of File Explorer showing the drives, if you can.
<br />
<br />Have one window open for Pictures, and another for the external hard drive, and transfer the photos into it by dragging and dropping into the external hard drive's window.
<br />
<br />WD has software that could simplify the process for you, have a look: <a href="https://support.wdc.com/downloads.aspx?lang=ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.wdc.com/downloads.aspx?lang=ja</a>

            Hi James
<br />
<br />Connect that external drive
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, on the left, choose your Pictures Library
<br />
<br />On the right hand side, select the folders of photos you want to transfer, right click those and choose Send To - your external drive should be bottom of that Send To list
<br />
<br />Then, you would need to delete those photos from your PC to stop those being synced to OneDrive . . .

            Hi James.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See here how to move or copy large groups of files:  
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />You do not have to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders in OneDrive if you don't want.  See how to turn off Folder Protection here:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Instead you can simply place in the OneDrive folder the files you want stored in the cloud vs. what you want to store on your External hard drive.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Groove Music - Sign In Issues &#40;all my devices&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having major issues with Microsoft music, I tried the 30 day trial but it just doesn't want to work and I get a can't sign in, please try again later on all 3 of my Microsoft devices (windows phone, windows 10 tablet, windows 10 Desktop). The apps
 seems to sign in to my account on all 3 of my devices&nbsp;as my personal picture comes up, but when trying to&nbsp;play back any music it shows the sign in error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network connection&nbsp;- tested on WiFi + 3G with same results</p>
<p>Checked account locations match on Xbox live and Microsoft account, all say UK.</p>
<p>I have logged in on another account and it works, which means my main account I use with all my Microsoft devices seems at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on to microsoft&nbsp;tech support 6 times now and on one can seem to help me ):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>

<p>I've had the same issue. &nbsp; Squeaking is just loud enough to be bothersome at times. &nbsp; However, over the past few weeks, it seems to have gotten better. &nbsp;I still have a few weeks left in the warranty, but I'd hate to send it out and get back a refurbished
 one. &nbsp; Headsets are great, I have a pair of Astro A50's. &nbsp;But there are times I don't want to wear them (like when watching Netflix, etc). &nbsp; It wouldn't surprise me if there was a new "slim" Xbox One that comes out this Christmas... I may just buy a new one
 then.</p>

<p>I have a squeaky Xbox One that is making gaming and enjoying media not so enjoyable currently.</p>
<p>I just completed the option for Advance replacement via chat and a short phone call from Microsoft. Its $15 shipping on this faster option, but I will receive the replacement unit before I ship my old one. This works much better for me. Note: I'm still under
 warranty with Microsoft.</p>
<p>My experience with the chat and the phone call was really rather painless. </p>

    <title>Flashing Red Lights - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flashing Red Lights</h2>
                    
<p>Okay i sent in my xbox 360 before because of the flashing red lights problem and it was fixed,&nbsp;but a couple of months later it started acting up again.</p>
<p>Now I have 3 flashing lights and when i went to support to find out the problem it didn't help, all it told me to do was to buy another power cord..</p>
<p>Which is not necessary because i tested my xbox with my friend's power cord and it still has flashing lights, so its my xbox that has a problem.</p>

<p>usually when it flashes the red lights it'd post a display of the error on your TV -- such as E83 or something.....can you see if it gives you one of those?</p>
<p>another troubleshooting method would be to disconnect any and all accessories that you have hooked up to your XBOX360 -- to see if one of your accessories is causing the flashing lights/malfunction.
</p>
<p>try those steps and see if you get results, i'll try to help the best i can</p>

<p>Also, noting what 3 quadrants are flashing red will help determine the issue. Post back with this information. Like thefonz1986 said, unplug any devices you have attached other than your controller, power, and a-v cables before turning on your console.</p>

<p>I unplugged all the cords and took off the hard drive, and waited some hours even a day like so many times and still it continues with the 3 flashing lights.</p>

<p>have you tried to plug it in a different outlet to see if that may be linking to your problem? -- which 3 quadrants are lit up top left (1) top right (2) bottom left (3) bottom right (4) -- when looking at your power brick (the thing on your power cord that
 separates the console plug in from a wire connecting to your console vs the one that plugs into the wall) when you are testing the xbox...is the little light on it red, orange or green? try those and post the results please -- please don't forget to include
 which 3 quadrants are lighting up, thanks. </p>

<p>Yes I tried using different outlets and the same thing happens.</p>
<p>For the quadrants the top left, bottom left, and bottom right lights up.</p>
<p>For the power brick the light is orange but when i tried using my friend's power brick to test my 360 out it was orange too, but mines still had the red lights. Plus he claims his power brick always been like that, and his 360 works just fine.</p>

<p>If it's not the power supply and not the wall plug, it's more than likely a problem with the system itself. It will have to be sent in for servicing. Go to Xbox.com and contact the support team to setup a service call.</p>

<p>After changing the password, go to <a href="http://account.live.com/changeid.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Action Center&#47;Windows Update&#47;Flyouts&#47;MORE will NOT work in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelovett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action Center&#47;Windows Update&#47;Flyouts&#47;MORE will NOT work in Windows 10 PLUS No Login Box on Safe Mode, Inaccessible boot device</h2>
                    <p>I'm having <em>numerous</em> problems and I'm hoping someone can help me.&nbsp; I just upgraded to Windows 10 on my laptop and my desktop.&nbsp; My laptop was previously Windows 8.1 and my desktop was previously Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I used the Microsoft Media
 Creation Tool to upgrade both machines, on the same day, at roughly the same time.<br />
<br />
I accidentally clicked the Brightness setting in the Action Center on my laptop and suddenly the Action Center won't open anymore.&nbsp;
<strong>ALL</strong> Windows Updates fail, <em>repeatedly</em>, and will <strong>
NOT</strong> download and install.&nbsp; Windows Update <strong>WILL NOT SEARCH</strong> for new updates
<strong>AT ALL</strong>.&nbsp; The flyouts on the taskbar when you hover over a program or file do not show themselves.&nbsp; I've tried the DISM, the System Readiness Tool, SFC, the works, and
<em>nothing</em> has fixed it.&nbsp; I tried a System Restore and had to repair the drive, and once it was repaired, it
<em>STILL </em>wouldn't correct the problem.&nbsp; I've tried the Windows Troubleshooter, same results, or
<em>lack</em> thereof I should say.&nbsp; When I've tried the DISM, it can't find the source, even if I manually tell it where the source is (such as the network resource on my desktop which ironically
<em>is</em> working), telling me that none of them exist.<br />
<br />
I tried to reset the Group Policy Editor on the computer.&nbsp; According to search and the computer itself, the Group Policy Editor
<em>does not exist</em>, <strong>period</strong>.&nbsp; I tried repairing from a network location, using my desktop, which is functioning fine, with no results.&nbsp; I tried to find the WIM file used to install it to begin with, both on the latop (which
<em>isn't</em> working correctly) and the desktop (which <em>is</em> working fine
<em>so far</em>).&nbsp; According to the computer, it doesn't exist either.<br />
<br />
I've tried booting into Safe Mode, hoping for at least a few clues there.&nbsp; Instead, I got more frustration.&nbsp;
<strong>NO</strong> configuration of Safe Mode appears to have an option for networking via the Internet,
<em>not even the "Network" option</em>, which Windows Update <em>requires</em> in order for me to use it, but I can't test it because I can't use it.&nbsp; That seems more than a little silly to me.&nbsp; How am I supposed to update "safely" without an option to update
 in Safe Mode?<br />
<br />
I looked at the Recovery Options on the laptop, and it says I can reinstall Windows 10 (of which I'm highly doubtful at this point), and keep my files.&nbsp; My files, but
<strong>NOT</strong> my applications and programs I've spent the past four days, <em>
literally</em>, <strong>all day long</strong>, installing.&nbsp; I'm not entirely thrilled about an option that "should" work forcing me to install everything all over again when the whole point is
<em>not</em> to have to do this to begin with.&nbsp; I was just getting everything set into the ways I like them to be set, just starting to straighten everything out after the chaos of installing it all.<br />
<br />
If there is <strong>ANY</strong> way to fix this without having to practically "rebuild Rome" I would
<strong>GREATLY</strong> appreciate help, instructions, <em>anything</em> that could help.&nbsp; I'm quickly reaching the end of my wits with this.&nbsp; Thank you very much</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update #1:</strong>&nbsp; Since I wrote this note, I'm now experiencing a <strong>
NEW</strong> problem.&nbsp; I attempted to enter Safe Mode to test to see if it was something third party, or something Windows related causing the problems I described above.&nbsp; Once in Safe Mode, even with the Networking option enabled, I still had no access to
 the internet to test Windows Update.&nbsp; I tried two or three different combinations with no differing results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I restarted the computer, again, in Safe Mode.&nbsp; It attempted to boot up in Safe Mode again.&nbsp; The problem, however, is that while I have the Windows 10 logo, and the little icons that represent internet access, ease of access and shutdown,
<em><strong>there is no login box AT ALL.</strong></em>&nbsp; I have <em>nowhere</em> to enter my password to go forward to my desktop.&nbsp; If I tell it to restart, it reboots to the
<em>exact same situation, still in Safe Mode.</em>&nbsp; If I tell it to shut down, <em>
precisely the exact same results.</em>&nbsp; It will <strong>NOT</strong> revert back to the normal boot sequence, like its supposed to.&nbsp; This is going from aggravation and frustration to full blown rage inducing meltdown territory.&nbsp; There is absolutely
<strong>NO REASON AT ALL</strong> these very simple tasks should be anywhere near this complicated and ridiculous.&nbsp; I again will be very grateful for any and all assistance you can offer in this situation.&nbsp; I'm just understandably very frustrated at this point</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update #2:</strong>&nbsp; Several hours later, I've tried, <em>repeatedly</em>, to reinstall Windows 10 on the machine.&nbsp; I tried creating a DVD with the Media Creation Tool, which did
<em>not</em> work at all.&nbsp; I tried creating a USB flash drive, which enabled me to reinstall (so it claimed) but gave me the INACESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE error, and will
<em>not</em> stop restarting, over and over and over and over and over....and you get the picture.&nbsp; I've subsequently tried
<em>every</em> option available on the menu <em>at least twice if not <strong>more</strong></em> to absolutely
<em>no avail whatsoever.</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>only</em> thing I haven't attempted is to completely and totally "nuke and repave" my laptop, namely completely and totally install, formatting the drive, the whole nine yards.&nbsp; My concern is, if I do that, will I be forced to buy a product I've
 already received a free upgrade for?&nbsp; Will it recognize my computer, and draw my existing license key from the protected memory of my hard drive, or will it insist that I
<em>must</em> purchase Windows 10 in order to install it?&nbsp; I can't access the old recovery partitions or anything else on the drive to reinstall Windows 8.1, so I can't get the machine back the way it was
<em>before</em> this three ring circus happened, and then reupgrade it.&nbsp; I can't roll it back within Windows 10 because I can't get to my desktop or anything else in the system to actually start this process.&nbsp; The only possibility I have is completely tearing
 it down and starting over, but I refuse to be forced to buy something I already had because of some ridiculous glitch in code.&nbsp; All of this started because I accidentally clicked the brightness setting in the Action Center instead of the box next to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, Microsoft techs, or <em>anybody</em> knowledgeable of these things and that has any insight at all into how to fix this, please let me know.&nbsp; Leave me instructions, do whatever, I just really need to get this resolved.&nbsp; I passed my wits' end several
 hours ago.&nbsp; Thank you for your time</p>

            My wife's HP laptop also stopped working with the action center.&nbsp; I too had hit the brightness control, went to 25%, then multiple hits got back to 100%.&nbsp; Sometime after the brightness control setting noticed that the action/notification center no longer
 worked.

    <title>Switch to open instances of a program using keyboard shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan sokalski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switch to open instances of a program using keyboard shortcuts</h2>
                    
<p>I often have multiple instances of Internet Explorer, Notepad, or other applications open at the same time. I know how to use the keyboard shortcut Windows Logo+number to switch to the group in the position number, but this always switches to the first instance
 of the application. Is there a simple keyboard shortcut that will let me switch to one of the specific instances? In my opinion, the shortcut mentioned above should be used to do this, but apparently Microsoft thought people would like the jumplists on the
 taskbar more than they did. I just changed my taskbar settings to Use Small Icons and Never Combine so that it looks and acts ALMOST like it did in Windows XP (instances of the same program are grouped, so you can click them just like before, but they look
 like one big button divided into sections). This isn't a big deal, I just want to know a quick way to switch to a specific instance using the keyboard. Any ideas? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Nathan</p>
<p>If you have Aero enabled, use the following technique.</p>
<p>Press and hold the Windows Logo Key and press the &lt;number&gt; for the program that you want to focus on in the Taskbar.</p>
<p>Keep the Windows Logo Key pressed and start pressing the &lt;number&gt; key. Each time you press the &lt;number&gt; key, you will see the full screen preview of one of the open windows. When you see the one you want displayed, release the Windows Logo Key.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
From what I understand the Xbox 360 Slim does not have any sort of memory unit slot so it would be impossible to transfer the data. Unless you were able to move the data from the memory unit onto a USB Flash Drive (upwards of 16GB) that would seem to be the
 only way you can transfer the data from the memory unit to the new console.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you would need to have access to an old console in order to be able to use a transfer cable. If the console turns on and it reads the memory drive then you should be able to use the transfer cable to transfer over the data from the memory unit
 straight to the 250GB hard drive.</p>

<p>The Xbox 360 Slim does not have a memory card slot, only HDD and USB. If you have access to another Original Xbox 360, you should be able to save the data from your memory cards to a USB, and then transfer said data from those USB drives, to your Xbox 360
 Slim.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>There are third party USB to Memory Unit cradles out there. They only work with Corona model consoles (first generation 360 S), and only on the front two USB ports. Trinity consoles dropped original MU support via the front two USB ports.</p>

Answers to 1 and 2:&nbsp; I am using a SanDisk external device, which when inserted into computer, shows the files I have in "F" drive, but when I try to open them, on seems to be blank inside and the other 3 open to
 crazy symbols.&nbsp; I do not get an error message.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. What do you mean by “</span><span>MY HDMI DEVICE WAS LOST, HOW I CAN RECOVERED” is HDMI device not getting detected?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
I would suggest you to run the following troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a><br />
<b><br />
Method 2<br />
</b>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
</span><span>Connect your computer to a TV<br />

    <title>Problem connecting to the internet via AOL &#47; Internet explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem connecting to the internet via AOL &#47; Internet explorer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently had the following error message come up when trying to connect to the internet via AOL:</p>
<p>ACS 4.9.9.1</p>
<p>TCP/IP Connection: Err 0x84008504 Vista-SP2</p>
<p>This would suggest to me that the problem is not with AOL but with the Vista service pack 2 update, especially as the problem is a recent occurrance after installing the service pack update. When I am able to get a connection and get on AOL, I can't get
 on most secure webpages, including hotmail.</p>
<p>Any ideas on this problem?</p>
<p>Cheers, Chris.</p>

            Thanks for the info. For some reason I didn't have the same problem today when logging onto the internet and so far I haven't had a problem with the same websites I had problems with yesterday. When I see this problem again, I'll try your suggestions and
 see if that makes a difference, then post the results. Cheers.
