<h2>            Windows sound randomly gets loud</h2>
                    <p>It's really weird.</p>
<p>Between short gaps&nbsp;where no sound is played by any app, my system somehow decides to put up the volume immensely. The actual system sound value doesn't change. Those no sound gaps can even be just a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>In order to get back to normal volume, I have to change the system volume just slightly, and everything is back to normal (muting and unmuting system sound doesn't change anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not that big of a problem but it's just annoying since I don't have any hotkeys on my mouse or anything to fix it quickly.</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me.</p>

            Hello daalsat.
<br />
<br />Did you notice that when it happens some particular apps are running?
<br />
<br />Please check the issue in clean boot mode:

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No extraordinary apps running when it happens. It does happen very frequently. Apps that I almost always run are my Browser (Opera), Steam, Spotify and Discord.</p>
<p>What I did notice though is that when I'm in a Discord Channel, the problem doesn't occur. Even when I'm alone in a channel, muted and deafened, it somehow counts as a "permanent sound", so this sound problem won't occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestion of a clean boot mode. I disabled more drivers than I thought, but it didn't seem to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran some virus scans without success. Sound drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help so far.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the troubleshooter couldn't fix my problem. What I am going to try is using different sound devices (other sound ports, bluetooth etc.) and see if the choice of device has any impact on my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my primary sound device a Logitech G433 headset. I've used it on other computers to make sure it isn't a hardware problem on my heahpones, but the issue only occured on my main PC.</p>

<p>He asked for the best sniper rifle, not the best weapon to snipe with. :P</p>
<p>Its all about personal preference. I your gonna wanna decide between a semi-auto or a bolt-action sniper rifle. I prefer bolt action, I feel I can be more accurate and controlled. However I know people who completely disagree. As far as damage I'm not believe
 all bolt-actions do the same amount, while all semi-autos do the same amount. I switch off between the SV98 and the M450A5. I cant stand the M98B , it feels to slow when chambering the next round. If I had to choose I feel most comfortable with the SV98. Just
 keep playing sniper and try out the new ones you unlock. Each gun has a unique feel to it. As far as scopes I prefer a 12x, combined with my sensitivity I like the tracking speed it gives me, Again this is all personal preference your gonna have to try them
 all and see which feels most comfortable.</p>

<p>M98B has almost no bullet drop and it is extremely accurate. I don't think it's even debatable...as for chambering the next round, I think the M98B is just as quick as the SV and M40.</p>

<p>Eh, might not be for you. In my brief use of it I didn't notice it being much more accurate or having less bullet drop. It might chamber as fast as the others, it just feels slower it me.</p>

<p>The M98B I believe is the best because you have to compensate less for bullet drop off. That said...If you use a rifle long enough then you will get used to the drop off. It's interesting then because if you go to use another rifle, you'll be all off at
 long range. So my advice is to find one you like and stick with it.</p>
<p>The only time I switch is to use the SKS (or now I'm trying out the new semi from Karkland) for close quarters combat. They screwed up the IR scope so it's less fun on Metro, but I still manage with an RDS sight or even ACOG. You can do pretty amazing things
 with an SKS and I don't think you're at a huge disadvantage compared to assault rifles. Assault rifles go too fast with ammo and you feel compelled to keep them at a fast fire rate and spray to suppress. Then you look and you're out of ammo. I feel that a
 semi auto sniper rifle, you're at least thinking more about your shots and there's less recoil (or as much, but by the time you can fire the next round the gun has came back down by then).</p>
<p>I've unlocked all sniper rifles in the game except the EMR and the new bolt action in Karkland. I also have over 800 sniper kills and a recon service star. Basically, I've used them all. Not only that, but I have most of all the weapon unlocks for each one.
 I've tried a lot of combinations.</p>
<p>It's sad that many of the attachments are a complete waste. I wish they would have put a little more thought into it... Even if it resulted in less unlocks -- that's fine, but don't give me a useless item. I also wish bolt action rifles were a one shot one
 kill.</p>
<p>The M98B CAN be a one shot one kill in the head or center mass. Always the head. Sometimes the center mass. I want to say it's because maybe the player was damaged, but sometimes I swear it's 100% health center mass kill. It could be range? I don't know.</p>
<p>Anyway, you want to use the straight bolt pull on these weapons unless you are at extreme ranges. Then 12x scope and bipod. You do NOT need a bipod for an 8x scope or anything less. You can steady those! If you have an 8X scope or lower power, then you are
 closer. If you are closer, you want the reload speed of the straight bolt pull.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the M98B has 5 (+1 chambered) shots whereas the M40 has 10+1. I DO like the M40 and it also has less drop off...But something about it I feel like isn't as good as the M98B. I think it is probably the drop off even though it's ever so slightly
 more compared to the M98B. I would say it's up to how you feel about how much ammo you have.</p>
<p>Also, I usually always use ammo specialization. I find that I don't die often and run out of ammo a lot. However, suppression bonus is good to have so when you miss (which is typically by a little bit) you're at least taking away their ability to accurately
 return fire.</p>
<p>Use the MAV. Paint targets (you can also spot through your rifle scope of course, actually any weapon zoomed in you can hit select with to spot...so EVERYONE should be doing this...unless maybe it's only recon class that can I don't know for sure). Alternatively
 if you don't feel like helping your team, use the TUGS to cover your rear.</p>
<p>Anyway this is going off subject.</p>
<p>Best gun? M98B for sure. I will try the new Karkland bolt action rifle, but from what I've read the range is less (I saw 800 meters vs the 1200+ of the M98B and the 1000 of the M40). So I'm probably still gonna stay with the M98B.</p>

            Hello Manasa,
<p>Thank you for helping, but who is <strong><span>donnabilln</span>
</strong><span>?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, I followed your links and found out my drivers were already updated. I had done it. I also receive the Windows updates. At this moment I have over 50 for Windows and Office, which I installed meanwhile. If this issue comes from obsolete drivers
 or missing updates, how can I find from which one? Surely not from Office or its updates because it was already there before it was installed. Also, when simply shutting down, it can take over five minuts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, I have read many people complaining about issues after downloading updates. Do you think it could be from that? Is it worth to remove all updates to check if it will be from one of them? Can I do it and reinstall the updates afterwards without
 getting into further problems? Tell me, please.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When <em>Resuming Windows</em> appears it slows down enormously; the logo above shrinks and enlarges extremely slowly, and I now counted about 19 full cycles, too many. After resuming it becomes normal again. What is strange is that the hibernation
 links all disappeared except for those on all the <em>power plans</em> settings, but the computer does go into sleep and hibernation according to what is set up on the plans. So if the hibernation links disappeared, that is not much of a problem, but it is
 useless to hibernate when waking up takes so long.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span><br />

<p>The cause might be from a driver. Through the years I have noticed that when I change for a new motherboard, sleep and hibernation are not always present with the Windows drivers, but I have used the manufacturer’s and can’t find newer ones on their sites.
 Hence my problem. Will it really be from a driver or something else?<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I could solve the long shutdown problem without help. As it is a home computer and no one else using it but me, there are no secrets to keep on the page file. By not clearing the page file it shuts down in a flash.<br />
<br />
However, I could not solve the problem with long time on waking from hibernation. Booting time is reasonable. Searching again on the performance event logs, I found new critical references. These are the only meaning lines of three logs in chronological order
 (older first, but not really important):</p>

<p><span>From what we can read the fault seems to be on the ASUS/ATI atikmdag.sys VGA driver file. However, as I said on my first post, all drivers are up to date, including this one and according
 to the manufacturer’s web site. The driver version is mentioned on one of the logs and can be checked
<a href="http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?modelname=M4A785TD-V%20EVO&amp;SLanguage=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong> </a>. All I can do is to apply an older driver still available on that site. The same applies to the audio driver.<br />
</span></p>
Then, I read some specific information on this drive on ASUS web site <strong><a href="http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?board_id=9&amp;model=EAH5870%20Series&amp;id=20100107001547578&amp;page=1&amp;SLanguage=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 .</strong>
This thread has been here for some time without a solution or feedback, even if I believe it has sufficient information. If the information is not enough, please ask what else I must provide.
<p>Can someone tell me what I can do, please?</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi Straydog,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to uninstall and re-install the Display drivers and then check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌<br />
<br />
b.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Look for the Display adapter drivers, right click on it and select
<br />
<strong>Uninstall.</strong><br />
d. Reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>e. On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Hope this helps. Get back to us with results.</span></p>

<br />

<p>Hi Manasa,</p>
<p>I followed your instructions, thanks. Windows found the drivers both for audio and video with the same version number, but not exactly the same. I can't find the faulty
<span>atikmdag.sys </span>file is not found on the driver details list on the of display adapter proprieties. So it is probably not coming from that alone. However, the display configuration on Catalyst Control Center is no longer available.
 The hibernation option on the Start Menu / Shut down&nbsp; didn't come back even if hibernation is still possible as before with the keyboard as selected on the power configuration options — this didn't change. Worse,
<strong>the awake time from hibernation</strong>, the main issue, <strong>didn't change</strong> either.</p>
<p>I have found some references to diagnostics with Visual Studio 2010 Diagnostic Tool. I downloaded the file and I have the results on the hibernation-resume tracing. I don't have enough knowledge to understand the results, so I have uploaded them for someone
 read them and please tell me what they mean and what I have to do. The files can be downloaded. I made two settings. One contains a set with all the
<a href="http://www.leaopelado.org/issue/Tracing.rar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>four traces</strong></a>. The other one only the <a href="http://www.leaopelado.org/issue/Hibernate+Resume_tracing.rar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Hibernate+Resume</strong> </a>tracing.</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me on solving this very annoying issue, please.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I can't analyze the boot and hibernation traces, because they lost a lot of information. I only saw, that Write Caching is disabled on your HDDs. Why did you disable it?</p>
<p>Enable it and check if the issues are gone.</p>

            Thanks for answering, André. As you can see, waking up from hibernation takes so long that I can’t hibernate. I have been searching for a solution much before I opened this thread (look up the date, please).
<p>Well, I am surprised for your two remarks.</p>
First, I just uploaded the tracing test directly copied from the temporary file well after it ended. I have just uploaded a fresh one now with Filezilla. If the same thing happens I don’t know why, maybe you do and could tell me how to correct it. I’ll have
 to provide you with the needed data.
<p>Second, the write caching settings is something strange because I have never tried to change that on the HDDs. So I went to look up and change, but then I was astonished to find that the tab to set it up is not where it should be for two of my hard disks.
 Look what I found:</p>
<p>I have three disks. As two of them are not SATA and I have a CD and a DVD already connected to the only possible ATA connection on my motherboard, I have these two ATA disks connected through a PCI adapter named “Silicon Image SiI 0680 ATA-133 Medley Raid
 Controller”. It is from these two disks properties that the Policies tabs to set the write caching are not present. They are not present on the controller either, so that I’ll have to contact the manufacturer to know how to make the change. I’ll get back to
 tell about this as soon as I can.</p>
Do you think the long awake can come from this problem?
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> <br />
<br />
I uploaded a new Hibernate+Resume_tracing.rar file. About the write caching settings, I didn’t need to contact the manufacturer because I found them, even if not how to change. I also uploaded images of the these write caching settings for you to check up.
 Thank you. Please advice.</p>

<p>Hi, the new trace works.</p>
<p>suspending the system (services and applications) is fast. Also the resuming of the services and programs is fast. From what I see, it's a HDD issue. Writing and reading the data from the hibernation file takes to long.</p>
<p>Try to get driver, which allows you to enable caching!</p>
<p><br />

You told me, that you can't find an option to enable the Write caching in the device manager. So try t get new drivers from Silicon Image which allow you to enable write caching. This will fix your issue.<br />

            Actually, I have had this EXACT same problem.&nbsp;It's a problem with the&nbsp;video&nbsp;card on your computer. Try updating the graphics card drivers. Or you could continue using your mom's computer.

<h2>            skype account dialing telephones in north america</h2>
                    <p>I have had a skype account for years and have subscribed to a no limit any telephone call, land and mobile, in North Amarica and had a $29+ credit sitting for overseas calls.</p>
<p>Today everything has disappeared. I have nothing. No credit no contact list, and apparently no plan either. What the heck is going on???</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your Skype Credits and contacts should sync on your Skype app whenever you’re signed in to it. Sign out of your Skype account and sign back in
 again using the correct <strong><em>Skype Name</em></strong>. Most likely you are signed in to Skype using a different account, probably a Microsoft Skype account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Signing in to Skype using a Microsoft email address can route you to a Microsoft Skype account which is a totally new account that is linked with
 your Microsoft account. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
 If you encountered any sign in issues, please change your Skype account password using this
<a href="https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

    <title>Cannot turn on network firewall for windows10 - SOLVED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabrinachae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot turn on network firewall for windows10 - SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>Every time I turn on my computer I get a notification about my computer firewall.</p>
<p>I choose the option "turn on Kaspersky total security" but when I go to control panel&gt;System and Security&gt;Security and Maintenance</p>
<p>it says under Network firewall that windows firewall and kaspersky total security are both turned off. I don't know how to turn them on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to Services, and it says Windows firewall is running and is automatic.</p>
<p>The same goes for Kaspersky Anti-virus services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my computer protected? What's causing this notification? Any ideas on how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>=========================================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem was solved by itself after the last windows update.</p>
<p>I turned on my computer today to uninstall and reinstall my Kaspersky as suggested, but before I did anything I noticed that I didn't receive any security notification.</p>
<p>I checked my security and maintenance, and it now says Kaspersky total security is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the last update did, but it seems to have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you everyone for your kind responses.</p>

            <p>There could be a conflict with Windows Firewall and Kaspersky A/V. &nbsp; Does your A/V have a firewall included with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to uninstall Kaspersky completely, then reboot your computer. &nbsp; Then check whether you can adjust the settings for Windows Firewall. &nbsp; If you can, and you want to continue to use Kaspersky, then turn off Windows Firewall and reinstall Kaspersky.
 &nbsp; Make sure that you have a product key, etc. if you don't have the installation disks for it.</p>

            Hi GBrooks799 ... system restore fails when there is too much corruption in the existing operating system.
<br />When that occurs I always advise to do a clean install of Windows.
<br />Why does corruption happen?  Bad updates, upgrade from previous versions, incompatible drivers or apps etc. 
<br />Below is a link from Greg on how to do a clean install.  
<br />Better than keep digging hole deeper by continuing to troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<p>1) System restore is an unreliable method to troubleshoot computer problems.</p>
<p>a) many times the restore points do not work</p>
<p>b) many times if the restore points work they do not predate the computer problems</p>
<p>c) many times there may be no restore points when you need them</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There are substantially better methods to protect the computer from:</p>
<p>malware</p>
<p>ransomware</p>
<p>corruption of the operating system</p>
<p>corruption of the registry</p>
<p>sluggishness</p>
<p>failure to boot </p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) There are other methods to troubleshoot speed and pep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Open the website for the computer or motherboard manufacturer &gt; support &gt; enter the product or serial number or model &gt; select the operating system &gt; view drivers &gt; post a URL or hyperlink into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) To evaluate the computer environment please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
6) Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3813-language-add-remove-change-windows-10-a.html<br />
<br />
<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
7) Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive, drop box, or google drive to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-OneDrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07<br />
<br />
This command will automatically collect these files:&nbsp; msinfo32, mini dumps, drivers, hosts, install, uninstall, services, startup, event viewer files, etc.<br />
<br />
8) Open administrative command prompt and copy and paste the whole command:<br />
<br />
copy %SystemRoot%\minidump\*.dmp "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\"&amp;dxdiag /t %Temp%\dxdiag.txt&amp;copy %Temp%\dxdiag.txt "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\SFdebugFiles\"&amp;type %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts &gt;&gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\hosts.txt"&amp;systeminfo &gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\systeminfo.txt"&amp;driverquery

<br />
9) There is one file for you to find manually:&nbsp; dxdiag:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In the left lower corner search type:&nbsp; dxdiag &gt; When the DirectX Diagnostic Tool opens click on the next page button so that each tab is opened &gt; click on save all information &gt; save to desktop &gt; post one drive or drop box share link into the thread<br />

<h3> davidthomas_dgt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t my HP laptop to upgrade from 8.1 to 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Pavilion laptop on which I am unable to upgrade to windows 10 from 8.1. I have downloaded the update about 6 times, gone through the full procedure as far as the laptop displaying a configuring windows 10 upgrade message only for it to restart
 and load up windows 8.1 again. The update history just shows it has failed to update. When I click on more details I get the error code 80004005 every time. Any ideas / solutions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent

    <title>OS Memory Leak - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryantherhinox  say:</h3>
<h2>            OS Memory Leak</h2>
                    Problem: After 2-3 weeks of using the xbox one it has become sluggish. On several occasions while navigating the home screen the video will freeze but audio will play. A minute or two later the video will catch up with the audio and the problem resolves
 itself. Fix: Hard re-boot the console. Since the xbox one only enters sleep mode the volatile memory never gets a chance to reset. The xbox runs much faster / smoother after a hard re-boot. Conclusion/opinion After 2-3 weeks of daily "heavy" use the xbox one
 shows signs of poor memory management. Allowing the xbox one to completely turn off seems to help with performance.

<p>I have always thought of it as the Xbox version of Hibernate on computers. Every so often we just need to fully reboot the system (2 min power drain on console works for me) the clear out all that system data. Perhaps this is something that will be getting
 resolved in the coming year? </p>

<p>Pressing (or touching I guess) the power button for 5-10 seconds will hard shutdown the console. The problem is known, at least to the community, but I'm not sure if Microsoft has acknowledged it yet.</p>

support.xbox.com/.../power-cycle-console</a> &nbsp;or &nbsp;With the console on, press and hold the power button on the console for 5 seconds until it shuts off. &nbsp;Unplug the power supply, wait about 30 seconds and then plug it in and reboot. &nbsp;You should see the green
 splash screen upon reboot. &nbsp;It may take a minute to boot all the way to the home screen. &nbsp;As FatherSama said doing this once per week seems to be the best way to keep things in check until a patch comes.</p>

                    I own a HP DC-5800 which came with Windows Vista Business Cd's which is activated. I now want to install Windows 7 Ultimate to this computer. Since I will no longer be using the Windows Vista Business Operating system on this computer, am I allowed to
 use it in one of my other computers &amp; activate it. It would seem logical for me to do this because I will no longer be using it on the HP DC-5800 computer.

<h2>            100&#37; DISK USAGE, STILL NO SOLUTION.</h2>
                    <p>For 4-6 months I've had this issue with windows 10 100% disk usage, I've spoken to so many of microsoft support staff, every time I end the live chat and remote access with them, they say "it will not happen again", even though all they do is do what I've
 already done by reading forums, They do the exact same as the last person I speak to, It's a known bug on windows 10, I don't understand how it's not been resolved yet.</p>
<p>I don't mean to sound rude but it's highly annoying, when I need my computer to work, I've had to lend an old laptop off a friend for a while.</p>
<p>What else could be the issue?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know it says Chrome is at the top of the list in this picture but that's usually not the issue at all.</p>
<p>I'm looking at it right now and the 'Service Host: Local System (16)' is the highest, along with 'wsappx (2)'</p>

            Was this an upgrade or clean install? Often upgrades leave behind junk that causes issues. As a last resort a clean install might rectify the issue.

<h2>            explorer.exe crashing every 30 seconds or so, don&#39;t know how to fix it</h2>
                    Every 30 seconds or so explorer.exe (Windows explorer not Internet Explorer) will crash, reloading the taskbar and closing all open WE windows. This is quite frustrating as I type a lot and every time explorer.exe crashes I have to click the window I was
 in to keep typing. How to I fix this? I'm running Windows 8.1 64 bit operating system with 4gb Ram and AMD Radeon HD 7520g processor.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Media Player 11 does not recognize blank CD in CD DRIVE but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ohallock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 does not recognize blank CD in CD DRIVE but Win XP file system does allow file transfer.</h2>
                    Windows Media Player 11 does not recognize blank CD in CD DRIVE. It willl attempt to burn if called secondarily if a lot of music files are put in the D: tmp cache to write to disk, after activating write files to CD disk, MS Media Player is called to
 burn a lot of music files but none will be transfered, something like try again at a slower speed, but a slower speed setting will still do nothing, but on hitting burn buttons in Media Player it does not see a blank disk in the drive, even at first burn to
 disk buttons would not even look for the disk with another audio program hogging all the .mp3 &amp; .wav file associations. &amp; I see on searching that a lot of people have this problem &amp; no one is providing answers. I can write one music file at a time one on to
 the CD and write them thru XP D: cd cache but not a collection all qued in waiting to write to cd cache at once. The Media Player 11 is getting so bad that on occassion with nothing else running hitting the burn button at the end of a music list and windows
 XP home closes up and shuts down, like the shut down button was activated, yet&nbsp; the DVD D: win xp icon transfer cache folder will read write &amp; erase a CD with little problem except with multiple music files.&nbsp; The playlist would not even activate the wizard
 via the burn button until I changed the music file assocations to point media player. Now the CD Writting Wizard will not recognize a blank disk if has been writting to with just a cache of music to write, error there is no disk in the drive. Thanks need solution
 particulary, if it is crashing windows xp entirely from the burn button?&nbsp;<br />

<p><span>Hi Ohallock,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 the drive read other CD’s and DVD’s on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message when you insert the disc?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any third party CD DVD burning software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to clear the Windows Media Player database and later try to burn the music files to the CD and check if it helps. To do this,
 follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Exit
 Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span>Start</span>,
 click <span>Run</span>, type <span>%userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Media Player</span>, and then click<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 all the files in the folder, and then click<span>Delete</span> on the <span>File</span> menu.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 Windows Media Player.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Exit
 Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span>Start</span>,
 click <span>Run</span>, type <span>%userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft</span>, and then click<span>OK</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 the<span>Media Player</span> folder, and then click <span>Delete</span> on the <span>
File</span> menu. </span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 Windows Media Player.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also run Microsoft “fix it tool” and check it helps you get the CD / DVD drive to burn the
 disk properly. Access the link below and follow the steps. If fix it tool does not help you may try to perform the steps manually in the article and check if it helps you burn the disc from Windows Media player.</span></p>

Have you contacted Groupon to check if it is a known issue?<br />

<div>It seems like whenever I try to draw on a drawing software ( Photoshop, Paint, Flash even iScribble.net ) the brush stroke is just dragging behind the cursor until it stops. It occurs with the tablet and the mouse. I've disabled the tablet driver that
 came with windows already and my Wacom Tablet driver is up to date. Enhance cursor perfomance is checked as it does nothing for my problem.&nbsp;

            I have exactly the same problem. The problem is not with mspaint. There is a little lag on ALL the drawing programs i use. A cleanboot is not correcting the problem. Performance troubleshooter is only saying some programs are loading at the boot (they will not affect performances in my windows). 



To give you an idea, i have Intel i5-2500k 3,33Ghz, 16 GB ram DDR3, nVidia 570 GTX...  



Don't think it's a performance problem... I just think drawing on Windows 7 is ****. I got this problem in mspaint, flashplayer, iscribble, photostop CS4, but there is no delay between the pointer and the physical mouse. Only delay between the stroke and the pointer. Always....

            <p><span>Hi VincentGagné-Perrier,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot."
 A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When
 you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Performance troubleshooter checks issues that might slow down the computer's performance, such as how many users are currently logged on to
 the computer and whether multiple programs are running at the same time. 
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to</span>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>update</span></a><span>

<p>The cleanboot is doing nothing because the installation of windows is fresh ! There is no programs in conflicts !</p>

             Well,  forum moderators and support engineers, you may want to dig deeper into the issues rather than responding with scripted responses. 



I too am having the identical issue.  I can tell you that when using my Gmail account via the Windows * mail app, I can send an text email with no issue, but - as of late - any email that has a photo attached will fail.  Using a browser, I can log into my gmail account and - via the gmail interface - successfully send the email with the photo.

<div>Hi Syed</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was hoping for a more serious response from a company like microsoft. I'm a sw validation engineer and i can identify a bug when i see one.</div>
<div>the least you can do is to try to reproduce it.</div>
<div>just get a gmail account and try to config it in the mail app. then try to send an email with any attachment.</div>
<div>this doesn't wort for about 20 of my cs study class. so imagine the regular end user.</div>
<div>please don't send me a tutorial.. tell me that you, or someone in microsoft tried to reproduce it.</div>
<div>and if it worked then you can send me tutorial.</div>
<div><br />
<div>and btw my iphone works perfect with gmail and this isn't google..</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>
</p><p>Cortana translates my speech to text quite well, but Windows Speech Recognition is lousy. It is all Microsoft! Why doesn't Microsoft share technology so we can have an effective way to dictate into Word Docs? Through our phones, we can all dictate our emails
 and texts and docs through Siri and Google just fine. Why the delay with Microsoft? or have so many of us just not found out how yet?</p>

            <p>With all due respect to the answer from Jenith, it does not address the problem. I, too cannot get speech recognition to work. I have done all the training, configured microphone, and practiced the speech training over and over, to no avail. If I try using
 speech recognition for dictation, it simply types gibberish. I speak as distinctly as possible. A simple " The dog is brown" sentence will come out looking like this "axgbfl." It is not even typing words.</p>
<p>And Cortana is only slightly better. She types words but not the correct one. </p>
<p>Now I &nbsp;tried a simple experiment. I used the google microphone search option and spoke commands and sentences to my computer. &nbsp;Each time the google prompt &nbsp;typed them perfectly, so clearly the microphone is able to hear me just fine.</p>
<p>I did it multiple times, same position in my office chair, same tone of voice. Google worked perfect, Cortana and speech recognition did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example : I tried this same sentence with all three programs. </p>
<p>I said "Start speech recognition".<br />
</p>
<p>Google search typed the phrase perfectly.</p>
<p>Cortana typed "Hie Vee invasion"</p>
<p>Speech recognition typed a series of random gibberish letters once again that did not form a word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 , all updates installed, computer less than a year old. So what is wrong? It seems like the speech recognition program does not work at all. I have used the older version before on different computers and it usee to work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the microphone as I described, it works fine with other programs.</p>
<p>Cortana sometimes gets it right, but really the misses outweigh the hits and it isn't worth trying. I need a dictation program and don't want to pay for one if I can help it, particularly because it seems such a simple thing. My kindle and my Iphone also
 hear me just fine, right now I am using them primarily instead of my home office computer for dictation which is my temporary answer, but I need to be able to use my computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone give an honest solution without referring me to a generic article - is there something corrupted with a file I need to fix?</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Susan</p>

<p>Thank you for your supportive response and verification that it is not just me! Your response will save me (and my wife) a lot of time trying to get my wife to (unsuccessfully) convert over to dictation on her PC. &nbsp;She'll just keep using Siri on her phone
 for now, then email her dictation to herself and copy and paste. That will be a lot less work and frustration, even with the extra steps. Thanks again, Ron
</p>
<p>(Why on earth can't a company like Microsoft get it right when Google and Apple can and do?! Microsoft says says it is trying to compete in the mobile and more current scene, but isn't even close on this basic piece of the action. It would help the productivity
 and accessibility of their own product, Word, tremendously.)</p>

            <p>A lot of straying from the original question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can dictate to word documents in PC, Office 2013,&nbsp;and phone with Windows 10, the feature is there.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 Mobile phones you can use speech to text for emails and SMS. There is no delay. The phones have the feature right now.</p>
<p>Maybe you haven't used a Windows 10 phone yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speech recognition works very well on the phone, haven't used it on the PC much.</p>

            <p>See, this is the problem. I know how it is SUPPOSED to work, and it just doesn't. As I stated before, I can get another speech recognition tool on my computer to work perfectly with no fuss whatsoever( google search - it has a speech option). Microphone
 works just fine for that and the program understands me clearly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using WSR multiple times, I know how to start it, I know the command prompts, &nbsp;I know how to use it as I used it on older computers. I know how to speak clearly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these things work. I constantly get helpful hints from it , like "try saying start listening" about 5 times before it will finally kick in. Then, once I get it to finally understand I am dictating and get the program to begin typing, it just types
 gibberish. Not words, just random letters in a row like this : "xbhfkalopwskghj"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried speaking single letters clearly, like "A. B. C." and still will get gkj or some nonsense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked all the settings over and over, it does not work 98% of the time. Every once in a blue moon it will get it right. I have spent hours fussing with it. &nbsp;Cortana is only accurate about 30% of the time. It is NOT user error. I am not a novice at this
 and like I said, I can get perfect results using google mic on search, so it isn't a mic error. I have used 4 different microphones as a test. My regular computer one, 2 different headsets, and a high end Yeti. None work with WSR, all work with google.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has to be a program error. &nbsp;My question is how to fix it. &nbsp;It is obviously faulty software on some systems. If yours works then I am thrilled to know it can work, as I really need it and don't want to buy Dragon. I just want to know is there a fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I am not the only one with the problem, and I know my way around a computer, so if there is a patch to fix this I would appreciate someone sharing.</p>

            <p>Let's face it: Speech recognition in general is lousy. It's a technology that still has a long, long way to go. Some applications are less lousy at it, and some are more lousy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best is probably software by Nuance (Dragon Naturally Speaking) and even then it's their healthcare software that's really outstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving down on the lousy scale, many people think that Google Now is really good, for a consumer quality utility. Certainly better than Siri, which is another notch down on the lousiness scale.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would put Windows speech recognition another notch lower on the lousy scale. It's got a long way to go. On the other hand, Cortana is one of the key features of Windows 10, so you can bet that the boys and girls at Microsoft are working day and night to
 make it better. But until then, as Bette Davis famously said, "Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night."</p>

            <p>Marty, this is helpful in trying to determine the problem. &nbsp;It makes sense that the programs are designed differently, I suspected as much, however I still cannot resolve the WSR issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel there is something more than user error. I have (as I said before ) 4 different microphones . One is a $200 Yeti, 2 of them are headphones (close talk microphones) and 1 is a regular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no background noise competing, speak clearly, and no luck. It just types nonsense. I can say something as simple as "A" and it will type xxkl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just getting it to type is an exercise in frustration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be some kind of issue other than me - am I missing some kind of setting? Or is it simply not working, a corrupted program perhaps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the older versions quite successfully before. My work-around now is to use Google Docs. There is a speech recognition program in the tools section. I can dictate to my heart's content with no problems, not just in short sentences. Then I transfer
 the doc to my writing program. It's a pain having to do 2 steps, but that works for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish I could get my new windows 10 computer to be compatible. I am out of ideas. A 5th microphone seems silly. I spent 2 hours yesterday trying to redo every single training session, played with the microphones, watched "how to videos" even though
 I know how to use the program.</p>
<p>Still no luck. So, anyone out there who resolved this issue, feel free to jump in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is left to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Video driver repeatedly crashing. &#40;Mobile Intel GM695 Express&#41;</h2>
                    So I'm having a heck of a time trying to get Windows 7 to play nice with my Dell Latitude D630 laptop. I installed Windows 7 about three months ago and since that time I have had frequent video driver crashes that completely lock my system. I have tried
 uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers several times to no avail. I am just about at my wits end. Its getting to the point that I think that this is harming my HDD. I just discovered a bad block notification in my Event Viewer: "The device, \Device\Harddisk0\DR0,
 has a bad block.", and believe it is probably because of having to constantly shut off the computer because the video driver locks the computer and I have to hard reset to get the computer to respond again. Here are my specs:

I have also tried to grab the drivers provided by Dell's website but those haven't helped me either. I would like to know if there is a solution to my dilemma so that I can cease having to shut my system down without properly shutting down the system first.
 I have no other idea on what to do besides post here. Any help is greatly appreciated.</div>

            Okay. Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have one last question though: how do I keep Windows from automatically installing the default video driver? I noticed the last time that I uninstalled the driver Windows immediately updated the driver upon the next startup after uninstalling the driver.
 I even tried turning off the internet and automatic updates in Windows Update but the driver still automatically installs upon the next startup after uninstalling the driver. Is there anyway to keep this from happening?</div>

            It's OK to allow Windows to install it's generic VGA drivers.<br />
The drivers from Nvidia and AMD graphics cards can conflict if both are installed, but the
<br />
Windows VGA and various Integrated graphics drivers very rarely cause a problem.<br />
<br />
Just don't allow the 'optional'&nbsp; Windows Updates to&nbsp; 'update' your graphics driver.<br />

            Ah, I see.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Well, I followed&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a36fb140-0f9e-469f-896a-576bc18f0eff">Imran M</a>'s instructions above after uninstalling the previous driver.</div>
<div>I installed&nbsp;the Windows Vista x86 video driver (in Vista compatibility mode) version&nbsp;v.7.14.10.1409 from Dell's website. After install everything seemed to work fine. I started watching some videos on Youtube and after a few minutes of watching the computer
 crashed into a bluescreen. I tried watching Youtube after rebooting once again and after a few minutes it repeated the same scenario. Afterwards I found this message in my Event Viewer system log:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. &nbsp;The bugcheck was: 0x0000000a (0x95635008, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x82afe025). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 080813-18345-01."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have since then uninstalled the driver and allowed Windows to reinstall the previous driver (v 8.15.10.1930) and have not encountered any BSOD's so far. However, this video driver still intermittently locks the system. I just had to hard reset after
 the video became unresponsive. So, unfortunately, I am in the same predicament again as my first post.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Just don't allow the 'optional'&nbsp; Windows Updates to&nbsp; 'update' your graphics driver."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hmm, I did allow Windows to update the generic VGA driver to the v 8.15.10.1930 driver after uninstalling the Dell driver though. Is that a problem then?</div>

            <i>"The device, \Device\Harddisk0\DR0, has a bad block."</i><br />
Failing HDD (bad sectors) will cause BSOD.&nbsp; You need to verify the HDD is not failing.
<br />
Have you run a disk check on it ?<br />
-What are the temperatures on the cpu and graphics chip ?<br />
<br />
You should upload the Memory Dump file to Skydrive , so others here can analyse them -<br />
-The files are found in <i>Windows \ minidumps</i>. (You need to have 'show hidden files and folders'
<br />
enabled - This is found in&nbsp; the 'Tools' tab \Folder Options \View,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; top of the Window).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

</a><br />
<br />
- A System Information report is also useful.<br />
Go to Start &gt; run&gt; and type msinfo32<br />
Save the file and upload the saved file with the dump files. If you have several files you can<br />
compress them before uploading to Skydrive.<br />
<br />
<i>"I did allow Windows to update the generic VGA driver to the v 8.15.10.1930 driver"</i><br />
<br />
Yes, anything that is part of Windows should normally be updated via Windows Updates, but as
<br />
you are using an 'old' machine, the VGA driver update may not be suitable.<br />
If the system is stable with the original Win7 VGA drivers then stick with them, but you will<br />
still need to sort out the Intel graphics.<br />
Generally it's more the non-Windows drivers that are best updated via the mfg's web site.<br />
Such as drivers for dedicated graphics cards, and older Integrated Graphics that used a
<br />
chip on the motherboard, such as your&nbsp;<span> X3100&nbsp;</span> (vs the new HD graphic in the cpu).<br />
However, you wouldn't want Windows Updates to undo your work by installing a driver that is not<br />
the one you have found to be the most stable with your system.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; A big issue is you are trying to use Win7 on a machine that is not supported by the mfg past&nbsp; Vista .<br />
While Vista drivers do often work on Win7 there is no guarantee of stability .<br />
<br />
You've tried the DELL drivers. Did you try the Win7 drivers for the&nbsp; ?<br />

            I did run a chkdsk a few days ago with the /r parameter and the system checked out clean, no bad sectors. Just to make sure I re-ran chkdsk again today. I used the command chkdsk C: /f /r and the check still returned no errors or bad blocks. I did get
 an error message stating:
<div><br />
<div>"failed to transfer logged messages to event log with status 50"</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am not sure why the results wont write to the event log.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The temperatures for the GPU and CPU look normal with the CPU cores hovering around 55 c with normal usage and the GPU hovering around 50 c according to HWMonitor.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a skydrive link to the minidump and msinfo files that you requested:&nbsp;http://sdrv.ms/13Oy8BW</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried the Intel drivers from their site, but that was sometime ago, and I can't recall what the problem with their drivers was, only that there was a problem. I'll try installing them again and see if that works or what the problem was.&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I however, haven't installed the Windows 7 codec pack. I already have all of those codecs currently installed on this computer I believe through VLC. I recall installing some sort of codec pack so I could play .avi, .mp4 etc. In that case would this
 pack still be potentially helpful for me?</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried a clean install already. The initial problem occurred right after a clean install actually. So that is why I was scratching my head at first. I have installed Win 7 on a few older systems and the default drivers from Windows Update usually
 work just fine out of the box. This is the first time I've really encountered any problems. The problem seems to occur at random. It isn't just when playing a video (initially I thought it might be a faulty Flash install),browsing, playing a game or even just
 leaving the computer idle without any applications running. That is why I believed it was the video driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: Okay I tried installing the Intel drivers above and it gave me this error:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"An unknown error has occurred"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Setup will now exit.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am pretty certain this is the same error I got when I tried installing these drivers the last time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I still haven't tried the codec pack, but that is the last of the above recommendations that I haven't yet tried.&nbsp;</div>

            I imagine the codecs that you installed with VLC are fine ( k-lite maybe ?), but I don't really know
<br />
much about codecs. I had already installed the Winodws codec pack before installing VLC .<br />
- I installed the Win7 codec pack because it has the <i>ffdshow</i> codec configured not to run with
<br />
Fallout 3, and various other games that it can conflict with, but I imagine&nbsp; k-lite would use the
<br />
same settings in this case.<br />
<br />
The System information file didn't open for me, but the error shown by 'Who Crashed' (only a<br />
basic BSOD tool) was -&nbsp; <i>win32k.sys&nbsp; </i><br />
The following fixes/workarounds were from an old thread ( '07 ) but worth checking;<br />
<br />
- One poster, who was using a core2 DUO,&nbsp; had to turn 'Hardware acceleration' off
<br />
(he did not try just lowering the setting) or his machine would BSOD.<br />
- Another in the same thread uninstalled his <i>'Intellimouse'</i> software and fixed his problem<br />
( assuming the Intellimouse software loaded with Windows, this is the sort of conflict that<br />
Clean Boot will often find). <br />
Anti-Virus can be fine one day and cause problems after the next update.<br />
Browsers seem to cause this for some as well. If you recently installed a new browser
<br />
or add-ons for your browser that could be another potential source of your issues.<br />

            Yeah, it was K-Lite.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>"<span>The System information file didn't open for me"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Should I try reuploading it? I just went to File &lt; Save As in the system info dialog and saved it to my desktop.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><font>Hmm, apparently I am unable to turn Hardware&nbsp;</font>Acceleration<font>&nbsp;off. When I go into the&nbsp;</font><span>monitor properties dialog and click the Troubleshoot tab the "Change Settings"
 button is greyed out.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I checked the programs list and can't seem to find a listing for Intellimouse, unless this software isn't listed in the programs and features list I don't have it I guess.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Hmm, I have Microsoft Security Essentials. Should I try reinstalling it?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Well, Chrome has been being quite buggy lately and tends to crash on me quite a bit. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it a couple of times but it keeps crashing. I think it might be an issue with
 my plugins though. However, the screen doesn't freeze just when the browser is open, sometime nothing is open and the screen freezes. If it was a problem with my browser would it still crash the system even if it wasn't open?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><font><span>At this point I am slightly considering going back to Windows XP since it appears that I would have better luck with obtaining a stable system because there are Dell drivers available for my particular model
 of laptop. At this point I have to hard reset the system about once a day and I know that its just an&nbsp;</span></font><span>eventuality</span><font><span>&nbsp;that I am going to start experience
 HDD errors/bad blocks due to constantly having to improperly shut down my system.&nbsp;</span></font><span>What do you think?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I just love Windows 7 sooo much more than XP though :/</span></div>

            These guys are helpdesk support. TechNet is more like tier 1/2 support. You know, the "REAL" engineers. I've got the same question as you. This WSD / NetBIOS is a Microsoft fubar and it really screws up networking in a mixed platform environment.

<h2>            Parental Controls </h2>
                    Is there anyway to add specific words in the parental Control feature?&nbsp; I do not necessarly want to block a total web site, but I would like to block specific words or phrases.&nbsp; When you block Spam from your email you can choose certain websites, but you
 can also choose certain words to block.&nbsp; On the You Tube website you can type in the word ____ and all these Video's come up and some are not apporipriate for my teen aged daughter (girls making out with other girls etc), but even though I have the medium
 setting set for parental controls these video's are still are allowed accesed because they are posting them in a different content then what the parental controls offer.&nbsp; So if we would be able to add words to the block feature as well as websites, this should
 help to block more content for the younger or teen aged viewers.&nbsp; I think adding a feature that will allow parents to block certain words as well as websites would benefit everyone.&nbsp; Please let me know if this is possible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and consideration. &nbsp;

<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />

You might want to look more into Web Filter, however I do not believe Parental Control can be specific to that level.<br />
