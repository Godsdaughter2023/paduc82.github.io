<h2>            Unable to copy files from FAT32 external drive &#40;0x80004005&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1TB external HDD, I was trying to backup the data to another external drive I just bought, and I got "0x80004005" error, so I went into the subfolders and copied them individually until I finished backing up ~600 GB (out of ~800 GB), then one big
 folder (the one that I backed up from my old PC - was a windows 7) gave same error, I can't remember if I have changed the permissions of it in the past, but I tried to access them on properties, but there was no "security tab" (the drive's FAT32), I tried
 running gpedit.msc but I couldn't (I am Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to get those files out because the hardware I am backing up has been hit several times and keeps giving me problems while connecting it (and I don't save my files on the computer, because my laptop has only a ~100 GB SSD, and this external
 HDD has it all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried doing the thing using a windows 7 PC at home, it just prepares to copy, and then suddenly the file transfer window vanishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback, really appreciated, I went on into the subfolders and copied them to the other hard drive, but remains two folders (~32 GB) telling me the same error which is 0x800040005: unspecified error (not "access denied").</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two folders have many subfolders inside them, that certainly have hundreds of .zip/.rar files, but the big folders themselves aren't packed into such extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now facing the problem in two folders that were inside the (200 GB) folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scanned them using my antivirus (Avira) and got not detection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how to export/import files in Windows 10, I tried to autoplay the hard drive but the option was not included.</p>

            <p>Have you checked the external drives with their manufacturers' diagnostic utilities? There may be hardware faults or firmware upgrades and/or (unlikely) incompatibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also possible that your laptop has faulty memory or problems with its SSD. You should check the laptop's SSD with its manufacturer's diagnostic utility&nbsp;and memory with e.g.

<p>
</p><p>If no problems are revealed by the tests above, it is still possible that there are other hardware faults on your laptop.</p>

            <p>The HV620 will contain a disk from a disk manufacturer. Test the disk with the disk manufacturer's diagnostic utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems with the HV620 on several systems. which appears to be what you are saying, the problem will be&nbsp;with the HV620.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NTFS would be a better formatting method for the HV620, unless you have systems which cannot read NTFS. Pre-formatted drives are usually FAT32 only because it is the most universal formatting method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your old PC had problems the backups you are trying to recover may have been damaged at source.</p>

            You cannot make Windows installation disks but you can make factory restore DVDs. The exact method depends on the manufacturer. You need to read the manual that came with your PC. The manual might be on the PC itself rather than in paper form. What brand
 is the machine?

            Hi Rowan,
<br />
<br />You seem to be running that installation from inside Windows 7
<br />
<br />The most successful way is to backup your data and clean install by booting form the Windows 10 installation media .  ..

</p><blockquote>Hi Rowan, <br />
<br />
You seem to be running that installation from inside Windows 7 <br />
<br />
The most successful way is to backup your data and clean install by booting form the Windows 10 installation media . ..
</blockquote>
Thanks for the quick answer. I have used the media tool to create an offline installation on my external HDD but when run the installation still fails. How would I perform a 'clean installation' do i just choose for the tool do delete everything or would I
 have to clean boot Windows 7?&nbsp;

<h3> c. t.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to get audio in Windows 7 through HDMI and PC Speakers simultaneously&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if there is any way to get audio going through HDMI and another device in Windows 7 simultaneously.</p>
<p>My usage is as such:</p>
<p>Windows 7 PC in same room as HDTV, have HDTV near bed, have PC near bathroom. Both work individually for audio and video. I know how to switch output between different devices, but would like to output the audio through both the HDMI and PC speakers.</p>
<p>Is Windows 7 capable of doing this?</p>

    <title>Media&#47;hotkeys keys will not work only when any Office program is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanm21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media&#47;hotkeys keys will not work only when any Office program is in focus</h2>
                    Microsoft windows, with Microsoft keyboard, controlling Microsoft media player, the media keys only do not work when a Microsoft Office prog is in focus!<br />
<br />
Bottom line, Office 2010/13 64bit blocks global hotkeys including the default media keys on my computer. The only global hotkey that works is volume.
<br />
<br />
I have found many questions and solutions and can assure you this is not a common one found. In short, my media keys on my Microsoft keyboard will not work when any Microsoft Office program is in focus, word/outlook/excel etc.
<br />
<br />
'Next' on my media keys work everywhere else, also a global hotkey I assigned within the media program works everywhere else except when Office prog in focus.
<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, and probably a reason its not common, I also have Office 64bit installed. This problem was there when I had 2010, and still persists with 2013 installed.<br />
<br />
I have tried many 'fixes' for this issue. All my drivers are updated. I tried with and without Intellipoint, I tried with and without microsoft keyboard center. I tried with a logitech keyboard. I modified my media players config .ini file with keyhook=0 and
 1, i tried changing the global hotkey to diff button configs, i tried using macros to execute them, and this problem is in all media players including Windows Media Player, my main goal is to use in Media Monkey though. Office progs must capture my keyboard
 input and not let it reach any other program is my guess or they get lost in translation through the 64bit something.

            I have a microsoft exchange account for business, and I called customer support to solve this. They insist I uninstall and reinstall which will not fix it because i had this problem for 5 years, on every version of windows and 2 diff versions of Office
 64bit, and 5+ diff computers.. Microsoft will not admit it is an actual build in flaw in their program, and the solution needs to be the architecture of the software not a unique persons computer issue. 5 years and they still will not acknowledge or attempt
 a fix.

            <p>FOUND SOLUTION </p>
<p>I finally went with windows 10 pro 64bit clean install everything and tested the keys with each step, still did not work when any office 64bit window is active. I found the solution on a MediaMonkey forum, basically the global hotkeys get sent as a low level
 signal or vise versa. I changed my media monkey player config file to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PreferLLKeysHook=1</span>&nbsp;and
 it works!&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily MediaMonkey has a way to change this receptor, however I would not know how to change this on Windows Media Player which wont work, or itunes etc. There must be a similar change to the windows registry or something that can do the opposite of what
 I did from the player side.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nvidia 740m drivers and Windows 10 not working &#40;Error 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello<br />
Recently, my graphics card has started having problems again.<br />
My laptop has 2: Intel HD Graphics and Nvidia 740m, normally i use the integrated graphics but when I want to play a game i have to use the 740m. This card worked perfectly on windows 8 and 8.1 but on windows 10, it works for a while and suddenly stops working
 (error code 43 on device manager) for no apparent reason, which was what happaned yesterday (had windows 10 for 3 months with no problems).</p>
<p>Also, for some reason, the yellow triangle in device manager disappears when I boot in Safemode.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a duplicate, and thank you for your help</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 7 64bit Driver Issue - Linksys WUSB54GC Will Not Enable</h2>
                    I have a Linksys WUSB54GC version 3 Wireless Network Adapter.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest driver on the Linksys support page that says it is fully compatible with Windows 7 64bit.&nbsp; The adapter will not enable.&nbsp; After 3 exhausting chat support sessions
 with Linksys, they could not figure it out and threw the problem back in my lap saying it must be a problem with my Windows 7 64bit.&nbsp; I have searched the support forums for both Windows and Linksys, and some people have had luck, and others haven't.&nbsp; The driver
 was manually installed several times along with deleting the hardware, reinstalling and loading the driver over and over.&nbsp; I am trying to connect to my Linksys WRT54G Router that has the latest firmware and has other wireless computer connected to it with
 no problems.&nbsp; Can anyone assist?

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>GFar74,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>MSHTA (Microsoft HTML &lt;</span></strong><strong><span>Hypertext Markup Language&gt;</span></strong><span>
 Application Host Is a process that runs .HTA files (HTML Applications), typically MSHTA loads as soon as an .HTA application needs to run, and then terminates when the application completes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur if a Windows system file is missing or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run SFC (System File checker) Scan. To do this, follow the steps
 below </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With Windows XP installation disc in the drive</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span>Click<strong><span>
 Start</span></strong>, click&nbsp; <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>, and click&nbsp;<strong><span>Command
 Prompt<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, this could be an activity of virus</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Run an online scan for any threat
 and try to fix them</span></p>

When you right clicked at it, what did it say anyway ?<br />

            Problem removed as of this week. Thanks to an update from BT, the icon is no longer anonymous: it now says 'BT Broadband Desktop Help' when you hover the cursor over it. But how sloppy of BT not to fix this slipshod oversight before now! Thank you, David,
 for suggesting how to deal with the problem.

    <title>Not Able To Boot Surface From USB Drive - True Tale - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not Able To Boot Surface From USB Drive - True Tale</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backup all my computers using two Windows Home Server (WHS) systems. To restore a system from a backup, you use a boot CD or USB drive. A boot restore CD was included with the WHS software. This worked fine until Uefi bios systems appeared. Eventually
 Microsoft provided an update that allowed the WHS to backup a Uefi computer. In addition to installing the update, you needed to create a (new) boot USB drive to use for performing a restore. This (new) boot USB drive was created by WHS on request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a (new) boot USB drive and it works perfectly on my desktop and laptop computers. Although created by Microsoft engineers, it will NOT boot the Surface Pro! When I try to boot the Surface Pro from the boot USB drive, I receive the following error
 message (the message is offset on the screen and not fully visible, but the readable part is below):</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \efi\microsoft\boot\bcd</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; status: 0xc000000d</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An error occurred while attempting to ... data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file structure of the USB drive is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4103280d-1f45-48c3-8c87-f8dbbb98b655" /><br />

</p><p>There are two .bcd files as shown below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone in this forum can tell Microsoft (and me) how to correct this boot USB so that it will boot a Surface Pro and allow a restore from the WHS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Your screen shots are way too small to read. But to make a bootable USB for Surface, you need to format FAT32/GPT using the Rufus tool.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made a FAT32/GPT&nbsp; bootable USB drive using Rufus 2.2. Surface Pro would not boot from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WHS2011 Server produces a bootable USB drive that is used to restore a backup. It will not boot the Surface Pro (GPT formatted or not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is really very simple: Microsoft should provide a bootable USB drive with each Surface! Or, more to Microsoft's style, provide a KB article with a download that creates a bootable drive using the Owner's USB drive. In each case, the resultant
 USB drive needs to be able to be modified (ie, added to) with programs like a backup recovery program.</p>

<h2>            Audio-Driver Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft-Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm having troubles with my audio drivers. This is the 3rd time i have this Problem. I have writhen Mails back and forth with Asus because i thought it might be the onboardsoundchip that's broken. Now before i get the Motherboard out and send it in for a
 warranty check i don't want to wait for Weeks/Month till i get the Mobo back. Just to find out it's not a hardware problem. It seems like windows is keeping me from fixing this problem the easy way. Because everytime i uninstall the driver and restart the
 PC it installs the drivers from itself. Even tho i spent hours to keep windows from updating and downloading drivers automaticly. It's so f**** anoying. Even tho i pull the Lan-Cable it keeps installing the Drivers and it seems it does it wrong. Also it depends
 on Games if the Sound works or not. In Desktop everything is fine but as soon as i start a Game it's acting weird. Im tired of reinstalling Windows all the time and reinstalling and downloading 400 Gb of Apps and Games that need to be reinstalled to work.
 Last time Games like Rocket League didn't work but i was able to play insurgency for example. This time i can't play neither of those with working sound. I have played Ring of Elysium wich crashed my sounddriver one day but after the restart everything was
 fine. The next day i played Sea of Thieves. As soon as i start the Game all the sounds get muffeld. Teamspeak sounds diffrent then usualy. I have deactivated the communication options in sounds so it doesen't change anything. I really wonder why i even bought
 a new pc. Just more and more Problems with increasing prices aswell. Windows doesen't even offer proper support for they're product and ask you to pay insane amounts of money for support for a product they earn money for.&nbsp; This time the game insurgency doesn't
 work aswell. An the funny thing is as soon as i change the sound output to my monitor it works. Even tho when the driver crashed the soundoutput for both my monitors was completly deactivated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My System:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i5-7600k @4.6 Ghz ( no the problems are not from the overclock because i had the same problems before i done that)</p>
<p>ROG Asus Maximus Hero IX</p>

<br />
If Windows 10 has already updated and installed a driver although you did not want it, you'll need to uninstall it first. Then you need to prevent Windows 10 from reinstalling the uninstalled driver:<br />
<br />
Press the Windows + Pause key combination to open the System window.<br />
Click Advanced System Settings on the left side of the navigation.<br />
Click on the Hardware tab and the Device Installation Settings button.<br />
click No in the new window. Save confirmed with changes<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx for the effort but that's what i have allready tried a few times. When i go to the settings to stop windows from installing drivers it was on yes. As far i remember i turned it off but coud have been on a earlier OS wich i reinstalled because of the
 same problem where the same settings didn't help at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did all this again as you adviced and it doesen't work. I uninstall the drivers, turn off the auto updates, restart the pc and it installs both drivers again. It's like hiting your head into a concrete wall. You can try it but it won't help. Im so
 frustrated about this topic. Dealing with this problem since more then 1 year and there is no proper solution other then reinstalling windows and wait for it to crash itself again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots after i done the uninstall and restart.</p>

<p>I've tryed everything. I also spent a lot of time googling and watching youtube videos with similar problems. Coudn't find any solution for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here 2 more screenshots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. unistalled the drivers (same like before, i unistalled it in the device manager, and it makes no diffrence) You can see all the Audiodrivers are gone.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>2. Screenshot after the restart with auto installation of drivers still off as before</p>

<p>
</p><p>Both Audiodrivers are back and installed automaticly. It's really frustrating. My sucpision is it's either a Problem of Windows that keeps installing unwanted drivers or it's a problem between nvidia high definition audio and the realtek driver wich im supposed
 to use. Those are my mainboard audio drivers wich provide sonic studio and the realtek audio manager wich i need to have a decent audio quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You say "Both Audiodrivers are back and installed automaticly."</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div><span><span>But that is only the case if you go ahead as you do.</span><br />
<span>So uninstall driver .......</span><br />
<span>But i<strong>f you install the high definition drivers, as I have stated,</strong></span><br />
<span>then you have after restarting<strong> only high definition in the device manager and no Realtek more.</strong></span><br />
<span>It should work then.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>But I conclude my further cooperation here.</strong></span><br />
<span>Good luck with the further search, maybe you try it with my solution possibility.</span></span></div>

<p>Did it and it's the same result again as before. Realtek installed itself again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx for the try. Maybe i shoud have added what i tried in first place. And sorry for not following the instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to remove both drivers, restart and do a clean manual install of the driver and restart again but its not working like this if windows keeps installing the drivers. No mather what i do or change in settings.</p>

    <title>Fable 2 DLC issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexbihari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fable 2 DLC issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was wondering if anybody has had any luck with playing the DLC using the Platinum Hits edition of Fable 2. It's a single disc with the game and all the playable DLC. I had no problem downloading and playing the game, but haven't had any luck with the
 DLC. It comes with the Premium edition of Knothole Island and See the Future DLC packs. I downloaded the free version of the DLC from xbox.com and downloaded it my One just to see it that would even work, and I was able to visit the shops and get some items,
 so I imagine the Premium version should work too. I just spoke with Xbox support and they said they said it should work, but they weren't able to resolve it at this time. They said they'd get back to me within a few days, but to post here in the meantime.
 Thanks in advance to anybody that might have a solution for this, or just let me know if you're having the same issue and i'll let you know what Xbox comes back to me with</p>

<p>I have the Fable 2 Collectors Edition Disc and play the game fine but I can't access my Xbox 360 special content. I added the code for the Fable 2 Master Chief Armor and sword on Fable 2 launch and was able to use on the Xbox 360 but can't access it on the
 Xbox One. The DLC isn't listed in the DLC menu and I can't access the Xbox One Xbox360 Emulator download history to download the content to the Xbox One.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. Pretty peeved that MS didn't state up front that inserting the disc will trigger a download from the server versus a disc-based install...burned through about 50-60GB of data and my ISP uses a data cap system of 300GB. Then I
 finally get into Fable II that I have only ever owned as the Platinum Hits version and, lo and behold, Knothole Island and See the Future don't work. I'll be glad when they get it fixed.</p>

<p>Same problem here, after my fail with Mass Effect, where I had to buy the DLCs, I bought the Game of the Year Edition to have everything for Fable 2. And I had an interesting discussion with the german support about "There have to be a code with the game
 - No, there ist not any key with the game - Then your game is broken"</p>

<p>I had to explain multiple times the the support specialist that it's a SINGLE disc with the game and all the DLC on it. That fact that you don't know that worries me it's not going to get fixed for a long time. Please pass this info forward since saying
 it 3 times wasn't enough</p>

<p>Had a chat with support over the phone as well, same thing. Platinum hits disc based dlc doesn't work, so filled out the survey. I have the preview dash and sent in a screenshot of the purchase screen for one of the dlc's stating even the plat hits version,
 which shouldn't need any downloads, is requiring purchase of the dlc's to play them. hopefully that will help out a little as well</p>

</p><p>I have just reinstalled Windows 8.1 Pro. During setup, I have chosen not to use OneDrive as the default storage location. But I have chosen to set up my Microsoft (online) account on it, as opposed to a regular local user account. On the first sign in, I
 noticed that the desktop background was not the default Windows 8.1 background (img0.jpg), and I had several keyboard layouts configured.&nbsp;This is a Retail copy, without any special OEM configurations, this should be just plain Microsoft Windows with default
 settings.</p>

</p><p>I had reformatted the disk, so the installer should not have picked up on anything from previous installation and reconfigured it the same way or anything like that. So it must be due to creating a Microsoft account, and the setup pulled some configurations
 and settings from the Internet. Although I have chosen custom settings during setup and I have disabled everything I could, along with OneDrive. But the "sync" appears to be separate from the cloud storage, and it appears to be set to sync automatically and
 is enabled by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very much hate this, and I am looking to remove all this garbage collection from my previous installation. I have been looking at various web tutorials and Microsoft support articles on how to get rid of the old data and disable sync. But this is not very
 straightforward. I have encountered more than just one web page that is directly or indirectly related to this.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>There is a "your devices" page on the "devices" menu on Microsoft Account site (<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">url</a>).</li><li>There is a "PCs" menu on the OneDrive site (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/prev?v=DevicesView" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">url</a>).</li><li>There is a "Device backups" option on the OneDrive site (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/Options/DeviceBackups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">url</a>).</li><li>There is a hidden "Delete your personal settings" page on the OneDrive site (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/win8personalsettingsprivacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">url</a>).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused! What is what, and who does what to whom? That's what I would like to know! Why is one web site or page not enough for managing all the Microsoft and/or Windows devices? It's not clear from the descriptions on each web page or site what each
 option does. In fact, there are no descriptions at all. There are just a bunch of buttons and links, with no proper description of what they do or how, or when to use them. For help and support, there is a link on the page footer or header to the support site,
 that is: the main Microsoft support site. Right! Good luck finding relevant information in a haystack of all things Microsoft, e.g. software products, hardware products, services, etc. That's like asking your car dealer for instructions on how to change a
 headlight bulb on your brand new car, and he gives you driving instructions to the nearest repair shop. (At least where I live, car dealers are happy to help with the easy tasks, even if you're not a customer. Many also offer full, certified and authorized
 repair service under the same roof. At very least, my car dealer would have given me a printed copy from a technical manual for the car.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Account site:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c31f93d-281f-4bf5-8fd1-26eb2b522776" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>What does the "remove pc" button do? Why is there no short descriptive explanation on the page?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OneDrive PCs menu:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/655bb74b-6996-4ced-9bbd-807f0283f545" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As can be seen here, there are three entries for PC devices on the "PCs" menu. Clicking on either one returns "OneDrive can't connect to [crazy PC on the other side]". Can't connect? Why would it want to connect??? Is this some kind of backdoor to the registered
 PC for listing and manipulating files on its OneDrive folder? It doesn't say what it does. There's no description. Just a shiny button... hmm... wonder what this button does... click! You've been hacked! With your consent!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you click on one of the device entries, the option "remove pc" will appear. It's titled exactly the same way as the "remove pc" option on the Microsoft Account site. So how is one different from the other? Can't they be joined together for simplicity?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Device backups option:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56a67f44-15f4-4c70-ae9c-b8f2f5bbfe6e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an option titled "device backups" on the OneDrive site. It lists "backed-up device settings". How is this different from the device entries on the PCs menu???... Is this one for "becked-up" device settings (preferences and configuration), while
 the other is for listing OneDrive files on each device? I learned that on Windows 8.x devices, settings can be "backed-up" even if or when they are not synced ("sync your settings on this pc").</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hidden "delete your personal settings" option:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a96ac06-a7e8-4b58-8d40-3773e54a6086" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And what's this? Why is this page hidden??? It's not much of an option if it's hidden away from the user (not listed as an accessible option on the main web app interface). I had to consciously and knowingly do a web search to find just the Microsoft
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/sync-settings-pcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how-to article</a>, which then contains a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=262691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link to the web page</a> for this hidden option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It becomes immediately apparent to anyone who has used the Web for more than 15 years, that the various Microsoft web sites relating to Windows (the sync and backup feature, but also online service integration in general as part of the overall Windows experience)
 is poorly organized, and loosely defined. Hiding the page for deleting sync/personal/backup/whichever data speaks loudest and most clearly!</p>

            <p>In this time and age, I can't help but wonder if any sane person has any overview of where their data is, or what kind of data they are sharing with overseas companies and their affiliates, or what that data is used for. Ask yourself, how many websites do
 you have a user account for? Do you remember the password and user name to sign in to each and every one? You don't share the same password do you?... People have lost sight of this thing called "technology" and now they have lost their mind with "cloud".
 Cloud this, cloud that.... It certainly doesn't make things easier in managing your data when the web front-end for services such as those from Microsoft are so dysfunctional and in disarray.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b04e176-85b9-4794-adfa-90350f8b4235" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just clicked that funny button! I got to this page asking me to confirm. "Once you remove your PC: you won't see it here anymore". Eeeh??... I didn't understand that. Does anyone else here understand it? That's the most useless way to describe an action
 that's about to happen! This appears to be important too... why else would you ask the user for confirmation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that it will remove the name of my computer from the list of devices. But what's with that? It doesn't say anything about what this implies. Will my previously installed free Windows 10 upgrade be affected, i.e. be deactivated? And for a prompt,
 this message is missing a question mark!! It only concludes what will happen and offers a button to press. A simple "are you sure?" would do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eff06ec4-06c0-4aa7-bebf-e3d22087cd1b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next page asks me to reset my PC??? "Almost done! Now, reset your PC." What??... "Now, reset your device or remove your Microsoft account from it to make sure it won't show up here again." OK...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what I just did!! But how could I know? There is no description of what the option does, not even on the confirmation page (it just concludes the obvious and asks for confirmation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually tried to contact the appropriate Microsoft support department about this, but I never got through to talk to a person. I was stuck in a maze of interactive voice response options. Some of these options are just directing the user to go online
 and visit some Microsoft web site or page for help. So is the case with OneDrive (option number 3 under Account Assistance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried chatting with Answer Desk but didn't get a hold of anyone to chat with. They were all busy. I waited for about one hour and gave up. The waiting time for phone support was reported as 249 minutes. Well... I have no intention to sleep with the phone
 on my ear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it only assumed that each and every user who visits Microsoft Account site will know how to use the options available on the site? Why is there no proper documentation? There should be a dedicated page only for Microsoft Account, describing all the
 options and their meaning. That way, I could just look up that "remove pc" button and figure out what it does, without having to find out the hard way by testing it (and potentially destroying something on my PC or relating to my PC in the process).</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I tried to get in touch with Microsoft support, but I only managed to get to a "billing" representative (for services, and subscriptions, I guess). He did offer help with Microsoft Account, but only for certain aspects of it. He could only help with restoring
 passwords and compromised (hacked) accounts. But he could not help explain what "Devices" menu is for. Nor point me to some online resource that explains it. He asked me to call some number. I think it was the number for Answer Desk for "products bought elsewhere".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So he must have had highest clearance, for being able to assist me with password resets and things like that. Yet he was responsible for "billing"... somehow. Maybe he bills people he helps with password resets??... we will never know. But he could not shed
 some light on what the "devices" menu is for. Maybe he just didn't know...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is what I think...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The "Devices" menu on Microsoft Account site:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this thing is some kind of authentication page, for devices on which the Microsoft account is used. Very much like Google! Just Microsoft! So if you have a device, like a phone, or a tablet, or a laptop that you log into with your Microsoft account,
 then that device will prompt you to verify the first time you sign in on it. Once you verify, this device will pop up on your Microsoft Account devices page. So if you remove it, it should mean that you have to verify your account again on the device for which
 you have removed the entry from Microsoft Account, the next time you sign in on it using the same Microsoft account. It reminds me of Apple...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if that made it much clearer, but it is some sort of authentication going on. I'm not familiar with how this works with Windows Phone, or an Xbox, because I don't use those. But from the looks of it, I would say that these devices have had such
 option for a long time now. As for Windows PCs, I believe this is new! In fact, it looks like this only works this way with Windows 10 computers. So it will take a PC with Windows 10 on it to get that device listed under "devices". It won't get listed if you
 sign into a Microsoft account on a Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly sure where Microsoft is going with this. But from the looks of it, it's some kind of anti-theft mechanism, or a part of one. For instance, Windows Phone owners or users are advised, on the site, to check for some kind of code when they sell
 their phone to another person, or if you are buying one from another person. As a way to check that the phone is not locked and tied down to another person's Microsoft account, so that you may tie it to your own later on. If this is it, then it has come to
 Windows 10 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The "PCs" list on OneDrive:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I suspected, the "PCs" list turned out to be a way to list and access a computer's OneDrive folder remotely. I found this page about it:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fetch-files-on-your-PC-70761550-519c-4d45-b780-5a613b2f8822?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fetch files on your PC</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why the explanation is hosted on office.com site, when it relates to onedrive.com site... but anyway!</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you have the OneDrive desktop app for Windows installed on a PC, you can use the Fetch files feature to access all your files on that PC from another computer by going to the OneDrive website. You can even access network locations if they're included
 in the PC's libraries or mapped as drives. When you browse a PC's files remotely, you can download copies of them to work on. You can also stream video and view photos in a slide show. To access files on your PC remotely, make sure the PC you want to access
 is turned on and connected to the Internet. OneDrive also needs to be running on that PC, and the Fetch files setting must be selected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get this! "You can use a PC running Windows 8.1 to fetch files that are on another PC, but you can't fetch files that are on a PC running Windows 8.1, even if you install the OneDrive desktop app on that PC." Got it? Have a laugh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it "only" works with OneDrive app on a Windows 7, and possibly Vista if one is available for that system. I say "only", because it's not something you should feel like you're missing out on. This may seem like a convenient way to access your files, but
 I would consider this a security risk. If you need your files, carry them on a USB flash drive, or establish a more proper, and secure remote access to them if you need that. Hmm... wonder why they disabled this in Windows 8 or 8.1... after all, these come
 with OneDrive client built in... what a fantastic "feature".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be possible to access a Windows 8.1 computer's OneDrive folder as well, provided that it's mapped as a network drive on a Windows 7 computer with OneDrive app. But I'll leave that for others to explore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The "device backups" and "sync your settings on this PC":</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm undecided on the difference between these two "options", if you can call them that. For starters, one is accessed internally in the operating system interface, and one is accessed externally through a web front-end (OneDrive site). And there is no one-by-one
 translation between them. In other words, there is no "sync your settings on this PC" option on the OneDrive site. It's only listed this way in the operating system. So how do you know which one is for "sync" and which one is for "device backups"? There's
 no easy way telling, except for experimenting and trying out. There is no documentation of neither the Microsoft Account site nor the OneDrive site. Apparently, we are expected to know it all as soon as we see it... right... who doesn't know what to do with
 a "remove pc" button or a "PCs" list. Right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I had to guess, I would say that "device backups" is for that "back up settings" section in Windows 8.1 sync settings. I think this backs up the more desktop oriented things, like font sizes, input language settings, and maybe other system configuration
 settings. While the app, the new "modern" app ecosystem has separate sync options, and if I am right, these are cleared (fully and completely) from that hidden web page on OneDrive (see my first post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that "back up settings" section has been removed in Windows 10's sync settings. So Windows 10 is trying to make all this coherent by providing a single "sync settings" option for the entire sync feature (and individual ones for things like themes, languages
 and so on). This seems like something that should have been done from the Start (pun!), with Windows 8. This is the way it was supposed to be but never was, so Windows 10 is trying to fix it. But hiding and showing certain options will not fix it. Internally,
 there are still two kinds of apps and ecosystems in Windows 10. The new (doubtful) and the old (good and proven). There is still much to wish for to bridge the gap between these two worlds, and it's the small things that surface sometimes that reminds us of
 just how divided the new Windows systems are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the best thing to do would be to let go of the old stuff that bogs down Windows, and focus only on the new kind of apps. But that may take much more time and perhaps a complete redesign of the system from its core. This would probably break compatibility
 with a lot of software out there, and Microsoft can't afford that. So they have chosen to mix and match with little bit of everything, and even more so with "universal" apps and "continuum". They could have created a separate branch of Windows, for touch and
 mobile only... like Apple did. But I guess they tried that already with Windows RT and it was not a huge success. This stems from the fact that Windows users want Windows "programs", not "apps". It doesn't matter how you wrap it up, or the meaning of the term,
 "apps" are a different category of software. Because of the new development in mobile devices, the term "apps" has evolved to mean something more than just "application software".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to recap, the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Devices"</span> menu is for linking and un-linking Windows 10 devices (and Xbox and Windows Phone) to and from a Microsoft account, the
<p>
</p><p>Fill me in if you think I got anything wrong or if you want to add something to this. I had to rely on my own testing and web research to draw this conclusion. As often is the case with Microsoft products, the motto seems to be "code first, document later",
 and it has followed on to the web services. There is really not even a FAQ section on (or for) Microsoft Account site, there is merely a how-to on creating or signing in to a Microsoft Account. There is no help on how to use it. The site itself has no descriptions,
 not even tooltips on what each option of button does.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, AMD/ATI and Dell do not support&nbsp;this line of Graphics adapters on Windows 7 or Windows 8. You can attempt to force install the Windows Vista driver from Dell.com using the "have disk" install method. Here is a link&nbsp;which describes the have
 disk install method. It is intended for Intel XP drivers, but works just fine for AMD Vista/Win7/Win8 drivers too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-030331.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-030331.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll need to download the .exe file from Dell.com, uncompress it, and then point device manager to the .inf file per the have disk install directions. The .inf file is typically located under&nbsp;a folder like:</p>
<p>\Packages\Drivers\Display\LH_INF\ but may be different depending on how Dell packaged the driver for your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that&nbsp;drivers designed for Windows Vista are not supported and may have significant compatibility issues like crashes and blue screens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the risk of crashes blue screens, Microsoft recommends that customers use the&nbsp;Microsoft Basic Display Driver (MSBDD) included in Windows 8 on these systems. MSBDD offers reliable basic functionality but does not include&nbsp;certain power saving modes,
 accelerated graphics, multi-monitor, or high-resolution support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Headphones not working fine with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Lately, I plugged in my headphones(Sony MDR-ZX100 model) and when I went past 50% it started to screech like a very loud harmonica. Only at and louder than 50% volume. I tried to use troubleshooter and uninstall my sound card, but that didn't help.</p>
<p>I also us a headset and those work fine.</p>
<p>Note: I just put it to 45% volume and press it against my ear it is still their but very faint, also this works on my tablet so it is my computer that is causing the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Since the headphones work fine on a different device and other headphones work fine with your computer, this may be an issue with
 the drivers itself. Usually headphones are plug-n-play devices. However, it seems that Windows might not be able to determine the right driver for the headphone.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Lets try to uninstall the driver and reinstall and check if it works fine. To do so, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Plug the headphones and go to the desktop screen.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Press Windows + X and select Device manager.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Expand the audio category and right click on the headphone driver and select Uninstall.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions to uninstall the driver. (make sure to keep a check on the option which says delete the driver)</span></span></li><li><span><span>Once the driver is uninstalled, unplug the headphones and restart the computer.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Plug back the headphones and check if it works fine.</span></span></li></ol>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results once you have tried these steps. Hope this information was helpful.</p>

            <p>I tried that and it didn't work. &nbsp;I have a few reasons why</p>
<p>A. The headphones are a 3.5 mm analog which use my computer's sound card, so it is not a seperate driver.</p>
<p>B. My computer has multiple sound setting. A dell one, which every time I plug it in it pops up, what device is this? And it has a list and also has realtek hd audio.</p>

            Do a roll back to Windows Vista<br />
<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />
<br />
Also, run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, it will scan your system and provide a report telling you if your PC can run Windows 7 and if there are any known compatibility issues with your programs or hardware.<br />
