<h2>            Skype 8 for medium size company</h2>
                    <p>Our office has around 100 computers, most users have skype classic, and it works great and we, as admins, are somewhat able to put some restrictions on it. As we all know Skype classic will soon be discontinued and all users are supposed to update to version
 8, however, in our environment, Skype 8 is no good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is impossible to put any restriction on it as there are no GPO packages for skype 8. We can't switch to Skype for Bussiness, because our licensing doesn't allow it.&nbsp; Also, they're basically different products and any migration is out of the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, will there ever be a possibility&nbsp;to add restrictions to this version of Skype using GPO or any other tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what about giving us an MSI installer? Now I have to make scripts to install the .exe.</p>

<h2>            Why does the latest Windows Update cause c drive errors&#63;</h2>
                    2018 Cumulative Update for Windows Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 - I installed this update and I got the message that Windows needed to shut down for repairs and then restart. The computer froze at that point and I restarted manually.&nbsp; I have Rollback
 Rx Professional and rolled my system to before this update was done. I then could get my Windows to work but I had disk errors. The automatic repair feature wouldn't fix the problem. I then ran Norton Disk Doctor and it tried to fix the problem. I got the
 message from Norton Disk Doctor that Disk Doctor could not find or retrieve the chkdsk logs. I then contacted Norton Support and they fixed the problem of disk errors. However, when I ran the Windows Update again, I was right back in the situation where there
 were disk errors again. I used Rollback Rx Professional again to roll my system back to where it was prior this Windows Update. I have disabled automatic updating for now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had a previous problem when I ran the Windows Fall Creator update. It wiped out my pictures, half of my programs, and caused havoc with my Windows apps. In a community forum, I found others had similar problems.<br />
<br />
With the damage done by Windows Updates, I can imagine why people have turned to Macs, Chromebooks, and the Linux operating system. You people really need to do better.<br />

            <p>Windows 8.1 boot loader behaves somewhat differently to previous versions of Windows and modifies the bootstrap then reboots the&nbsp;computer to allow secondary operating systems to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how often you want to load Linux I would use the one time boot menu when booting from USB and not use the boot menu at all. This would then prove that the USB key is properly configured.</p>

    <title>Why 360 remastered&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> re5cue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why 360 remastered&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the Halo remastered and am very excited for the Gears Of War remastered, but why are they already remastering games that we can still play online on the 360? I personally feel like they should not waste their time remastering
 games that aren't that old and are still available for online play on the original. I would love rather see remastering of games like: Medal Of Honor: Rising Sun, Conflict: Desert Storm, etc. Games from the original Xbox! Ones that we can't play online anymore!
 This is just my opinion and would love to hear what everyone else thinks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can't play Halo 2 online on either the original Xbox or the Xbox 360, and the original Xbox edition of Halo: CE was never capable of online functionality. The re-mastered edition of Halo: CE on the Xbox 360 simply contains DLC maps for Halo: Reach. So,
 for half of the Master Chief Collection, it was resurrecting online functionality that was lost for four years, and bringing online functionality to a title that had never had it before (on the Xbox, that is.)

<p>What I would like to see is older games polished. &nbsp;There are plenty of older RPGs that would work great as downloadable games and they could keep the older style but just polish it up to make things look nice. &nbsp;Same game with just a little polish and made
 to work great. &nbsp;Some are on the phones/tablets at $10-$15. &nbsp;They could work on a console as well. &nbsp;I do not mind the phone/tablet versions but I am not a fan of the on-screen controls. &nbsp;So I would go for the Xbox/PS/WiiU downloads quickly.</p>

<p>Yes that is true, but as I'm sure you recall as well, we already had a Halo CE remake on the 360 (Halo Anniversary). Sure it was on the 360 and I never got it so I'm not sure if it has online multiplayer or not, but it's still a remastering. I do feel like
 343 did a great job at the remasterings and I enjoyed doing the campaigns again but I just feel like these remastering's are getting out of control. They're unneccesary considering most of us have these games on the 360 and can still play online. And to mention
 the fact of the Xbox One becoming backward compatible? What's the point of buying the remastered? Better graphics? To me it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>@Guerrero Ultimo </p>
<p>I agree! I've seen some &nbsp;on the App Store! One thing the makers of Gears Of War were saying was that the remastered will for the most part work the same way as the original. The main difference will be the graphics and physics. I could totally see this working
 if it only costed people who have Gears Of War already like 10-20$ to upgrade to the Xbox One version! I would much rather see a game rereleased on the Xbox One from the original Xbox. Like you said "polished", that would be great! Even if it had the same
 boxy graphics or whatever, I would still buy that before a remastered game from 7 years ago.</p>

<p><span><span>This is where some people (myself being one) differ in opinion.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There's nothing wrong with having backward compatibility... but for me, most of the games I played and loved on the 360, I played a lot of... and then I moved on. I have no interest
 in revisiting them... IF... I'm just going to be playing the same old game I've played to death on the 360. Why bother? Online MP or SP makes no difference in that aspect, to me.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But, if I see a digital re-master of a game that I loved and played a ton of on the 360, coming to the X1, then it feels "new" again. It makes me want to play it because it has
 something new about it, even if it's just a fresh look. <br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>TBH, I'd buy a re-master of almost any of my 360 favorites and play them again, before I'd bother to play the BC version I already own.<br />

<p>I completely understand where you're coming from. It is nice playing a game again with a fresh look. That was why I got Halo MCC, because I played Halo 3 ALOT after it was released. But, I'm definitely not playing it as much as I thought I would. The fresh
 look wears off like @DeadFall526 said. Do you think if they made a remastering of Battlefield 3 or CoD MW2 that people would buy it? I honestly don't think people would. I think we'd see a lot of people just switching back to the 360 versions if that happened.
 But that just might be me, maybe people would buy it. I think it would make more sense for them to be doing the original Xbox hits now and then do the 360 ones down the line, maybe when the server for the 360 version isn't up anymore.</p>
<p>There was a game called Phantasy Star Univerae, a MMORPG on the 360. The game was huge at one point but aftee a while, people stopped playing it online (mainly because it cost 15$/month) honestly it was one of my favorite games but the online server isn't
 up anymore. It that got remastered for the Xbox One, I'd probably get it since the servers are down. But if the servers were still up, I wouldn't even think about buying the game all over again.</p>

<p>^I guess the difference would be the 'blockbuster titles' for me. I probably wouldn't bother with the titles you mentioned either. But the Mass Effect series (IMO) would be a buy for me... if they re-mastered it. That and the Gears series.</p>

<p>I guarantee you the Mass Effect series will get remastered, I would definitely like to see it remastered. But I would personally rather see it remastered a few years down the line. In my eyes, there should be that break between the original and the remastered.
 Because then when it's remastered, you're returning to it years later all excited! I guarantee you 100% never been more sure of anything in my life that if Medal Of Honor: Rising Sun was remastered, it would beat any of these remastered Xbox 360 games, maybe
 even new releases, in sales just because people would get that nostalgia from Several years ago. I mean that's almost a 12 year old game. And it was a HUGE game then!

<h2>            Laptop screen resolution changes when lid closes</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Qosmio X775 with an NVidia GTX 560M adapter.&nbsp; The system originally had Windows 7 and was upgraded to Windows 10 last year.&nbsp; Late 2016, Windows update stopped working and would no longer update Windows or MS apps.&nbsp; To attempt to fix this,
 I installed the WIndows 10 anniversary edition.&nbsp; Since this update, when I close the lib on my laptop, the screen resolution changes and all my windows are shrunk and stuffed to the upper left corner of my display.&nbsp; My resolution is set to the default (recommended)
 resolution of 1920x1080.&nbsp; My system settings are set to "Do Nothing" when the lid is closed when plugged in and on battery.&nbsp; What else can be changed to fix this back so it wont mess up my display when I close the lid?

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Screen issues can be a little bit tricky to resolve until we find the possible cause. To further assess on this, kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any other changes on the settings of your PC prior to the issue?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</li><li>Current build version of your Windows operating system</li></ul>
<p>In the mean time, try to boot your PC in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong>, to see if the issue would still persist. Also check if
 your drivers are <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updated to the latest version</a></strong>, especially your monitor and
 graphics card driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change I've made was the upgrade from the MS website, I downloaded Windows10Upgrade9252.exe.&nbsp; It upgraded me to Windows 10.0.15063 (from System Information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted to SafeMode, but Safe Mode does not support the 1920x1028 mode my NVidia recommends, so I really could not test this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the lengthy driver upgrade process recommended above.&nbsp; After about an hour and 3 reboots, my PC came up in 1024x768 mode.&nbsp; I changed it to the recommended 1920x1028 mode and the problem persist.&nbsp; I am now running NVidia driver 21.21.13.7684
 (from System Information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to further explain, when the lid closes, it changes the resolution.&nbsp; When I open the lid back, it changes it back to 1920x1024 but everything is resized and stuffed in the upper left corner.&nbsp; I can't tell what resolution it is changing things to.&nbsp; I
 would guess from the sizes, either 1280xsomething or 1024c768.&nbsp; And there is no other display connected to this laptop.</p>

            <p>I can get the printer properties to show up. it isn't showing a color option. under the original settings, I was printing in color with no problem. i first got the gray scale by using Printer Properties, clicking the Advanced button, turning on High Quality
 Grayscale, then clicking OK for this option.<br />
<br />
now, i can't find anything that will allow me to return to color. when i try clicking on Turn Grayscale Off, it won't allow me to turn it off and return to color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm still looking through the links you provided, in case i missed something.</p>

            <p>JD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally been able to open the page at this link below.&nbsp; It would not open for me when I posted the other links.&nbsp; The information was to see if your HP printer was compatible with Windows 10 and if there was a newer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04658195#Install_Windows_driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04658195#Install_Windows_driver</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From that website, download either the HP full featured driver or the HP basic driver.&nbsp; I would think the full feature driver is going to give you programs and utilities for the printer, as well as the driver.&nbsp; At the top of the page is a link to a Printer
 Install Wizard.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>I would download the HP full feature driver from that page.&nbsp; Next, I would completely uninstall the printer from the system.&nbsp; I usually like to unplug the&nbsp;printer from the computer and power source, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of the printer is OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer, not shutdown, but restart the computer a couple times without the printer.&nbsp; After a couple restarts, install the printer full feature driver.&nbsp; It should be a .exe file that you can right click on and run as administrator.&nbsp; Start the
 full feature application first, then let the program tell you to connect the printer again.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp; If your printer is listed there, right click on the printer listed then select uninstall.&nbsp; Click in the box to uninstall the driver if you get it.&nbsp; Then restart the computer.&nbsp;

    <title>Binary Domain video glitch - game unplayable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phaser80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Binary Domain video glitch - game unplayable</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have started this game yesterday and I'm experiencing strange video glitches.</p>
<p>1) During the introductory mission some parts of my character's and my partner's suit flicker i.e. appear and disappear. That's annoying but playable.</p>
<p>2) Shortly after the initial fight with the robots starts -&nbsp;the screen goes all white as if someone throw a flashbang. The action goes on, I can see the damage I receive, I can hear all the audio but I don't see anything. Then I die because of wounds and
 everything repeats.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced something like this? Do you know what to do with this?</p>
<p>It's so weird - it looks to me like video drivers fault but you cannot update them because it's an xbox...</p>
<p>And yes - I cleared my xbox hdd cache, deleted all the game files&nbsp;and the problem still remains.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

                </div>

<p>Greetings phaser80,</p>
<p>Just to be clear in your problem...</p>
<p>1. Does this issue occur with any other game?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried either of these discs on a different console, such as a friend's? if yes, does the problem occur too ?</p>
<p>3. What are you using to connect your Xbox to your tv? HDMI ? AVI ?</p>
<p>Lastly, have you tried the game on your console with the HDD removed? if not, please give it a try.</p>
<p>Finally, please try <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/image-on-your-tv-is-unclear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a> and see if it can help you with your problem.</p>

<p>@collecionador</p>
<p>ad.1 I played many, many other games and didn't have such a problem. Only once I noticed some wierd graphics artifacts, texture flckering and audio loss when I was playing Mass Effect 3 demo but I thought it just might happen to demo as it's an early development
 stage product. I still haven't tried Mass Effect 3 full game to prove it.</p>
<p>ad. 2 I still haven't tried to run this dics on another console but I definitely will.</p>
<p>ad. 3 I connect my xbox to TV using a component YUV cable. 1080i video mode. I tried on different resolutions but it didn't help at all.</p>
<p>I tried to run the game today with the HDD removed as you suggested. I used USB pendrive to store my profile. But all that effort led to nothing. The problem still exists.</p>
<p>@Woden HTG</p>
<p>No, I haven't installed the game on the hard drive but I shall do so. The DVD isn't scratched at all - it's an almost factory clean copy. I bought this game in a brand new state (plastic wrapping).</p>

<p>Allright, so I have done addidtional test with that game and here are the results:</p>
<p>1) I have run the game on two other consoles - one 'old' white and a new slim model - the game runs perfectly OK on both of them.</p>
<p>2) I have installed the game on my console's hdd - no change, the video glitch is still there.</p>
<p>Moreover, I downloaded and tried the demo of Binary Domain - it gives me the same glitchy effect as the full game.</p>
<p>So please advise me what shall I do with it now... Just as a side note I would like to say that this console has been delivered to me by Microsoft in February in exchange of my previous console that died because of the Red Ring of Death...</p>

<p>I did some more research into the problem - I connected my xbox using HDMI to another TV - still no good result - the glitch remains. It looks like my console particulary doesn't like Binary Domain and Mass Effect 3 (demo). Please help me with that problem.</p>

<p>Hey there, phaser80. I just attempted to reproduce what you described initially and have been unable to. Would it be possible for you to try playing the content on your same console with a different gamertag? I'd like to know if the issue persists when you
 do this. In addition, if you would be able to take some video footage of what you are seeing I would be interested to see exactly what you are encountering. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I played the game using 2 different gamertags and there is no difference.</p>
<p>I rceorded the glitch with my phone and published it on youtube here: [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvbmKdGZOFI]</p>
<p>Sorry for poor quality and very, very low audio but it's all I can achieve with my phone.</p>

<p>Hey there, phaser80. I really appreciate you posting the video. From what I can see it looks like this is stemming from the graphics card in your console, especially since you mentioned encountering similar issues during Mass Effect 3. At this point I would
 recommend sending your console in for a repair. You can find steps for how to do this in this support article titled "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to get your Xbox product repaired</a>". Thank you and
 please let us know if you have any questions!</p>

<p>Step 1: Download and Save the video onto your cpu from your email</p>
<p>Step 2: Sign up for Dropbox. You can do it through your web browser on your cpu.</p>
<p>Step 3: Upload your video to dropbox </p>
<p>Step 4: Download the Dropbox app to your iPhone (only opening on Safari will NOT work)</p>
<p>Step 5: Select the video, click on the 3 dots that resemble an ellipses in the top righ corner. Click 'Export'. An option menu will pop up at the bottom of your iphone, allowing you to choose 'save video'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now of course, you will need a little bit of storage for step 4. I was able to gain storage by deleting instasize and replacing it with instazz. However, you can choose an app of your choice to be replaced with another that does similar work, or delete some
 things you don't use every day.</p>

If you copied the .mov file to a folder on your hard drive....<br />
I have no idea why Gmail would be involved when you <br />

Maybe the Gmail Forum would be worth a visit:<br />

<h2>            Network&#58; No Internet Access</h2>
                    <p>On the desktop, I get a Network notification that I have no Internet access, but I do in fact have access. I can load any website just fine, pull down Outlook data, etc. But when I switch to the Start screen and use a Metro app they all think there is no
 network connection and nothing will update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've uninstalled the network card driver and reinstalled and things were fine for a bit, but it seems anytime I restart the machine, say for an update, it shows I have no internet connection.&nbsp;Again, I do get connection on the desktop, but the Metro apps
 think there is no connection and won't update their data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you try the printer on other computers? Do other USB or WiFi&nbsp;devices work on your<br />
Surface (depending on usage). Could be a cabling issue if using USB or a WiFi device issue if going Wireless.<br />
<br />
As OEM&nbsp;the Printer Maker is responsible for the proper operation of the printer <br />
and their&nbsp;supplied drivers. Check with&nbsp;the Printer Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line
<br />
documentation and&nbsp;drivers, and ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any).<br />

            <p>JosefkKrkland, it is highly recommended to have and frequently use AV software on any computer. i think the windows defender is a pre built in anti-virus software</p>
<p>but i would still recommend some Internet security anti spyware and anti malware later on if there starts being reports of smart viruses geting around the windows defender, you might consider an antivirus.</p>

            I don't fully understand this. Microsoft recommends that 2 software programs should not be running simultaneously, yet Defender is said here to be a virus checker, and McAfee antivirus runs be default on Windows 8. Can someone please fill me in on this
 situation?<br />

            Windows 8 has a new feature that let's you refresh but loose data. Refreshing deletes viruses, but it is good to have an antivirus software. And popular ones like mcafee and norton aren't that good because hackers intend to make viruses that can't be detected
 by the popular ones everybody uses. So unpopular anti viruses like avg and sophos will probably be better.
<div><br />
<div>Remember that windows 8 isn't any safer than windows 7 so it's chance of getting viruses is the same. You probably would need one.</div>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Defender on Windows 8 is a full anti-malware program (not just anti-spyware like in previous Windows versions). It is effectively a new version of Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) but with a different name already
 built-in to the Windows 8 operating system. For many people Windows Defender is sufficient in Windows 8 as a real-time protection anti-malware program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you wish to install a 3rd party&nbsp;real-time protection anti-malware program then you may, but it is generally advisable not to have more than one such program running at any given time. In fact, some of the 3rd party programs
 will deliberately disable Windows Defender to avoid problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The choice of any 3rd party program is subjective and also depends on your circumstances.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">No anti-malware program is perfect. Doing an independent scan periodically with an on-demand scanner like the
<u>free</u> one from Malwarebytes is a a good idea.</span></p>

Malware is a shortened form of the term malicious software. It is basically a general term that covers all the nasties, including viruses, worms, trojans, adware, spyware, keyloggers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A virus is a subset of malware. The definitions vary, but it is basically an unwanted and potentially harmful program that can reproduce and spread to other computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms malware and virus are often used loosely, interchangeably and sometimes erroneously.</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately and as of now, the option to remove Quick Access tab is not available. There may be 3rd party tweaks that may help you remove it. However, Microsoft does not recommend doing so to avoid further issues in the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to leave&nbsp;you inputs through Feedback App on the Start page which gets reviewed by the development team who may, in future, want to consider providing options to remove it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Well Niranjan there are several pages on-line that show how to get rid of Quick access. I just can't seem to modify the ShellFolder Attributes value in RegEdit. While the text tells how to set permissions it doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel Microsoft did a good job on Windows 10. However killing off Windows Explorer and replacing it with File Explorer was a huge mistake. It's a mess, and has lost a ton of features carefully crafted over decades.</p>

    <title>Enforcement&#47;Suspension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wild nukez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enforcement&#47;Suspension</h2>
                    <p>So my son uses my live account for his XBOX and was suspended last night because someone he was playing with said he was annoying and he was going to report him. which he did.... my son is 10 yrs old and this other kid is 14. The language coming from these
 players so young is terrible BUT it is ON the TV and I can hear everything either party is saying, including my son. I let the language pass knowing my 10 yr old isn't repeating it but he was banned from using his voice/text/streaming because another player
 was mad that a 10 yr old was better than he was. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is.... does Microsoft/XBOX monitor and review the conversations BEFORE the suspend someone OR do you just trust that someone reporting someone is valid?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MULTIPLE text communications on his xbox live account from other players calling my 10 yr old a
<strong>[Mod Removed-Profanity]</strong>' and 'trash' because he beat them in a game of fortnite. he doesn't report anyone, just blocks them if it's not appropriate. SO why have those players not been banned or do you just assume the person reporting someone
 is valid? </p>

            Microsoft reviews each report that is submitted regarding communications harassment. They look at the messages sent and can review in-game chat (they do have access to everything that crosses their servers). If your account was suspended, it was because
 of inappropriate content coming FROM it, not directed at it.<br />
<br />
While this may be hindsight, it is advised that each user on Xbox One have their own Microsoft account. This prevents the situation that you described (YOUR account being suspended for something someone else did).<br />
<br />
As to the texts your account has received, the enforcement system only works when we take part in it. You absolutely should report such harassment, otherwise, as you noted, they won't be suspended. Why weren't they suspended? Nobody reported it.

<p>I'm currently working with xbox enforcement. I guess he didn't report them because it's like going through a sea of messages when kids are just throwing
<strong>[Mod Removed-Profanity] </strong>back and forth. Some messages aren't that great but again.. he's 10 and really doesn't think much of it other than 'HAHA I BEAT YOU!' lol

    <title>Windows 7 showing all sub folder contents when I view My Documents. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 showing all sub folder contents when I view My Documents.  How do I change this&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I open up my My Documents folder on one of my Win7 machines and look at the file list, it shows me every file from in My Documents and in any sub folder within my documents, all in one huge list.&nbsp; I can't figure out how to make it not do this and just
 show me the files in that folder and show me the folder names of the sub folders like it does normally.</p>
<p>I have another Win7 machine that works right so I'm sure it's just some setting on this one machine making it do this but I can't find it anywhere.</p>
<p>Anyone seen it do this before and know how to make it not do that?</p>
<p>I've tried setting it to Arrange By Folder, and that breaks out the files properly but then they aren't sorted.&nbsp; I change it to Arrange By Name, and it alphabetizes them but then it goes back to showing me every file in all the sub folders.&nbsp; Help please.
 :)</p>

            Well, I found out the problem was the Sort By option.&nbsp; I didn't realize there was Arrange by and also Sort by.&nbsp; Arrange By was set properly but Sort By was set to Date for some reason.&nbsp; I changed Arrange by to Folder and then Sort by to Name and then everything
 started working fine.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that you get an error saying that the feature is unavailable for the Windows edition when trying to add a language.</p>
<p>Please answer these questions so I can understand the issue better.<br />
1. Which edition of Windows 8 do you have?<br />
2. How did you install Windows 8?<br />
3. If you upgraded, from which version of Windows did you do so?</p>
<p>To check the Windows edition, type "System" on the Start screen, click "Settings" and click the result that says System. Check for the information under: Windows Edition.</p>
<p>For reference to find the Windows version.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer: "Add features" option is unavailable in volume license versions of Windows 8</p>

2) Windows was already preloaded in my laptop.</div>
<div>
3) No upgradation from any other version of Windows</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Currently my laptop is in English language, and I want it completely changed to German language.</div>
<div>
Now I know the process of converting into some other language but since my laptop is of a single language version no other language is possible and when I try to change it the line reads as "Unavailable in this edition of windows".</div>
<div>
Is there any way out??...Is Microsoft working on a software or upgrade in which I can use multiple languages??</div>
<div>
Please help out.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to upgrade to&nbsp; Windows 8 pro to enjoy multiple language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope it helps.</p>
