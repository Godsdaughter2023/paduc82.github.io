<h2>            Creative update internet LAN issues kb4022405 uninstall</h2>
                    <p>My computer automatically&nbsp;updated this Creative Update, and ever since my internet LAN adapter is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to uninstall the driver every time I Restart, and it's giving me some issues while working during the course of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how can I uninstall this update?<br />
</p>
<p>I have read a lot about bugs and WIFI issues but this is something else and it is making the Windows 10 experience a nightmare.</p>

<h2>            Copied items appear in the clipboard for 5 seconds and then disappears</h2>
                    PC running winXP SP3. I've tried scanning the computer for viruses and malware using a variety of softwares. When I copy an item (ctrl-c), the item stays in the clipboard for about 5 seconds and then disappears. I can paste the item within the 5 seconds,
 but after that, there is nothing to paste.

            I fixed the problem! Not too long ago, I activated an app that "optimized" RAM to make more RAM available for other PC functions. One option in the app deleted the clipboard contents as soon as they were detected. I disabled the clipboard option in the
 RAM optimizing app, and the problem disappeared.

            i am having the same experience. i had three old work laptops reformated to xp with their individual product codes, and they keep asking to be re-avalidated. &nbsp;I phoned microsoft and they tell me, they no longer support xp, which l know. so, therefore,
 from my experience they will now not allow a reformatted xp system to run either. Is this true?

            <p>I am having problems activating too.&nbsp; I've spent 30 min on the phone trying to activate something they don't support.&nbsp; they told me to call my local tech.&nbsp; Local tech?&nbsp;&nbsp; why?&nbsp; I've reinstalled &amp; activated with this same product key--that is valid--for years.&nbsp;
 I've never had this problem, and they can't help me.<br />
I think it's all a con to force the upgrade.&nbsp; I'm not ready to buy another computer, but I'm seriously considering going with Apple now.</p>

            <p>This may be inherent to laptops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But I have reinstalled XP on PCs a couple of times this last month. Had no problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;When installing select to activate XP&nbsp;later. Get the system up and running. You will have 30 days to activate it. Get all the updates available that are 'Security' and 'Important' through Custom update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Do not allow "auto update"! </p>
<p>On any updates that are not marked as Security or important then you will have to check each one to whether you actually need it or not. If you do not need it don't install it.</p>
<p>Never allow Windows update to install hardware drivers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once these are done...select to 'activate' only. Answer the prompts. Then OK.</p>

<p><span>Could you please go through the steps that you took to 'fresh install' XP on your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Exact steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Put xp cd in computer and booted, delete previous partions on hard drive and then reformat</span></p>
<p><span>and select to install windows a while later input product key which was accepted so installation</span></p>
<p><span>continues after sometime reaches the log in screen, click on 'owner' to log in then informed</span></p>
<p><span>windows needs to be registered so I registered over the internet which was reported as being</span></p>
<p><span>successful tried to log in windows says product needs to be registered - infinite loop. Registering XP&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>by the phone produces the same infinite loop and if I disconnect the internet (hard wired ethernet)</span></p>
<p><span>and reinstall when trying to validate on the phone no software key is generated so can't register over</span></p>
<p><span>the phone at all. I've tried all the combinations I can think of all with no joy.</span></p>
<p><span>Waiting with a very small expectation that this can be resolved...</span></p>

            <p>What I would do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Format the HD with a 3rd party program like 'BootItNG" Or "Bootit-next gen."</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a "Seagate" disk manager disk. But it has to be installed in a working machine. Then I have to plug in the HD that would be formatted and open the disk management tool and find and reformat the HD from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is not good to 'just' insert the disk and format and install from the original OS Cd. It will leave the branding of the previous install. Which is probably why you are having this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;IF you can get a 3rd party disk manager/formatter? Possibly on CD/DVD or on a floppy using a USB connected floppy drive.&nbsp; Then boot to that. You will be able to TOTALLY reformat the OS drive where absolutely nothing is left on it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Then insert the OS Cd and install. Put in the 'Code Key' when asked but decline any and all attempts to register it. If you have a choice select "No not now" or "later"</p>
<p>&nbsp;Continue the install to desktop. If asked to 'log in'? Just cancel or without putting any password hit 'OK'/'Log In'. Plus tick "Don't show this again"</p>
<p>&nbsp;This should get you to a desktop of a fully functional machine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;The CD you are using? Is it a Windows XP CD or a laptop makers' recovery CD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it is a recovery CD then you will not be able to do a complete&nbsp;fresh install of XP.</p>

                    <p>I'm experiencing two problems with the Windows 10 start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is that after a reboot, the pinned start menu tiles get jumbled up. It keeps the first icon in each group but the rest just get all moved to new groups at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem is that the "Most Used" list doesn't seem to update, it's still got the default items there (maps, people, etc) from when I upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to fix these?</p>

            <p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform SFC (System File Checker) Scan and check if it helps. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</p>
<p>a. Click on Start button and type cmd in the search box.<br />
b. Right-click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
d. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.<br />
Warning: Do not close the Command Prompt Window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of the issue so that we can assist you further.

            I've run this with no reports of any problems.&nbsp; My "Most Used" list still consists of Get Started, Paint, Notepad, and Contact Support, despite using PPT/XL/Word/Outlook dozens of times each.

            <p>I think I've found my problem - don't know if it applies to others.&nbsp; If you have a program pinned to the Start Menu, it seems that it will never appear in your Most Used list.&nbsp; I was wondering why Excel, Word, etc., never showed.,&nbsp; So I ran a bunch of other
 apps and they appeared.&nbsp; Then, on a hunch, I unpinned Excel from the menu, and it immediately appeared in the Most Used.&nbsp; I re-pinned it to Start, and it disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So apparently the Most Used list is the list of apps you use the most except for those that you use enough to pin them to start because you use them the most.&nbsp; Perhaps is should be the "Most used of the non-most-used apps" list. :(</p>

<h2>            adaptec RAID and Windows 7 not working</h2>
                    I am trying to update my computer to 7. &nbsp;I still have xp64 on it but it Adobe software doesn't like xp64. &nbsp;Right now it is dual boot.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything seems to work great on windows 7 but after a few hours of running it my raid alarm goes off. &nbsp;If I reboot in windows 7 I can't use the drive, if I reboot in xp64 it says that the drive is rebuilding/verifying and I can use it. &nbsp;I have done this
 several times. &nbsp;I am now on day 8 of running the computer on xp64 only so I don't think it is a problem with the raid. &nbsp;I think it is a problem with drivers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>xp64 has 2 drivers loaded</div>
<div><span>Adaptec AIC-9410 Serial-Attached SCSI (SAS) Controller</span></div>
<div><span><span>adaptec processor device (pseudo)</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Windows 7 just has the first one.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I talked to the manufacture of my computer</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Supermicro SuperServer 7045B-3B</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>they were not much help</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I talked to adaptec, and they&nbsp;weren't&nbsp;much help.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>They said it could be a driver issue.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I have a raid 0 and a raid 10 and 2 individual hardrives on this computer (running through the raid controller)</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>3 time the alarm has gone off on the raid 10 drives and 1 time it has gone off with the raid 0.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I wonder if it is the disk defragmentor setting off the alarms... because every time they go off I am not working on the system.... also maybe the
 power management is turning the drives off? &nbsp;But if that was the case I would have to alarms going off with I wake the computer up.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Any help would greatly be&nbsp;appreciated.</span></span></div>

<p>Hi Reuberm,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft answers.</p>
<p>If you are able to boot to Windows 7, I would recommend that you update the drivers for RAID from the hard disk manufacturer.<br />
If you are unable to boot, then I would recommend that you download the drivers manually for Hard disk manufacturer and copy it on USB stick and you might require to start the installation of Windows 7 from the disc once again.<br />
Connect the USB stick and start the installation process, in the process it will give you an option to “Load drivers from the drive location”. Once all the necessary drivers are installed, you may finish the installation process and check if you are able to
 boot without any issues.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you backup all the necessary data that you have saved on Windows 7.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you visit the TechNet Forums for further assistance from the link below:

<h2>            Please Read... -Samuel-</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 image build 9200 question. - Is it legal to activate enterprise 9200? and yes I got this legally and or found it unknowingly meaning I did not know the build number of the official MSDN or Microsoft Service Domain Name but just took time to ponder
 what would be a suitable system for me, meaning I did not know if it was the final and some are stating it to be the Microsoft&nbsp;corporate build knowing an extreme amount of crazy freeloaders which I am&nbsp;sort o fitting in that partial description; I had to look
 up the information before I found out and apparently it was a final build RTM, which back at the time I did not know what that meant.&nbsp;if&nbsp; also I am guessing what that MSDN&nbsp;stands for.
</p>
<p>Though it is not the final edition. It was a build that modeled the true stability of such production in the interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also there is no way to activate even the evaluation or I already have it. My key is or was correct, due to tutorials learned somewhat but it is invalid for a strange reason&nbsp;and shows a partial key which is actually containing the last 5 digits of the
 key which I do not know the method for which to finish the key on 8 and or activate the windows product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the product key and know the thing&nbsp;but for some reason my windows says the key cannot be activated found or such with DNS and KMS and I have wireless and a hard-drive. Can someone explain to me what the heck is going on with the situation of Windows
 8? And yes I just started the evaluations. And apparently I read here that when are they going to put it out on the market. The problem here is that Windows 8 if such that I know was of&nbsp;based on&nbsp;suspicions that I did not currently know till now,&nbsp;it was leaked
 the RTM&nbsp;standing probably for Runtime Machine,&nbsp;and or not supposed to be out there in the web. So now people are looking at the tutorials for windows 8? And I apologize for answering with my questions but I am actually looking for an answer to my question.</p>
<p>Please note I will not say the whole product key knowing people may activate enterprise at a risk that I get in trouble for actually trying to be legal about it.</p>
<p>Anyway... The current key is like this : *****-CWCK7. Does anyone know how to obtain the key and know for a fact that this is the product key piece that which I know the full product which actually I cannot even insert the key using activation method and
 I tried. Then a bunch of errors show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- One error for DNS.: Need help.</p>
<p>- One error for KMS. : Desperate help.</p>
<p>- In windows&nbsp;PC settings it states Windows cannot be activated right now after the installing of the system. : Impossible.</p>
<p>- PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Reboot bug where I lost my metro&nbsp;and interface by compressing the registries together (Windows 8&nbsp;Manager Beta)&nbsp;which is a mistake that left a blank desktop when&nbsp;logging in or turns out to be nothing. To fix this problem I had to reinstall the system from
 its scratch point with information hopefully still in the machine otherwise stuck on the opposite end of the Microsoft servers. The problem here is it deleted all the metro which is the interface of windows 8 that I learned about in a PC magazine. Good thing
 I backed up what I wanted to actually keep.</p>
<p>- A bug also where the metro if exited out without email or unfinished account that which could be or not verified at the moment, the mail tile inwardly disappears.</p>
<p>-And yes I do use the internet as a mail system but I am talking about the sync settings to get mail directly to the PC which indeed is the same as going onto the internet. But it makes it easy for us people who need everything together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing is the sky-drive for instant sharing and or just to be stupid for some people and myself,&nbsp;but sadly I do not know what to do with it, meaning what to put in there for public sharing considering me being me and just&nbsp; well who knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Please note that I am taking the time to understand actually how metro works. I only know what it is because I read a windows 8 magazine and also have found some of the things that people are currently working with. And I am not a coder. So if you are
 a coder or have a tutorial. I have the product key but do not know how to activate it knowing I tried slui.exe 3 to enter it knowing the method did not work&nbsp;command&nbsp;and such. Is it impossible or do I need new build knowing my product ID number which should
 not be stated knowing people would come after me and trying to activate what they could not get or find legally?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a trial MAK or something that someone could give me a new ID or do I not need to change that at all because everyone searched for a build I have? Cause I did not know this would happen and just recently heard and or figured some if not all or perhaps
 none of this stuff out by myself meaning I am not the only one who has questions pertaining to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Windows is giving out the enterprise edition freely in theory for the trial that is kind. But knowing that it cannot be activated even through such is also a problem. Please help. :(</p>
<p>Also I do not want to be cheated by company and or people selling the product but it was supposed to come out in October but the RTM which is the Runtime Machine I am guessing got leaked to the public early through a flaw in the company setting or that of
 your people in the background working for Microsoft. Please understand I get my products legally if I could help it knowing I do not steal from people though am a freeloader like ninety-five percent of your people or so who actually do use computers. It is
 unfair the software does not come out at or with the production of a new operating system. And that is why you got those who actually do not like buying online and or those who make such useful but not get money for products as according to copyright, distribution,
 and that of business appliance.</p>
<p>Please note that also it is a shame that Microsoft took such a hard hit now that I am gathering thoughts in my head when I type this. I really wanted just to stay updated on news and such but it is ashamed that Windows is having a deal and people are taking
 advantage of it all getting stuff distributed by illegal means. So much for the software industry and PC industry as they taken into measures to shut down everyone who even activates the product or gets it legally.</p>
<p>Sadly about the news they do not update everyone with what goes on across or have a daily world news station but have to go across the web on different places and hackers sites just to find it. That includes the worst biblical tower of babel case where languages
 understand one another and use English as a means of communication knowing even when I speak it to my own they do not understand me. But if you look at the clarity if people would not assume one's mind but bother to listen they could along with children of
 their own and family get along.</p>
<p>Heck I blame actually the people who distributed it all&nbsp;from Russia and or Germany with your hacker groups, and somewhat of the islands except for the fact they fought for honor in representation of one's own people also teaching the world manners regardless
 of persecution, and these are the leading manufacturers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do&nbsp;not help for being a downloader,&nbsp;but you cannot shut down that torrent site because it is a part of the Russian Federation and connected to groups like that of your A-groups, the bad ones and the actual administration. I did a lot of research and took
 some snapshots with a non-legal software or rather that one should not be presented to all people, legally licensed and given to me on my B-Day but it is a snapshot software my brother got legally. If they continue what with the&nbsp;advancements who knows what
 could happen knowing their society and that of people across the globe are at stake. I tell this as a message that people need to slow down development and start going after these guys knowing such A-groups spread across the globe with that of from Europe
 which started from 5 stupid rebels who even wanted to over throw their own government and systems - This is your business man logo of 5 elite. They were back in 2008 if not earlier as&nbsp;written in the hacker's book 4th edition looked up&nbsp;but now updated if not
 already now in the library. Such a book came out but was&nbsp;researched three years or so before its time. Dr K... for the K in such a name means Kingpin. I wonder also about the legitimacy of joining&nbsp;such a group with the consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I wonder who inspired these people or what do they believe in. Oh yeah I forgot. I am persecuted by that of Germany as a religious hate crime by them by posting pictures of the devil verse that of Jesus Christ because they are Satanic or worship the
 devil compared to that of those who believe in the faith of God which kept not the people but that world in balance. For such&nbsp;I am a believer&nbsp;not in corruption though I had known principles of it. I twisted the logic of Anonymous&nbsp;for stating they are Legion
 1/0 for them being undefined. I stated that everyone is known indeed. And indeed&nbsp;it was of two digits not to define which is 0E and 0F for they already will try to figure out everything and what breaks down or builds 0E and 0F. And I say to myself.&nbsp;Idiots
 we and also that who am I to understand but by similar principles taught to me and that preached with what I believe that is true and applies to life?. The next thing that starts is religious persecution then the lack of the freedom of speech, even in your
 local church or faith, which I looked at a faith higher than my own and abide by something stronger. Please note that I do not go to other countries to preach a belief I do not fully know or how it applies to life if it cannot be proven.</p>
<p>At least I am not afraid to admit this knowing these idiots said F-the system and or do believe in something but have no clue what they believe in and I would not be a suicidal martyr as such that of a leadership that hurts its own.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I was like, why did I take a picture of this? For a cause people that Germany is behind all the madness up to that of your Arab countries fighting the rebels or supplying them to terrorists meaning people of other countries invading another&nbsp;with the
 powers of Russia. And does the international council know this? And heck... I am actually a 20 year old who knows more because I tried to relate the connections though the people are unheard. Thus at your headquarters of HBO you have the symbol on a building
 that represents who they are. The stupid media is in the act too, some good some bad, not only that... you got people with that stupid FAK technologic mask. I am like, where do they get such a face knowing it looks good, but also that each one of those of
 administration ought to be tracked down and also those of hackers having the mask and positions re-elected. Your government does not do a good job with this stuff cause people are only aware of elections and sports besides that of the economy. If you want
 jobs so badly then help your people by not forcing insurance on some but be sure that everyone is legal. And that I should also say to those who are considered the 'American People' you have to remember that the media does not treat people equally because
 they are also a part of the American people when they come here to America or a part of another group when ever they migrate across the globe. I ask what in the world is wrong with people persecuting other people for what they believe in rather than that which
 is wrong to society?</p>
<p>Then you have your worse elected officials or some put new into the office. It is those people who inherit not only power but also do not know what they are doing a cause for. It is these people we elect who make our laws, educate the people or younger kids,
 etc. In fact government is actually taught by the international board if not that of your higher council or founding people the Magistrates, which nobody or Parliament even mentions what is the situation here with the laws that are made and how are world laws
 made? It is these people who took text from ancient times from the lands that were once holy but now surrounded by war. It would be a future threat to the globe knowing each side of the world is affected by that which is unstable because of the lack to check
 the backgrounds of people such as your masked leader in Parliament or that of the Magistrates which is above the House and the Senate if not for the fact they did not break down.</p>
<p>Everything is unheard and I will make it known that as one of the youngest people who could be a CEO. I know this that many of the jobs us younger people get are taken by people who have degrees but also that of a non-intellect, over power, or corruption.
 First of all it starts with family and local communication which I thought who are people to assume my own mind and what I think, and I thought to myself those who taught me had more respect then those who taught me false if any at all being a model example.
 Family they teach the child. A child should not know more than his family but also have that of life skills being able to take care of one's self with another. But they should not be married as young kids. Such it be that the world not be overpopulated and
 there be a lack of resource due to the lack of conservation if not for the effort to sustain the environment or for your governments to hide future resources selfishly or not. I ask people like me to stop being so worried about machines in life and look at
 the big picture. Though I cannot budget I know what is suitable toward my needs as an individual. People calculate that and it is among a totality. When you have people treating people cruelty or hurting those who are peaceful and seek harmony you get this
 wicked world's way referring to that of all. So who is it that has the most chaos is those of the East compared to those of the West but it is the new or commoner age that came to and survived on the west. In fact it is strange the Eastern world can and will
 not hear the cries of her people knowing some have spread their believe true or false forcing it on others or some actually teaching the correctness and tolerance to live, but with many believes in result believing something different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sites to shut down.</p>
<p>- Russian Federation server and&nbsp;Picktorrent, etc...&nbsp;sadly and this would lead to many cases and the people going crazy.</p>
<p>- It is no wonder I found hacking tools on that website and your many free torrent sites like File Buster and such is&nbsp;of the hacker's underground, rather the chain.</p>
<p>- When Anonymous shuts down the web because they snuck into the administration it is all over unless one in agreement to Paul Fetch&nbsp;stops this mess though I also an idiot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Once the connected media is shut down. It is over for some if not many people and we can all start walking again with the airports and security corrupting that of its people which is a stupid repeat of history or we can change that history by actually having
 a cause and a purpose in life and for each of our lands work on getting along with others and setting agriculture and using science for good rather than actually experimenting without knowing we cause harm to others. Test your work on yourself and in a desolate
 land that is barren as a consequence that one changes the flow of land and sea at such a rate for which one should see.</p>
<p>- It came along earlier with that of Japan and Tokyo which developed such things with the games. Too bad Japan was wiped out by a big flood which broke the history near China, Asia, etc.&nbsp;Though we do not tolerate one another or do, I respect the people for
 teaching me manners.&nbsp;Rather the Tsunami everyone forgot which I sadly remember. Were there not a single person who believed on God or was it a matter of nature? I do not know and it is depressing but I show these people respect because they had honor for what
 they represented though I do the most for my own. Um my question is which side of the world got flooded or was this considered a world to go to?</p>
<p>- I blame your Mexican Cartel sneaking into the US and or other places across the globe trying to improvise how to drug everyone or bring such into the country to kill the people. Such is a sad extreme knowing others will attack a land that is peaceful or
 with minimal crop resources.</p>
<p>- Who are those who pollute what is near? Does anyone actually care for where they live at?</p>
<p>- Surely there is actually something strange about those who have literature&nbsp;on the other side of the world or underground&nbsp;and these are not to be explained by myself for I do not know everything.</p>
<p>-I cannot describe that of Canada but the polar ice caps and your mountains with the artic zone that will fade away some day but people indeed are safe or not unless they know survival within the mountains. But not safe from earthquakes and or the Sun.</p>
<p>-What is sports to me? What is technology to me? Have we explored beyond the limit? What is life to me? Is it peace or chaos? Such indeed is neither but by a guard in that which is higher than my own knowing indeed my actions are wrong or right but from
 within have I been slack, for both internal and external.</p>
<p>-They force me to have medication and I tell the doctors... I am thinking clearly or they do not bother to check my brain and heart over that of giving me drugs. Rather they rush to keep me alive on the death bed in my condition but I was much more innocent
 as one who knew nothing rather than that which also I remember for people bring such the circumstance to mind, not reminding me of what good was within rather than that of the bad times.</p>
<p>- The sports I suffer with in my physical condition. Others are better. In the fields of math and science one is also better than I. What job is for me but to abide that which everyone or myself has copied from one another? It is that of stability in hope
 knowing there are more jobs than meets the eye that one cannot develop alone but from the mind.</p>
<p>- Soon they shall know everything and not be able to reach it by science. Then such is a problem with your education system as they do not fully teach a subject but take the willingness to understand a part. Hence also from my intellect which has at the
 time collapsed due to incident or a cause, I recovered more memory as an expansion. The caution here is a concern among that with bipolar and Asperger syndrome with both in a similarity.</p>
<p>- Food production... I would understand such is of the agriculture for which the weather has been terrible to grow in many areas. Yet other people need to actually handle the food properly and learn to clean themselves with pure water and that of a disinfection.
 It is that such a nation needs to have a filter and learn to reserve that which we labor for.</p>
<p>- For every man who owns an animal. Do not unleash it on people or abuse it. If an animal is to be eaten let it be that there be an over populaces of that animal in good health and notice the condition of what they do to the land. Such to also prevent disease.
 Bugs are pestilence but also are attracted and or develop microscopic. Such is not me but a creature with a cause to attack the pollution of areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- DO NOT BUY ANOTHER PIECE OF SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR COMPANY IS LEGIT AND OR ALSO THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT LEAKED TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BY GLOBAL MEANS. THAT GOES FOR FOREIGN PRODUCTS AND OR THAT OF A COST MAKING MONEY TOTALLY USELESS IF EVERYTHING
 IS FOUND FREE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Money is actually a trade system that represents a nation. Please note the people ought to make their own money. Please note that counterfeiting is not legal if such the same bill is copied but this is why it is illegal to burn, destroy, etc... copy money
 for what it is. Resources.</p>
<p>-I was a friend with an Arabian who went to school with me but left towards an unsettled land back towards his birth home. Was he a belief of a Muslim or a **** or that of a Seeq? I ask which one is more peaceful without violence for such indeed was my
 friend regardless of who he is or was&nbsp;as an individual. For also such people have come towards and met me as a person of different type and belief and I accepted them knowing within that indeed they were regardless of act as long as all sides were in agreement.
 I am a Christian but also that for which once a land was persecuted I knew that which also was proper in attitude. Indeed this man was all three but without that of military purpose to corrupt his own and attack others therefore not being to me a terrorist
 but that of what they believed in unity with that proper principle of such no man knows but are starting to learn. Who entered the holy lands? It is not in my accord to go or step upon such grounds corruptible. Knowing such that the lands held stable are those
 abided by its people who indeed became corrupted through cultural methods of history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I learned that of my father. I do not need to repeat his history exactly. For they knew settlement and war. We... know something greater as a child more than what we are influenced and taught to believe about ourselves and others. A child who grows without
 a parent, hopefully it indeed is a good model and influential cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Without such that a culture does not develop. The world needs difference. Knowing such the ancient ways are lost but for hopefully the right reason, yet people are who they are in representation to hold that which we do not understand.</p>
<p>- I had learned more from my local church than that of the universal. But if not a member of my own church but that of universal? Why so is the universal church not stable compared to that of a local church which believes? The broken that believe rightly
 indeed I was preached too and accepted the advice of my elders. Regardless of history sometimes they try to change that of people, before also they look at themselves. Knowing I try to change. I change for the better.</p>
<p>- When they express weakness. My greatest is indeed my strength. Who dares use the principles of Jesus and Sun Tzu in vain but that which is corruptible? For such is better to be used right to understand that you are not worthy including myself of following
 the better of each the two. I cannot follow law expanded which crucifies those of the law for I am one who does not know this. What is your law of the land? Yet also to abide by such a law I ask this. Do we attack or do we understand as according not to attack
 or break but to be silent according to that of Sun Tzu? Indeed... Anonymous used this for corruption. I use it for right of all though motivated wrongly indeed I was at the time for which I learned of the principle.</p>
<p>- What is scripture to me? Is it combined? Such may be so if it were not that they are not the same but similar a piece in relevance.</p>
<p>- I am no expert but one who sticks up for what I believe. I am a student that studied biblical principle. Knowing what it is I use could be dangerous even to my own mind, yet what is it indeed I have taken for to know for granted. I cannot understand all
 for even that man which knows his truth could fall from it. It is shown that perfection in falseness or truth did not make the man who he was deep within.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When everything is free. What happened to those of honor with work and effort?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The CEO and the SEO do not see the consequences of their choice and that which is free and also a thing given for money and that which is of trade. Though that be a lie they look at the cost rather than the future perspective knowing the distance can be
 traveled at lower cost then what the public actually spends to do so.</p>
<p>- The fact that I am a child young nobody believes me. Someone online my age called me a professor for me knowing nothing that which also is common sense.</p>
<p>-The text is understandable if one wants to represent profane for your young child or adult acting childish. I am not one to speak for I made my claim myself. Yet I do not disregard the matter that such is not to be judged. I judge not the character but
 the action of one's motive in their speech.</p>
<p>-In your games and your media... I found information on E-commerce and that of government. Be assertive not to associate your criminal cases that for which others insane or madness support. So what indeed is public friendly media or comedy? Such is a case
 study but also what influences the mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way.... I had said enough before some others actually get mad at me for being what I am as an individual. I am a person like you all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But regarding that fact... As my contribution towards advertising what people need to read or know about me. Go to your site... Duley.com for your products if you are buying with cash and cash back offers as stated on the news right now by your media.</p>

    <title>Division Gold Edition - boxed game download code not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h guitarshreduk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Division Gold Edition - boxed game download code not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I purchased a boxed version of the Gold Edition of Division, that includes a code to download the additional content, season pass, outfits. I have installed the game from disc, went to redeem my DLC code and it just gives the error "Something went wrong,
 please try again later" as if the said content cannot be found. Have tried using the code from XB1 Dashboard, and from Xbox Store link from the Division main menu, same result as above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking on the Xbox Store - there is a Gold Edition listed, but this bundle includes the base game along with season pass and outfits. I presume that this code is just for the Season Pass + Outfits as an add-on to the base game, why is the store having issues
 redeeming this? Post the supposed fix/update to the rewards vendor by Ubi, the included Gold Edition items aren't there for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that there's an ongoing issue with Xbox One versions of The Division and accessing add on/gold edition/extra content, just frustrating that the suppled code still will not redeem four days after release. Thanks all</p>

<p>With the one from the xbox store from my own experience you don't redeem. A cofe</p>
<p>But physical copies issues you have to contact support if it's a 25 digit code contact xbox support</p>
<p>For anything less you must contact ubisoft as it would be a custom code redeemable on the website they provided all xbox codes are 25 digit except for some custom codes but this is up to the publisher</p>

            Something you have running in the background is failing. Googling around shows one person who had installed Style XP and that was causing the problem. Other links show people having the problem but no solution. So if you haven't installed Style XP, you'll
 need to do some systematic troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
If the computer is completely virus/malware-free, manage your startup to find the culprit.<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />

<p>I'm sorry, TeeKay, but I must ask you to do as I suggested:&nbsp;<span><em>click on the error message to select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it into the text entry box.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I see time and again that users transcribe error messages instead of copying and pasting them; in most cases, this introduces typos that make it impossible to interpret the error message properly. Accuracy is vital; a little misplaced comma
 or space can make the difference between success and failure. Copy and paste ensures this essential accuracy.</span></p>

<p>Thank you very much. The second post is a copy and paste from the error message I got when I opened WLM, the other one I got if I wanted to open any folder or message, it came in a rectangular box. I could never do copy on those error messages I wish I knew
 how.</p>
<p>Let me just update you , as I stated earlier it was working fine till Dec 11 I didn't use this device for several days then those messages came, this morning I opened it and every thing looks in order (it seems that just by showing your kindness and goodwill
 to&nbsp;help other people things get&nbsp; fixed on their own).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another problem if you can be so kind and help me the version of WLM I have on this device&nbsp; is not the same as on my old one. first off when I put in the account info I did not have to put in information for the folders it synchronized automatically.
 My problem is I have in OUTLOOK 2 folders with the name "sent" one it recognizes as a sent folder, the other not.&nbsp; The emails I sent using WLM on my old device, went into the folder that's not recognized. &nbsp;I tried a long time ago to get someone to help me
 fix it , to no avail. I worked around this at first by using the "to" column in the header line for the list of messages . Then I realized I could move the emails I needed into the &nbsp;other sent folder, although cumbersome it worked.</p>
<p>Now on my new device WLM recognizes neither as a sent folder. The question is how can I get it to recognize the right sent folder as a sent item older ? (it put in my sent emails in the right folder in OUTLOOK ) If I can't, can I get WLM to display "to"
 in the header ? without this it's very hard for me to look for items sent to specific people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

<h3> dgjones13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update failure.  Error 0x800700c1</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing the following problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2017-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4020102) - Error 0x800700c1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is some windows functions don't work at all, such as the the Window button on the lower left corner is dead.&nbsp; Overall, everything is slow, I often get 'program is not responding messages' on internet use and in Office 365.&nbsp; If I wait long enough
 programs eventually respond but it may take 5-20 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Windows Update Troubleshooter.&nbsp; It runs through completion but doesn't help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Windows Safety Scanner and Avast Pro scanner which indicate that my system is virus free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, how can I fix this?</p>

            Go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

 You can also wait until Oct 17th when the new Fall Creators Update Version 1709 is released, install Media Creation tool to Upgrade Now which is the most stable method to change to the new version which you need anyway. Since it reinstalls Windows chances are it will repair the problem. If it doesn't you'll know that a program or setting conflict is the likely cause, since these are retained..

Media Creation Tool here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

If problems arise during Upgrade go over these steps which overcome most hurdles in Upgrades if you complete them all:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrad

            Hi

Please try the following solutions:

First lets delete all updates currently downloaded:

Go to This PC =&gt; Now open the C Drive =&gt; Go to Windows folder =&gt; Now find folder named Softwaredistribution =&gt;  open it =&gt; Open the folder called Download =&gt; now delete everything from there.

This should fix your issue. This solution deletes the corrupted updates and will stop this from happening. Now try to run the update services again.

If this did not help let try to manually download and install the update from here

www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=kb4020102

Please let me know if it helped or not and i will gladly assist further.

Kind Regards
Phillip Roos

Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 

net stop wuauserv 
net stop cryptSvc 
net stop bits 
net stop msiserver 
Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
net start wuauserv 
net start cryptSvc 
net start bits 
net start msiserver 

Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 

Hope this helps, Good luck!       
        </p>

<p>Thank you to all who responded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phillip, I tried this first.&nbsp; Deleted the files, followed the link to the manual download, downloaded the x64 update through the recommended method, but when the installer started up it returned the messsage 'the upgrade is not applicable to your computor'.&nbsp;
 So nothing happened.&nbsp; I know my system is 64 bit.&nbsp; I tried the x86 out of curiosity and got the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what?</p>

                    <p>So I bought a xbox one s today. &nbsp;Have had the Astro A50 Halo edition, used them in the previous xbox one. &nbsp;And continue to use them in pc. &nbsp;Now I go and hook them up on the xbox one s and they seem not to work. &nbsp;I have done all the updates, controller updates and firmware updates on the Astro's. &nbsp;Wondering if anyone else has had this problem. &nbsp;Thinking its probably the xbox and controller need a new update for them to be compatible. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>BSoD when playing UE4 Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e96as  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSoD when playing UE4 Games</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
recently I have noticed that while I am playing Unreal Engine 4 games, I sometimes get a BSoD.<br />
The latest one was QUOTA_UNDERFLOW (0x00000021), which blamed the Windows Kernel (so basically any driver?).<br />
<br />
The minidump file is this one: <a href="https://nofile.io/f/AUpYDhVpuWs/061218-10156-01.dmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://nofile.io/f/AUpYDhVpuWs/061218-10156-01.dmp</a><br />
<br />
This is not the only BSoD that I have encountered so far, but it is the first one I noticed after I reinstalled Windows (Windows 10 Enterprise 1803).<br />
<br />
My system specs are:<br />
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 @ 3.6GHz, 1.256v<br />
Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix B350-i<br />
RAM: G.Skill Trident Z 3200MHz CL14 (passed MemTest live usb)<br />
GPU: Sapphire Pulse RX 580 (stock)<br />
PSU: Corsair SF450<br />
SSD: Crucial MX300 525GB (latest firmware: M0CR060)<br />
<br />
What I did so far to try troubleshooting my system:<br />
- Replaced motherboard and RAM (did this after I was BSoDing continuously - also when idling/trying to boot - and was stuck in boot loops due to KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED)</p>
<p>- Reinstalled Windows multiple times (both Restart and fresh install)<br />
- Tried multiple GPU driver versions (always uninstalled with DDU in safe mode)<br />
- Ran MemTest86 via bootable USB without errors (4 passes, I had to turn the PC off after those as I couldn't sleep. It's an ITX system and it makes a whole lot of noise during summer - it does NOT overheat)<br />
- Reseat GPU<br />
<br />
What I did since the previous BlueScreen (might have fixed it, but I highly doubt it):<br />
- Underclocked my GPU from 1366MHz to 1306MHz, upped the power limit to +30%, left voltage on Auto<br />
- Updated SSD firmware to the latest version<br />
</p>
<p>All my drivers (chipset included) are up to date:</p>
<p>- GPU Drivers: 18.5.2</p>
<p>- Chipset Drivers: <span>18.10.0601 (I have noticed that the chipset driver shown on the motherboard page is an earlier version from May</span><span>, should I install those? The ones I have were released on June 7th and I downloaded them off AMD website)</span></p>
<p><span>- Audio Drivers: </span><span>6.0.1.8382 (Realtek)</span></p>
<p><span>- LAN Drivers: </span><span>22.9.16.0 (Intel)</span></p>
<p>Does anyone know how can I fix this? The BSoDs are now happening weekly (daily when I decided to RMA motherboard+RAM).

</p><blockquote>Does this happen only while playing UE4 games? The crash dumps do not provide much help.
</blockquote>
<p>Most of them yes.</p>
<p>However, before I decided to RMA the motherboard and RAM the BSoDs happened also on boot or playing games with other engines. BSoDs I have seen include MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, and a few others I don't remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous kit of RAM seemed fine on Memtest86 but after so many BSoDs related to it I decided to RMA both the motherboard and the RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the motherboard 3 times already by the way (and the RAM once) - this is the first motherboard I am using with a B350 chipset instead of a X370.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what it could be in my opinion:</p>
<p>- Faulty GPU (but I have never seen any artifacts)</p>
<p>- Faulty CPU (very unlikely, plus I think I would see more problems than this, especially when running CPU intensive tasks like Handbrake)</p>
<p>- Faulty PSU (I am not sure? The SF series by Corsair is a really high quality one)</p>
<p>- Bad AMD drivers (cannot do much about it, but I don't see many people whose PC's are powered by AMD having similar issues to mine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can provide you with anything let me know. I have just updated the BIOS to its latest revision today as well (no BSoDs yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: Thanks for trying to help out. I know the dumps do not say much, and I usually manage to solve stuff by myself, but this time the solution is eluding me, so I am at a loss. Thanks again!

            No Problems. I would have also suggested a BIOS update next, so if that happens again we would see other options.

    <title>Cannot hear or speak in game chat on Destiny with the Xbox one basic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maddoxx75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot hear or speak in game chat on Destiny with the Xbox one basic headset</h2>
                    
<p>Ok first off Destiny is the only game I own so far that I really need to chat on while doing the Crucible multiplayer, so don't know if this is strickly a problem I am having with Destiny or if this is an overall problem with the Xbox one itself. I have
 looked up online and tried several things to try and make this work. None of my friends yet have an xbox one so not sure if I can even chat in party chat. I have tested my connection and everything is good and Nat is open. I have updated my controllers with
 the headset attached. I have tried the in game switching between party and in game chat. So far nothing is working. When I do join a crucible match the speaker symbol is by my name and when I talk it moves like I am speaking. There are no speaker icons next
 to any other names on my team. So I don't know if they can hear me or not obviously since I can't hear if they are responding. I do have a wired Turtle Beach headset. I just haven't gone to buy the adapter to use it. It may not work either. I'm at a loss folks.
 Please help! Thanks in advance.</p>
