<h2>            The action can&#39;t be completed because the file is open in COM Surrogate.</h2>
                    <p>The file is NOT open anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I apply changes to multiple mp3 files simultaneously, after making changes to the album name in 'properties'?</p>
<p>I click the 'Apply' button to OK the changes, and get a box pop-up with the messages:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>'The action can't be completed because the file is open in COM Surrogate'</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>'Close the file and try again' (See image below).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since the&nbsp;upgrade to Windows 10 and the recent automatic update, I can only make this property change to single files at a time, not multiple files like I used to be able to do in Windows 8.</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;no other programs open or using the file (that I am aware of)&nbsp;while trying to make this change in the properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is 'COM Surrogate'?</p>
<p>Why has it got my file open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance if you can help.</p>

            <p>Same thing happens when trying to remove properties from images (e.g. jpg).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night&nbsp;I&nbsp;spent&nbsp;a night behind my PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a clean install of 10240 ISO and I could remove properties from images :-)</p>
<p>Let the PC upgrade to 10586 through Windows Update and the problem was back :-(</p>
<p>Did a clean install of 10586 ISO and the problem was immediately there :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the above tests were done immediately after installing Windows 10, i.e.&nbsp;no antivirus,&nbsp;nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess we will have to wait for a fix from MSFT.</p>

            <p>Hello fellow frustrated WIN10 upgraders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far everything I've read from MS is the usual subterfuge.&nbsp; This is CLEARLY a WIN10 upgrade issue but all we get is the usual casting of the issue into 'something you did' and a few suggestions to try adjusting greyed-out options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a solution that I guarantee will work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Copy the files that you want to manipulate to a Linux system.</p>
<p>2. Remove the personal information there using something like EXIFtool and proceed to share your clean files as you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually yes, there is a MS-based solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not on&nbsp;one leave things hanging, I tried installing EXIFtool on my WIN10 system and it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to simply remove all EXIF data you can place an exiftool instance on your desktop, modifying the filename with the options "(-all=)".&nbsp; You can then drag and drop a file onto this desktop icon and voila, no EXIF data!</p>

    <title>Why were basic controls like saturation contrast and hue taken out of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stopjuststop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why were basic controls like saturation contrast and hue taken out of Photo for Windows 10 back in the 2016 update, and how then do we adjust these parameters&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is really frustrating for me because I have almost no need for all the filters and effects.&nbsp; It's alright if developers want to add this on, but WHY take away the most basic controls?</p>
<p>How now do i do basic adjustments like contrast and saturation?</p>
<p>Intelligent and creative humans who use computers might not always want pre-made effects.&nbsp; I personally think they're not that useful to be featured so prominently and and I would just want the option of being able to touch up my own photos in the most basic
 way.&nbsp; This was not an improvement, it has handicapped the functionality of my computer.</p>
<p>If I want to draw on my photos I can use MS Paint.</p>
<p>This and all the random changes every time there's a forced update makes me crazy.&nbsp; I don't want to have to learn how to use my computer over again every few months or year.</p>
<p>Please bring back user controllability.</p>

            Definitely do send Feedback to MS so they know what users in the real world want and need (not that they will listen, but it is worth trying).
<br />
<br />It seems like MS is redesigning Photos to be more of a video / slideshow tool rather than a still photo editor.   I took a look and there still is some contrast and saturation control in Photos. Look in "Adjust".   It is very basic, I don't know how it compares to the old controls. 
<br />
<br />There are other, better, free, photo editing tools to replace the "improved" &lt;sarcasm&gt; functionality in Windows, like GIMP and Paint.Net. 
<br />
<br />FEEDBACK HUB- SEND FEEDBACK TO MICROSOFT WITH THE FEEDBACK HUB APP &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;F&gt;
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402156...</a> 
<br />There are real MS staff and developers who monitor all submissions to the UserVoice forums whether you submit them through the Feedback Hub, or by using the Feedback command built in to some MS applications, like Office 2016, or by using the appropriate link directly
<br />
<br />NOTE: BEFORE entering your feedback, Especially when you have crash problems or driver problems where you are willing to share confirguration information from your sisytem, click on the link to “go to diagnostic and usage data settings”. This takes you to the settings dialog for “Feedback &amp; Diagnostics”.  This dialog allows you to specify “Basic” or “Full”. Pesonally I prefer basic most of the time. But when it is display or driver issues it would be a good idea to set it to “FULL”. 
<br />
<br />Note: there is a special check box for “problem with how text is displayed”
<br />
<br />Note: there is a special category for “Driver” issues
<br />
<br />Note: When you look at existing feedbacks there is a “Share” button near the top left side of the dialog to get a link to the suggestion. That button is NOT present when creating a new feedback.  You have to submit it, in the Feedback Hub home you have to click on “My Feedback” at the very top of the screen and select “All Categories” just below that.  Then click on your recently submitted suggestion. Now, you can see the “Share” button to get a link you can post back to the forum so other people can comment and vote on the suggestion.
<br />
<br />
<br />This next link is a wiki with a collection of MS UserVoice.com sites I’ve encountered (I’m sure there are more):
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-desktop/ms-suggestion-box-sites-at-usdervoicecom/7397119c-6d48-49e6-8d94-7bd0a50d214f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />In addition, when you post a suggestion / complaint to UserVoice, if you have reached there by being guided while asking a question in a forum, please post a link back to your suggestion in UserVoice in the original Quetion. That way other people who see your original question because they are looking for the same fix can easily find your suggestion, vote for it and add supporting comments.
<br />
<br />FEEDBACK FOR EDGE: CLICK ON “…” ICON FOR SETTINGS AND MORE THEN CLICK ON SEND FEEDBACK COMMAND

            Part of problem is, Windows 10 is a transitional desktop operating system. Its basically starting from scratch.
<br />
<br />Features and functionality previously found in apps like Windows Essential and Photo Gallery were part of the older WIN32 legacy programming interfaces. 
<br />
<br />The new photos app is built on the new Windows Runtime or UWP (Universal Windows Apps) model. So, its basically rebuilding everything. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, its taking time to add back missing features and functionality, but I believe its partly intentional to maybe encourage third party developers provide similar functionality. 
<br />
<br />The best you can do right now is to submit feedback if you don't see something you previously used in the older app. You can press Windows key + F to open the feedback app then submit you suggestions.

    <title>Blue line on computer monitor&#47;desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitty rickardo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue line on computer monitor&#47;desktop</h2>
                    When I switched on my computer this morning and clicked on the desktop a blue line appeared - something I have not seen before.&nbsp; If I click and drag I can then expand this blue line to form a box (I am sure there is a technical term for this, but I don't
 know it!)&nbsp; It doesn't seem to be doing any harm, but I would like to know what it is, where it has come from, what is it's purpose and how can I get rid of it?&nbsp; If it is relevant I am running Windows 7.

            <p>Your monitor needs to be replaced.&nbsp; It is either one of the very large cathode ray types or a very old flat screen with a fluorescent backlight.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find very nice ones for around $140.&nbsp; Go for a 23 or 24" one&nbsp; They have a different format.&nbsp; What
 is called 16x9.&nbsp; Yours is very likely a 4x3.&nbsp; That means the newer ones are lower but wider.&nbsp; The newer ones now have LEDs as their backlights and will hold up much better and draw about 1/4 the power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and run the drive tester software from your hard drive manufacturer which is Seagate.&nbsp; You can download from here.&nbsp; It is called Seatools for Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/seatools-win-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/seatools-win-master/</a>
</p>
<p>Run all three tests.&nbsp; The long one will take at least an hour and you should not use your computer for any other purpose while that is taking place.&nbsp; The reason for doing this is that hard drives don't last forever and yours is already 6 years old.&nbsp; If it
 is beginning to fail and you have not seen the signs yet, these tests will tell you that. On the other hand, if it passes these tests you will have the confidence of knowing it is in OK shape.&nbsp; The cost is nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another program you should run checks the integrity of the data on your hard drive and is a worthwhile test to run.&nbsp; This one fixes things that if finds wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will take more than an hour to run.&nbsp; To run it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start globe</li><li>All programs</li><li>Accessories</li><li>RIGHT-click on command prompt and choose Run as administrator</li><li>Type the following into the black window that opens</li><li><strong>chkdsk c: /r</strong>&nbsp; type exactly as you see it including spaces</li><li>Type <strong>Y</strong> for yes to accept running it on restart</li><li>Type <strong>exit</strong></li><li>Restart your computer</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You have the best antivirus product there is.&nbsp; You picked the right one.&nbsp; Stick with it.&nbsp; You may be able to better it by buying the regular version.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I am saying this because it is the antivirus product and NOT the security product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Internet service is very slow.&nbsp; Likely a typical telephone company type service.&nbsp; FYI, cable systems are capable of delivering far better service, but not necessarily at the same price.&nbsp; But if you have cable service, it would be worth a query to them
 to find out.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Good morning Canadian Tech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have left it until this morning, when&nbsp;I have a little more time to go through your suggestions, and have been into the Seagate website and&nbsp;started to read the User Guide.&nbsp; It all seems a bit complicated to be doing in a free hour
 or so and I have decided to go back to that later.&nbsp; In the meantime I followed your instructions to check the integrity of the data.&nbsp; I have done everything you said and restarted my computer.&nbsp; There is nothing to indicate that anything is happening - hence
 I am emailing you!&nbsp; Should there not be something to indicate that a program is working etc?&nbsp; As you can no doubt guess I am not at all computer literate and need an idiots guide!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this didn't work AT ALL, and now I've basically stuffed my computer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried the repair, and that ran for over an hour. My computer basically cracked it with that program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to remove this mess, by doing&nbsp;a system restore to a previous date (Jan 26).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no microsoft outlook (message: it cannot initialize Microsoft shared utilities)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no microsoft word (message: there is not enough memory or disk space to run word)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no microsoft excel&nbsp; (message: there is not enough memory or disk space to run excel)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have over 80% of disk space available on my PC, and don't know what to do to fix this mess :(</p>

            <p>Corrupted files can cause "not enough memory or disk space" reports.&nbsp;What happens is that handling the file goes in circles. It keeps repeating &nbsp;one procedure tying ever increasing amounts of memory until the memory is exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult to be sure how get back to where you were. The original problem could be the result of a failing hard drive. The existence of bad sectors on the drive can lead to corrupted files and these can be important system files or unimportant data
 files. You could spend an unlimited amount of time and still not get a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The practical solution will be to restore to factory settings or to reinstall windows and program files. The first task is to recover all important data files and put them on external media. When you have completed this task you need to determine whether
 there are obvious problems with your hard drive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please paste a copy of a chkdsk report on your C partition here. Select Start, Run, type "cmd" without quotes in the box and press the ENTER key. Type chkdsk and press the ENTER key and a report, detailing amongst other things a summary of how the
 disk space is utilised, is provided. If you want a report on a partition or drive other than C you need to go to that partition. To access F, where F is the required partition you type F: and press the ENTER key.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Copying reports from a command prompt can be tricky. Right click and select Mark. This enables you to highlight selected text and click to copy. You then go to an open Word, Notepad or similar file, right click and paste. The selected text transfers
 from your clipboard to the open file. You can paste directly into a reply message to most forums.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not try to fix any problem revealed by the report using chkdsk as it could make the situation far worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have said earlier that your computer is a Dell. Is it a desktop or a laptop? What is the exact model? Was Windows 7 preinstalled when the computer was purchased or was it Vista?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your new situation I suggest you get rid of McAfee and install an alternative. You will have to remove every vestige of McAfee before installing an alternative.</p>

            The file tcpmon.ini is almost always flagged by sfc as a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a bug and not a real issue.
<br />
<br />
I don't like the look of that ICE ECC utility overall and what it claims to do is to make some kind of extra backup of your files, not to repair a pre-existing problem,&nbsp; I don't see how it was applicable in the first place except for a dubious recommendation
 I see in a Google search from a site that misstates the purpose of the file.<br />
<br />
I concur that a disk check is advisable.&nbsp; It appears that either that utility damaged your system or that there may be a hard drive problem.<br />
<br />
If the drive is OK, try an earlier System Restore point if possible. <br />
<br />
What was the problem with McAfee that led you to run sfc initially?<br />

    <title>Sleep Mode with no light blinking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> txz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sleep Mode with no light blinking</h2>
                    It is a brand new pc, a Toshiba P25W-C2300-4K. Among other things, the Windows sleep mode is working strangely, or inconsistently. It does go into sleep mode as set with power light blinking. However, if you leave it sleep for hours, the light &nbsp;stop blinking,
 then you have to press the power button to wake it. (I already set it such that any key stroke should wake it up). As usual, the computer manual does not say anything about this (and many other things) and I have searched up and down to find an answer but
 in vain. Why can't Microsoft make anything simple and consistent such as this. Older version of Windows did not have this problem of PC "playing dead" with no indication of being ON while in sleep mode.&nbsp;

<h2>            kannagi.net Touchkey on a Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I've just purchased a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 to do artwork on, but I didn't purchase the keyboard.</p>
<p>For most uses I figured I could use the onscreen keyboard, I't works just fine.</p>
<p>But all the art apps I've looked at require the use of hot keys, and I can't use the touchscreen keyboard without squeezing the menus off the screen.</p>
<p>I though I'd solved this problem when I found a small app... http://www.kannagi.net/touchkey, which displays a limited number of keys or key combination on the screen..</p>
<p>However, when I dowloaded and tried to install it, Windows 10 blocked it.</p>
<p>Does anyone now if there is a problem with this app, and if not, how can it be installed?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Ken</p>

<h2>            Enabling Windows ReadyBoost on a flash-based drive Tablet PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody, I have a 2 GB Tablet PC with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to increase its memory by using ReadyBoost. I can't. Let me explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, my Tablet PC and my micro SD card comply with all the requirements, but one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>32 GB free space (formatted in NTFS)</p>
<p>Data transfer of at least 3.5 Mb/s (it's a Category-10 device:&nbsp;45 MB/s)</p>
<p>My Tablet PC has USB 2.0 compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I also found that: </p>
<p>
</p><p>"In addition to the requirements listed in the previous answers, Windows will also disable ReadyBoost if your computer is already using a flash-based drive such as an SSD or eMMC drive. In these cases, ReadyBoost is unlikely to improve performance."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
 Doug E. Cook, insider on Microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any workaround, any way to enable Windows ReadyBoost on Windows 10 with a flash-based device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a lot of people are having the same problem, but I can't find someone who has already solved it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help. I really need to&nbsp;speed it up.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Cesar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your system has a flash-based drive such as an SSD hard disk in it, using ReadyBoost isn't necessary. You will receive the message, "ReadyBoost is not enabled on this computer, because the system disk is fast enough that ReadyBoost is unlikely to provide
 any additional benefit." This is because a system with an SSD hard disk, along with SuperFetch, can outperform ReadyBoost.</p>
<br />
If you feel that your device's performance will improve by enabling ReadyBoost, we request that you take a moment to send us your suggestions through the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong>&nbsp;which is readily available with Windows 10. You can find it through
<strong>Cortana</strong> or the <strong>Search bar</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you need further assistance, let us know.

    <title>Nether Warts and Nether Fortresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> president plum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nether Warts and Nether Fortresses</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, Cmonster789 here, I seem to be having trouble finding Nether Warts in the Nether (duh). I have found a Nether Fortress, and apparently Nether Warts are supposed to found near the staircases in fortresses, but they aren't there. It seems though
 that there is more Nether Brick under the floor of the fortress, is there more underneath? Am I supposed to dig around to find them? Is anybody else having these problems? If you guys could help that would be great!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>-Cmonster789</p>

<p>Based on what I've seen on various other forums and in my own maps, &nbsp;I don't think that everything in the latest update is working 100% just yet. I would venture 4J is going to push either a bug fix before the next update, otherwise we're SOL on a few things
 until January sometime.</p>
<p>As for finding Nether forts, sometimes they'll be buried under netherrack completely. I've had good results looking near soul sand before on both PC and 360 versions. Also, as with villagers, if your map is from before the last update you won't get a nether
 fort in that world.</p>

<p>With the size of the nether you may or may not get a fortress with nether wart or blazes. I started a new world for testing and went to the nether to check it out. Found a fortress but a good portion of it was cut off because of the bedrock walls. Searched
 the entire thing and found no wart and no blaze spawner. I did find where the blaze spawner was suppose to be but the bedrock wall cut off the fortress right where the spawner was suppose to be. Good thing you can use creative mode to get stuff your world
 doesn't have.</p>

<p>If you are unsure as to whether or not you have a nether fortress you can make a new save with the same seed number and go in creative to see if you have one or not. &nbsp;It sucks cause my wife and I are on one that we named "Capital Wasteland" (beautiful map
 with valleys and mountains, lots of iron, animal life, and forests) &nbsp;been searching the nether for a couple hours last night before making another world with the same seed number in creative (same village buildings as ours) and searched the nether to no avail.</p>

<p>I kind of did the opposite. The test world I started tuned out to be pretty cool so I'm thinking og starting a 2nd world wit hthat seed. Found a nice size village with a huge cave system underneath a ravine close by. In the ravine I ended up finding 2 cave
 spider spawners close together, right in the open, &nbsp;so I can make a dual spawner trap. The only thing I don't like about the world, though, is the nether fortress is all messed up so I have no blaze spawners or nether wart. Guess I can keep searching through
 seeds I guess.</p>

            This just happened to me overnight.&nbsp; I've had Weatherbug installed for years, and now your update makes it not work.&nbsp; Fix your problem, and stop shoving it off on Weatherbug.&nbsp; I spent over 35 years in IT, and if you introduce a change so that existing
 applications don't work, it's your problem, no matter if you're Microsoft or Weatherbug.&nbsp; Shame on you for bugging out on your responsibility.<br />

            <p>Thank you very much,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had found solutions for other graphics cards.&nbsp; I had already&nbsp;found&nbsp;the 13.4 Beta Driver, and it&nbsp;looked promising (it made reference to legacy support, which is what some drivers can be modified to do in notepad).&nbsp; I installed it, but it didn't work.&nbsp; I
 followed your tip to "pick a driver"/"have disk"&nbsp;and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add that I had to search for the W86a_inf folder, I found it here: C:\AMD\AMD_Catalyst_13.4_Legacy_Beta_Vista_Win7_Win8\Packages\Drivers\Display\W86A_INF</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I had three INF files in that location, I used the one with that started with CH.&nbsp; The others started with only a C followed by numbers.&nbsp; This was a wild guess and it worked for a Lego CAD program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried any of my other CAD programs yet, and I will try them soon&nbsp;and update if they are sick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I did not install Catalyst 13.4 Beta, just the Beta&nbsp;Driver.&nbsp; I've had some issues in the past with Catalyst Control Center and I didn't want to go there again.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's probably fine, I'm just paranoid because ditching&nbsp;it fixed a problem I had been beating
 my head&nbsp;on for&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ATI 4800 HD, If you have&nbsp;ATI card of similar&nbsp;series consider this solution.</p>

<br />2015 09 28- Microsoft Snip – a new way to get screen shots

<br />TEXTIFY – CAPTURE TEXT FROM ALMOST ANY DIALOG BOX
<br /><a href="http://rammichael.com/textify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rammichael.com/textify</a> 
<br />.
<br />Have you ever wanted to copy some text from a dialog box which doesn’t provide such functionality?
<br />.
<br />Textify was created to solve this problem: you can point your mouse over the text, click on the mouse shortcut (Shift + Middle click by default), and get a selectable view of the text.
<br />.
<br />You just put the mouse pointer on the desired line and hit the keyboard shortcut (ie I tweaked it to be &lt;left mouse&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;
<br />For example, in Programs and Features I can capture this about Office 2010: 
<br />.
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010
<br />Publisher: Microsoft Corporation, Installed On: ‎2017-‎03-‎18, Size: 49.8 MB, Version: 14.0.7015.1000
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />.
<br />Unfortunately this is the initial install version information, but by going to Word 2010 File menu &gt; Help command I could capture the current info:
<br />.
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Version: 14.0.7177.5000 (32-bit)
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />.
<br />Playing around I’ve found it seems to be able to capture a line of displayed text almost anywhere in many applications, ie in many dialog boxes I was able to capture the setting name and its value
<br />.
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Distance:
<br />0 pt
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />.
<br />Which I would tweak for documentation and sharing to be
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Distance: 0 pt
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />.
<br />Note: in the comments of the Textify web page there is a tweak to allow it to automatically select and copy the text.  In the Textify.ini change the line “auto_copy_selection=” to have value “1”. The change will take effect after you stop and restart Textify.

For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

<p>To be honest with you 1gb RAM is really low for a Win10 setup. It is a resource hog compared to other OS's including older Win OS's. I have a laptop with 4gb RAM and I find it a bit slow these days. Just sitting at the desktop&nbsp;with no programs or apps running
 (other than the windows processes) I am using 56% of available RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That number will bounce around some depending on what needs to be happening&nbsp;in the background. Robn's&nbsp;advice is sound but you are going to be very limited by the amount&nbsp;of RAM available. If you are able to add more that would help, but it will depend on
 your particular computer.</p>

            Hi  Ishwinder, the problem is your system does not meet the minimum specs for Windows 10
<br />
<br />You would need a minimum of 2GB of RAM for the 32bit version and 4GB of RAM for the 64bit version
<br />
<br />Have a look on the net and get another stick of RAM and Windows 10 will then work better for you

<h2>            BSOD shortly after startup, works normally after restarting</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>For some time now i've gotten several bsod after startup that seems to be related to either memory or drivers like</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>KERNEL_APC_PENDING_DURING_EXIT</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>with system service exception and driver irql not less or equal being the most common ones. It seems to always happen after 5-10 minutes regardless of current activity (even on the log in screen). however when i restart the machine it works fine again and
 i can use it for as long as i like until i turn it off for a few hours (it must be off for a few hours for the bsod to reappear for some reason), then it's back to the bsod after startup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i've run sfc and chkdsk several times and they report no problems, i've also tried memtest and taking out RAM one by one without luck. Even tried resetting the whole machine and using a fresh windows install but the issue is still there. Bios is up to date,
 windows is up to date and device manager and snappy driver installer says all other drivers are also up to date. Windows Defender and Malwarebytes isn't finding any virus or such either.</p>

            There was no definitive&nbsp;driver mentioned in the crash dump. As it takes a large number of dumps to find the actual cause, do you have some more minidumps so that I can help you better?

            The minidump was from the first BSOD after machine reset, after that it it freezes during the BSOD repair process forcing me to shut down the machine, I suspect this is why it hasn't created any new minidumps on subsequent BSOD's. I have no idea what's
 causing it to act that way so I'm not sure how to fix it.&nbsp;

            So after the kmode_exception_not_handled bsod this time the repair process identified ntfs.sys as what failed. the event viewer doesn't say anything about it though but i did see an error stating that dump file creation failed due to error during dump
 creation with the source being volmgr. And also several errors containing "Session "CldFltLog" failed to start with the following error: 0xC0000022" i'm not sure if that is relevant though. there is also several DistributedCOM errors but when i talked to support
 they said i could just ignore them?<br />

<h2>            Favorites bar missing after update in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days ago my laptop decided to perform an update during the middle of the day. I have Windows 10 version 1511. The update took 30 minutes or so which disabled me from using my laptop. After the update ALL of my Favorites on my Favorites Bar disappeared.
 I am absolutely PISSED!! I now have to reestablish all of my favorites, not an easy task! Microsoft needs to fix this issue before they arbitrarily decide to do updates.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better I would like to ask&nbsp;if</span><span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;favorites bar has disappeared from&nbsp;a particular browser or all the browsers?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a System restore by following the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the login screen, hold the “Shift” key and click on <strong>power icon</strong> and click on
<strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>Click on Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options.</li><li>Click on <strong>System Restore</strong> and follow the prompts to restore the system.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring. During
 System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss of important
 files as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information is helpful. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Gawlfcondor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you have been able to find a fix for this issue. I too am having the same issue with the favorites bar missing. Strange thing though the problem only seems to be with ie11 after recent updates and is missing across all my connected PC's.
 But on the Edge browser the favorites bar is still there and working.</p>

<h2>            How can i force delete a file in windows pls &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way i can force delete a file in windows ? my file can't be deleted, bacause it's locked by my app. Yes i can exit/restart my app but I don't want to restart my app every single time this is happening because it really waste my time, to restart
 my app , i tooks 15 seconds , so each restart process will waste my 15 seconds. I want to be able to unlock it manually or force disconnect the file to the app. How can i do this ? i tried 'del /f' using admin previleges but it's not working. I tried also
 third party app like 'unlock it' but not always works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea ? this thing starts to make me crazy.</p>

</blockquote>
Yes, if i close the app, i can delete the file. But i don't wan't to every single time to restart my app just to delete this file, it will take too much time. The app is Nuke studio , it's a compositing app , something like after effect. I need to do a lot
 of render when working on a project . Sometime the file can't be render because the file is exist already or locked, i have to quit app ... delete file ... restart app ... try to re-render ...done... and if this happen later i have to do the same stupid process
 again and again. It never happen in osx/mac. I've been asked this problem in nuke forum and most of the response point me to the windows permission system. Ok, let say i don't care about that system issue, now i just want to be able to do just some dirty works
 by manually delete that render file before i render. But there's no way i can force delete while the file is used or locked by app. The only way is to close the app first. There should be a way ( in administrative/root level) where i can force the system to
 disconnect the file to the app itself so i can delete the file. Any solution ?

    <title>Are files encrypted by default in any way&#63; &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rb_ebm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are files encrypted by default in any way&#63; &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question about the default encryption of files. I read that starting with 8.1 all files in Windows have some encryption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently wrecked a Windows 8.1 laptop (spilled wine on keyboard) laptop and removed the hard drive to an external enclosure to try to recover files. When I plugged the enclosure into another of my laptops and tried to look at files in my "User" directory,
 Explorer initially indicated that my user folders were empty. However when I double clicked on them, I got a dialog about recovering/looking at my files (can't remember exactly what it said). When I accepted this, all my files were indeed recovered (process
 took a couple of minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At no point was I asked to provide the user or account password to get/recover all my files. Is this because the external enclosure was plugged into another laptop which was also logged into my Windows live account? I'm hoping that if someone else took my
 hard drive and put it into an external enclosure, that they could not just see all my files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I mistaken, or is there something more I need to do to have some default encryption of files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, RB</p>

            It depends more on your hardware. &nbsp;Windows RT tablets encrypted by default, while 32-bit processor tabs didn't. &nbsp;I'd say to be completely positive that it's set how you like, you can type "bitlocker" into your search box and turn on encryption yourself
 directly.

            This problem can be caused by software such as a bad driver or hardware (bad RAM).
<br />Fix Windows 10 error Page Fault In Nonpaged Area
<br />If your error is typical, it will result in random BSOD crashes but between crashes, the computer will be usable. Let us use those moments to troubleshoot. First check the hard drive for errors.
<br />
<br />1.	Open a CMD window as an administrator.
<br />2.	Type or paste ‘chkdsk /f /r’ and hit Enter.
<br />3.	Allow the process to complete.
<br />
<br />Then perform a system file check.
<br />
<br />1.	Open a CMD window as an administrator.
<br />2.	Type or paste ‘sfc /scannow’ and hit Enter.
<br />3.	Allow the process to complete.
<br />
<br />It might also be useful to check Windows updates and drivers as they are often the cause of Page Fault In Nonpaged Area errors.
<br />
<br />1.	Navigate to Settings, Update &amp; security.
<br />2.	Click ‘Check for updates’ in the Windows update tab.
<br />3.	Allow the process to complete.
<br />4.	Navigate to Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Device Manager.
<br />5.	Select hardware, right click and ‘Update Driver Software’. Make sure you check graphics and audio drivers as well as any third party webcam, printer and other drivers.
<br />6.	Reboot and retest.
<br />
<br />If the BSOD still occurs, let us check the Windows page file.
<br />
<br />1.	Right click ‘This PC’ in Windows Explorer and select Properties.
<br />2.	Click ‘Advanced system settings’.
<br />3.	In the Advanced tab click Settings in the Performance box.
<br />4.	Click Change in the Virtual memory box and uncheck ‘Automatically manage paging files for all drives’.
<br />5.	Set a custom size for the page file.
<br />6.	Click Ok.
<br />7.	Reboot.

<br />Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues.

<br />==================================================
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics 
<br />at top of list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory

    <title>Lock screen keeps reverting to facebook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lock screen keeps reverting to facebook</h2>
                    When I first got my Surface pro 3 a few years ago, I linked it through the Facebook app then immediately unlinked it because I didn't like having them linked. Since then my lock screen occasionally reverts back to my profile picture and cover image from
 the time. In lock screen settings it is set to windows spotlight but it still occasionally shows the facebook ones from a few years ago. Any ideas?

            There might be some legacy images being stored on your PC . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer and navigate to (Replace Username): 
<br />C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets
<br />
<br />Delete the contents of that folder!
<br />
<br />
<br />Then navigate to (Replace Username): 
<br />C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\AccountPictures 
<br />There you can delete old pictures you have used . . . 
<br />
<br />NOTE: to access these folders in Windows File Explorer, you will need to check 'Hidden Items' box on the View Ribbon

            Lizze, this is really strange . . .
<br />
<br />If you open the Settings App
<br />Go to Accounts - Sync your Settings
<br />Is 'Sync Settings' and 'Theme' turned on
<br />If so, turn them off
<br />Set a new Lockscreen Image and Restart your PC

            It's been doing it so long and it never bothered me but now it's a picture of my ex occasionally when I start my laptop which is a bit annoying!&nbsp;I followed https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-windows-spotlight-stuck-same-image-windows-10 to get the
 spotlight images back and will also turned off the syncing so fingers crossed it now won't do it again! I will see what happens as it doesn't happen on every start up. Thank you for your help!
