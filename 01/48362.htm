    <title>New MS Tool to repair problems with Anniversary Update available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New MS Tool to repair problems with Anniversary Update available</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Immediately after the W 10 Anniversary update, as many of you have experienced, things started to 'freeze' that had never frozen before. It began with any NOTIFICATION freezing in the bottom right of the clipboard and whatever page I was on that was behind
 the Notification would also freeze.&nbsp; The only way to get things unfrozen was to reboot each time.&nbsp; I called Surface Tech Support and was fortunate to get a fellow in the Redmond, WA support center.&nbsp; He said this was a "known issue" and that MS had created
 a Tool to fix the issues but that it was testing this Tool so it has not yet been released as part of the new System Update.&nbsp; It worked for me but with a few issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, here is the official web address to go to.&nbsp; NOTE that there is NO '.com' after the address:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://aka.ms/windowsselfhealing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the prompts and it will run through a series of checks and fixes then ask you to Reboot.&nbsp; It may ask you to confirm the time zone you are in.&nbsp; Then, if it has installed correctly and fixed corruption and missing files, it will ask (like it did for
 me) to check the option to perform a new&nbsp; System Update.&nbsp; I did that and rebooted two times.&nbsp; HOWEVER, after performing these actions which took about 40 minutes on my 512 Surface Book, the MS Tech had me go to the Troubleshooter and run, as Advanced/Administrator,
 the Troubleshoot problems with Windows Update.&nbsp; It came back that there were still missing or corrupt Registry Files and I was directed to choose the option to APPLY FIX.&nbsp; I did that and all the freezing has stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER... There is a new issue that I believe is a result of this Selfhealing patch.&nbsp; There is now random FLASHING of the screen - the same kind of flash you see when you reload the entire OS either via Recover from the cloud or using a USB stick recovery
 image.&nbsp; The flash I describe shows the rectangle box that you see in an instant when you reload the OS.&nbsp; MS is aware of this.&nbsp; This had never happened before (random flashing like it is reloading the OS) until I applied the Selfhealing patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Flashing is happening less today but it happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still think applying this process is worth it because all the freezing has stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SRX case remains open and Tech Support is following up with me tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually had a flashing issue when I was using windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I booted up to the windows 10 login screen &amp; almost every time I clicked on the start button my computer flickered.&nbsp; That why I went back to windows 7 sp1. &nbsp; The anniversary update
 made the flicking worse.&nbsp; Never flickered in windows 7 sp1 or even in a Linux systems.&nbsp; I dual boot. &nbsp; Just for the recorded,&nbsp; I tried windows 10 by itself with no other operating systems installed and the flashing still happened.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am sorry that there is no way to take a screen shot it happens randomly and in a split second not humanly possible for me to catch it happening. &nbsp; But if you ever relaod Windows 10 that box with the white border appears as, I am told by MS, the Windows
 OS I flashed into the PC &nbsp; this same flash and rectangle box continues to happen since I installed the self healing Tool to correct issues with the Anniversary Update &nbsp; three days since I installed that Tool and the flashing with the box appearing I still
 happening Mark</p>

            Thank you for inform about the new tool.<br />
<br />
<em>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">shows the rectangle box that you see in an instant when you reload the OS.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MS is aware of this.</span></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>"<br />

</em>My machine is a desktop PC. After I upgraded (via from setup.exe) version 1607 (14393) from version 1511 (10586), this strange 'rectangle box' was begin to appear an instant when logon screen. I don't run&nbsp;</span><strong>WindowsSelfHealingTool</strong>.
 I know nothing about it! What does it mean? This is internal a issue.<br />
<br />
I would really analyse with Windows Performance Analyzer the issue. But I rollbacked version&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1511 (10586). Why? Not freeze issue. After I used a few days</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows'
 all XAML system is broken. </span>I tried to solve this matter so hard. Unfortunately, the "<em><strong>explorer.exe &gt; Class Not Registered</strong></em>" issues can't fix.&nbsp;I'd have tried anything for solution! (Note: I've been using PC since 1991; I learned
 BASIC and PASCAL programming languages&nbsp;at medium-level when DOS era. I even&nbsp;have a passion to IRQs, even Assembler. Those were the days!). Perpahs, need a clean-install but this method is&nbsp;toilsome (again re-install all softwares, personal customizations, etc).<br />
<br />
<strong>My final words</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>t</em></span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">o Windows' Core team:</span></em><br />
<br />
All you have been transform Win32-system to XAML/App system, step-by-step. I know why this need is Universal Windows Platform(PC-Mobile editions merge -&gt; Store -&gt; Bussiness ecosystem). You see this as a matter to life and death for company future. I understad
 why your turn a deaf ear to the "<em>Please, don't transform the win32 structure to XAML/App system. Don't convert all Control Panel to Settings app</em>, etc"&nbsp;like feedbacks of most user myself included.
<br />
<br />
We all know where this is heading: Windows 10 can't reach to Windows 7 usage level. My friendly advice to you: Modernizing Windows 7 or "<strong>Classic Edtion</strong>" like retro/special a SKU for Windows 10 without XAML/App system(without "Settings" etc.
 app, AppX services and Windows Shell Experience Host system). In this special SKU, users can be still install and run apps from Microsoft Store, only then the App/XAML system begin to works. In one respect, re-moderinized a Windows 7 which it manually install
 &amp; run AppX-XAML apps.

            Thank you for the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a hunch what some of the flashing could be.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it maybe related to Microsoft Windows Defender working in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program is not totally hidden when working in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have not tested
 this theory out.

            PureOcean&nbsp; if you try the upgrade again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try a free virus program that turns off windows defender &amp; see if you still have the flashing issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the flashing issue since 1511.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was so minute that some people wouldn't notice it.&nbsp; Me,&nbsp; I notice
 stuff like that-my eyes are more sensitive. &nbsp; However, the flashing got worse with the anniversary&nbsp; update.&nbsp;

            <p>@<strong>groze952:</strong><br />
<br />
Thanks you for your reply. Yes, I&nbsp;thinking try the upgrade agin, but&nbsp;not just yet. Microsoft releases one after another new cumculative updates for 1607. I waiting that 1607's fixing after new updates...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, speaking of logon screen, there is another a issue.<br />
After Windows 10 upgraded to 10586 from <strong>Build 10240</strong>, the&nbsp;spinning circle begin to one more displays on the eve of logon screen. Boot sequence: Windows 8/10 logo and above spinning circle -&gt; Black Screen (1-2 seconds) -&gt; again spinning circle
 (1-2 seconds) -&gt; logon screen. This issue didn't exist in Build 10240. It's began in 10586. I thought&nbsp;that MicroSoft' aware the minor issue and in Redstone 1 builds might be fixed. I upgraded to 14393. No change. The issue still happening. Solution: MSCONFIG
 -&gt; Boot Tab: select to "<strong>No GUI Boot</strong>". So, the spinning circle animation no longer displays and without instanly black screen directly opens logon screen.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
A littele advice to <strong>webmasters of Windows web-pages</strong> in Microsoft.com.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
May prepare special (not KB!) the one page including Windows 10 troubleshooter &amp; tools. In this page, can be list all offically Troubleshooter &amp; Repair utiliy, tools for Windows 10 by Microsoft created. All tools can be merged&nbsp;under a single the page. For example.<br />

            <p>UPDATE to my installing the Windows 10 Self Healing Tool:&nbsp; Yesterday MS Tech Support in Redmond, WA called me back and because I was having the screen flashing issues only after the Tool was installed, he had me first:</p>
<p>1) Run the Advanced Troubleshooter. It returned results of missing and corrupt files/registry files.&nbsp; I applied the FIX and re ran the process and all came back fixed and perfect.</p>
<p>2) Tech had me re install the Self Healing Tool.&nbsp; It ran through it's process on my 512 Surface Book in about 25 minutes.&nbsp; I re booted and then it asked me to choose UPDATE in the Self Healing Tool window.&nbsp; I did that.&nbsp; I rebooted two times.</p>
<p>3) Tech had me run Command Prompt (Admin):&nbsp; sfc /scannow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That process came back with no integrity violations.</p>
<p>4) Over the last 24 hours their has been NO screen flashing at all, no freezing of Notifications or websites.&nbsp; No errors of any kind.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;I did find that I hade to turn BLUETOOTH back on and reconnect the Pen.&nbsp; For some reason after the above processes, Bluetooth and pen connection needed to be re activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tech Support suggested that the first two times they had me (on different days) install the Self Healing Tool, that there were already corrupt and or missing registry files that resulted after the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.&nbsp; So the conclusion or suggestion
 they gave me that I performed was to first run the Advanced Troubleshooter as noted above and allow the repair FIX in that program and THEN run and install the Self Healing Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am HAPPY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Zune Software Login Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diego kant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune Software Login Error</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello To All The Community,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well Since I Wasn't known about the Existence of any Zune Device, Happens that soon I'll be ordering a Zune HD Black 16GB from Amazon (as sadly it is discontinued by Microsoft) :/</p>
<p>but that's not the problem, as the tittle suggests, I had to download the Zune Software (which I used to use before to play music) in order to use my Zune HD, but the problem is when I want to sign in to my Windows Live Account from Zune (which just worked
 before fine), says my Password/email are incorrect, while they've been the same for all my services, Works on my Xbox, works on my Windows 10 PC,on my Surface,&nbsp;on my Windows Phone, it even works on old-related Windows Live Services like Halo 2 for Windows
 Vista, curiously it doesn't work as well on the Games for Windows Marketplace, which I know is discontinued as well but with me stills works (says can't sign in, but doesn't matter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Main problem here is with Zune, which says My Password/email are Incorrect, I've checked Caps, Numbers, Letters, my Email letter by letter, everything matches my Live Account, Sometimes it just says "Can't sign in now, please try later", then later "that's
 not a valid&nbsp;password/email combo. Please make sure Caps are turned off and you enter your full email."</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3425fb0-d358-4990-a60a-c043981d4198" height="259" width="326" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Note, that's not my email, is the example, but it uses Outlook&nbsp;;)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p>I'd like to know if I have had something wrong in the installation as due to Windows 10 Mobile Preview, my Mobile hotspot is in the ruins (slow as hell), and downloading 270MB of the Zune Software may had something to say,</p>
<p>Or if it's just an issue of the server, or if it is fixable I'd like to know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway to whoever takes the time to read this, Hope someone can help me :D.</p>

            <p><strong>Hi Eeshwar,</strong></p>
<p><em>Thanks for Answering!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, My Outlook account works just fine in all my Devices, works as well on the Outlook.com website, was migrated from Hotmail to Outlook last year, and I checked the MD5 of my Zune Installation, which shows is it complete, so the Package itself shouldn't
 be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One Thing I might consider that would be the problem, I Have Tow-Step Verification for my account, and as I Know Zune was discontinued, is no longer supported or updated, so latest Microsoft Services which wasn't complemented to Zune, won't work the way
 they should, and since I use Tow-Step Verification,&nbsp; I don't know if Zune works with it,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Should I give a try to Sign In, without Tow-Step Verification? or Is may something else?
</strong>(Because I have no idea if Zune Supports Tow-Step Verification, so far I know Tow-Step Verification uses a Browser Window to access).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Already Uninstalled the Zune Package and Reinstalled, keeps the same issue going on.</p>

<h2>            Unauthorized changes to administrator restriction settings.</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>(OS = Home XP SP3, Internet through TDS via DSL, Security =McAfee total protection). Recently I have had connectivity issues with Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer but not with Fire Fox.&nbsp; Both browsers load up but can not access the Internet despite having
 a good strong connection. I get this error code for google, <span>
<span>"Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): Unknown erro</span></span>" and for
<span>"Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): Unknown erro</span></span>" and for
<strong><em>IE</em> </strong>I get "Internet Explorer cannot display the web page" I eliminated the problem being a server or web site issue and or a Fire wall security setting issue. In addition I ran several Virus scans and spy ware scans but no help.&nbsp; I
 Used many resources, Google, and&nbsp; self help Q/A forums on the NET and the reoccurring theme concerning a fix for my problem seems to be adjusting&nbsp; proxy and LAN settings for both browsers.&nbsp; Here's where it gets strange and is the reason I'm writing you, I,
 as the administrator&nbsp; am not able to make the adjustments to proxy settings because on the<strong><em>IE</em></strong>browser under tools the NET option has been locked out, the operation has been canceled, A box appears after I click NET options and it says
 "operation canceled due to restrictions set by administrator".&nbsp; So who made these changes?? I ask my self.&nbsp; Mal ware?? Virus?? Don't know but I do know that it has crossed over through, I assume, my virtual browser settings that follow me through Google Chrome/
 Tool bar. where ever I access the net. Not sure Why it has not affected Fire Fox browser?&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Google the NET option is accessible but the option for proxy settings does not work, will not open.&nbsp; Where there's a block to click on, and you can see where it does, nothing happens.</p>
<p>How can I reverse these settings and gain access to my settings again?</p>

    <title>Xbox One achievement problems prevent games from being completed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One achievement problems prevent games from being completed</h2>
                    
<p>I just managed to complete Sleeping Dogs but not without achievement issues and now I'm trying to complete Saints Row IV but the Don't Panic achievement is broken preventing the game from being completed. I looked into this to see if there was any solution
 but from what I've read there's not only no solution but they are not even going to bother to try and fix these issues. If you look in the forums they are just locking these posts likely to prevent massive feedback on how angry people are getting over this.
 Has long as the money keeps rolling in Microsoft just don't give a hoot! This game as been out for a year so there has been loads of time and not really any excuse for this behaviour. Achievements like this are story related so can't be missed so honestly
 how hard can it be to fix it? If your past that point the achievement should be there. This is where we stand, Microsoft want us to purchase games and their services which are not cheap but don't give a hoot that the games can't be completed. It might not
 seem to be your problem yet if you haven't switched to Xbox One but believe me when you do and realise the games you pay £50 for are not even completable and Saints Row is by far not the only one. You'll also notice there's no mods or reps on these posts they
 just get locked up with no solution. Be part of something special, come on Microsoft what's special about a broken system Of gameplay?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only game I've played so far where I got a few achievements that still haven't unlocked is on Halo MCC. It might have been fixed by now in recent updates but I haven't fired up the&nbsp;game in quite a while.</p>
<p>I have had other games where I got the achievement and it just said ... "Done, Unlocking" ... but they have always unlocked after a day or so. Sometimes I didn't even see them pop up but when I checked the list they were unlocked and my score had updated.</p>
<p>I remember on Destiny, some achievements didn't pop until you signed out of your profile and signed back in whilst the game was still running.</p>
<p>A good site to check ( if you haven't already ) is somewhere like ...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xboxachievements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xboxachievements.com</a></p>
<p>They often report bugged achievements with solutions on how to get them unlocked.</p>
<p>To be honest though these days achievements don't bother me either way, I would quite happy to play games without them but I'm not sure who's to blame when a game has buggy achievements, Microsoft or the games developer? not sure!</p>

<p>The "Don't Panic" achievement appears to be a regional issue. It's unlocked for plenty of people on TA so it's not broken and all the people having issues with it appear to be outside the US.</p>
<p>It doesn't appear to be a MS issue but rather the developers fault. I know there is a censored version of SR that was released in many countries and the process of censoring it may &nbsp;have been what broke the story line achievements.</p>

<p>I looked into the situation before I made the post. True achievements is where I went first. This is where I found out the problem was flagged but nothing was being done about it. People have tried just about everything to get this achievement to pop including
 changing region it just doesn't work. &nbsp;I encountered the done unlocking problem loads of times but if you look at this achievement it's not even flagged as being unlocked. I was hoping to get this game on my completion list after Saints Row 3 but it looks
 like that's not going to happen. At the end of the day it is Microsofts problem, they run the service, &nbsp;give licences to these company's and are suppose to maintain a standard of service. Gaming is suppose to be fun but since switching to Xbox One it's been
 a roller coaster of frustration and anger. Don't even get me started with the connection issues, I can stream from an app like Amazon Prime yet get disconnected every 30 or 40 seconds while playing Saints Row and get no connection issues on any other device
 including my 360. I'm surprised the streets are not littered with smashed ones. </p>

<p>Not having a go but you say gaming is about fun, ok achievements should unlock but surely it hasn't stopped you enjoying the game? Maybe it's just me where I don't really care about the achievement system either way.</p>
<p>Like Randver mentioned it doesn't appear to be a Microsoft issue but rather the developers.</p>
<p>I know when quite a few people had issues with Halo MCC achievements not unlocking, the developers said they were aware of the issue and were working to get them fixed, as I said I don't know if they ever did but it sounded here as well as if it was down
 to the developers not Microsoft. </p>
<p>Again, maybe it's because I don't really care for achievements, sure they are fun to get but don't make me enjoy games more or less if some are buggy.</p>

<p>Half the fun of gaming is competition, achievements and completion are a major part of gaming and competition when in a community. Who doesn't like to be at the top of the leaderboard in the game and in the points scored. It seems your missing the point.
 Would you be happy if you bought a TV and found only one channel worked, well obviously you would be because you can still watch TV. Why are people making excuses about this, it's expensive and broken.</p>

<p>Would I be happy if I bought a TV and found out only one channel worked? No I wouldn't but achievements are not as important to me as they are to others and I'm not bashing people for this, each to their own but I can still enjoy a game without achievements.</p>
<p>Who doesn't like to be at the top of the leaderboards in a game? Personally I'm not a competitive gamer, I play mainly for fun, to me gaming is not something I take seriously. Sure I like having a laugh online with my mates, challenging each other on games
 like Forza for example but again it's more about having a laugh or lets say some 'friendly competition' For me I can enjoy a game just as much if I'm bottom of the leaderboards, if by some miracle I was at the top I wouldn't enjoy the game anymore.</p>
<p>Again I appreciate we are all different but achievements, game completion is not and never will be for 'me' a major part of gaming so it's not a case of me making excuses about it, it's a case of not caring about it, maybe some would class that as an excuse?</p>
<p>Either way, I think whatever game it is havin g achievement issues you would probably do better contacting the developers themselves, not Microsoft.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>What's even more amusing concerning claims its a region issue and only outside the U.S. I've actually tried to change my region and timeZone to no avail and if you go to TrueAchievements solutions there are 2 solutions and one is put your Xbox on English
 and switch region to UK. It appears this is a fallacy being told on either side of the Atlantic US saying it's the UK and UK the U.S. &nbsp;Microsoft run Xbox live, the whole caboodle including which company's they give licences to. Of course if Microsoft cared
 they would "influence" these company's like Deep Silver to put broken things right but they don't because they are more interested in the cash from the next broken game. That's why I blame Microsoft because of that reason and from what I'm reading here they
 have washed their hands of it of the grounds they didn't make the game just the money.</p>

<p>@Lofty and @Owen achievements not unlocking falls squarely on Microsoft. They changed how achievements are handled. On the 360 it was a developer issue, on XB1 its on MS. At least thats what a support agent told me.</p>

<h2>            Image too big for screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Toshiba computer with windows 10 already on it.&nbsp;Two weeks old.</p>
<p>Over the days the screen image has gradually got bigger and bigger. No problems at start. But then after a few days&nbsp;I had to scroll up or down or left to right, because the image no longer fitted the screen. Now I can't delete my emails because&nbsp; the scroll
 bar can't be seen.</p>
<p>Can you help me please?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure I understand correctly, are you referring to the desktop background being enlarged?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Update display Driver</strong></p>
<p>An outdated or incompatible display driver could be causing the issue. If you recently upgraded to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, it's possible that the current driver was designed for a previous version of Windows. Check to see if an updated driver is available.</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>2. Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and press <strong>enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Expand display adapter.</strong></p>
<p>4. <strong>Right click </strong>on the driver and choose the option to "<strong><span>Search automatically for updated driver software</span></strong>." Follow the steps, then select
<span>Close</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Change display size</strong></p>
<p>1. Press<strong> Windows key + I</strong> to open settings.</p>
<p>2. Click "<strong>system</strong>".</p>
<p>3. Click "<strong>display</strong>" on the left pane.</p>
<p>4. Make sure the display slider is on the left hand side of the slider bar. (100 %)</p>
<p>5. Click "advanced display settings".</p>
<p>6. Try changing the resolution and save the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Change scaling</strong></p>
<p>1. Type "change text and other items larger or smaller" in the search bar and open it.</p>
<p>2. Under "change size of items", click "set a custom scaling level".</p>
<p>3. Change the % to 100% from the drop down list and save the changes.</p>
<p>4. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Display settings is at 100% on left of scale. This scale does not allow me to slide to a larger scale it just reverts back to 100%. The brightness scale operates OK it gives me a number above.</p>
<p>Set custom scaling level starts at 100% to 500% so does not allow to go lower.</p>
<p>Windows 10 was already on the laptop when I bought it. It was OK to start.</p>
<p>It is not just my email account. Any platform I go on&nbsp;it is the same, it has gradually got bigger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got my old laptop out. When I logged into my email account I discovered I have the same problem. If I go into other platforms I was using still the same problems on my old computer. It is not a computer problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that the issue occurs in both the computers. I would suggest you to attach a screenshot of the screen for us to better understand the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Uninstall Display Adapter driver</strong></p>
<p>Try uninstalling the display adapter driver, and then restart your computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Expand display adapter</p>
<p>4. Right click on the driver and uninstall it </p>
<p>5. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Clean Boot</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Have tried both methods but still have a problem. As you can see there is a right side scroll bar. On my charts the right scroll bar has disappeared. While taking this image to send I tried to enlarge the rectangle and suddenly the side bar disappeared just
 like on the charts. I can't get it back. Could it be the Adobe flash player causing the problem? I set up a new account the charts were OK until I went full screen. Then not only one chart changed but all the charts changed to having no right scroll.</p>

<h2>            My Skype ID and email are not searchable</h2>
                    I had an interview the other day, and the interviewer was not able to locate me using my email address by way of Skype search. I ended up having to search his email address and call him (not professional, in my opinion.) I have a second interview tomorrow
 with someone else and I want to make sure my Skype ID and/or email is searchable so he can call me. What do I need to do??

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you use your&nbsp;email address to set up an&nbsp;account? If so, they should be able to search you in Skype unless they're using a Skype&nbsp;for Business account which&nbsp;might be connected to a private network and has restrictions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, make sure you've updated your profile. Information you include in your Skype profile, such as your location, email, or phone number make it easier for&nbsp;them&nbsp;to find you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change some of your profile information using Skype for Windows desktop, Skype for Mac, or Skype for Linux, and the updates will be synchronized across all your devices. This option isn't currently available in our mobile versions.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your <strong>profile picture</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Click <strong>Show full profile.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Click each profile setting to change it to a different option, or delete the information if you don't want it to be visible in your profile.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck&nbsp;with your&nbsp;interview!</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/58d1bb0e-0d66-41b9-8489-ebffe1557dfe" title="WinstonRice">
<p>
</p><p>You can test your camera/video with the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the <strong>classic Skype (7.40), </strong>on <strong>Windows desktop</strong>: Select
<strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Video Settings</strong>. If you see video, your camera is working and ready to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, in <strong>Skype for Windows 10 (12.xx</strong>), click the ellipsis (<strong>three dots</strong>) beside the dial pad : Select
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; Click <strong>Test Video.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, with the <strong>new Skype (8.xx), </strong>click the ellipsis (<strong>three dots</strong>) beside the dial pad : Select
<strong>Audio and Video Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>

<h2>            How to enable Preview pane in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Viewing contents of a Notepad txt file in Windows Explorer - Windows 10 PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 used to automatically display the contents of a Notepad text file in Windows Explorer. The contents appeared in the right hand pane of Windows Explorer, when you highlight a filename in a directory listing. In a similar way, Windows Explorer in
 Windows 7 would also by default also&nbsp;automatically display&nbsp;jpg images and so on.</p>
<p>I can't see this functionality in Windows 10 (Home edition). How do I activate it?</p>

            <p>I do not use windows home, but the solution below should work. in fact, it's not really a functionality. you simply need to activate file preview in file explorer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>click in the<em> View</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; tab in file explorer and click on preview pane. it's all you need to do.</p>

            Hey sknatl,<br />
<br />
You’ve mentioned about getting error message while configuring XBOX. So what is that error message?<br />
<br />
Here are certain things to consider if your Xbox 360 won’t connect to your PC running Windows Media Center:<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using a wired connection, make sure that the Ethernet cable is plugged into the Ethernet port on the Extender.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Extender is connected to the network using a wireless connection: <br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure the Extender is within range of the wireless access point or router with as few obstructions as possible between the Extender and the access point.
<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure that both the computer and Extender are connected to the same router.<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your wireless network uses a security key, verify that you have the correct network security key for the type of wireless network security method that your network uses.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try re-starting the PC running Windows Media Center computer, the Extender, and your network hub, router, or switch.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure that you know the user name and password for an account that has administrative privileges on your PC running Windows Media Center. You must be able to provide this information when prompted for Extender Setup.
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using a fingerprint reader or another security program on your computer, you might need to change the program's settings before an Extender can be connected to the computer. If the security program does not include a setting that resolves connection
 issues, you'll need to uninstall the program to use an Extender.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have Windows Live OneCare installed on your computer, select the Connect my Xbox 360 or “Media Center Extender to my Media Center PC” check box in the Windows Live OneCare Firewall Connection Tool.
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure that your PC is not joined to a domain. If your computer is connected to a domain, remove the computer from the domain, and then go through Extender Setup again.<br />
<br />
You should be good to go from here.<br />

<p>Thanks Lawrence for your response. If Microsoft language packs does not contain the Burmese language then do Microsoft recommends/supports any 3rd party Burmese packs? if yes, please let us know the details.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I recently 'upgraded' to Windows 10. &nbsp;Since the upgrade, I haven't been able to wake the computer from sleep mode without shutting it down and restarting it. &nbsp;I have done the standard troubleshooting, tweaking of settings. &nbsp;Everything says that I should
 be able to: open the lid to my laptop, press a keyboard key or the power button to wake it from sleep. &nbsp;Nothing works. &nbsp;Or sometimes it will work for 2-3 days, then go back to the way it was. &nbsp;Please help!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently 'upgraded' to Windows 10. &nbsp;Since the upgrade, I haven't been able to wake the computer from sleep mode without shutting it down and restarting it. &nbsp;I have done the standard troubleshooting, tweaking of settings. &nbsp;Everything says that I should
 be able to: open the lid to my laptop, press a keyboard key or the power button to wake it from sleep. &nbsp;Nothing works. &nbsp;Or sometimes it will work for 2-3 days, then go back to the way it was. &nbsp;Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sheila</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I solved it .................</p>
<p>The fault is the sleep option fails and crashes your computer when woken up. You might discover the virus checker has also been disabled !<br />
You computer's power-key [in the start menu] needs a popup menu with ' Hibernate' 'Shut Down' and 'Restart'.<br />
<br />
1. Click starts &gt; settings &gt; system<br />
<br />
2. Left side menu click &gt; Power and Sleep.<br />
<br />
3. Scroll down click &gt; Additional Power Settings.<br />
<br />
4. Left menu. For each of these Click &gt; 'Choose what the power buttons do' and Click &gt; 'Choose what closing the lid does'. Make these changes [battery and plugged in]:<br />
<br />
When I press the power button ~ Hibernate.<br />
<br />
When I press the sleep button ~ Turn Off the Display.<br />
<br />
When I close the Lid ~ Sleep.<br />
<br />
Now return to 3 above &gt; Additional Power Settings and continue:<br />
<br />
5. Look for 'Plan shown on the battery metre' and a highlighted circle. Yours could be 'Automatic balances or balances[recommended]. If your computer is highlighted [example DELL] use that option.<br />
<br />
6. Adjacent your choice click 'Change Plan Setting'<br />
<br />
7 On next screen click 'Change advanced power settings'<br />
<br />
8. A new menu appears. Move down and click &gt; Power Button &amp; Lid<br />
<br />
9. Go down the menu and make these changes [battery and plugged in];<br />
<br />
Lid close .... change to 'Sleep' for both options.<br />
<br />
Power Button ... change to 'Hibernate' for both options<br />
<br />
Sleep Button ... change to 'Turn Off the display'.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to OK before closing the process.<br />
<br />
Power option key 'sleep' has now been removed and Hibernate installed. <br />
Your computer should no longer crash to a black screen because 'sleep' has been replaced by 'hibernate'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start&gt; power key &gt;&nbsp; Hibernate, Shut Down or Restart. </p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having a corrupted profile is one of the possible reasons why your dashboard on device stuck going down. To help you resolve this concern, we need to collect more information. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to remove and re-add your Xbox profile?</li><li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Have you tried updating your Xbox One console?</li><li>Have you tried to reset your console into factory defaults?</li></ul>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Does this issue occur only when you download smith from the Internet?<br />
2. Do you receive any error message?<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may&nbsp; follow these steps and check:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the folder and click on “Properties”.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the tab “Security”.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the “Advanced” button at the bottom.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Change Permission”.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select your user account and check the option “Include inheritable permissions from this object’s parent”.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on apply to remove the lock icon.<br />
&nbsp;The lock icon will be removed because the folder now inherits the permission of the parent folder. If that folder does not have any special permissions you will successfully remove the lock from the folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may rebuild icon cache and check:<br />
a. Open Folder Options to select (dot) Show hidden files and folders.<br />
b. Open a Windows Explorer window.<br />
c. Go to C:\Users\(User Name)\AppData\Local<br />
d. Right click on IconCache.db and click on Delete.<br />
e. Click on Yes to confirm the deletion. <br />
NOTE: This deletes the file to the Recycle Bin. It is safe to empty the Recycle Bin when finished.<br />
f. Close the window.<br />
g. Empty the Recycle Bin.<br />
h. Restart the computer.<br />
i. When you go back, you will notice the Size of the IconCache.db file is smaller, and the&nbsp; Date Modified is now the current date.<br />
NOTE: If for some reason IconCache.db is not there or the size has not changed much, then just restart the computer again. You may need to restart a couple of times in some cases.<br />
j. The icon cache has been rebuilt.<br />
k. Open Folder Options to select (dot) Do not show hidden files and folders.</div>
<div><br />

<p>I assembled a kit, (Gigabyte mobo, AMD FX-6100 proc, 4GB Patriot RAM, 120GB SSD, etc). When up and running I loaded my OEM Win 7 Home Premium Build 7601 disc, loaded the OS, and was off to the races. The next morning I tested the rig - worked fine, but Win
 asked for my activation/registration - I clicked on Later, as I was on a test bench without internet access at the time. A couple hours later after moving to its final location, I plugged everything up - Windows wouldn't boot, except for Safe Mode (w/ or w/o
 Network).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I decided to try to reinstall. Got partway through but them everything just stopped. I formatted the drive, tried again - nothing except a black screen with a little message bottom right corner - This Copy of Windows is Not Genuine. Well it sure IS! I
 paid $100 from a reliable source (Newegg) and have the 25 alphanumeric key (which I had to enter twice already) and am now stuck with an expensive door stop!
</p>
<p>Now it won't even load in Safe Mode - stuck in middle of install with no end in sight - HELP!!!</p>

            <p>Doug; I've merged your two posts as they appear to be duplicates. As for activation after you have tested the hardware I suggest you try phone activation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' you are located in from the drop down list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5) Stay on the phone *** do not select/press any options *** and wait for a person to help you.<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />
7) The support person should give you a confirmation ID, copy it down on paper, <br />
8) Verify the ID is correct by reading back to the support person.<br />
9) Enter the ID number and click 'Next' to finish the activation process.</p>

<p><strong>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</strong></p>
<p><br />
Note: If you are Overclocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features, start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite&nbsp; and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p><br />
Disconnect any other (additional) internal hard drives and external USB devices.<br />
Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>First run Memtest86+:</strong>&nbsp; <br />
This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<strong>Test your drive - Create a Bootable CD:</strong><br />
Anywhere from 5 to 25%, (depending on the manufacture and model) of new hard drives are defective.<br />
Note: Hard drive reliability has gone way down in the last 24 months and improved a bit lately depending on the manufacture.</p>

            <p>Dear JW: While I appreciate the time and effort youput into an attempt at answering my posted question, and I think I may find many of the resources you posted in response useful at some point in the future, it is also clear that you did not read my question.</p>
<p>Your answer's 1st step - "1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4" indicates you missed my key issue - Windows Won't Boot. There is no desktop. There IS NO START BUTTON or SEARCH BOX".
</p>
<p>Again, I appreciate your efforts, but they are irrelevant when I CAN'T GET TO WINDOWS AT ALL. I wish experts who try to help would pay better attention. The question headline says it won't boot. The lead sentence complains that the answers I've seen so far
 say to go to Control Panel, etc but I CAN'T DO THAT - THERE IS NO CONTROL PANEL, since WINDOWS WON'T BOOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did look at your Korner and agree completely that MS missed a money making (and customer satisfaction points - huge ones!) opportunity in not adding a paid upgrade to XP with desirable features and continuing security support! They have a lot
 of worthwhile products (both software and hardware) but I do question their business plans from time to time (Win 8, for example - trying to straddle desktops and tablets in one package is a grave error, IMO).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks anyway - I got it working all by myself. I had tried to reinstall Win 7 but kept getting nowhere, until I not only formatted the drive, but also re-partitioned it by eliminating the "100MB Reserved" part.&nbsp; It finally reinstalled after I did that
 and I tried again inserting the product key (I had mis-typed it before) and all is well now...&nbsp; Doug V</p>

            <p>Formating a drive prior to win install went out some win versions ago; when you boot from the win dvd, early in the process you delete any partitions found, then continue the install, which in the process formats the drive.</p>
<p>The 100mb reserved contains boot info and is part of any default win7 installation</p>

            <p>Palcouk:&nbsp; I'm not disbelieving you or saying you're wrong - I'm only saying that I tried 6 or 7 times to re-install Win 7 Home Premium to both an SSD that already had it installed once seemingly successfully, and a spinner that had been formatted, as well,
 but the install, every time, got so far and no farther - just sat, dead still (no activity light from SSD or BD-RE drive). Then when I not only formatted the SSD but removed the 100MB reserve partition, it finally worked (I was able to enter the correct product
 key, which I had mis-typed one character before). </p>
<p>I had been on the phone with both Newegg (who sold me the Win 7 disc) and MS in a conference call - Newegg was perplexed, MS said that the OEM version could not be installed successfully on a home-build (had to be a licensed manufacturer) - which, as I think
 we both know (at least I do) is BS. All the time (over an hour) on the conference call I was trying different things, and when I cleaned the SSD and eliminated that "Reserved" by renaming the volume and deleting the 0 partition, then expanding the 1 partition
 to the entire drive, then sticking it back in the new build - only then did the install work as it should (just after MS and Newegg has opened a ticket!).</p>
<p>BTW - my first effort with Newegg hit a brick wall - they had to have a Case # from MS to do anything, and MS wouldn't open a Case # unless I said it appeared to be pirated OS. So when I called Newegg back and threatened to declare it a pirate copy, suddenly
 I got LOTS of cooperation from a very nice lady! It would have never occurred to me to do this - it was what the MS guy in india told me to do, and it worked.</p>
<p>But it all became moot when, suddenly my reinstall efforts bore fruit. So go figure. I did nothing else that would have any bearing on this issue, which is why I concluded that it must have been something in that 100MB reserve that was preventing me from
 continuing the reinstall. It's just something I'd never come across before (never entered the wrong Key before), and if it wasn't that 100MB Reserve that was screwing things up, what the heck was it? Huh?&nbsp;&nbsp; Doug V</p>

<h2>            USB Mouse&#47;keyboard disconnect then bluescreen error</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire (notebook Windows 7) 5551 I was playing StarCraft II and the USB keyboard/mouse disconnected and went haywire, when I pressed Enter to chat it spammed the letter "e" then the PC realized this and crashed with blue screen error.
<div>the game I was on was using a lot of processing so I think maybe my PC couldn't handle it. It never happened before though...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>I looked in the event viewer and found this:</span><br />
<span>": The embedded controller (EC) did not respond within the specified timeout period. This may indicate that there is an error
<span>": The embedded controller (EC) did not respond within the specified timeout period. This may indicate that there is an error
 in the EC hardware or firmware or that the BIOS is accessing the EC incorrectly. You should check with your computer manufacturer for an upgraded BIOS. In some situations, this error may cause the computer to function incorrectly."</span><br />
</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>any idea's why or how to solve this? It has happened once more, right when I was almost done uploading a youtube video! (bad luck)</div>

            There are 57 problem devices in MSINFO32 - all are printers<br />
Please uninstall these devices (you may have to do it through Device Manager)<br />
<br />
Both BSOD's point to USB.&nbsp; I noticed that you have MAudio installed - and we've seen a lot of similar problems from that in the past.&nbsp; I'd suggest uninstalling it and removing any associated devices.<br />
<br />
Daemon Tools (and Alcohol % software) are known to cause BSOD's on Win7 systems (mostly due to the sptd.sys driver).<br />
Please uninstall the program, then use the following free tool to ensure that the troublesome sptd.sys driver is removed from your system (pick the 32 or 64 bit system depending on your system's configuration):&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.duplexsecure.com/faq#remove_32sptd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.duplexsecure.com/faq#remove_32sptd</a><br />
<br />
FYI - I see mention of a cracked Steam service in your files.&nbsp; If the system is cracked - in most cases our attempts at helping won't work.&nbsp; Also, if the system is cracked, we cannot help with it anyway (it's against the rules).<br />

            I deleted all the printers except for C1500 because that's the printer I used<br />
<div><br />
<div>It seems MAudio is the program I use for my piano-laptop midi cable, I will try uninstalling it and will re-install if I have to (I could probably find diff software if I needed to)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I removed the drives, it seems Daemon can create a drive without using SCSI (it's an option)</div>
<div><br />
<div>when I ran the tool It said no sptd was found, I re-added a virtual drive and ran the program again it still said none found same with when I re-added the drive from PowerISO (I still removed the virtual drives I&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;been using them anyway)</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Cracked steam has nothing to do with the system, and currently I don't have any cracked steam games. Steam is an application so I doubt it would effect anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would assume it could also be a hardware problem?</div>

            The tool may not find the sptd.sys driver if the Daemon Tools installer removed it (or, if it wasn't present - which may be the case with later versions).<br />
<br />
There are certain indicators of a hardware problem that we look for.&nbsp; The most easily noticed is a number of BSOD's with different error codes and different causes.&nbsp;
<br />
So, we eliminate all the other possibilities, and what's left is either hardware or Windows.&nbsp; Hardware problems are more common than Windows.&nbsp; Here's a list of free hardware diagnostics that I recommend:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.carrona.org/hwdiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.carrona.org/hwdiag.html</a><br />
<br />
Your system doesn't meet this criteria as both memory dumps are STOP 0xFE.<br />
BUT, it does blame the ACPI system in your computer - so it's possible that there is a lower level hardware problem.<br />
<br />
Daemon Tools drivers are present in both memory dumps.&nbsp; Please uninstall it as described above.&nbsp; Leave it off the system until the system is stable.<br />
<br />
There are also numerous older drivers dating from 2009 that should be updated or removed from your system.&nbsp; To remove them, using the uninstaller - DO NOT delete them as it may result in the system becoming unbootable.&nbsp; Here's a list of the older drivers:<br />
<br />
mwlPSDFilter.sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tue Jun 02 06:07:30 2009 (4A24F9E2)<br />

<br />
The S3DInjectionDriver.sys likely belongs to a 3D program from this company:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.iz3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

The rest may be found at <a href="http://www.carrona.org/dvrref.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.carrona.org/dvrref.html</a><br />
<br />
It's interesting to note that there are at least 2 of your AMD chipset drivers that date from 2009 (AtiPcie.sys and usbfilter.sys) and that one of them is a USB driver - which is what you're experiencing problems with.<br />
I would suggest getting drivers for your AMD M880G Chipset from the AMD website (in order to get the most recent drivers that are available).

<div><br />

The USB Crash happened again! Only this time it didn't BSOD I even had my camera ready! I accidently went into user lock. I was playing SC2 which takes a lot of process, the game itself is fine, but there's one custom map that has lots of "stuff" going on and
 lags a lot, it did another USB crash everything went haywire and made the game unplay-able
<div><br />
<div>to describe it as best as I can, the PC makes the USB device disconnected sound, which then my external keyboard and mouse disconnect. I can plug everything in try different slots nothing happens (I only have three usb slots)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could this be the problem: "<span>Out-of-date firmware or basic input/output system (BIOS)"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I ran Microsoft Fix It, it found the same problems as the trouble shooter, it came up with all those printers that are disabled, I didn't enable any of them</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>this is stuff I researched on the internet with people who had similar problems:</span></div>
<div><span>I noticed someone else had their PC crashing because of the power supply, when they plugged their USB in the mother board didn't get enough power or something. I doubt that's the reason my PC has the original power supply/battery</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>here's something that might have caused it"</span><span>seeing some option about turning on/off usb power saving ( i can't remember the exact name of this option ) and I thought it maybe reduces the frequency with which the os polls the usb ports"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>"</span><span>I did this, right click on power logo in tray, select power options and go for "Change plan settings". There is "change advanced power settings", which has USB settings - usb selective suspend setting. Turned that off"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I did exactly what this person up there did, I disabled the USB selective suspend setting, Only when plugged in, when it's unplugged it's enabled.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Still haven't found a fix! I'll continue to research the problem on the web as well.</span></div>
