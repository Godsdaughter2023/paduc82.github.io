<h2>            Xbox 360 slim keeps randomly turning on and off by itself</h2>
                    
<p>It will randomly turn on and off repeatedly. Usually the disc tray will also open and close many times. I have had this console for about 11 months. In May I sent it in for a repair because it wouldn't read any discs, but it had worked great until about
 two months ago. I had just moved it to a different room in the house and noticed that it would turn itself on and off repeatedly at random times. This will usually go for about two minutes and it only happens when the console is already off. I have tried switching
 to a different outlet and have cleaned the eject and power buttons. I currently unplug it when not playing it but would like to know if there is any fix for this problem</p>

<p>I think what he is asking is if there was a wireless controller that was paired to the device that is paired to another console now. Either that or if there is a wireless controller that is paired to the console that might be causing the issue.</p>
<p>Simple way to figure this out, do you have two consoles? If not then A would not be an issue. If so, then it STILL should not be an issue for the same reason a Bluetooth can only be working with one phone at a time. Pairing can only be done with one device
 at a time. BUT... I have seen it happen with my sons controller once. He turned on his xbox with the controller and it also turned on MY xbox. We paired the controller with his xbox a second time and the issue was gone. I think it was just a fluke and it started
 to look for the original xbox, but then it went to his. It never happened again after the second pairing.</p>
<p>To test theory B, take the battery pack off of the controller (s) and see if it happens again. If it does not happen again, skip to the next paragraph. If it does, you may have another device (a remote control, phone, wireless doorbell, or something else
 that is sending out signal) that is interfering with the signal to the xbox. Now you have to see what other wireless devices you have in the area that may be causing the interference. Test each device by using it in front of the xbox and see if anything causes
 the issue.</p>
<p>If detaching the battery pack makes the issue go away, then try putting the battery pack back into ONE of the controllers. Wait and see what happens. If the issue returns, take the battery pack out of that controller and repeat the process with each controller
 you have making sure only ONE controller has a battery pack in at a time. Should one controller cause the issue but not any of the others, try swapping a different battery pack into the suspect controller. Test again. If it does not happen, it might be the
 battery pack. If it does happen again, it may be the controller. If it is the battery pack, just replace it. If it is the controller, you may have corrosion in the controller, a bad circuit, or a closed loop (etc.). In other words, the controller may need
 to be rebuilt or it may need a deep cleaning. I will let you decide how to handle that, but I would just buy a new controller.

<p>We only have one 360 in our house and there is only one wireless controller connected to it. I will try removing the battery pack when I get home and see if it happens again. I also have remotes for my TV and receiver nearby, so I can test those too.</p>

<p>just an amended... the device doesn't have to be in the same room to interferer. IE: cellphone in the kitchen gets a text msg, speakers in the living room make an odd noise.</p>

<p>Took the battery pack out of the controller last night. It happened again this morning. Someone was using their cell phone while it was happening, but they were outside. Other than that I could not find anything else that might be interfering with it. Could
 there be something wrong with the console itself?</p>

    <title>Windows Firewall service not starting after Creator&#39;s Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starayo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall service not starting after Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    <p>I noticed this issue when, after I updated to the Creator's Update, a friend was unable to connect to a game server running on my PC. I couldn't understand it, because I had everything set up and it was working prior to the update. I figured it was likely
 an issue with firewall settings being reset or something, and went investigating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, opening the "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security" app after starting my PC gives me an error:
</p>
<p>"The Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in failed to load. Restart the Windows Firewall service on the computer that you are managing. Error code: 0x6D9."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening the services app shows the Windows Firewall service is set to automatic start, but is stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I manually start the Windows Firewall service, it will start, the "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security" app will work normally, and everything is connectable once again. However, I need to do this manually every time I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I ensure this service runs as it is supposed to? I have run a SFC and it found no issues.</p>

            Unfortunately not. I have resolved myself to just having to manually starting the BFE / firewall services manually on startup.

<h2>            keyboard is not working. Acting ridiulously every time&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Since, yesterday, middle row letter keys were not working including ENTER except "G" &amp; "H".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager, the default MS keyboard (Standard 101/102-Key or Microsoft Natural PS/2 Keyboard for HP Hotkey Support) was showing as the latest! Uninstalled &amp; restarted the PC as prompted on the screen. But, still no luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fully scanned my PC with the latest updated Windows Defender but no any virus was detected at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperately read Microsoft's support website &amp; did "Hard reset" in the evening which actually solved my problem for that time (Yuuhuuuuuu....!!) :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, this morning onwards, 3rd row letter keys are not responding including the "spacebar" &amp; left hand shift key :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that means, it's not a hardware problem &amp; some virus circus is going on in my&nbsp;laptop which even Microsoft's built in troubleshooters can't detect!!<br />
<br />
Right now, I am typing here with the combo of onscreen keyboard &amp; physical one on my Laptop which has taken me nearly 22 mins (ridiculous...isn't it!!)<br />
<br />
Any further suggestions or support guys??</p>

<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there is something wrong of the external users. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can communicate with the external users, it means the setting in Skype for Business admin center is no problem. There is no other actions you need to take.

            <p>Press the windows sign lower left of keyboard and the letter r at the same time.</p>
<p>Remove anything in the search box and then enter . and hit enter.</p>
<p>If you see App Data click it.</p>
<p>Click Local.</p>
<p>Click Microsoft.</p>
<p>Find MSN and copy it to a zip drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don not see App Data.</p>
<p>Go to view a box will appear with three tabs.</p>
<p>Select the view.</p>
<p>Scroll down to hidden file and select to show file extensions.</p>
<p>Then proceed as above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take the zip and put onto the new computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the same as above to get to the MSN folder.</p>
<p>Right click it and rename it as MSN.old.</p>
<p>Go to the drive that the zip is in and copy the file.</p>
<p>Again go to App Data.</p>
<p>Click Local.</p>
<p>Click Microsoft.</p>
<p>Put your curser on the page and right click then paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now have MSN and MSN.old in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open up your email and the old stored&nbsp;folders should be visible.</p>

<p>Took an awful lot of frustrating phone calls for this simple answer.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth &#40;Windows 10&#41; shows Jam Wireless headphones are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emperorwingz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth &#40;Windows 10&#41; shows Jam Wireless headphones are paired, but no sound.</h2>
                    <p>This has been a repeating issue. I will turn on my Jam Pro wireless headphones only to find they've been desynced and I have to resync them to my laptops bluetooth. When I do, it will ask me to verify the pin on the screen (6 digits) matches the one on my
 headphones (which is utter nonsense, given these are headphones, and are incapable of receiving said pin). I'll connect anyways and my laptop will state that I have indeed connected my headphones and are ready for use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are not. No sound from my headphones, despite it's claims. After about 10 seconds, the status of my wireless headphones in the Bluetooth settings will go from "Connected" to "Paired", basically stating that I do not have a connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, I have tried unpairing and repairing the device. I have tried troubleshooting my bluetooth settings. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling my bluetooth drive (and restarted my computer). Nothing has worked. Like I said, this isn't the
 first time this has happened either. Most of the time I'll get lucky and one of these steps will eventually work, but I'm fed up with fidgeting with this. I need this resolved once and for all, it's incredibly frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Almost forgot, but before anyone suggests to update my driver. I've tried that, and my laptop states that the most up to date driver is already installed (M76USB)</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />If your Bluetooth is disabled then do the following to enable it.
<br />Uninstall the device from device manager and restart bluetooth service. 
<br />Start &gt; services.msc 
<br />Right-click "Bluetooth Support Service."
<br />Choose Automatic.
<br />Go to device manager and&nbsp; right-click on your computer name and click "Scan for hardware changes"
<br />Install the bluetooth device drivers from the manufacturer's website, if any. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<p><span>Hello Drava,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for Posting on the Microsoft Vista Community Forums.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sounds like the preferences in the printer settings are changed on your computer. You may try to change the advance setting of the printer and verify if you are able to print the first page first and last page last on XPS document writer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the steps below to change the printing preferences:<br />
1. Click on Start<br />
2. In the start Search box type Printers and press enter.<br />
3. Right click on XPS Document writer and click on Printer properities.<br />
4. Click on Advanced tab.<br />
5. Select the option to print directly to printer.<br />
6. Click on Apply and Ok.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Verify if you are able to print the first page first and last page last.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope it helps. <br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards, <br />

    <title>Surface Tablet keyboard stops working arbituraily - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xhalite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Tablet keyboard stops working arbituraily</h2>
                    Hello, my surface tablet touch cover keyboard randomly stops working after I don't use it for a while. I got the firmware update from earlier this month. However, the only thing I can do is reclick it in to the surface when it doesn't respond. It isn't
 a connector problem, it is working when I use it like right now as I type this. Is there a permanent fix?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several threads of similar reports.&nbsp; Since this one is still in the unanswered category, i'll repeat one of my postings on another thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experience the touch keyboard not working when surface goes into locked mode. Usually I have mail and IE running in background with cover closed in "book" position. I called tech support and they had me detach and reattach 15 times in a row, then when
 that didn't work, had me do a refresh. Refresh worked for an hour or two, but then issue reappeared.&nbsp; I have to detach and reattach. If the keyboard is not attached, then the onscreen keyboard does not work.&nbsp; In hindsight, i think it initially worked because
 i didn't have the keyboard in closed position when testing with technical support.</p>
<p>I had the keyboard replaced, but the problem remains. I did refresh again, installed all firmware and software updates. Consistently, touch keyboard does not work coming out of locked mode.</p>
<p>Hope a fix will be coming soon. </p>
<p>Update (12/6/2012): Ok, i think that the keyboard functionality is impacted by positioning of the device and the order of: opening cover, kickstand and screen coming on. If keyboard doesn't work, close cover/kickstand, flip device over, open cover (to left
 like book), open kickstand, screen lights up and it works. Hoping this is still a software bug that can be fixed and not a hardware flaw.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update (1/3/2013): I still have an issue, but i do the close again, flip over in my hands are re-open and it works about 75% of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes, i have to do it several times - i must not have the sequence correct, or it is a sensor issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another thread, someone just&nbsp;posted that they didn't have the issue until their Surface was replaced to fix a different issue, but not the keyboard.&nbsp; Now he has the keyboard&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MICROSOFT - Is this a hardware problem?&nbsp; A firmware issue that can be fixed?&nbsp; A software issue?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update (2/27/2013)&nbsp; I finally got tired of this nagging issue.&nbsp; I had both the Surface and touch keyboard replaced by Microsoft.&nbsp; Problem does not appear on new device.&nbsp; What an improvement in user experience not to have this issue anymore!</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer &#40;Desktop, Taskbar, etc&#41; disappears shortly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loveliermaple45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer &#40;Desktop, Taskbar, etc&#41; disappears shortly &#40;&#126;2 min&#41; after signing in. &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I left my computer running while I went out on a short errand, and came back to find that it had reverted back to the Login screen.</p>
<p>Thinking that Windows had just tried to update itself while I was gone, I signed back in.</p>
<p>Upon logging in, though, I was greeted with a desktop whose Taskbar was missing almost all of it's usual Icons. The only ones remaining were the Start button, the Search-windows Magnifying glass, and the Task-view Icon: none of which were actually functional.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of pondering what was going on, and just how I would ask the internet for help if I couldn't use my taskbar to load my browser, the desktop itself, which had been fine up to this point, suddenly went all black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After multiple restarts, the issue remains, and plays out pretty much the same each time. After having restarted my computer a bunch of times, though, I noticed that the usual loading screen (the one that takes place directly before the Microsoft-account
 login screen) is now just a blank, black screen, and takes about 30seconds to load, as opposed to the normal blue screen with a loading symbol that lasts about 3 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After managing to find a round-about way of loading Internet-Explorer, I searched for answers online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple people seemed to have had a black-screen inducing issue similar to mine, which was said to be fixed by simply using Taskmanager to run "Explorer.exe" again. I tried this, and it did indeed bring my desktop back. But not my taskbar icons. And my
 Desktop eventually reverts back to Black after the usual 2min.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another person made a video about fixing another seemingly similar issue, involving using Regedit to change a Shell file to involve Explorer.exe again.</p>
<p>I followed the videos steps, but the file already had explorer.exe in it's prompt, so it ultimately did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to find any other topics quite like my issue, I've come here to ask for help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit*</p>
<p>After doing further digging, I found that my Event Log is full of sihost.exe errors, and explorer.exe errors.</p>
<p>Looking up issues involving those things, the common thing to do is boot into protected mode.</p>
<p>Doing so gave me a pair of error messages as soon as I finished entering my password:</p>
<p>"sihost.exe : Unknown Hard error" and "explorer.exe : Unknown Hard error".</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit 2*</p>
<p>ran a "Sfc /scannow",&nbsp;and it's results say that I have corrupted files that couldn't be fixed because the file in store was also corrupt. there were also a great deal of errors saying "*weird-file-name* is not owned but specifies SDDL in component *weird-file-name*"</p>

<p>Fixed the issue myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out I had multiple corrupted files in my operating system (I'm guessing they got corrupted by an update or something that I didn't know of, because I never had any problems with it for the last year, and I don't remembe installing any updates recently,
 but whatever)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Microsoft Website and did an "In-place repair installation" or whatever it was called.</p>
<p>Have not had any problems since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you time, sorry that I couldn't have fixed it myself BEFORE asking you for help.</p>

<h2>            800704 DC - Download Gamertag Error</h2>
                    
<p>Hello People my Account was banned 2-3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>My Bio had something in it, that Microsoft didnt liked. So i got banned for two weeks. ( yes, two weeks without any warnings...)</p>

<p>So after these two weeks i tried to connect to xbox live but i wasnt able to connect, they told me that i have no connection to xbox live, but on my second gamertag i can play online.</p>
<p>I tried to delete my Gamertag and download it again, but it wont let me download it, they always tell me that i can not connect with xbox live, then the window dissapears.</p>
<p>Now since the new update i can download my Profile but than suddenly a message pops up, it says : " 800704 DC " This Profile cannot sign up at this moment and that i should try it later again. i tried it like 15 Times but it wont work.</p>

<p>i have tried so many things, + the support could not help me and yea i am waiting a few weeks for a answer now. i'm trying everything for a few weeks and its kinda frustrating because even my Gold is finished now! ( If i have to wait more than 4 weeks is
 xbox giving me a free gold month or something else??)</p>
<p>I hope that anyone can help me..</p>

<p>Hello Stephen,</p>

<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            MAC address not Matching Internet.</h2>
                    So Recently I got a new modem because my old one was starting to get very old and my family decided to get a new one. Good Idea we thought but I seem to be getting problems where on my wireless connection (Not Ethernet Cord) doesn't quite match my modems
 MAC address. It says go to "xbox.com/networkhardware. After you've changed it, check your connection again." Well when I put it in the website it just brings me to the forums and Im not even sure if you can even change your mac address let alone make a new
 one. Help Would be Appreciated!

<h2>            SOS&#33; Please somone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>i posted that problem before in other forums, several veterans and me&nbsp;couldnt solve that issue. here it is -</p>
<p>Theres many webpages (approx 500) that i'v been visited to learn for big test, now as obvious they all kept in history, i sw the there so i trust on that, but anyway i did copy every day of the History folder (@ C:\Documents and Settings\Yakir Cohen\Local
 Settings), laugh of the fate, explorer stucks -&nbsp;and reset settings deletes all history, i wasnt worried, until i try to delete the original but empty&nbsp;History folder mentioned above in order to rename the new backup and basically replace the history that way.
 my hart fell with the sound of the error message says "History is a windoes system folder and it required for windows to run properly. it cannot be deleted." I look for solution in the web almost 10 hours, try to delete it withe the CMD in safe mode - nada.</p>
<p>i have a small test tomorrow. and several tests ahead, i really need that materials and its under pressure of time.</p>
<p>Please somone to help me with that issue!</p>
<p>Thanks oyu all very much.</p>

<p>If you have deleted the history folder, and not erased using CCleaner or Eraser, then you still have chance torecover<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">almost</span> every file if you did not switch off the computer.</p>

Sorry but it's not what i ment. i do have backup of the history (hopefully, because&nbsp;someone told me that this is where explorer keep the history files (@ C:\Documents and Settings\Yakir Cohen\Local Settings\History - History is the folder but it hidden asa
 system folder) i also saw that it contains items like today yesterday sunday, so i pretty sure this is the one). the problem is that since its a system folder i cannot just delete it and rename one of the backups in order to replace it, theres probably some
 other way i try to use command prompt with safe mode but still it cannot be deleted from there. its probably need to be place that do not use windows at all in order to delete it from the CMD, but even more important is to know that when i copy&nbsp;the&nbsp;history
 folder&nbsp;(by simple copy-paste operation)&nbsp;the data within it&nbsp;was properly&nbsp;saved and intact for that manner.</p>
<p>briefly, theres one thing i need to know &amp; and one thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;- 1. now that the history system folder that backup by copy-paste is good- can be actally recovered with the pages i visited months ago (it sepuse keep pages upto 150 days). 2. to&nbsp;replace the
 original history folder in some way(i&nbsp;think by delete the original and rename the copied).</p>
<p>Can you help me with that?</p>
<p>TIA.</p>

<p>Backing up history folder serves no good purpose. Because history folder is dynamically created every day, it has different index.dat file. This index.dat files is system locked up by the Windows Explorer (which can be ulocked with Unlocker_1.9). Restoring
 index files will not help you since the site you want to revisit will always create a new session cookie, or permanent cookie depending on what server requires.<br />
<br />
Now, you could recover the names and links of sites you have visited from index.dat. But you have to use a trick. Here is the way how you would use the trick.</p>
<p>Since index.dat is locked by current explorer session, you use WinPE-based utilities as mentioned before (UBCD, BartPE, Live CD, Hiren Boot CD, etc...). This will allow you to access to the index.dat files, cookies, and even temporary files folder and its
 contents. <br />
<br />
Then copy&nbsp;index.dat file(s) to a USB drive as index.dat.txt, and cookie files which starts with*** Email address is removed for privacy ***,
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, etc..<br />
<br />
Using two utilities you can get the following items:<br />
(1) <strong>URL Extractor:</strong> This will allow you to extract URLs&nbsp; from renamed index.dat.txt file (links http://, ftp://) and save it as csv or txt file. At least it will allow you to obtain link values.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.spadixbd.com/extracturl/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.spadixbd.com/extracturl/index.htm</a><br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.karenware.com/powertools/ptcookie.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.karenware.com/powertools/ptcookie.asp</a></p>
<p>But be mindful that these exercises are futile to get connection to a server since you need to establish a session cookie, and if your license (via cookie) has expired, then you cannot access server (a trick in olden days was used to reset server timing..but
 that is fixed now).</p>
<p>Another trick which may or may not work: Use a program called <strong>Locate32</strong>. With this program you can get everything under the temporary folder tree, even system locked index.dat. This way might be simpler, if it works. Plus, Locate32 is far
 superioir to Windows Search or Google Desktop, as you do not convey user data back to Microsoft or Google.</p>
<p>To avoid future problems like this one, you can install <strong>doPDF</strong>&nbsp; program, and<strong>print</strong> PDF files of the web page you are interested in. This way you will never have to resort to data mining.<br />

Okay. first i want to thank you so much, i really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>i try the first trick, the url extractor, what i did is that - 1. i did copy of the the index.dat file from the history folder that contains the wanted websites, put it in desktop, and renamed it to index.dat.txt 2. open the extract url software, click 'new',
 in the 'new session window' in 'general' tab i set the source to 'URLs from file' radio oprion, choose the file and then ok, then it gives me an error&nbsp;- 'cannot focus a disabled or invisible window'. i download also the second software but i&nbsp;didnt know what
 to do with it or how to operate it.&nbsp;to be honest you spoke in very high language for me and i am not quite sure i understood everything right. i looking into the index.dat.txt file and i saw theres a lot of text there, but theres also the&nbsp;full addresses i'v
 been&nbsp;visited so is i can get that it wouls be wounderful, and&nbsp;i guess the url extractor should do that but&nbsp;it gives me that error instead. can you please tell&nbsp;me step by step how to&nbsp;get those addresses? as i complete ignorant at this field...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And again thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Modem problem after System Restore in XP</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I recently Restored my Dell Dimension 3100 with XP after getting a virus. When I tried to re-establish my internet connection my wireless modem is not showing up in Device Manager. There is an Ethernet Controller icon that shows up with a yellow exclamation
 mark after it; but I don't know if this is the modem.<br />
The modem is one that I installed and have subsequently lost the software CD so cannot update the driver or connect to Internet and find the driver as I don't know make/model of modem.<br />
Do I need to remove modem to check the make/model or can I connect to the internet with a cable and use a program to detect the momem?<br />
Please forgive my vagueness and probable incorrect use of terms, I am an old man and know very little about computers.<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi Mate,</p>
<p>good news, it doesn't sound like the modem just a driver issue go here http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;SystemID=DIM_PNT_P4_3100&amp;os=WW1&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=-1&amp;impid=-1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then under the network tab download the driver for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the modem you have sends out a wireless signal for your computer to receive then it cant be the modem as you don't install a wireless modem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have an inbuilt wireless card or did your internet service provider give you a USB one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your reply,<br />
It turns out that I had&nbsp; PCI Card installed in my computer, not a modem at all! So I am just going to get a USB Wi-Fi dongle and connect to the wireless router that wat. Thanks again and sorry for such a poorly informed question, I shall make it my priority
 to inform myself about computers and related technologies to avoid any further problems.

<h2>            BLUE SCREEN, UNABLE TO BOOT, NO HARD DRIVE FOUND, AFTER WINDOWS XP UPDATE IN FEBUARY</h2>
                    Like&nbsp;many&nbsp;of you, after February's updates I was not able to boot up my laptop.&nbsp; Safe Mode would not work and when I tried the accepted fix from the Recovery/Repair Console, I got a message saying "Setup could not find any hard disk drives installed".&nbsp;
 After <em>hours</em> of searching for a fix, I finally figured it out and now everything is&nbsp;booting fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you having similar problems, here is what I did...<br />
<br />
1) Visit this site: <a href="http://techrena.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-install-your-own-wndows-xp-in-hp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://techrena.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-install-your-own-wndows-xp-in-hp.html</a>&nbsp;and follow their instructions for the BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If that link does not&nbsp;work for&nbsp;your computer, try this one: <a href="http://techrena.blogspot.com/2009/01/integrate-your-own-drivers-or.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://techrena.blogspot.com/2009/01/integrate-your-own-drivers-or.html</a><br />
<br />
Next, insert your Windows install CD and when it loads, hit R to repair.&nbsp; Then follow these instructions:<br />
<br />
2) Select the option for C:/Windows<br />
<br />
3)&nbsp;Type this command: CHDIR $NtUninstall<strong>KB977165</strong>$\spuninst<br />
<br />
Hit ENTER<br />
<br />
4)&nbsp;Type this command: BATCH spuninst.txt<br />
<br />
Hit ENTER<br />
<br />
5)&nbsp;Type this command: systemroot<br />
<br />
Hit ENTER<br />
<br />
<p>6) When complete, type this command: <em>exit</em></p>
(Most of the above instructions were found on this thread: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/thread/73cea559-ebbd-4274-96bc-e292b69f2fd1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
If your computer didn't come with a Windows CD you can make a recovery CD of your own or borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; For the purpose of recovery, I don't think it matters whether you have XP Home, Pro, etc., any CD will work.&nbsp; There are websites online that
 will tell you how to make a recovery CD...and even provide the files...it just takes a little searching.&nbsp; Unfortunately I didn't save the link for the&nbsp;site I used :o/<br />
<br />
If for some reason you are<em> still</em> unable to get your computer running and would like to get your important&nbsp;files off of your hard drive, I found&nbsp;this amazing, easy and free method.&nbsp; Just download the below&nbsp;OS and burn the ISO to a CD and then boot from
 the CD and load the operating system (load live from the CD - <em>don't </em>install).&nbsp; You will be able to browse all of your files and transfer them to a USB Drive or burn them to a CD:

Apparently it is a root virus (?) of some sort that causes the update problem in the first place.&nbsp; I have scanned with

MSRC: Restart Issues After Installing MS10-015 and the Alureon Rootkit: <br />

<br />
Backdoor.Tidserv [AKA Win32/Alureon] and MS10-015<br />
&lt;QP&gt;<br />
Backdoor.Tidserv does a very good job in that sense, especially with the<br />
latest version (TDL3), which uses an advanced rootkit technology to hide its<br />
presence on a system by infecting one of the low-level kernel drivers and then<br />
covering its tracks. <strong>While the rootkit is active there is no easy way to<br />
detect the infection, and because it goes so deep into the kernel, most users<br />
cannot see anything wrong in the system</strong>...Even worse, because the infected<br />
driver is critical for system boot-up, Windows will not boot in Safe Mode<br />
either [after having installed MS10-015 on an infected machine].<br />
&lt;/QP&gt;<br />
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/tidserv-and-ms10-015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/tidserv-and-ms10-015</a>&nbsp;[emphasis mine]</p>
<p>Tdss rootkit silently owns the net<br />
&lt;QP&gt;<br />
Tdss rootkit 3rd variant is the last member of Tdss rootkit family that is<br />
quickly spreading around the world. While a number of rootkits are just<br />
developed as a proof of concept, this is not the case. Tdss rootkit is well<br />
known to antivirus companies because of its goal to get total control of the<br />
infected PCs and using them as zombies for its botnet.</p>
<p>During these years it has always shown a team of skilled people behind it, who<br />
always applied advanced techniques <strong>often able to bypass antirootkit softwares</strong>.<br />
Actually, this last variant could be easily named as the stealthiest rootkit<br />
in the wild.</p>
<p>This infection is bringing all together the best of MBR rootkit, the best of<br />
Rustock.C and the experience of old Tdss variants. <strong>Result is an infection that<br />
is quickly spreading on the net and it is undetected by almost every security<br />
software and 3rd party anti rootkit software.</strong></p>
<p>...currently [20 Nov-09] no antirootkit is able to bypass disk filtering<br />
technique used by Tdss rootkit but, even if it was possible, this rootkit<br />
could not be detected by file size cross check because file size of the<br />
original and infected files are exactly the same.<br />
&lt;/QP&gt;<br />
