<h2>            S305 Bluetooth disconnects 30 seconds after connecting</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
In windows 7, I have a Motorola S305 Bluetooth headset working fine for several years on three different laptops (only one at a time).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of a sudden its been disconnecting after 30 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It says it has the latest drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remove it in device manager
 and re-scan it and install the drivers, which works for a few days then the same problem with disconnecting after 30 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi David, my name is Andrew and I'm an Independent advisor here to help you.
<br />
<br />Please follow this guideline: 
<br />
<br />Guide 1: Try to update Graphics Card Drivers. Update the Display Drivers, then restart your PC once and check if that helps
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402844...</a>
<br />
<br />Guide 2: Try the troubleshooting steps provided in HDR and WCG color settings in Windows 10
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4040263/windows-10-hdr-advanced-color-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/404026...</a>
<br />
<br />The part about Display requirements for HDR in Windows 10 from the above article will help you to check the compatibility of your monitor for HDR.
<br />
<br />Guide 3: Reduce Frame Rate.
<br />1: Open Settings, System, Display, Advanced display settings, Display adapter properties
<br />2: Switch to Monitor tab, Select 30 Hertz for the Screen refresh rate and click on OK
<br />3: To change Frame Rate go to Display adapter properties and reduce resolution, then switch to Adapter tab and choose List All Modes.
<br />4: In List All Modes, choose the setting that includes 1920 by 1080, 60 Hertz, then click on OK
<br />5: Restart your PC
<br />
<br />Write me back if it works or not. 
<br />
<br />Thanks, 
<br />Andrew N.

    <title>Paperport 11 Printers did not install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoandar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paperport 11 Printers did not install</h2>
                    
<p>I have Paperport 11 Pro installed and running on Windows 7 -64 bit Home Premium. But the "printers" that it usually installs (so you can print to the paperport program) did not install. In previous versions of Windows the way that worked is that a process
 named "pptd40nt.exe" would be running all the time, which installs and runs the "printers" from the list of installed printers. So you just select one and print to it. I have tried running this file in the Win7 installation, but it doesn't do anything. It
 never shows up as a running process. I tried "run as administrator" and "compatibility mode WinXP SP3" but still no results.</p>
<p>Nuance tech support knowledge base lists Paperport 11 as compatible with Windows 7 x 64. But aside from that their support site has not been much help, and they list my registered version 11 as "expired support", (they would love to sell me a newer version
 for $200).</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions to get this working. Not having those "printers" seriously limits the program's functions for me.</p>

<p>I have pp12 running on win7 64 bit, I initially had no end of problems, which after a couple of pp updates and correspondence with pp now seems to have been resolved. I seem to recollect that the previous pp11 didnt run under win7, I didnt try running it
 in winxp compatibility mode</p>
<p>In this version there are 5 Nuance entries in msconfig startup tab, including the one you mentioned</p>
<p>PS I obtained an official pp12 verion update for substantially less than you stated</p>

            You might consider using the native <strong>hosted network</strong> functionality built-in to Windows 7 Ultimate/Enterprise/Pro/Home Premium that turns a wireless (WiFi) equipped Win 7 machine into a wireless router. Look at using either
<strong>Connectify</strong> or <strong>Virtual Router</strong> (both free) that provide a nice GUI to configure the function. Note this only supports
<strong>WPA2 encryption</strong> (very very important) by design.

<p>You are using an online installer and Microsoft has removed all of the corresponding files from their servers so that's why you get an error. What you need is a copy of an offline installer. You can find out more in the link below.</p>

<h2>            Public Desktop showing instead of user desktop when logged in &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    Upon login to Windows 10 using my username (the only one on the machine), it has now started bringing up the 'public' desktop instead of my 'user' desktop.&nbsp; I have no idea how to get my desktop folder to show back up as the desktop.&nbsp; I figured out that
 it was now displaying the contents of the public user folder because my anti-virus updated and put an&nbsp;icon/shortcut on the desktop.&nbsp; It was the only icon on this desktop.&nbsp; When I looked to see where the shortcut was located, it showed "C:\Users\Public\Desktop".&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
 to this&nbsp;I thought maybe it was in tablet mode like the forums suggest.&nbsp; Not the case here.&nbsp; Any thoughts on how I can get MY desktop back instead of the public one?&nbsp;

            What does this do exactly?? It does nothing to fix the issue which is Windows 10 displaying the contents of the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Public Users</span></strong> folder instead of the<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">logged in User</span></strong> folder. Is there a simple way to redirect Windows 10 to display the contents of
 the correct folder as I am loathe to have to re-install Windows as all the updates and software re-installing will tie up my families bandwidth for about a week and cost me a fortune in excess data charges.<br />

            p.s. - The only "issue" which occured is the failure of OneDrive to sync properly and I had to reset it following instructions from another post. The Desktop malfunction began around the same time, I have checked and no Windows updates were installed at
 that time. Is there anyway this could have caused the Desktop malfunction? Would removing and re-installing OneDrive fix this issue?<br />

<p>Hi, I had the same issue and I found it to be caused by OneDrive Desktop syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To revert to your own Desktop right click the One Drive symbol and choose settings. Navigate to the 'Auto Save' Tab and in the Dropdown List next to 'Desktop' select 'This PC only'. After saving my Desktop instantly reverted back to my own, instead of the
 public one. Obviously <strong>this turns off syncing of Desktop items</strong>, but I never wanted that anyway.</p>

    <title>GetRawInputData results from phantom touchscreen problem on SP3 with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunterpritchett  say:</h3>
<h2>            GetRawInputData results from phantom touchscreen problem on SP3 with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am having two types of phantom touches on my Surface Pro 3 (128GB SSD, i5, 4GB RAM) with Windows 10. In the first, there will be repeated touches in the middle-upper-left of the screen. These do not happen often and can be resolved by pressing the power
 button two times. These touches are not described further in this post as the solution is easy and the problem happens infrequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose of this post is to address the second type of phantom touch I am receiving. This problem has been there since I bought the device several years ago and I was running Windows 8. This phantom touch is always in the very bottom right corner of the
 screen and triggers the notification window. This problem happens fairly often, though without any sort of pattern. It happens plugged in or not, with a mouse or keyboard attached or not, all times of the day and all locations. The screen is not damaged and
 I have tried all the solutions listed here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-the-surface-touchscreen?os=windows-10#Solution6W10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-the-surface-touchscreen?os=windows-10#Solution6W10</a>&nbsp;short
 of sending the device in for repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to troubleshoot the issue further I wrote a program that catches the bRawData binary from the RAWHID structure returned by the RAWINPUT Structure that is returned by the GetRawInputData function dll. This data is then converted to a Hex. While possible
 that there is a problem in my code, it returns different values for touches any where else on the screen, so it certainly seems to work. When touched anywhere else on the screen it returns 5-6 bRawData binaries which are all very different, but when the phantom
 touch is registered it always returns only one bRawData binary which I have converted to a Hex and listed here:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">****(**)FFFFFF80258025201C201CFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0100000000</p>
<p>where **** appears to be a counter of the number of bRawData binaries caught since RegisterRawInputDevices was called and (**) has always been 00 except for once where it was 01, but I may just have recorded it incorrectly that time. Please get this information
 to whoever writes the drivers for these touchscreens. Hopefully it will help. If this is not something you can do, please let me know how I can get this information to them, as they may not be able to reproduce this issue themselves. I have put a lot of work
 into figuring out this problem and it would be beneficial to many if this problem was addressed.</p>

            <p>This doesn't work for me, if anything it made it worse.</p>
<p>I did something which seems to have worked, though it's hard to tell as this problem sometimes disappears for days and then reappears: I used this website&nbsp;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/surface/deploy-the-latest-firmware-and-drivers-for-surface-devices?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396
 to download SurfacePro3_Win10_xxxxxx.msi and after installing it I went to "Settings App--&gt;System--&gt;Apps &amp; features" and uninstalled it, and then let Windows update reinstall them again. Not sure why this would work, but I've been problem free for a couple
 days now anyway.Any chance that the information in the original post I provided will make it's way to someone on a development team?</p>

            Got a reply from Supportability that basically said ".. I will <span>pass it along to the touch guys.</span><span>

<p>
</p><p><span>Installing/uninstalling the MSI would update drivers and firmware, and then roll back drivers (but not firmware).&nbsp; For this scenario what we care about is the touch firmware on the device which should have been updated by the MSI.</span></p>

            I should say that this has not proved to be a permanent fix. Still can't find one. It's fine though. I'm happy they got the information I submitted, and hopefully it proves helpful. Apparently reinstalling drivers seems to help for a while so I guess I'll
 just do that every now and then.

            Reinstalling drivers works consistently for roughly a 3 days. Thinking about writing a script that automatically reinstalls the driver every other day

<h2>            SearchDiagnostics - ErrorCode&#58; 0x80070057</h2>
                    <p>In Systemsettings of my windows 10 installation the 'indexing options' are missing (they have been missing on win 7 before the upgrade also). Now I ran the troubleshooter "Identify and fix problems with windows search", but I get an unexpected&nbsp; error returned:
</p>
<p>Packt-Id: SearchDiagnostic</p>
<p>Path: unknows</p>
<p>Error-Code: 0x80070057</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody knows what to do and how to get back the indexing options (I've tried the manual commands like "rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srchadmin.dll" without success already)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I've uninstalled windows search on windows 7 before, but now on windows 10 I cannot reinstall it via 'De-/Install Windows Features'</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>
<p>
PS Maybe the names of the commands/menu entries are a little different in reality - as I am running a german version of windows 10 I may be missing the correct translations.</p>

            <p>No, unfortunately not - the service is enabled already (and Microsoft Windows Search Indexer is running as background job). Problem is that the index does not cover my whole HD because of some very large directories. At the moment some files are found, others
 are missing.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do is to exclude some directories from being indexed - is it possible to set exclusions via registry editor?</p>

<h2>            Automatic Updates&#58; still happening in spite of turning off &#34;metered connection&#34;</h2>
                    I am a very "light" user, but I still have trouble keeping to my 5GB monthly&nbsp;data limit because of automatic updates. I have followed the instruction to turn off the metered connection in my wifi settings, but I still had a nasty surprise yesterday when
 some updates used up more than 1 GB of my 5 GB monthly quota.&nbsp;These are certainly not monthly updates, but they seem to be even more often than weekly, sometimes almost every time I turn the computer on! Can I downgrade to Windows 8 or 8.1 to avoid this problem?
 (I don't see anything fancy in Windows 10, but it just happened to be on my new computer)&nbsp;

</p><p>You need to turn <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on</span> the metered connection to gain control over when you download Windows updates.&nbsp; You will need to do&nbsp;updates at some stage&nbsp;[you cannot just ignore them].&nbsp; I often use my local library's free
 WiFi network for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; The large updates you've just had are known as "Cumulative updates" [CU].&nbsp; For 64 bit Windows they are generally almost 1GB whilst for 32 bit Windows they are generally about 500MB.&nbsp; This month, Microsoft issued a CU a week or so ago {that is possibly
 the one you mentioned in your original post} that proved to be faulty so they had to issue a replacement CU on 13th December.&nbsp; Each of these would have used up about 1GB of your allowance.&nbsp;
<em>CUs can always be downloaded separately and installed later on so you do not need to use up your allowance for them if you sometimes have access to an unlimited data connection.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; I have found that other Windows updates generally take up to a hundred&nbsp;MBs a month but can&nbsp;sometimes use up more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; There are also the installed Windows "Modern" Apps to consider [Mail, Calendar, Maps, Edge, ...].&nbsp; Their updates can also be several hundred MBs each month.&nbsp; If you are logged on to your computer with an MSAccount [rather than a "Local user account"]
 then App updates will happen automatically despite the metered setting unless you turn them off in your Windows Store online settings [you cannot turn them off on the computer itself].&nbsp; I sign on to my computer with a Local user account in order to avoid these
 updates.&nbsp; I always&nbsp;wait until my next library visit to update them because I regard them as mostly useless and I'm only updating them at all&nbsp;because I want to&nbsp;avoid leaving potential security vulnerabilities on my computers.&nbsp; I have an MSAccount that I log
 on to just for this purpose</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; Your other applications will also have updates issued for them if they are still supported by their publishers.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>My MS Office 2007 gets small security-related updates that are&nbsp;generally much less than a&nbsp;hundred MB a month but later versions of MS Office get much larger updates.&nbsp;
</li><li>MS Office 2016 apparently gets several hundred MBs of updates each month, so others have stated in this forum, and its updates are not always managed by Windows update so they occur irrespective of the metered setting.&nbsp; They have to be deliberately turned
 off&nbsp;for day-to-day running and then turned back on again &amp; run manually when you are on an unlimited connection for a while [again, a local library&nbsp;can be an appropriate place for doing this].&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; Your antimalware application also needs to be updated.&nbsp; Updates can often be issued several times a day but are generally only a few MB so I never worry about them.&nbsp; The one exception I have found to this is Bitdefender; its updates are upwards of 3GB
 a month [this is not a typo or an experimental error] because&nbsp;Bitdefender does not download changes to its malware definitions, it completely replaces its existing definitions with each update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been keeping two Windows 10 computers updated using my 6GB a month connection and it normally uses up about 2GB&nbsp;a month for the pair, ignoring Windows "Modern" App updates, but any reissued CU rather wrecks this.&nbsp; My local library is on my route to
 the supermarket so I often stop off on the way -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I update the Windows "Modern" Apps, </li><li>I download any new CUs for installation later on unless I am in a hurry &amp; decide to use my own connection for them, and
</li><li>I also check for updates to my other applications.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>My advice on this subject is in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-networking/manage-internet-data-usage-and-windows-updates-in/5417b89b-4790-4cd9-b854-809862274447">
Manage data usage and Windows updates in Windows 10 - WiKi</a>&nbsp; I am currently working on a significantly improved scheme for managing updates.&nbsp; I had hoped to publish this a month ago but I have had to concentrate on some high priority tasks instead.&nbsp; Now
 that I have seen your question I will make sure I post back here when the improvements are published but do make use of the existing guidance now as it remains valid [the improvements are additions to the guidance rather than replacements].</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>

            <p>I have followed your advice but still get ambushed by these hidden updates. The last time I turned on my computer it gobbled up 1.3 GB within seconds! I live in fear of Windows 10 ! :) I just use my mobile phone or the public library for Internet access,
 and I have a brand new HP laptop sitting idle.</p>

            <p>Caritas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to find out what is using your internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Check for Windows updates</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.1&nbsp; Look &nbsp;in <em>Event viewer</em> [it's in the Start menu within the group
<em>Windows administrative tools</em>]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.2&nbsp; On the left-hand side, expand the entry for&nbsp;<em>Applications and services&nbsp;logs</em> by clicking on its little dropdown arrow.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.3&nbsp; Drill down to <em>Microsoft</em>, <em>Windows</em>,
<em>WindowsUpdateClient</em>, <em>Operational</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.4&nbsp; On the right-hand side, click on <em>Filter current log</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.5&nbsp; In the middle of the dialog you'll see <em>&lt;All event IDs&gt;,
</em>click on that to overtype it with <em>31, 41</em> then OK</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.6&nbsp; On the right-hand side, click on <em>Save filter to Custom view</em>, call it&nbsp;<em>Windows updates - Windows log</em> and enter a description
<em>Windows updates, WinDefr updates, App updates - also shows failures</em> then click on OK.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.7&nbsp; Saving this as a <em>Custom view</em> will allow you to&nbsp;see the latest results in the future by selecting this filter on the left-hand side from within the
<em>Custom views</em> group.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1.8&nbsp; So, has Windows updated or tried to update?&nbsp; If so, what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Check Windows apps</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.1&nbsp; Right-click on the <em>Taskbar</em> and select <em>
Task manager</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.2&nbsp; If its bottom-left shows <em>More details</em> then click on it to show them</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.3&nbsp; Select the <em>App history</em> tab</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.4&nbsp; Click on the column header <em>Metered network</em> to see its usage by Windows apps in descending order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.5&nbsp; Have Windows apps been using your network?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.6&nbsp; If so, you can control them to some extent&nbsp;at <em>
Settings</em>, <em>Privacy</em>, <em>Background apps</em>.&nbsp; If you allow them to operate in the background at all then your permission extends to letting them update in the background as well.&nbsp; Personally, I just turned them all off a year ago to give me time
 to find out more about their background operations but I have never been able to find out anything useful about&nbsp;the subject so they are still all off.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.7&nbsp; I also prevent them updating by logging in to a Local user account not an MSAccount-linked user account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.8&nbsp; I do not know how <em>Background apps</em> operations relate to&nbsp;<em>Live tile</em> operations [para 3].</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2.9&nbsp; You will also find some entries for Windows apps in the internet data usage records for the last 30 days -
<em>Settings</em>, <em>Network &amp; internet</em>, <em>Data usage</em>, <em>Usage details</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; Check Live tiles</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3.1&nbsp; In your <em>Start screen</em> [the right-hand side of your
<em>Start menu</em>], you probably have <em>Tiles</em>.&nbsp; I have some Dell ones &amp; some Office ones in this illustration.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/980ca96f-2af9-4e1e-9c1b-2b3f440eba28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/980ca96f-2af9-4e1e-9c1b-2b3f440eba28" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3.2&nbsp; Right click on every <em>Tile </em>in turn, hover your cursor over
<em>More</em> then check if the entry <em>Turn Live tile off </em>appears.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b4e83a-528c-423e-b6b3-a65f3fe15abd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b4e83a-528c-423e-b6b3-a65f3fe15abd" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3.3&nbsp; If so, consider what you want that application or app to do and decide if you want to let it operate automatically.&nbsp; Just by way of example, if you use the
<em>Mail</em> app to check your email then you might want to let that operate.&nbsp; Personally, I just turned them all off a year ago to give me time to find out more about
<em>Live tile</em> operations but I have never been able to find out anything useful about&nbsp;the subject.&nbsp; So I just tidied them up a bit&nbsp;using
<em>Unpin&nbsp;from Start.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3.4&nbsp; I do not know how <em>Live tile</em> operations relate to
<em>Background apps</em> operations [para 2.6 above].</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; Check your anti-malware application.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4.1&nbsp; All decent anti-malware applications update their malware definitions regularly so they are ready to detect the latest threats.&nbsp; Most of them only use a few MB a day to do so [Bitdefender uses a hundred MBs a day].</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4.2&nbsp; The anti-malware applications themselves can also get updated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4.3&nbsp; Many anti-malware applications also have a regular discourse with their parent website throughout the day.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4.4&nbsp; They all differ.&nbsp; You might need to consult their Help system, user manual, support website&nbsp;&amp; user forum to find out how it uses the internet.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4.5&nbsp; Windows Defender is prettyy straightforward as it is updated as part of Windows updates unless you have followed my advice about updating it using Task scheduler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; Check your other applications</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">5.1&nbsp; HP might have pre-installed some "helpful" utilities.&nbsp; You'll have to check each one [they are probably all in the
<em>Start menu</em> within a group called <em>HP stuff</em> or similar].&nbsp; Check for internet usage while it is doing its job and for any setting that allows it to update automatically.&nbsp; You might find out information about them in the HP website or in the HP
 user forums [a link to which is given at the top of the HP support page].</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">5.2&nbsp; You might also have installed applications.&nbsp; You'll have to check the
<em>Start menu</em> entry&nbsp;for each one.&nbsp; Check for internet usage while it is doing its job and for any setting that allows it to update automatically.&nbsp; You might find out information about them in the&nbsp;publisher's website or in their user forums [if they have
 any].</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the&nbsp;internet data usage records for the last 30 days -
<em>Settings</em>, <em>Network &amp; internet</em>, <em>Data usage</em>, <em>Usage details</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>6&nbsp; Check what level of data you are sending to Microsoft at <em>Settings</em>,
<em>Privacy</em>, <em>Feedback &amp; diagnostics</em>.&nbsp; I have mine set to the bare minimum.</p>
<p>

    <title>Shortcuts icons overloaded by the default Windows icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpuj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shortcuts icons overloaded by the default Windows icon</h2>
                    My Windows 7 desktop and all the shortcuts to .exe files I create in the directories do have the icon corresponding to the correct .exe file.<br />
But the <b>icons get overloaded by the default icon</b> (small white rectangle with a kind of window picture in it).<br />
<br />
When I refresh the desktop, I clearly see the display of the correct icon during 1/4 of second and then comes this other default icon on top of it.<br />
<br />
Here is a partial screen shot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vlfyctbgfex40k/2012-10-13_112328.jpg<br />
<br />
Note that when I increase the size of the desktop icons, the regular icons get bigger but the overloaded default ones stay as is.<br />
Also the few .exe files stored on the desktop (not shortcuts) do not have this double icon problem. It's really only on shortcuts.<br />
<br />
I use MSE for the security, have removed all possible spywares with other tools, run sfc /scannow succesfully, check directories options, display options, removed the iconcache.db, checked on Internet, etc... but now I am really stuck with this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for support<br />

            <p>Hi JPUJ,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that you’ve problems with the shortcut icon. As I understand that all your shortcut icons have the default Windows icon. Please correct me if
 I am wrong.</p>
<p>Could you check if the same issue occurs in safe mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the below link on how to boot the Computer in safe mode</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If safemode doesn’t works, proceed with clean boot:

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p>Try to change the icons manually.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click a program icon, and then click "Properties." The Properties window for that program shortcut appears.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the "Shortcut" tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the "Change Icon" button.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click an image in the main area of the window to select from one of the default icons included with the program. If you have downloaded an icon that you want to use, click the "Browse" button. Locate the icon
 file and double-click it.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click "OK."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still persist. Try to create a New User Account &amp; check if the File Association is corrupted in the New User account or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a different user account to determine whether the problem is related to your user account, use a different user account to test the issue.
 If you do not already have another account on the computer, follow these steps to create a new account:</p>
<p>Create a new user account check if they work.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p>If it works in a new user account, then you can consider the old user account as corrupt. You can check the link below on how to ‘Fix a corrupted
 user profile’</p>

<p>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue
 resolved.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

            Hi Abdul,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. You are correct in saying that all your shortcut icons have the default Windows icon. But to be more precise, this default icon
<b>comes over</b> the regular icon. It is not a substitution but an overlay that you can see in the screenshots links included.<br />
<br />
This is more visible on the desktop of course, but happens also in the desktop folder and any other folder where a shortcut is present. For example:<br />
- On the desktop: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vlfyctbgfex40k/2012-10-13_112328.jpg<br />
- In the desktop folder: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tbe646bpu8jsyps/2012-10-14_143026.jpg<br />
<br />
1 - Safe Mode<br />
I did start Windows in safe mode and the same problem shows up on the icons.<br />
Here is a capture of a part of the screen in safe mode:<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/u6d402pfcmjhco3/2012-10-14_095934.jpg<br />
<br />
2 - Changing the icon of the shortcut<br />
I can change the icon of the shortcut, but the default one still appears on top of the chosen one.<br />
<br />
3 - Change user<br />
I have another account for superadmin to which I swapped already and noticed the same issue<br />
<br />
4 - New user account (admin)<br />
I now created a brand new account and am moving to a session under this account.<br />
Again the default icons are coming over the regular ones but clearly a while after all the regular icons have been displayed. I guess because the new account requires initial tasks that slow down the desktop building process. But at the end this is the same.<br />
<br />
Just for info I also tried to restore the system to an earlier date but the oldest back up already had this "feature".<br />
<br />
Also FYI, neither the file associations nor the shortcuts links to the files are affected. All work fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
JP<br />

            Dear Abdul,<br />
<br />
The "All work fine" is only about the file associations and shortcut links, as a complementary information about the icons.<br />
<br />
If you look at my comments 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- addressing your previous reply recommendations, you will notice that I still report the same persisting issue all times.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
JP<br />

            Ok, found the problem. This is the arrow picture that is displayed over the icons when it's a shortcut.<br />
<br />
I played (and forgot) with a program called Fxvisor which set this value:<br />
"C:\Program Files\Frameworkx\FxVisor\Empty.ico,0"<br />
within this registry key:<br />
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Icons"<br />
to remove the arrow. It might have worked a while until some change put this default icon as an overlay over the shortcuts icons.<br />
<br />
Just put back the regular value for this registry key:<br />
"C:\Windows\System32\shell32.dll,29"<br />
<br />

<h2>            how do I manually download and instal updates in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Finally I have Windows 10 installed and working perfectly!&nbsp; Really impressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have a dodgy wifi connection, which only appears to cause a real problem when downloading and installing updates - when set to auto update they fail! - I have had to resort to manually download and instal updates when connected to modem via Ethernet
 cable.&nbsp;(when I had windows 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at update settings in Windows 10 and can't see the option to manually download and instal updates.&nbsp; I want to make sure I don't get problems, so can anyone point me in the right direction please.</p>

<h2>            Cortana Settings Do Not Load After Creators Update</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After updating to the Fall Creators Update, I went to check my settings to change back what the update changed, and noticed that the Cortana settings do not open. When clicking "Talk to Cortana" or "Permissions and History", the screen is blank and
 the loading dots scroll across the top over and over, with nothing loading. The "More Detail" is the only thing that loads properly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have contacted Microsoft Support multiple times to try to fix this, and have done all the CMD lines they showed me, and none of them have worked. I have tried to do restore points, that didn't work either. I also went into the Troubleshooting part
 of Windows Settings and did them all, and none of them picked up anything wrong with the system files.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have searched all over the web to find someone with the same issue, and no one seems to have had this before. I didn't want to ask Microsoft again because they will tell me the same CMD lines.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My last resort was to try some sort of repair install? I just wasn't sure to do that because I didn't want to have it uninstall all of my programs and only keep my personal files.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'm hoping there is an easy fix. Thanks in advance.</strong></p>

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
<br />
We really appreciate your patience regarding this matter. Knowing that all the possible resolutions has been made and still nothing worked, this might mean your PC needs reinstalling.<br />
<br />
However, you may still consider resetting your PC with the option of keeping your files. Have you done it before as well? If not, you may follow the steps under the
<strong>Reset your PC</strong> selection from <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Make sure that you choose the
<strong>Keep my files </strong>option.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

</p><p>I know how important this is for you. I'd be glad to assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Skype Number is cancelled, you will receive the confirmation email (registered email address used to create the account) shortly after the cancellation. Skype Number will remain active until its expiry date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it expires, Skype will reserve the Skype Number on user's account for 90 days. This means no one else but this user can purchase this particular number during this period. User can renew his Skype Number again easily from his account page.
<span>Once 90 days passes after the cancellation, the number will be available for the public, and the user cannot retrieve the same number again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Let me know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

            Hi Alice.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>

<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />See these Facebook video troubleshooting steps:  <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/facebook/facebook-video-chat-troubleshoot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://drfone.wondershare.com/facebook/faceboo...</a>
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Windows Store app will not launch in Windows 10</h2>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Not Compatible with &#34;Air Display &#40;Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> egartley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Not Compatible with &#34;Air Display &#40;Microsoft - WDDM 1.1&#41;&#34; Driver</h2>
                    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp;Disregard the nonsense below. Just look through the various solutions offered in the replies. Basically, install Air Display again and perform a
<em>clean</em> uninstall which should remove the driver.<br />
<br />
<del>What can I do solve this problem, so I can run Windows 10? I have tried uninstalling this driver, but upon reboot it reinstalls itself, which tells me it may be necessary for normal system function (with my monitor?). Another thing I have tried is looking
 for an update to this driver, but I cannot find any update for it, whether it being 1.2 or 1.3. One thing I read was that version 1.2 of this driver was supposed to be installed with Windows 8.1, but that was not the case for me when I updated from Windows
 8 to 8.1. Thanks in advance for any possible solution!</del></p>

            Late replies ftw! So apparently Air Display is a streaming service that allows you to stream your PC to you phone/tablet. Not essential at all. In order to get rid of it though is a bit tricky...You have to download the air display client from the air
 display website and do a clean uninstall from the air display folder. Viola, Air display is gone from the device manager. I had this same problem :/ though, it still shows in my Get Windows 10 App that my PC isn't windows 10 ready (by god I exceed the system
 requirments) but the last run was on july 22 and from what I've read it runs once every month. So even if you have the drivers all gone and this is still there, I don't think it's really a major issue. Hell, who am I kidding. I haven't gotten the early pre-load
 yet D:

<p>Have any other Gold members been unable to purchase "Resident Evil 4" at the discounted Gold price of $6.49? I tried to purchase it earlier this week and it indicated my card would be charged $19.99. Earlier today I renewed my Gold membership with a three-month
 code, and still Live would only let me purchase the game for $19.99. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>still shows you as silver on the forums how long ago did you do the gold? &nbsp;sometimes it takes a bit for the servers to realize you did, &nbsp;you can either run a speed test on your console or redlownload your profile which would give you the more up to date
 and now gold profile good luck.</p>
