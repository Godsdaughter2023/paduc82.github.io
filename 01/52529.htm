<h2>            Can&#39;t log on with correct password</h2>
                    I am unable to log onto Win10 with my correct password. &nbsp;I have tried unplugging computer and removing batteries. &nbsp;This did allow my computer to install updates when I plugged back in. &nbsp;Still could not log on. &nbsp;I do not have a usb backup to restore password.
 i am very frustrated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that. I can imagine that must be frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the query, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What happens when you enter the password? Do yo receive any error message?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes to the system prior to the issue?</p>
<p>3. Are you able to login to <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/</a> using the same Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, confirm the correct password is getting entered with some simple checks before resorting to more extreme measures:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on the “eye” icon in the password field and view the password before hitting Enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Verify the keyboard layout wasn’t changed during the upgrade, causing you to enter unexpected characters when typing.&nbsp; Press the Windows Key and the Spacebar at the same time to check the keyboard language and layout.&nbsp; While holding
 the Windows Key, press the spacebar repeatedly to change the keyboard layout.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>From another device, verify that you can successfully sign into
</span><a href="http://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://account.live.com</span></span></a><span> with the same Microsoft account email and password.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If that doesn't help, try resetting the password by clicking the link below and try again.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why can't you sign in?</a></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let us know the result.</span></p>

            I clicked on the eye icon and saw that the password was correct. I received no results when I pressed the Windows key and spacebar. I can log on to my Windows account online on another device. &nbsp;This is not the password I use to logon to my PC running Windows.
 &nbsp;It worked fine after updating to Windows 10. &nbsp;I hadn't used the PC for awhile and just discovered my password no longer works. I'm going to try the link above to "Why can't you sign in?" &nbsp;Will let you know if it works. &nbsp;I talked to Microsoft yesterday, but
 was told to wait 24 hours and try to login again. Bah humbug!

            <p>If you are upgrading from an existing version of Windows (7 SP1 or 8.1 Update) and you already have Windows Essentials, I'd imagine it would still be there after the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are buying a new computer with Windows 10 (once they are available), I'd assume that Movie Maker and Photo Gallery would be already installed. But even if they aren't, you can just go to the

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a frustrating problem with multiple controllers on my Xbox One X... where my controllers freeze (light still on) and upon hard powering the controller off or removing and replacing batteries, the problem persists... the controllers work
 when wired though... and I've replaced my first Xbox One X for the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have the same issue or can anyone advise on a solution or fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your time in reading this and input will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Plee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue that is being experienced having to do with the Xbox One wireless controller not turning off when removing/replacing the batteries, or that you also cannot use the controller even though it is turned on indicated by the light of the logo?</p>

<p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw that you mentioned that the controllers work fine when wired. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance of some type wireless interference in your room or that part of your home that might be affecting the controllers?</p>
<p>(ex: wireless home telephone, blue tooth equipment) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried moving the Xbox to another part of your home&nbsp;to see if the controller problem persists?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would suggest trying a friend / or neighbor's Xbox controller to see if the problem continues with their controllers as well.

    <title>Strange searchindexer.exe, searchfilterhost.exe, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabrielmccall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange searchindexer.exe, searchfilterhost.exe, and searchprotocolhost.exe slow down computer when running</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to all this, but I think I may have some kind of virus that utilized these three files:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\SearchIndexer.exe</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\SearchFilterHost.exe</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\SearchProtocolHost.exe<br />
<br />
I find all three of these processes in task manager. The thing is that the Services for these are disabled and when I ask task manager to point to the services there are none highlighted. This leads me to think that these processes have been hijacked. I can
 close these processes if I do it in the correct order, but they always come back even though the services for search indexing are disabled.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My system becomes periodically unresponsive to mouse input and it happens only when these processes are running. This is very annoying trying to play bubble island in a browser online because the mouse locks up. I think this behavior could be indication of
 a larger issue. Neither AVG no Microsoft Security Essentials finds any threats.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
SearchIndexer.exe is the Windows service that handles indexing of your files for Windows Search, which fuels the file search engine built into Windows that powers everything from the Start Menu search box to Windows Explorer, and even the Libraries feature.<br />
If you take a look at the file properties, you can clearly see that this particular executable is the Indexer component for Windows Search—though the name probably gave that away already.<br />
<br />
If you want to stop the service from running, you can open up Services through Control Panel, or type in services.msc into the Start Menu search box. Once you’re there, you can find Windows Search in the list and click the Stop button<br />
So, you can be assured that these are no virus to be afraid of and hence you can just stop them if you don’t want them to run.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps below.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 1</span></strong>: I would suggest you to try disabling the .XML file extension from being indexed in the Indexing Options and check if the issue is fixed.<br />
You may refer the below mentioned link to add or remove index locations.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Improve-Windows-searches-using-the-index-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Improve-Windows-searches-using-the-index-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 2</span></strong>: Additionally you may also perform a full system scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner to eliminate any issues related to virus/malware.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Hope this information helps you!</span></p>

            The problem is that the service IS STOPPED and DISABLED, but these processes start and somehow run anyway periodically stealing resources without any service running behind them. I finally stopped the problem by cutting and pasting the offending files
 to my desktop where it is not capable of running.<br />
<br />
<p>C:\Windows\System32\SearchIndexer.exe</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\SearchFilterHost.exe</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\SearchProtocolHost.exe<br />
<br />
</p>
These three files are now sitting happily in a folder on my desktop because I transplanted them there instead of deleting them outright in case the system then broke and I needed to use a linux program to move the files again and "repair" the system. I still
 have them if anyone wants to look at them. =0)<br />
<br />
So, no services connected to the processes is extremely strange to me. MS Security Essentials did not find anything strange, but I can try the security scanner on them. =0) Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>

    <title>Directx11.3 version for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Directx11.3 version for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title: directx and windows 10 update</strong></p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from windows 7 sp1 to windows 10 with</p>
<p>
</p><p>acer 7750G laptop</p>
<p>i7-2630qm</p>
<p>8GB ram</p>
<p>6650M (1GB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I updated&nbsp;the computer&nbsp;to windows 10&nbsp;I just wanted to see if I had any performance issues or program backwards compatibility so I downloaded steam and installed one of my games. it does that first run where it installs anything it needs for the game
 to run and I noticed it installing directx. when it finished the first time skyrim scanned my pc it selected ultra high settings as default and I was able to get 25-30fps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked directx diagnostic tool and I was running directx 11.3. I didn't take a screenshot cause I thought that would be the version of directx I could get.</p>
<p>So I formatted my pc and did a fresh install of windows 10 and was able to load just two of the drivers I really need to make my computer run and the rest is just acer bloatware and windows 10 seemed to just installed the rest of what was needed like wifi
 Bluetooth etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>but ever since I did the fresh install I can no longer get directx 11.3. I can not recreate what I did and now what ever I do I get 11.2 directx. skyrim runs in ultra high now 16-21fps using 11.2 directx.
<br />
<br />
I ran directx 11.3 and gained performance, is there anyone that can help me figure out why I cant get 11.3 directx again PLEASE?</p>

<h2>            Is it true that I can&#39;t transfer files to my Windows 8.1 tablet using a USB cable&#63;</h2>
                    I am a bit of a tablet luddite, and I definitely do not want to use clouds or the internet to accomplish a simple task. &nbsp;All I want to do is transfer files and maybe outlook/office settings between my tablet and work/home PCs. &nbsp;The desktop at work is Win7
 Pro. Tablet is a Lenovo Ideapad with Windows 8.1 (pretty sure not RT). &nbsp;When i plug the tablet into a USB port on the desktop I get nothing. &nbsp;The tablet is charging, so the connection is there, but they can't see each other. &nbsp;Lenovo says that you cannot transfer
 files over a physical connection to a Win8.1 tablet, which seems like it has to be incorrect. &nbsp;Please tell me if it can be done over physical connection, or if I must establish a homegroup, how, or whether I really do have to use a cloud thing.

            So the answer is cloud or ad hoc network. &nbsp;Do not want choice A or complicated choice B. &nbsp;My phone, my android tablet, my laptop, all can connect to each other and share files with a cord. If I had known I would have bought different equipment. In case
 of my office computer, they are not both wireless either, so I am not sure an ad hoc network will work for me, but I need to investigate that since they are on a network in the office so I might be able to finagle it. &nbsp;But at least I know what I can't do,
 so thank you for replying.

Well I don't get this.<br />
How did you install it?

            This is weird.&nbsp; My father just called me tonight with the same problem.<br />
<br />
He has Windows 7 Ultimate and Office Pro 2007 SP2.&nbsp; His laptop is only about a month old, so it's fairly clean.&nbsp; It's a Dell Latitude E6400.&nbsp; Office was pre-installed.<br />
<br />
I looked at the system using Remote Assistance, but I couldn't find an obvious&nbsp;explanation.&nbsp; Unfortunately, every time Outlook is started,&nbsp;the UAC prompt comes up and I can no longer see or interact with his computer.&nbsp; He must click on Yes before I can see
 his screen again and resume control.&nbsp; Therefore, I never actually see the UAC message.<br />
<br />
One thing that we noticed is that the digital signature for OUTLOOK.EXE expired on January 22, 2010.&nbsp; Perhaps now Windows trusts Outlook less because&nbsp;the certificate expired?&nbsp; The timing of this problem makes the certificate suspect.<br />
<br />
I also checked WINWORD.EXE (Word starts&nbsp;up just fine without a UAC prompt), and it's certificate also expired on the same day.&nbsp; Therefore, maybe the certificate isn't the problem.<br />
<br />
My father&nbsp;has some other software installed that probably plugs in to Outlook and could have an impact, including:<br />
<br />
- Norton AV (pre-installed by Dell)<br />
- Adobe Acrobat (pre-installed by Dell)<br />
- Microsoft Office Outlook Connector (installed by me so that he can pull Hotmail into Outlook)<br />
<br />
Maybe there is something about this combination that causes the UAC prompt.&nbsp; However, all of this software has been installed since he started using the laptop, and the prompts just started now.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be happy to hear 'em.&nbsp; I&nbsp;might not&nbsp;have an opportunity to test any suggestions for a few weeks though, so I'm not a good candidate for immediate feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            <p>Hi Jerace</p>
<p>If you are dragging the document window with the mouse, this is probably the Windows Snap feature that is resizing the window to full screen.</p>
<p>This happens when the mouse cursor is dragging a window and the cursor touches the top of the screen.</p>
<p>You can disable this feature, if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> / <strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>. Scroll down and select the
<strong>Make it easier to focus on tasks</strong> link.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Scroll down to the bottom and place a <strong>check mark</strong> in the
<strong>Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click <strong>Apply</strong> / <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Problem with NTFS</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to mount an .iso file about 20 GB in size, however, the following error pops up every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Make sure that the file is in an ntfs volume and isnt in a compressed folder or volume."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The volume where the file is located is surely NTFS. There is no compression of any kind performed on the file, so I am kinda clueless about this error message. All this started recently after one of the automatic updates. I had no similar problems previously.</p>

            <p>In the second image where the second group of tiles is on the start screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your monitors resolution capabilities, current resolution, and resolution after the issue shows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers can cause this or the graphics card software. I would guess the issue may have something to do with the browser add on that captures YouTube videos. Perhaps running IE in no addon mode and checking. Task bar looks okay to me how does it look to you?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to see whTs going on you can attach Visual Studios debugger and watch what is happening

                    <p>COMPUTER HARD DISK DRIVES MEMORY / STORAGE - C: HAS 19.1 GB IS THAT STILL ENOUGH FOR COMPUTER TO WORK CORRECTLY ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my lack of knowledge on this but I have never had any training / education on Computing - also please excuse any incorrect Computing terminology.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Computer Hard Disks are showing these amounts of Memory / Storage are available:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ACER [C:] 19.1 GB Free of 141 GB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DATA [F:] 109 GB Free of 141 GB</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Am I correct in thinking that the ACER [C:] Hard Disk would contain my Windows 7 Home Premium Operating system and all of the Programs that I have downloaded onto my Computer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the DATA [F:] Hard Disk would contain things such as Documents, Photos &amp; Videos and PDF`s etc. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If I am correct in those assumptions would Members think that the 19.1 GB Free on the ACER [C:] Hard Disk should remain enough Free Memory / Storage to enable my Computer to keep working correctly ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no plans to download / install any large Programs onto my Computer in the future I am just hoping that it will remain `stable` with this small percentage of the ACER [C:] Hard Disk 141 GB Memory left.</p>

<p>Hello JimWynne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You very much for your reply to my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I am really only concerned about whether my Computer`s C: Hard Drive has enough Memory / Storage left to allow the Computer to operate correctly could You please comment further about what type of data any Computer`s Data F: Hard Drive stores.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am obviously not questioning exactly what is stored within my Computer`s Data F: Drive - just what type of things are on every Computer`s F: Drive ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct when I asked whether it <span>would contain things such as Documents, Photos &amp; Videos and PDF`s etc. ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With regard to the C: Drive I am hoping that I can obtain enough information / confidence to enable me to create more space / memory by uninstalling some rarely used Programs - is it as simple as that ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again for your interest and message - I would really welcome a further reply please.</span></p>

<p>Most Windows computers do not have an F: drive.&nbsp; A standard, run-of-the-mill Windows installation has a C: drive and -- at least until fairly recently -- a D: drive that is an optical disk (CD/DVD) drive (because most new software is downloaded from the
 Internet rather than purchased as a physical CD or DVD, computer manufacturers save a bit of money, space, and weight by eliminating the CD/DVD drive).</p>

<p><strong>Hello LemP,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You very much for replying to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that You will not mind me writing a brief reply tonight as it is quite late for me to be using my Computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the Disk Management facility and it showed my Computers C: Drive and it`s F: Drive -<strong> there is no D: Drive.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that for some reason my Computer / operating system has identified the `Data` Drive as&nbsp; F: ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The C: Drive and the F: Drive are on the same line on Disk 0 with a small recovery partition.</strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6aa30fd2-c178-44d2-b097-7c90190b8fd5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6aa30fd2-c178-44d2-b097-7c90190b8fd5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As You asked I hope that I have attached a screenshot of that and one showing the `Computer` section from the Start menu which also shows what Free Memory is available on the ACER C: Hard Drive and the DATA F: Hard Drive
<strong>- which is what prompted me to post the original question on here [the 19 GB free memory on the C: Drive].</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that this does not get too complicated - as I mentioned in an earlier message Children have more knowledge and experience on Computing than me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your interest and help I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the screenshots.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You have one hard drive that was split into two equal partitions (the small 16 GB partition appears to be where Acer has stored the "return to factory settings" image and related recovery software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usual reason that partitioning like this was done was to put user data (as you surmised,
<span>Documents, Photos &amp; Videos and PDF`s etc.) in a partition separate from the operating system (Windows).&nbsp; Although it seemed like a good idea when first thought of, it leads to the problem you now
 have, where the operating system's partition is about to run out of space.</span></p>
<p>What I had really wanted to see was the contents of D: , which you will see if you double-click on the D: drive in your second image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way you can confirm that the D: drive is where your user data is located is simply to find one of your documents, one of your photos, one of your PDF files, etc., right-click on the file and select "Properties."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see something like this (ignore the box around the "Change" button, that's just an image I found online):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a13d3d34-abf7-4801-a0bc-2fbad654e270?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a13d3d34-abf7-4801-a0bc-2fbad654e270?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Look at what follows "Location" -- it probably will start with D:</p>
<p>Please post a screenshot of the Properties page from one of your documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said all of the above, almost 87% of your C: drive is filled up.&nbsp; That's skating a bit too close to the edge for comfort and you should try to take some steps to clean things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Click Start, type Disk Cleanup in the Search box, and press Enter</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The C: drive should be selected by default, but if not be sure that it shows in the drop-down window:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c6f17b7-c440-4c0b-acf3-c7e3c439813a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c6f17b7-c440-4c0b-acf3-c7e3c439813a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Click the OK button</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Select all of the boxes on the next screen and click OK (you can clean up more by clicking the "Cleanup System Files" button, but we'll leave that be for now)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdf86227-93d1-4e94-8811-2b2e84b1fbdf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdf86227-93d1-4e94-8811-2b2e84b1fbdf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; How much space is free on your C: drive now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Download TreeSize Free from <a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; If there is a "TreeSize Free (Administrator)" shortcut in the Start Menu, use that to start TreeSize Free.&nbsp; Otherwise, right-click on the shortcut to TreeSize Free and select "Run as administrator"</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; When TreeSize Free starts, click "Select Disk" in the toolbar and then select "Local Disk C:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.&nbsp; Click on "Size" in the header row to sort the entries by size.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hello again LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You very much for your reply and for going into so much detail while trying to help me - Sorry that I did not see your message until Today / Monday afternoon I was not at home yesterday / Sunday.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As we discussed previously I don`t have a D: Hard Disk showing anywhere on my Computer or on any of the screenshots that I attached to my previous reply to you.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what You suggested and looked at the Properties for various Photos, Documents and Files -
<strong>they were all showing as located on the C: Drive not as I thought on the F: Drive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried checking the Properties of at least a hundred Files all of them show the location as being various sections of the C: Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am attaching some screenshots as you asked - please excuse me if these and the other screenshots are not attached in order.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I already had the TreeSize program on my Computer and I used it as you suggested to scan the C: Drive - I have attached the Scan result screenshot and also a screenshot of the Windows file expanded to show what you asked for regarding the top few files.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ccb04c0-1e4d-44bc-bbb7-d19c6e39214c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ccb04c0-1e4d-44bc-bbb7-d19c6e39214c?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c64dad86-d2cd-41db-bba2-fb2711febf5d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c64dad86-d2cd-41db-bba2-fb2711febf5d?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd9efc0c-9220-4858-b7ec-e2d8725e2206?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filest
<p>
</p><p>I also ran Disk Cleaner and this showed that there is 9.59 GB which can be gained on the C: Drive - I am attaching a screenshot showing only largest items found because the onscreen box display will not show all of the items.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However before allowing the clean up I wanted to ask you whether it is O.K. to remove the largest item which is `Windows Update Cleanup` = 9.56GB ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to make sure that I don`t remove that without checking whether it should remain on my Computer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some further guidance on the above please.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thank You very much for your interest, time, knowledge and advice regarding these enquiries.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: I have also attached a Screenshot of a TreeSize scan of the F: Drive in case this shows anything helpful ?</strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/992a582d-b74a-4586-98d6-c9d18842baf5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/992a582d-b74a-4586-98d6-c9d18842baf5?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>1.&nbsp; In general, it is safe to let Disk Cleanup to remove "Windows Update" files.&nbsp; The effect of deleting these files is that you will not be able to reverse previously installed Windows Updates.&nbsp; If your system has been running satisfactorily for a while,
 there's no reason that you should not delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; TreeSize Free shows that your Windows folder is using about 33 GB.&nbsp; That's fairly normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; TreeSize Free shows that the main use of the F: drive is two old system backups.&nbsp; First of all, it's never a good idea to have backup files on the same physical drive as the information that's being backed up.&nbsp; If the drive fails, you'll lose everything.&nbsp;
 Second, those are very old (2011 and 2012).&nbsp; You can keep them if you think you'll need them for historical reasons or delete them.&nbsp; Your choice.&nbsp; On this score, I noticed a backup from 2018 on your C: drive.&nbsp; You might want to look at that to see what it
 is and if you still want to keep it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; What I suggest you do is move your personal user data folders (My Documents, My Photos, etc.) from C: to F:.&nbsp; If you were to move all of these folders, you'll free up about 62 GB on C:.&nbsp; See the directions for moving these folders here:&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>For example, to move your My Documents folders, on the "Location" tab of the Properties for that folder, change</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Chris\Documents</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F:\Chris\Documents</p>
<p>and then click OK, followed by clicking YES.</p>

<p>Hello LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You very much for your very detailed message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your information about this I did use the Disk Cleaner to remove the <strong>
Windows Update Cleanup file - 9.56 GB </strong>- but for some reason there is no increase in Free Memory showing on the C: Drive - in fact it has reduced to 18.2 GB although I have definitely not downloaded any software or anything else - certainly nothing
 that would be almost 1 GB in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did look in the Recycling Bin just in case the file had been `deleted` into there - my lack of knowledge on the Disk Cleaner removal procedure - but it had not been -<strong> I wonder what happened to the 9.56 GB which was supposed to have been `freed
 up` ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get some free time to try and re-read and understand the How to Geek article better I will attempt moving the categories that you suggested to the F: Drive - Photos, Videos, Documents etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first read the article and found the `CHRIS` File where these various File categories are located I did try selecting Music - going to `Properties` - clicking on to `Location` and `Move`&nbsp; but I could not then find the exact `address` / File name [excuse
 lack of terminology] to be sure that I would be sending the File to the DATA F: Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did wonder if I could just type in the new Location as just&nbsp; F:&nbsp; &nbsp;?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I know that this should be very simple but is it as simple as typing in the new F: Drive location as:&nbsp; &nbsp;F:\Users\CHRIS\Music&nbsp; &nbsp;?&nbsp; [</strong><strong>It currently is:&nbsp; C:\Users\CHRIS\Music]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>And then using the same Location `address` -&nbsp;</strong><strong>F:\Users\CHRIS\</strong>insert File type here<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;for all of the other File types - Documents, Pictures etc. ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I picked my <strong>Music File / Folder </strong>to try out the transfer to the F: Drive because there is almost nothing in it and if I lost it I would not be annoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the Back Up`s that You mentioned - I have been using an External Hard Drive -
<strong>Free Agent Go Flex 500 GB </strong>- for my Computers Back Up`s for the last 7 Years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I started using the External Hard Drive I kept the old Back Up`s on my Computer just in case I ever needed to revert back to one of them in an emergency / severe malfunction<strong> - please excuse my ignorance if that is not desirable / possible ?&nbsp;</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to find out what is on the Back Up from 2018 that You mentioned clicking onto it on the TreeSize scan results did not show any understandable information regarding exactly what it contained - it did show `CHRIS` and some Documents, Pictures
 etc. but I don`t really want to either delete it or try and Move / Alter any of this without having better knowledge on what it contains.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a13a6876-c8f6-4336-8d26-61154c373e00?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a13a6876-c8f6-4336-8d26-61154c373e00?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Backing Up my Computer in the past I have only done `Full Back Ups` with the occasional `System Image`&nbsp; -&nbsp; I have attached a screenshot of my External Hard Drive contents list.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thank You very much again for your help with this - I really appreciate it.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>The folder that should get smaller when you select "Windows Update Cleanup" as one of the items for Disk Cleanup to delete is C:\Windows\winsxs.&nbsp; In your screenshot above, that folder shows as using about 15.7 GB.&nbsp; Run TreeSize Free for the C: drive again
 and see if winsxs is smaller.</p>

<p>Just leave everything currently on F: as it is.&nbsp; It's only taking up about 32 GB or about 23%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you should consider that the most common reason why computer users have to restore from backup is because a hard drive has failed.&nbsp; If you've been using the same internal hard drive since 2011, you're getting close to having a problem (see next
 paragraph).&nbsp; And as I wrote earlier, if your backups are on the same physical drive (both your C: "drive" and your F: "drive" are on the same physical device), if that physical drive fails, you'll lose both the main data and the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Most consumer grade hard drives have a 3 to 5 year life expectancy (although I have to admit that my own hard drives are about 7 years old).&nbsp; The best study of hard drive life was done by BackBlaze in early 2014:&nbsp; https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-long-do-disk-drives-last/&nbsp;
 They continue to publish statistics, but its a bit daunting to read through the articles:&nbsp;

<p>Hello again LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse me for not replying sooner - a member of my Family has been hospitalised so I have been very preoccupied with worrying and other tasks / family matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>In reply to your message - when I previously wrote this:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did look in the Recycling Bin just in case the file had been `deleted` into there - my lack of knowledge on the Disk Cleaner removal procedure - but it had not been -<strong>&nbsp;I wonder what happened to the 9.56 GB which was supposed to have been `freed
 up` ?</strong><strong>&nbsp; -&nbsp; End of Quote.</strong><br />
</p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p>I meant that after I carried out the Disk Cleaner removal of the Windows Update Cleanup file [9.56 GB] I was expecting the 9.56 GB to have been added to the available free space / free memory on my
<strong>Computer`s</strong><strong> C: Drive</strong> - approximately 9.56 GB added to the 19.1 GB that was showing as `Free` on my Computer`s C: Hard Drive.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No additional Free space / Free memory was showing after the Disk Cleaner process however when I shut down my Computer on that day a Windows Update configuration / `Do not turn off your Computer` message was displayed on the screen for over 2 Hours and
<strong>when my Computer restarted there was 23.6 GB of Free storage / Free Memory showing on my C: Hard Drive.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Removing the 9.56 GB Windows Update Cleaner file added 4.5 GB to the Free Space / Free Memory on my Computer`s C: Hard Drive - I wonder where the balance of the 9.56 GB went ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not even look at Windows - winsxs previously because I was only looking for free Space / Free Memory to be added to the C: Drive - however I did run TreeSize again at your suggestion and it showed winsxs = 10,558.2 MB.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your comments about only having Back Up`s stored on my Computer - I did mention in my last message that I have been using an External Hard Drive for Back Up`s for the last 7 Years -<strong> here is what I wrote:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>With regard to the Back Up`s that You mentioned - I have been using an External Hard Drive -&nbsp;</span><strong>Free Agent Go Flex 500 GB&nbsp;</strong><span>- for my Computers Back Up`s for
 the last 7 Years. - <strong>End of Quote.</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I kept the old Back Up`s on my Computer just in case the External Hard Drive did not work correctly if I ever tried to use it to return my Computer`s Programs and Data after a serious malfunction - most of the Programs
 and quite a lot of the stored Photos and Documents were put onto my Computer during 2009 - 2012 so I thought that being able to revert back to that state would be better than having to possibly `Go to Factory Settings` or similar ?</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>With regard to me trying to experiment by moving my Computer`s `Music` file from the C: Drive to the F: Drive - I tried that and received the Error message that I attached a screenshot of by following the procedures
 in the article that you very kindly gave me the link to here:</span></span></p>
