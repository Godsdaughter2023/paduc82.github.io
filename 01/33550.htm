<h2>            Win7 Home, trying to install SP1 but gets stuck at 14&#37; before it restarts</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to install the SP1 update though the Windows Update. It downloaded OK and when promted to restart I let it do so. But now it keeps getting stuck on stage 1 at 9% for over an hour, before finally getting up to 14% and restarting itself.
 It has done this 3 times now and the only way I can use my laptop at the moments is by forcing it to start in Safe mode (which is what I'm doing now.)</p>
<p>Can someone advise me on what I should do to resolve this? Would a System restore be enough?</p>

<p>If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; 2011). Unlike
 previous Service Packs, Windows 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; 2009. If you have been diligently updating
 your computer through Windows Update since then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy to<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup
 your computer</a> . The built in system imaging and backup and restore center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method
 carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. </li><li>Accept User Account Control permission </li><li>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, proceed with the installation. </li></ul>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD </li><li>Click ‘Run as Administrator’ </li><li>At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f </li></ul>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

<p>Mine installed right through to shutting down your computer - configuring Windows updaye (similar to your question). After about an hour stuck at 15% done I got frustrated and switched it off - contrary to the instrcution. I then restarted with the on switch
 - W7 took a while to load, but then gave a message saying finalising update and scrolled through the remaining 85% (a scrolling text message white text on W7 screen) before opeing the welocme page. It then configured installation&nbsp; and came up with a installation
 complete message. Now working fine with SP1 installed.</p>
<p>I would ahve thought that an acreditted update from the 'big boys' would have worked smoothly?</p>
<p>Hope this helpsother users!</p>

<h2>            Multiple Card SD SDHC reader doesn&#39;t work Samsung NF310 netbook</h2>
                    Multiple card reader (sd/sdhc/sdxc/mmc) on my Samsung NF310 doesn't work.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have tried uninstalling all USB controllers; separately I have tried uninstalling just the mass storage device driver; separately just the multiple card reader usb device driver; and separately the WPD driver; and separately all at once; reboot after each
 attempt-- nothing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have also tried different cards, different driver versions of USBSTOR/PARTMGR/DISK/WPD-RELATED and all INF versions.<br />
<br />
I have tried SP1 pre and post. No go.<br />
<br />
Pre and post Intel IMSM/Chipset update (All versions available);&nbsp;<br />
<br />
pre and post mounted devices deletion;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
clean windows 7 install; post recovery CD clean install; 3rd party drivers (alcor/jmicron/sd-only drivers/transcend/etc.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried re-assigning drive letters to the device which is ONLY possible on SD cards (which show a drive) but not on SDHC cards (all of which flash a drive in both disk management and in explorer before disappearing). I have tried drive letters E-T to no
 avail. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have disabled defender/anti-malware/anti-virus/firewall, etc. checked for errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the hardware side, I have &nbsp;tried inserting slowly, more quickly, part-way, etc. In safe-mode. No go.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I assumed the hardware is bad and damaged, and as a last ditch effort tried using the drive in XP and Vista. The drive worked flawlessly for all of my SD and SDHC cards! Windows 7 utilizes the generic multiple card reader for my printer-based external
 SD/SDHC card reader and that works fine!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But I can't get the internal multiple card reader to work under Windows 7 (and no external USB-related programs installed) Any thoughts?</div>

<h2>            Windows can&#39;t communicate to a device or resource &#40;primary DNS server&#41;</h2>
                    I am having a problem with my internet and that is the troubleshooting message i get.
<div>I use a Thompson RCA modem but the real problem is my router, when i just connect the computer directly to the modem, it works.,but is slow to find the IP&nbsp;address. When i connect through my router, it just&nbsp;instantly&nbsp;gives my no internet access. You may
 not find this a problem, but i cannot connect my&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;for some reason, it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;find the IP address. My router is a Linksys Wireless G Broadband router with speedbooster Model WRT45GS. It was working fine for about 3 months but now it all of a sudden doesn't
 work anymore. Also, this error started happening about a week after I flushed my computer because of a virus and i haven't put my files back yet. I have tried these things:</div>
<div>Resetting router</div>
<div>Resetting router to factory default</div>
<div>CPU restart</div>
<div>Modem restart</div>
<div>Router restart</div>
<div>Modem and Router at the same time restart</div>
<div>Microsoft Fix It: Flush DNS</div>
<div>Connecting my Xbox directly to the modem</div>
<div>Obtain IP and DNS&nbsp;automatically</div>
<div>Make sure DHCP is enabled&nbsp;</div>
<div>I haven't tried a new router yet, I have an old one that may not work but I will try that.</div>
<div>Things left to try:</div>
<div>New cable</div>
<div>New router</div>
<div>IP config/ manual DNS Flush</div>
<div>Please help me out here &nbsp;</div>

<p>Unfortunately, then we cannot help as the router admin need to be accessed. You can contact your ISP(Internet Service Provider) for better assistance.

</blockquote>
If you reset the router to factory defaults (number 2 on your list), the password to access the router's configuration utility was also reset.&nbsp; To reset Linksys routers to factory settings, you need to press the reset button (usually with a straightened paper
 clip) for at least 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
After resetting your router, however, you may have needed to reconfigure it to properly connect to your modem by following the directions from your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; Did you do that?<br />
<br />
For Linksys routers, you leave the user name blank and enter admin (all lower case) as the password.<br />
<br />
Let's start with some diagnostic information.<br />
<br />
What version of Windows are you using?&nbsp; You asked your question in a Windows 7 forum; are you using Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, etc? Have you installed Service Pack 1?<br />
<br />
It sounds as if you are connecting your computer using an Ethernet cable rather than wireless.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; Or did you connect "directly to the modem" by using an Ethernet cable but attempted to connect wirelessly to the WRT54GS router?<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Connect the computer to the <b>router</b>.</li><li>Open a Command Prompt window (for Windows 7, search for cmd and then click on cmd.exe)</li><li>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter</li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /all &gt; %userprofile%\Desktop\ipinfo.txt<br />
<ul>
<li>Now connect the computer to the <b>modem</b></li><li>Probably unnecessary, but restart the computer and when it restarts, open a Command Prompt window as decribed above<b><br />
</b></li><li>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line</li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /all &gt;&gt; %userprofile%\Desktop\ipinfo.txt [note that there are two &gt;&gt; characters this time]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notepad %userprofile%\Desktop\ipinfo.txt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit<br />
<ul>
<li>Copy (Edit &gt; Select All, then Edit &gt; Copy) everything from the Notepad window and Paste (CTRL+V) into your Reply here</li><li>Close and delete ipinfo.txt from your Desktop</li></ul>

            Hi Derrick, honestly there is no way to move that folder without causing serious problems to your system.
<br />
<br />You will see fixes on the web, most will brick your system . . .
<br />
<br />This would have to be done just after Windows is installed and before any software was installed to be done correctly!
<br />
<br />Is there nothing else on your C drive that could be moved to your D Drive to provide more space on your C drive?

            Hi Derrick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can't move the Program Files, nor should you move apps or Programs off the C drive because they write registry keys to Windows that integrate them into the OS until they are uninstalled. 
<br />
<br /> If it's an SSD they also benefit most from the faster speeds, while files do not.  So I would move Files off following this tutorial:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            I have a 1 TB computer, and most of the 36GB that is taking up my C drive is my steam games, which I don't think need to be on my C drive. I also don't want to be just using the 100 GB on my C drive while I let my 1 TB D drive stay empty. So if I am understanding
 you correctly, I need to basically reinstall windows if I want to use my D drive. Would there be any way to move my games and stuff off of my Program files?

            You didn't say it is Steam games, which are different.  See here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/257472/how-to-painlessly-move-your-steam-library-to-another-folder-or-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/257472/how-to-painles...</a>
<br />
<br />Again, it's always best to have programs on the C drive for many reasons.  What can be moved more easily are User folders which I provided the most authoritative tutorial  you ignored.
<br />
<br />When you said you wanted to move Program files because they were 36gb there was no indication you had 100gb drive because eveyrone else who asks about this issue have much smaller drives.  You can afford to keep program files on C and use D for storage, moving User files as space is needed, and saving a System Image backup of C so you never need to reintsall if Windows becomes irreparable but can restore C from the stored image in 20 minutes - this is the modern way to reintsall. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 not working on interactive drawing apps &#40;7th space, flockmod, etc&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I don't want to come off as irked, im willing to compromise with this thing I bought thats ~$1000, but this just... This irks me<br />
<br />
I like the surface pro 4 for it's intuitiveness, being a laptop and a tablet at the same time, but when I realized that paint tool SAI didn't recognize the pressure sensitivity when making strokes for the pen, I knew something was up with this. Don't get me
 wrong, I'm simple minded, I'm not tech savvy (at least not with the newer stuff) but this seems to be more of a flaw the more I use this thing, and frankly this **** me off as a free artist.<br />
<br />
To the point - I cant have the pen be detected when using online interactive drawing apps like flockmod or 7th space, it doesn't move at all, doesn't draw at all on the applications themselves. It works when i use my finger, but you can see how that's such
 a compensation when drawing that's its just flat out impractical, I can't draw details on things using my fat nubs of fingers. I'm willing to compromise my artistic life when using this thing, but when it's just straight up not working the way I want it to,
 you can see how I may want a refund for this thing... I paid $1000 for it, and I expected it to be as easy and simple as the tablet I had before this (wacom bamboo fun pen&amp;touch). I'm missing that old piece of junk more and more. Basically... Is there any
 way around this problem of mine? Or is this just a fault of Microsoft's products?<br />
<br />
The only thing I have to say if the latter is true... I get it microsoft... Your not wacom, but when you make advertising about this being the new revolutionary thing, yet can't have simple backwards compatibility with older programs and it can't do it's job
 the way I want it too... You can see why I'm kind of pissed off... Yeah this is very opinionated, I'm unsure whether to post it as a question or discussion, it's a bit of both. I dunno, should I get a refund or is there a way around this? Call me picky, this
 is just frankly not taking my side into account when selling your product to me under the guise of it being an artistic tool and not some casual tablet thing to be a hipster on.<br />

                    <p><strong>My SkyDrive is not working properly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Files updated on one computer are not showing on another Windows 8.1 computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have spent 2 weeks on this problem with no positive results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have decided I want to use the more reliable Sync Center.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, "make files available offline"&nbsp;is not showing in the file's content menu.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

<p><strong>How do I get Sync Center to work on my Windows 8.1 computer?</strong></p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

    <title>Recurring &#34;0x00000124&#34; BlueScreen after several - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curlycarlos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurring &#34;0x00000124&#34; BlueScreen after several troubleshooting measures</h2>
                    Hi everyone, I've been having a recurring BlueScreen for a couple of months now, and after trying several things to fix it, it still occurs.<br />
<br />
Here are my computer specs; I built it myself:<br />
<br />
Antec 500W EarthWatts PSU<br />
Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3R Motherboard<br />
Intel Q6600 @ 2.40GHz (Stock Voltage)<br />
2GB DDR2 1066 G.SKILL RAM<br />
Sapphire ATI HD4850<br />
160GB Seagate HDD<br />
Rosewill PCI Wi-Fi card<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit<br />
<br />
If I've left anything out, please tell me. <br />
<br />
This BlueScreen happens at random times. I've had it while browsing the internet, playing games, and just being at my desktop. Here are the things I've done to try and fix it:<br />
<br />
- Downloaded the <span>Microsoft</span> hotfix for the STOP code. (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952681</a> )<br />
- Analyzed the DMP files with WinDbg, but each time it points to a different process. (left4dead.exe, firefox.exe, avgsrvca.exe, and sometimes just System)<br />
- Gotten the latest drivers for my PCI Wi-Fi card, which may be the problem.<br />
- Updated my BIOS for my Gigabyte Motherboard, and updated/uninstalled Gigabyte's Energy Saver Utility. (GSvr.exe)<br />
- Ran a test with memtest86+ to check for RAM errors, but no errors were found.<br />
- Disabled "C1E" in my BIOS. (<a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1451968&amp;SiteID=17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1451968&amp;SiteID=17</a> )<br />
- Attempted to install Microsoft's Intel Chipset Reliability Update, which failed. "This update does not apply to your system". (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936357/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936357/en-us</a>
 )<br />
- Lastly, I reinstalled Windows Vista about a week ago. While it was setting up things for my desktop, (the point where the helpful graphics tell about certain Vista features and below there's a progress bar) I received a BlueScreen with the same STOP code.
 Edit: This is WinSat.<br />
<br />
Other people claim it has to do with audio devices. My motherboard has support for Realtek HD Audio Output, so I'm using speakers through a jack. Regardless, I do have the newest Realtek drivers.<br />
<br />
In addition, the Microsoft Hotfix has pointed to PCI cards being the problem. I've used two Wi-Fi cards in this computer, (one and then the other, never both at once), and both have caused a problem, even with updated drivers. As I said, the Hotfix did not
 help.<br />
<br />
My computer runs extremely well besides this small detail, but it's the kind of thing I'd really love to fix, because at some point I'll lose some sort of work from the crash, etc.
<br />
<br />
I'm able to provide more information if you need it. If you have any tip for me, that would be fantastic. Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
<strong>FINAL EDIT: Due to the length of this topic, I'm posting the resolution here. After around four months of troubleshooting, the 0x00000124 "The system has encountered an uncorrectable hardware error" BlueScreen was caused by a
<em>faulty Intel Q6600 processor</em> . If you're having this sort of trouble and nothing else works, this could be the problem.</strong>

<p><span><span>Hello Alex,<span>&nbsp;
</span>I see that some folks have tried to help.<span>&nbsp; </span>I admire that they root this whole post and try to help.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, we pretty much have it down to the processor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s an unusual fault, but nonetheless, that seems to be the case.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your best bet, at this point, is to find another suitable processor and substitute with that.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You’ll probably need an adjusted chipset as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>That’s the only way we can rule out the processor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I know it seems cruel and unfair but, there it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>This is worth the read:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/sys/crash.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/sys/crash.htm</span></a></p>
<p><span>I was following that from here:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/mbsys/gen_Failure.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/mbsys/gen_Failure.htm</span></a></p>
<p><span>It all seems to point at the CPU.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You should note that a complete rebuild is probably not in the future, just replacement of failed parts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One in particular, and it’s not likely your mother board.</span></p>
<p><span>I still don’t know why Verifier can do what it does.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am now of the opinion that this tool is rather formidable in scope (much more so than I originally believed).<span>&nbsp;
</span>It would appear that this tool is capable of drilling through the system and causing anything that can fail, to do so.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I just unboxed the Performance Base 3 hours ago.&nbsp; Immediately it would not download or install updates.&nbsp; I rand the Windows Update Repair tool and got the updates though I still had to manually install the NVIDIA and INTEL processors in Device Manager (Even
 though they showed they were all already installed and "working properly".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am getting these error notices related to detaching the clipboard. Does anyone know how to resolve these?&nbsp; I appreciate any advice and guidance!</p>

search bar</strong> on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and type <strong>"NVIDIA Control Panel"</strong> a window will pop up saying
<strong>"Manage 3D Settings"</strong> under <strong>Preferred graphics processor,</strong> choose

<p>Hi Carlo,&nbsp;&nbsp; I so appreciate you taking the time to assist me with your wise guidance.&nbsp; So I did install the Firmware Updates via MSI files.&nbsp; I also opened the Nvidia Control Panel and the 3 D Setting was already set to AUTO-SELECT.&nbsp; I did re apply that default
 and closed out of the Panel.&nbsp; I rebooted the SB after the MSI files installed and STILL the same errors are happening...&nbsp; Immediately the red light comes on the detach key on the keyboard.&nbsp; This happens on its own when I have made no attempt to detach the
 clipboard.&nbsp; Then the error boxes appear and they now even include DROPBOX and OFFICE - saying (along with all the other warnings) that these programs 'may have to be closed before detaching' -&nbsp; I uninstalled the keyboard drivers and reinstalled them.&nbsp; I also
 ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it still shows:&nbsp; Missing or corrupt registry files" even though that had been addressed and supposedly FIXED yesterday.&nbsp; In the last few hours I did a complete factory reset and wiped the Book (there was only Dropbox
 website downloaded and Office 365).&nbsp; After re installing all the updates the SAME error is happening.&nbsp; The red light comes on the detach key; the detach icon on the screen is a shell of itself / only part of its image shows and the error boxes appear and they
 can NOT be cleared unless you wipe the book again to factory settings.&nbsp; MS Surface Tech support asked me to return it.&nbsp; I will do so in the morning.&nbsp; This is a terrible experience reminiscent - sadly - of all the problems with first edition SB.&nbsp; But thank
 you for your help.&nbsp; I TIRED....&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind regards,&nbsp; Mark</p>

<p>Hi Carlo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I received my replacement 1TB Performance Base SB last week.&nbsp; And while it did not have the immediate problem of not being able to detach the clipboard at all, I discovered what MS Engineers in Redmond confirmed to me a few days later (via a visit to
 the local Bellevue (Seattle) retail store:&nbsp; That if you choose HIGH PERFORMANCE in the NVIDIA Control Panel settings, you CAN NOT DETACH THE CLIPBOARD UNLESS ALL PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE OPEN ARE FIRST CLOSED.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booked an in store appointment as soon as I saw this happen and because the Bellevue Store (as I was told) is the one store in the US that has a direct connection with the MS Engineers in Redmond, WA, three in-store support technicians worked with my SB
 to reload the entire W10 OS via BMR wipe and Update; tested system disk idle (as it would idle at 100% all the time right out of the box on every system/program); Tech team confirmed that even after the BMR reload and installation of other programs that were
 missing, you CAN NOT detach the clipboard without closing all open programs or apps - if you have set the NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL option to HIGH PERFORMANCE.&nbsp; HOWEVER, you CAN detach the clipboard IF you have left that setting set to AUTO-DETECT in the NVIDIA
 CONTROL PANEL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two Redmond top engineers had two different explanations for the three in-store tech support people:&nbsp; "That is a feature of the new NVIDIA Card" - The other engineer of equal stature told the tech team, "It is an error we have not figured out how to correct
 but a fix is coming sooner than later."&nbsp; I believe the LATTER statement as did the 3 tech people in the Bellevue store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final RESOLUTION AND WORK COMPLETED STATEMENT ON my case/ticket reads:&nbsp; "Clean install of Windows; verified device issue when using "High Performance" setting - Rectified issue by switching 3 D graphics selection to "Auto-Detect" and informed customer
 of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is hard to believe that MS could launch the Performance Base models and not have caught this problem or that they knew about it and launched this anyway.&nbsp; For a computer that costs well over $3,000.00 for the 1TB model, this is very disappointing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the two Redmond Engineers and the in-store tech team wrote me an email thanking me for working with them&nbsp;in&nbsp; bringing the SB in for assessment and for allowing them to&nbsp;pull the Log Files for MS and reset the SB so they would know for certain the
 detach in "High Performance" mode was not a hardware issue but an software issue that needs to be resolved right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Carlo for your help!&nbsp; Happy Holidays.</p>

            <p>Hi Carlo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to add that I knew you were correct before I brought this replacement SB into the Bellevue Store.&nbsp; However I wanted to know if having to choose AUTO DETECT over HIGH PERFORMANCE to allow the clipboard to detach while programs were running was an
 error OR a feature.&nbsp; I also went into the store for this tune up because I could not get the idle to drop from 100% for all programs it was running.&nbsp; The tech team told me there were missing files and errors in the software that was pre installed or when I
 ran the downloads and updates upon unboxing this 1TB Performance Base Book.. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVALUABLE HELP and that of the MS tech team in Bellevue, WA MS Store and the Engineers in Redmond.</p>

<h3> sandyt_m2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Verifying isn&#39;t working. Won&#39;t send to new email to verify.</h2>
                    <p>Currently I'm using a Comcast email as my primary sign in email. &nbsp;However, I'm getting rid of Comcast, and want to use a Gmail address as my primary to sign into my Microsoft account. To do this I have to create an "alias" and make that my primary. &nbsp;However,
 you have to have that new email verified. I hit verify, then this box pops up giving me a choice to SEND EMAIL to verify, or to cancel. &nbsp;I hit SEND EMAIL to verify, and it will NOT send. I really need to change my email. what can I do. Obviously, I'm not all
 that computer savvy. I don't do too much on my computer. I'm a part of the horse and buggy age group, and would appreciate some simple instruction.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I suspect that the problem might be a temporary one. Suggest you to check this after some time (I.e. after 24-48 Hours). Also ensure that you have entered correct Email address, while adding Gmail as alias. Do check&nbsp;spam or trash folder
 on your Gmail account to ensure that the verification email shouldn't be caught there.</p>
<p>

            Hi  acatch4u, try running that command from the Windows Recovery Environment . . .
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Command Prompt
<br />From there run the sfc command and see if that completes . . .

<p>There are multiple trial and error steps that you can try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Find a flash drive that you can format ( &gt; or = 8 GB)</p>
<p>2) Create a bootable Windows 10 iso:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/9230-download-windows-10-iso-file.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Trial and error steps one:&nbsp;&nbsp; command prompt in safe mode</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Trial and error step two: &nbsp; Windows recovery command prompt:&nbsp; Administrator: X:\Windows\sytem 32\cmd.exe &gt; X:\sources &gt;
</p>
<p>type these commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) bcdedit | find "osdevice"</p>
<p>(Make note of the partition drive letter displayed in the result)</p>
<p>b) dism /image:M:\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions </p>
<p>(change M: to the partition drive letter displayed in step 4a) ( There is a space between \ / )</p>
<p>c) (reboot and attempt sfc /scannow in safe mode)</p>
<p>(To get into safe mode hold down the shift key and click power then restart &gt; hold shift while clicking restart &gt; open the computer's advanced troubleshooting menu &gt; click startup settings &gt; click safe mode with command prompt &gt; type sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) If the above steps fail then trial and error step three:&nbsp; reopen the Windows advanced troubleshooting menu on the iso &gt; command prompt &gt; admnistrator: X:\windows\system32\cmd.exe &gt; type:</p>
<p>sfc /scannow /offbootdir=M:\ /offwindir=M:\windows</p>
<p>(change the drive letters M: to the partition drive letter displayed in step 4a)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) If all of the above methods fail then trial and error step four:&nbsp; boot the computer normally and open file explorer.</p>
<p>In file explorer click on the Windows 10 iso and launch setup or setup.exe.</p>
<p>This is the method to perform an in place upgrade repair:</p>

<h2>            Toshiba WT8-A cant repair windows</h2>
                    <p>I was installing the new graphic driver on my toshiba wt8-a when I accidently allowed another program to reset, now windows is broken (i installed windows 10 and no longer have a backup partion)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I created a bootable repair disk on another pc and successfully booted it however i cannot pass the keyboard layout step as i cannot select any options because the intro is not touch enabled and i cant plug in a keyboard or mouse as i have a usb in the only
 mini usb drive nor is there a onscreen keyboard option (not that i can click it anyway)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i tried to recover the tablet from scratch by deleting the old boot keys, now im asked for a bit locker recovery key which i have but cannot enter as the menu is not touch enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and so i have no inputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the touchsceen works in the system settings so its a windows problem that touchscreen is not enabled on recovery drives and there is no onscreen keyboard option.... which is a little weird for windows 10!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway im moments from throwing this thing from my balcony.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone know if i can flash the drivers somehow?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and we will try to assist you in the best way we can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your situation, I would recommend that you re direct your query to your device manufacturer. This is so because of the fact that your recovery partition has been formatted&nbsp;which contains all the necessary details of your systems drivers.&nbsp;We will be
 unable to restore all the lost drivers as your system contained an OEM OS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your designated manufacturer&nbsp;(Toshiba) will be able to restore your lost recovery partition and make your device functional again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />You need to reboot your System. Perhaps you can't see the button with "Reboot now" due of some error. Please reboot your system and then check for update. If you see that nothing has been done, then delete content of "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and follow these commands:
<br />
<br />1. Digit "cmd" in windows search bar
<br />2. Right click on  "Command Prompt"
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator"
<br />4. Digit "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER
<br />
<br />Once done, check for update in Windows Update.
<br />
<br />P.s: Please, if the answer resolve your issue, click on Yes. Thanks.       
        </p>

            Hi Adrian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can use another PC to create the bootable media or download the ISO to transfer  back to the problem PC and open the media or click to mount the iSO file, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />If further problems then follow these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>New Skype Desktop version 8.13.0.3 Doesn&#39;t allow ringing on loud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> veggiemumof2  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype Desktop version 8.13.0.3 Doesn&#39;t allow ringing on loud speakers but in-call audio on Headset</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7.</p>
<p>My Skype desktop application has just updated itself to version 8.13.0.3. On previous version of Skype I could set the incoming calls to ring on my computer loud speakers (so I could hear it) but my in-call audio to work on my headset. Now this option has
 been taken away, there is only one setting for ALL audio. My 2 choices are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headset - I can make private calls, but can't hear it when someone is ringing me</p>
<p>Loud Speakers - I can hear when someone is ringing me, but I have my calls broadcast out loud (and still need to wear the headset for the microphone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please put this feature back! Is there a workaround? I think I'm going to have to go back to an old version of Skype (if possible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joanne</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>And as for your concern, you can choose which audio device to use as it is not possible to utilize those at the same time in the new version of Skype. Should you wish to revert back to the previous version, you can do so by installing it through out website,
 here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">www.skype.com</span></a></li><li>Click on <strong>Downloads.</strong></li><li>Click on the dropdown from the blue button.</li><li>Click on <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks for reply. As far as I'm concerned this is a critical issue, so I will have to revert back to "classic" Skype. Thanks for the link, that has saved me some time looking for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to hear when the issue has been resolved, as I've seen threads about the same problem with the Windows 10 app and it seems a lot of people view this requirement as critical.</p>

<p>Six months have gone by and this critical problem has not been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought a phone that, when somebody called you, it only rang through the handset it would be regarded as useless, unfit for purpose as unless you had the handset to your ear you wouldn't hear it ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's exactly the way it is with skype now.&nbsp; It's beyond comprehension that this major bug could go unfixed for so long.&nbsp; Does anybody in the Skype team actually use Skype?</p>

<p>Please be advised that your reply is insulting to all users who can no longer get skype to ring through their speakers while using headphones for audio.&nbsp; Really, do you not understand that this issue which has been raised for over six months in many forums
 by hundreds of user that this is a major problem with the new version of skype?&nbsp; At least every other Microsoft agent has acknowledged there is an issue.&nbsp; eg in this thread Karen_[01] (Microsoft Agent) said "<span>Do not worry,
 this has already been taken note and I'll take this directly to our development team"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Our concern is that the problem has not been fixed. Nobody ever denied there was a problem.&nbsp; Microsoft has always acknowledged there was a problem.&nbsp; Until now. With your reply, you are now denying there is even an issue.&nbsp; This is a new low.&nbsp; For crying out
 loud get across the issue before your invalidate the concerns of all the millions of users for whom this problem is a major impediment to their being able to use Skype effectively.</p>

<p><span>Hi Rodrigo,
</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to install any program from the CD ROM to your laptop? Or if you are referring to the Hardware (CD ROM drive) compatibility.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive any message about compatibility while installing the programs from the CD?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are referring to the CD ROM drive the hardware itself, you can install the hardware on any Windows operating system from Windows
 95 to Windows 7 and Windows will load the generic drivers for your CD ROM and it should works with all versions of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are installing a program from the CD to your notebook and receiving any message about compatibility, you may access the link below
 and follow the steps to install the program in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
