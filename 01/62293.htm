            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check if that helps.</p>
<p><br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />

<p>Note:</p>
<p><strong>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</strong></p>
<p>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run</strong>. </li><li>Type <span>msconfig</span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
The <strong>System Configuration Utility</strong> dialog box is displayed.
</li><li>Click the <strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>
Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. </li><li>When you are prompted, click <strong>Restart</strong> to restart the computer</li></ol>

<h2>            Skype To Go&#58; Most calls fail - free line signal audible, but silence once callee picks up</h2>
                    <p>Since two weeks, I am experiencing issues with Skype To Go. I am calling a direct call number that connects me to landline phone number abroad. The free line signal is audible as usual. At one point, the free line signal stops, but I can not hear anyone.
 After retrying the call three or four times, it finally works. On some ocassions, the callee reports that he picked up but did not hear anything. On other ocassions, the callee reports to have picked up and has heard me, but I was unable to hear him.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am calling the same standard landline phone number since years through this direct call Skype To Go number, and the service has been very reliable until recently. It seems Skype To Go is unable to make a connection once the callee picks up. I can safely
 exclude issues with microphones being muted, or speakers not working. The only workaround is to hang up and call again. Sometimes it works on the second attempt, sometimes on the third or fourth, sometimes immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very frustrating problem. Unfortunately, it seems that the only way to contact Skype about this problem is through the Microsoft community, as there appears to be no way to contact Skype customer service directly about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check what is the problem here. I have a landline call subscription and consider to cancel it if this problem remains, as it seems that there are technical issue on the Skype To Go side that need be addressed.</p>

            Issue remains and has not been resolved. One out of two to three calls remain without audio connection although it seems the connection was established.

            Nathaniel Mon - I tried to repair windows live mail but was unsuccessful due to an error 0x800c0006.&nbsp; I did not want to risk trying the clean boot without a technician present.&nbsp; I know that Windows Live Mail 2012 is being phased out and it is recommended
 to change to Outlook.com but I wish to continue using the current program which I have installed - (Windows Live Mail 2012.)&nbsp; There still seems to be a problem with actually adding a new contact to my contact list in Mail.&nbsp; Thank you for your help and if you
 can think of any other ways to resolve this issue I would be grateful.

            It is doubtful whether the scanner is compatible with Windows 8.1. You can refer to the following link to check DiMAGE Scan Dual IV compatibility:<br />

<br />
To confirm this and for further assistance, you are advised to contact the respective manufacturer.<br />

    <title>Left Analog Stick Drifting &#40;Second time&#47;controller in three - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karma cop52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left Analog Stick Drifting &#40;Second time&#47;controller in three months&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just finished up with warranty support and am having my X1 controller shipped back and replaced. The problem is with the Left Analog stick drifting. This is terminal in shooters such as Titanfall where aim and accuracy are easily half the battle.</p>
<p>My concern is that this is the second controller this has happened with and I only bought my x1 on Feb 6. I started playing Feb 24. The first controller Gamestop replaced for me out of courtesy even though they weren't required to. This one I didn't have
 the heart to bring back and don't think they could do anything for me. And ultimately it's not their fault.</p>
<p>The weird thing about this is I've used two controllers total for my 360 in the last four years. So this is either a gigantic fluke, or what I foresee happening is this nightmare scenario:</p>
<p>1. I get fixed/new controller.</p>
<p>2. I play 4 to 6 weeks until left analog starts drifting again (Titanfall, rRse and other games require you to hold in the button to run...and I'm guessing I must apply above average pressure/strain). Still controller ultimately breaks despite not having
 done anything out of the norm (such as abusing it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I contact support, they tell me to ship it off. During this time of shipping back and forth (two to five weeks I'm estimating) I'm without any means to play or use X1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I get controller back and rinse and repeat for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>There's nothing to indicate this may not happen perpetually. I'm not mad, but I'm discouraged and concerned. Also curious and perhaps uninformed. I don't know how this process will work but it's incredibly inconvenient and really sad when you've shelled
 out top price for an X1 only to have it sitting there listless while you play mail games with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate your time and any input into this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Same problem here, right analog stick is drifting up, completely ruins your ability to play normally. &nbsp;Problem cropped up out of nowhere after 8 months of normal use. &nbsp;And it is out of the 90 day warranty period for accessories. &nbsp;Thanks a lot Microsoft for
 selling me a controller with an 8 month lifespan. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is the sole reason ill NEVER spend another Dollar on another product with a microsoft/ xbox &nbsp;product logo ever again. &nbsp; &nbsp; This guy above me has a legitimate problem. &nbsp;Guess what I have the exact same problem with my right stick after 2 months and 2 days
 of use. &nbsp; Funny how all my playstation 4 controllers work perfectly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Same stuff when it was the 360. i bought and returned 4 of them before I HAD to walk away. You ever been burned 4 times by ANY console? &nbsp;I should have known then when I switched to the PS3 that this company can't get any better. &nbsp; Now you want me to play
 mail tag like this guy with my only controller, oh wait my wait 3 month warrenty has long since passed because this thing has been collecting dust for the last 9 months. &nbsp;Because i have no faith that a new controller would even fix the problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for
 burning me again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the xbox is unplayable since every x 1 game is fps and my crosshairs aim for the sky 24 / 7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Been gaming since 84 and this is complete garbage for controller standards.</p>

<h2>            Download Full Halo 5 Game and Update On PC Then Transfer Those Installations To Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hi, is there a way I can download the full Halo 5 Game + Updates on my PC then put those files on a hard drive I have laying around? I own the full game on disc but I don't have a console to download&nbsp;the game on. But once I get a console I want to be able and plug and play with Halo 5 and not have to wait 5 days to play it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> redsoxaholic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Y50 Windows 10 BSOD Driver_power_state_failure</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago, I got a BSOD when I started my laptop. Ever since I have only been able to use my laptop in safe mode. I've gotten several error codes over the last month, including Driver_power_state_failure, Video_TDR_Failure, and DPC_WATCHDOG_Violation.
 Sometimes if I try to do a normal startup it will freeze or BSOD immediately, other times it can work for a few hours before it freezes/blue screens. I've tried resetting my laptop and keeping my files and that didnt fix anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here is the minidumps/msinfo 32:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ak8vdqH8oqbckHb9UTCWJFf2FZuH</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on how to solve this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Unable to activate Dolby Atmos for Home Theater when Turtle Beach - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitico303  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to activate Dolby Atmos for Home Theater when Turtle Beach Elite 800x headphones are plugged </h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm experiencing this issue: I've my Xbox One X connected via HDMI to my Denon X1400H receiver and my Turtle Beach Elite 800x headset connected via USB to the console and via optical cable to the TV (in order to get all the sound coming from the TV to my headphones). But when I try to select the bitstream format "Dolby Atmos for Home Theater" in the settings menu an error message is returned, it say that this format is only available whit HDMI connections and that I should try to disconnect the headphones from the optical out in order to use it. But the optical out is turned off and no optical cables are connected to the console! Actually, when I disconnect the USB cable that connects the console to the headphones base I'm able to select that bitstream format. After that, if I reconnect the USB cable all works fine, until the next reboot of the console.</p>

<p>So, why I can't use my Turtle Beach if I want to use that bitstream format??</p>

<p>PS: HDMI audio is obviously set on "bitstream out".</p>

<h3> vernonchandler1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-install Windows 10 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>My Dell desktop was purchased with Windows 10 64-bit OS installed, but it crashed due to a faulty memory stick &amp; had to be formatted.<br />
Not having a back-up CD, I installed Windows 10 32-bit...which is now currently installed<br />
This was almost 2 years ago but I would like to reinstall the 64-bit version now as I am looking to upgrade the PC.
<br />
Can this be done without I having to purchase the 64-bit OS?</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that several people have had this issue before but there is nothing recent. I can't determine if this is an actual application error or some sort of virus in disguise. I have done the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sfc /scannow
 and it did not help, tried to disable start up programs and msconfig. Nothing. I click OK to terminate the program and it just pops back up again. It won't close. I can't do a system restore as it won't open. Which makes me wonder if it is a virus of some
 sort. I've tried what I found over the last 4 days. &nbsp;I would greatly appreciate some help on this please!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you in advance.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Wesley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors why this issue is happening. However, for us to fully isolate and identify what is causing this, we need to gather the information below. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue? </li><li>When do you usually encounter the error message? Is it when opening a specific application or starting your PC?</li><li>What was your last activity when this issue happened? </li><li>Any changes that took place in your computer before this issue occurred?</li></ul>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>No, I did not make any changes to my computer before this happened. So far, I have done a few of the command promps that a few other people suggested.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sfc /scannow,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">dism.exe,
 ran virus scanner, adware scan and a reboot of my comp (kept all files). The error went away for about a week, then it would pop back up and I was able to close it. Now it is back on all the time and won't close again. I look in running programs and when I
 go to close programs that seem to run on a lot of memory I get a warning that I shouldn't close them. I am not sure where the problem stems from. As for safe mode, I haven't tried that. The error pops up on start up before I even log into my desktop. I hope
 we can find a fix!!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>My bad for not clearing it very well. Again the problem related from the taskhost.exe preventing me to acess system restore,settings, and all of my application including browser. However I was able to open Control Panel but it doesn’t let do a system troubleshoot
 which saying the exe files are missing &nbsp;so frustrated I tried System Reset but it stop due to an error .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I was cheking Control Panel by right clicking windows box but right now it wont let me acess. It feels like someone controling my computer&nbsp;<br />

            Thank you for the update. Since you can't reset your PC from the settings, you can get to reset by restarting your PC from the sign-in screen. Press the
<strong>Windows logo key</strong> +L to get to the sign-in screen, then hold the Shift key down while you select
<strong>Power</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Restart</strong> in the lower-right corner of the screen. After your PC restarts, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset this PC</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you can't get to the sign-in screen, use a recovery drive or installation media to reset your PC.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Mail notifications not consistent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taleys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail notifications not consistent</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently upgraded to Windows 10 and I'm finding that the Windows 10 Mail and Calendar app does not always send new email notifications to the action center notification area on my computer in a consistent way. It will work for a little while and send
 a notification for each email received but then for no apparent reason it stops sending them. So I'll have for example three emails sitting in the Mail App with no notification of them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not good because some emails are important and I'd like to rely on the notifications to be able to respond to them in a timely fashion. A reboot of the computer usually gets it working again but then some hours later notifications stop. I've not
 been able to see a connection between any event and when the problem starts to happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear, emails always go into my Mail app account perfectly. I&nbsp; just don't always receive notifications in the action center when they do. Sometimes notifications will work consistently for a day and then totally stop. Other times I'll get a few

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All my settings related to Mail and Mail notifications appear to be correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My system facts</span>:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have an HP-15 laptop running Windows 10 Home, version 1511, build 10586.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The laptop originally had Windows 8.1 on it. I never really used notifications on that OS (used Thunderbird) so I don't know how or if it worked other than noticing sometimes a notification would result from receiving an email and other times not. I did
 an upgrade to Windows 10 through Windows Update and then did a Windows 10 reset with all personal files removed and this in my understanding is almost like doing a clean install. I've read of people who have done full clean installs and also have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. This issue has existed since I upgraded/reset to Windows 10 and of course before the big recent threshold 2 update/upgrade and still does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I use a local account on my laptop. I have read of this issue existing with both Microsoft account and local account logins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I use two email accounts with the Windows Mail app, both of them Microsoft emails (a live.com and outlook.com account).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Some of the things I've tried to resolve the problem</strong></span>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Made sure all required settings are set to on including in the Mail app&nbsp; and turned them on and off again and tried restarts etc</p>
<p>2. Checked my computer for driver issues and known incompatibilities.</p>
<p>3. Uninstalled the Mail and Calendar app and reinstalled it and also removed the two email accounts (both MSN accounts) that are set in it and put them back.</p>
<p>4. Checked for updates to the Mail and Calendar app in the Store.</p>
<p>5. Cleared the notification cache in Settings and cleared the store cache as well as ran the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>6. Made sure I have all Windows Updates. and App updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some people have noticed that if you leave the Mail and Calendar app open, email notifications are consistent. My understanding however is that it should work with it closed as long as you have it set to "on" as a background app and have the other notification
 settings on. And of course, it does work for a while with it closed, just not consistently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a tricky thing because you'll try something and then it will work and you think it might be fixed but then invariably it starts not sending notifications again and it's very disappointing and frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for any suggestions or help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>
</p><p>Okay, I completed the scan in method 1, and it found no integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried method 2 and I got an error message. So I restarted the laptop and tried it again and got the same error message. It is:</p>

</p><p>I don't understand it but I have Cortana set to off as far as I know if that helps.</p>

            <p>I went ahead and created another local user account on the HP 15 laptop and logged into it.&nbsp; After going through the settings and turning things on, adding the email accounts to Mail, sending myself an email (the notification worked but this means little
 so far), I noticed that there is no Mail setting in background apps to turn on only a calendar setting so I put that to on since they seem to work together.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I decided to run that powershell command again in the new local account just to make sure that works. It seemed to complete without issue. I restarted the computer and had some emails sent to me. So far notifications is working good, but that has
 happened many times before after trying something or even just a restart/boot so I'm not sure if it's fixed or just more of the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE #1</strong></span>: </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>The issue does persist in the new user account. I received an email in the Mail app and no notification was sent after having worked earlier. So it seems like none of these suggestions helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the sake of it I ran the powershell command in the new local account again and it completes with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something else I can try to try to make the notifications work consistently? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this issue it seems what usually happens day to day is computer boots, notifications usually (but I don't think always)&nbsp; work, then a few hours later or some time later they just stop working, like the program went to sleep or something or something
 breaks and stops communicating. Sometimes it stays like that until a re-boot, or some other event like messing with the settings, turning things on and off for example, and perhaps other things, and other times it will start working again later seemingly out
 of the blue inconsistently.</p>

 default settings and to pay attention to everything I do. So far the computer is great and notifications are working but I won't know for at least a few days or perhaps longer if the issue persists or not after this (2nd) Windows 10 reset. I'll update either

            <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE #3</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did the Windows Reset and pretty much let Windows do what it wants. I did not uninstall any apps and only installed FireFox and Malwarebytes. I let windows update and the store handle all updates. I've noticed, like many have, that there is no mail
 app listing in background apps. Only Calendar. I've seen this before though I seem to recall the first time i upgraded that Mail was in background apps and then disappeared. What i did to try and fix it not being there before was to uninstall via powershell
 and then reinstall via store. This put it in the background apps but did not fix the notification issue. Anyway, long story short, after the Windows Reset the Mail app still does not send mail notifications consistently when the Mail app is closed. I'm not
 sure about the behavior while open - it does seem more consistent when open and I've read others have the same experience, but I need it to work while closed and I assume this is possible since it does sometimes work while closed. I'm thinking at this point
 that it's just buggy and I guess needs to be improved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So the mail app has not been working at all for me with notifications. So I did as before and uninstalled the Mail app using a powershell command. Then I reinstalled it via the Store. Now the mail app is listed in background apps set to on. I put all the

<p>
</p><p>One other thing : when I start up the computer sometimes, and this is true now and before, the action center sometimes shows the

</p>

            <p>OK, I wanted to update this posting as&nbsp; was having the same problem and I finally have notifications appearing in the Action Center.&nbsp; Apparently, my problems were all related to configuration and setup not a specific problem with my system or the Mail application
 however I did uninstall and reinstall the mail application during this process so it's hard to tell if the reinstall triggered anything or not.&nbsp; Here's what I do know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the MAIL application itself if you click on the gear for settings and you select Manage Accounts you need to select the email account you have a concern with and then select "Change Mailbox Sync Settings".&nbsp; To get notifications to appear in in the action
 center and change the notification icon in the system tray you need to make sure that the selection option for "Download New Email" is set to "As items Arrive"&nbsp; Apparently, this was my problem as somehow during the 1607 Upgrade that selection option got changed
 to "Every 15 minutes" but I also think this option only works if you have the Mail app open or have opened it during your logon session.&nbsp; Since I rarely open the Mail app (I use Outlook 2010 as my mail client) this was probably why I felt that the notifications
 were inconsistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the above I did note an inconsistency that's worth noting.&nbsp; In the Mail application under Settings -&gt; Notifications you have the option to turn notifications on and to select if you want to display a banner and play a sound.&nbsp; However, if you
 open Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Notifications and Actions you will find the Mail application listed with the option to turn notifications on and off.&nbsp; If you click on the Mail icon within that list you will find additional switches where you can turn the banner
 and the sound off as well.&nbsp; What's important to note is that the System setting override whatever settings exist in the application settings as I have the Mail settings configured to show the banner and play a sound however in the system settings I only have
 the banner turned on.&nbsp; To me having the same option in two locations where one locations can override another is very confusing so I'm not sure what Microsoft's thought process is in regard to the Mail application.</p>
<p>

            <p>I just had to comment, to thank you for such a complete and thorough explanation of the symptoms, and microsoft's absolute inability to rectify the problem. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it seems it has had zero effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, I'm an avid Android user, and since the Gingerbread/Honeycomb era (<em>my earliest experience with it</em>), not only has it come with an email app, you could also install any email app you like ... not the least of which, the GMail app (<em>which,
 I believe has now replaced the older stock email app</em>). &nbsp;No matter which email app, or how many, and whatever email accounts (<em>not the least of which, Exchange</em>), through thousands of hours of use, I can remember exactly zero times I've had issues
 with notifications ... let alone, these types of ridiculous hoops to jump through, in a vain attempt to fix/debug the issue, because the developer failed to otherwise do so adequately, himself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email is over 40yr old, and MS continues to struggle with implementing even the most basic features ... seemingly utterly helpless, to fix their own errors, pointed out to them by diligent users ... for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although, to be fair, running MS Outlook on Android (<em>as with any other email app on that platform</em>), has zero such issues, with the same exact account. &nbsp;Hmmm ... I could just set up my Android table on a stand next to my windows monitor, and set
 it to "<em>never sleep while charging</em>" and I'd have a third screen with utterly reliable email notifications.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Th whole software PPPOE arrangement never worked well from day one more than 10 years ago regardless of the OS used.<br />
<br />
As a result most serious DSL carriers actually give free Modem/Router so that the authentication would be done by the WAN side of the Router part.<br />
<br />
They are giving it for free because the Tel. support for this problem cost them more than the $10 that the Router adds to the Modem<br />
<br />
I.e., get a Router, simple Routers in the US are sold for less than $15.<br />
<br />
Router solve the PPPOE problem provides, security with the NAT Firewall, and the DSL Stream is actually faster than with software authentication.

                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to type French on my laptop so I changed my keyboard to FR (AZERTY). The problem is that I can't type these letters: â, ê, ô,... because everytime I press ^ (if we want to type these letters, we need to press ^ and then a, e, o,...), it becomes ^^
 instead of ^. I also tried with the US international keyboard but it still doesn't work: ' becomes '' and ^ becomes ^^ (which means I can't type the letters I want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you guys so much!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            20&#37; CPU Usage at idle--Windows 10 system interrupts</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I've upgraded to Windows 10, I've noticed that my CPU idles around 25%--specifically, one core hovers around 80-90% while the others are around 3-9%. I've run the Windows Performance Monitor Report, LatencyMon, and the Windows Performance Recorder
 and Analyzer. All of them point to abnormally high system interrupts as being the culprit. It lists 'rspLLL64.sys', 'USBPORT.SYS', and 'storport.sys' as having unusually high DPC and ISR counts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked in Device Manager, and I can neither update those drivers nor roll them back to an earlier version. Updating my BIOS is problematic since the latest update 1) came in 2012, and 2) is a beta version; the final version was never released.
</p>
<p>I've tried talking to Microsoft tech support, who weren't much help. No, my computer isn't infected; yes, I've tried restarting (several times). I've disabled a lot of the native Win 10 apps. If anyone can please give me an idea of what to do or where to
 go, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

            Windows performs internal housekeeping when you are not actively using your computer. This can include such tasks as search indexing, virus scans, file syncing, hard drive optimization and many others.

<p>
</p><p>System Interrupts consistently tops the list for most CPU resources used. If you're seeing something I'm not, however, I'm open to any suggestions to get this fixed.</p>

            Hi Barry,<br />
<br />
It is possible that this is an issue with the printer driver. To properly troubleshoot the issue, kindly check
<strong>Shilohbob</strong>'s post on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/windows-10-scanner/9eb96066-0a77-478e-8a27-4a538bfd2761">link</a></strong>.

<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

<br />
For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista/Windows<br />
7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same<br />
32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

If you do not have a Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />

    <title>Why would Skype add a contact without me knowing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bananarepublic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why would Skype add a contact without me knowing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got a report from a contact via a different medium that they got a Skype invite from me which I did not send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that time, I was inviting a different person, dismissed that as a mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the same contact informed me that they got invite again the next day and this time accepted it. However, I don't see them in the contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems like the Skype is posting unsolicited invitations, and somehow not telling me about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've assumed it's infected but running Malware shows nothing yet. Antivirus scan is still pending. What else I can do to determine the root cause of unsolicited invitations being apparently sent from my account?&nbsp;</p>
