<h2>            USB Flash BRAND NEW VIRUS &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft.<br />
<br />
l have a Silicon Power 16 GB flash drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Recently it infected with a virus.<br />
<br />
I deleted the virus with my anti-virus (<strong>Bitdefender Total Security 2015</strong>) , and manually deleted all the files and folders in the flash.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *** But after i pull it out and plug in again, <strong>all the files and folders also THE VIRUS coming back again</strong>. ***<br />
<br />
when i try to format the drive i get "windows was unable to complete the format".<br />
<br />
I tried to delete the flash's partition using "<strong>partition manager 12</strong>" and "<strong>CMD</strong>". but it didn't worked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When i try to delete the partition it looks like flash drive eject and plug in automatically.<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
for the record:<br />
<br />
i also tried to format it with some other software, and all of them giving me errors like "Access Denied" OR "drive in use with some program".<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
More Information:<br />
<br />
the virus folder name: <strong>cfsdaacdfawd</strong><br />
<br />
in the cfsdaacdfawd folder: &nbsp;<strong>aiasfacoafiasksf.vbss</strong><br />
<br />
Bitdefender Knows the virus with this name: <strong>Trojan.Downloader.JQVE</strong><br />
<br />
The flash also has the <strong>.lnk</strong> virus and make as u see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the <strong>hidden files</strong> wont show up if i remove the flash and plug it in again.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Saman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to run the Microsoft Scanner to check if the error message is any manifestation due to virus/malware infections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you. Kindly post back with the updated issue for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>First of all, what is so important for you about this 16GB flash drive. I would just not use it being the cost of a 16GB Flash drive.</p>
<p>the virus is probably being placed in your registry every time you use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seem that you virus software is detecting and removing it.</p>
<p>if not you need to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 If you feel good about your registry use abilities, you can try to remove it from regedit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you have a image backup, you can reload your image. you need to create one anyway if you have not already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if all else fail you can reload your factory restore. You should have created backup of you factory backup partition if not you need to do this or check you computer manufacture website for how to restore and backup your factory patition.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>ThanX EMJ ;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i'm sure my registry is clean. i searched about the virus. any trace of the names "<strong>cfsdaacdfawd" , "</strong><strong>aiasfacoafiasksf.vbss"
</strong>and<strong> "random </strong>(which is the other name of aiasfacoafiasksf.vbss according to some websites)<strong>"
</strong>can't be found in registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>right now i'm doing a full scan with <strong>"</strong><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner"
</strong>like Rajeshwari said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it didn't help, i wanna boot up windows 10 and repair the windows, although i just updated it &nbsp;:(((( &nbsp;. and i'm not&nbsp;optimistic about last option.</p>

            Still still not understanding your issue with this thumb drive. They only cost less then $10.00 on eBay with free shipping. Just trash yours and buy a new one. Watch out for the brand you by. It sound like this brand had this virus when you got it. No
 virus scan program is 100 percent.

            <p>Hi Raj.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your care to this matter.<br />
<br />
But i wonder why do you think "<strong>bitdefender</strong>" can't delete the virus if it exist, But this microsoft software can ???<br />
<br />
I just did a "Full Scan" with the "Microsoft Safety Scanner" and it didn't even detect the '<strong>aiasfacoafiasksf.vbss'
</strong>file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my flash drive chip and part-number is "SMI&nbsp;SM3257", i tried to reprogram it using "Silicon Power Ultima U03 SMI SM3257ENAA Format tool" and it also failed.<br />
i'm 100% sure its a virus that&nbsp;prevent the flash being format by disconnect and reconnect it&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i'm not sure it still exist OR this problem is a&nbsp;side effect of the removed virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">check this out:</p>
</p><p>when i'm trying to format it, right after i hit the format button, it looks like
<strong>my taskbar gets refresh</strong>, i repeat my taskbar gets refresh, not desktop or my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help with some more&nbsp;Professional suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope i was kind enough. :)</p>
<p>

            <p>No virus removal software is able to 100 percent remove all viruses. </p>
<p>Some virus require special procedures to remove them at a cost.</p>
<p>This is the reason recovery and image backups are so very important. </p>
<p>When you buy a computer the first thing you should do is the factory partition backup. And then after you load all of you important applications you intend to use on the system, do a Windows image backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your thumb drive, I would just get rid of it and buy another 16gb drive for under $10.00. Be careful about the brand.</p>

            <p>I never heard of a silicon power and you never said if you downloaded the virus yourself to it. So if the virus came on the drive I would not use their brand again. I sure you system is worth a lot more than a free 16gb flash drive worth less than $10.00</p>

            <p>Thanks my friend for your time,</p>
<p>
</p><p>now i'm sure it's broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried to format it with my "tv receiver" which has a basic and simple OS, but same thing happened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silicon Power is a good brand, i have a "external hard disk" of them and it's gold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my thinking is the virus did that to it. i got a new one using warranty. but still upset about i couldn't&nbsp;figure out whats wrong with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you again, microsoft seems have some bigger problems to deal with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very much appreciated your time.</p>

    <title>Microsoft xBox Live Support Complaint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steelmaccabeus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft xBox Live Support Complaint</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone have Microsoft Corporate contact for xBox Live service suite? Recently my credit card was charged a auto-renew for a child account. I was not aware that account had a solo xBox Live account as we originally had a Family Account. With that said
 that is not the true issue. The big issue is Microsoft Support claims my sons (10yr..By they way I was in his account initially when I tried to post here and it said he was not old enough to post in message board) email was notified of the auto-renew and NOT
 the Parent email!!! I logged into sons email and it has only received two emails in it's existence and neither was for the auto-renew notice. Support actually indicated the notification error-ed out and they auto-renewed anyway. Due to some potential fraud
 issues the actual charge to credit card charged was delayed 53 days before charge hit and now 6 days after the charge hit Microsoft refuses to issue a cancellation and credit as they state it had to be done within 30 days of actual system auto-renew date 12/2015.
 My major issues in summary:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I was not aware auto-renew was turned on</p>
<p>2. I was not able to see Auto-Renew pending under my Microsoft PARENT account</p>
<p>3. My sons email never received a auto-renew notification and neither did I as PARENT</p>
<p>4. I never updated the re-issued credit card number and that begs the question how did Microsoft find it and force payment</p>

<p>There is no 53 day delay in renewal</p>
<p>Your billing date and renewal date would be at max 1-3 days appart</p>
<p>If you have declined payment yes it will stop you after 20 days of declined payments from your payment option from.loging in</p>
<p>Your can check your billing date and renewal date at commerce.microsoft.com</p>
<p>For billing issues you must call support in your region really or chat support</p>
<p>You would have better chances with phone support</p>

<p>The delay was due to a change in credit card number forced by bank to protect a potential fraudulent activity. So 12/13/15 was renewal date and charge appeared on card 2/5/16 due to card number rejection. Since the auto renew notification was not delivered
 to my sons email account nor to my parent accounts the only way I recognized the renewal was by looking at charges on credit card. So the only successful notification I received was by way of credit card statement and that is within the 30 day window.

<p>Hab das Problem seit dem Update auch schon mehrmals gehabt. Liegt wohl am letzten Patch. Wenn du die Konsole komplett ausschaltest (5 Sek auf den Powerbutton vorne drücken+halten) und neu einschaltest läuft es normal wieder.</p>

<div>
So i decided to upgrade my pc from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro, and everytime when i try to boot from my bootable usb it will give me a bluescreen on windows 10. So i removed one of my ram sticks and it worked. After the installation i installed all
 the drivers and such on windows 10. Now it will boot with 8GB ram but not 10GB ram. When the extra 2GB stick is installed it will bluescreen at booting with the error: KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED and it just stucks at a bootloop of bluescreen with the same
 error. When the 2GB stick is removed it will boot just normally without any problems. The odd problem now here is that when i install Windows 7 again it just works with the extra 2GB stick without any problems, just windows 10 has problems.<br />
Currently i have everything at stock now.<br />

            Hi, Emorymontague
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk  with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

    <title>RpcRTRemote.dll and USERENV.dll - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RpcRTRemote.dll and USERENV.dll</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I finally managed to update my Win 7 64 pro laptop last night with Service Pack One and then the problems started! On restart I had error messages that the DLLs in the title line above were corrupt or not designed to work with Windows.<br />
<br />
So far I've tried following the advice on here by:-<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Uninstalling SP1 through the control panel</li><li>Using system restore (it says a file wasn't found. My virus prog was already disabled - the only suggestion the error message gave)</li><li>Pressing F8 during start up and disabling the signature enforcement, which does work, thank goodness, but is hardly a permanent fix.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows subsequently downloaded a load more SP1 only updates. These started causing disk errors (it said to run scan disk which I did and seems to have fixed whatever happened)!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've also tried booting from a Lenovo repair disk but this leads to a Lenovo utility which doesn't offer much (thanks guys).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've kind of run out of ideas, but notice quite a lot about this around the web, but with no definitive answers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help. I'm not technical so don't assume a high level of knowledge. The PC works okay once I'm over the F8 hurdle!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PETE</p>

            Hi Basith,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
I'd need to copy down the exact error message (no code), but it's something about 'bad image' as a header and then some text saying the application is either not designed for Windows or is corrupt. That message occurs for the two DLLs mentioned.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded and am running the Microsoft virus checker now on full scan.<br />
<br />
To clarify the updates, SP1 is loaded on the system and I've subsequently downloaded around 40 further windows updates that I assume were conditional upon the PC running SP1. These have installed without incident.<br />
<br />
However, I have a further problem now that I think might need you urgent attention and a response from Microsoft. Here goes:-<br />
<br />
I tried another piece of advice given on this site by MS support: to create a new user account and see of this solved the problem (it didn't). What does now occur though, on my existing and the new account, is a message comes up saying my copy of windows is
 not genuine and inviting me to pay you $99 to put it right.<br />
<br />
I guess this is either malware or whatever validates my copy of windows no longer works. The software was provided by Lenovo with my PC - I have the licence number etc.,
<br />
<br />
Is my PC about to stop working because of this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help...<br />
<br />
<br />

            PS...<br />
<br />
Basith, I'm looking at your advice to delete RpcRtRemote.dll. Is this safe<strong>??
</strong>I found the file as you suggested, right clicked and brought up properties. It says it's published by Microsoft nd is part of Windows.<br />
<br />
Additionally: I can circumvent the problem by pressing F8 during boot and then selecting Disable Driver Signature Enforcement. This prevents the problems associated with the two DLLs occuring.<br />
<br />
When I right clicked and looked at properties it has options to change permissions for the file. Would this maybe solve the problem?<br />
<br />
BTW, I ran System File Checker. It said it had detected issues but was unable to help...<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue with the System Files, as the System File Checker scan has found files that can't be repaired. I would suggest you to perform a Startup repair and check if it works for you.</p>

<p>Motocross Madness,Joyride Turbo,Sonic and Sega All Star Racing,Fire Pro Wrestling all use avatars.Microsoft is really sensitive about their avatars when it involves violence.They took away realistic guns and swords from the avatar store and replaces them
 with fake looking plastic ones.I would love to see a AAA avatar game like Halo with avatars but MS would never allow it because its too violent.</p>

    <title>Dropbox Will Not Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wyld oxz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dropbox Will Not Install</h2>
                    <p>In the vain hope that I might receive a quicker response here rather than Dropbox, I need some help. My Dropbox programme quit working some time ago; I'm not sure when exactly because I do not use it regularly (but when I do use it, I need it). I noticed
 the Dropbox icon was missing from my system tray, so I tried to run it from the start menu, but Dropbox wasn't there. I thought my entire Dropbox directory folder had gone MIA, too, but I found it. When attempting to run Dropbox, I was given some sort of message
 about accessing or permission to access a path. I assumed that the programme must just need a reinstallation, so I uninstalled Dropbox via the programmes list. But now, I am receiving a very strange message that says, 'Dropbox couldn't be installed, would
 you like to try a different Dropbox installer?' Then, I was thinking it had to do with my anti-virus software, so I turned all that off and tried again to no avail. I tried running the installer as the administrator, but I was only given another message about
 how Dropbox will not run as the administrator. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am wondering if something has gone awry in the registry, but I have not been able to find
<em>anything</em>, and I mean <em>anything</em>, on the internet about this particular problem, so I am extremely hesitant to muck about in the registry. The only known registry issue with Dropbox (that I have found) does not match my registry: there is supposedly
 a KS subdirectory that needs to be deleted, but I have no KS subdirectory. What I do have is a HKEY_CURRENT_USER =&gt;&gt; Software =&gt;&gt; Dropbox -&gt; (Default) REG_SZ (value not set) [--- AND ---] InstallPath REG_SZ C:\Users\[my username]\AppData\Roaming\Dropbox\bin</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything that I can think of and am willing to risk. Does anyone here {please!} have any brilliant ideas? Thanks for the help.</p>

 and reinstall dropbox. Dropbox3.2.9 goes all the way to end and then says it can't connect to the internet, when it should be able to.&nbsp; They have an offline installer and that didn't work at all - I get the same message you get.&nbsp; I tried googling a solution,
 and I agree with you - who wants to play around with registries?&nbsp; I agree that is asking for trouble - one suggestion was to go to dropbox and unlink and link my computer.&nbsp; The unlink is easy, but there aren't any instructions for how to relink.&nbsp; I'm guessing
 this has something to do with the latest security update - something always goes wrong after one, and it must be dropbox's turn now - looks like a lot of people are in the same boat with no easy solution.&nbsp; If dropbox gives you a solution, please post here
 as well - it would help others.<br />

            When I downloaded the online installer, it failed to connect to the internet (or so it said). I tried downloading it repeatedly, and it did the same thing repeatedly. Then I tried the offline installer of version 3.6.6. It did not do anything on double
 clicking or opening the file. Then I downloaded the latest stable version 3..0.4, and it worked like a charm.

    <title>Sony Bravia TV as HDMI Monitor -resolutions missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waltermcneil1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony Bravia TV as HDMI Monitor -resolutions missing</h2>
                    <p>I have seen the other questions posed about missing resolution, and followed the steps provided to restore drivers. these have not worked.
</p>
<p>I use a sony Bravia TV through hdmi as my monitor. my gpu is a ATI Radion HD 4300/4500 series with driver 15.201.1151.1008. after the spring update my resolution options dropped to 3 settings and none of them are proper especially the "recommended" settings.
 The scaling option is pointless as it will only make my desktop item larger and that is currently the problem. everything is too large and now squeezed into my screen. Unfortunately my system recovery does not go back far enough to remove the update as I have
 been out of town and did not use the pc to identify this issue when it updated. and the last system restore point is the update. it was perfect on 5/28/2018 the update was applied on 5/29/2018 and that is my last restore point so I cannot roll back to before
 the update. what else can I do to fix this issue do I need to do a reinstall of windows at this point?</p>

<p>Check the AMD/ATI Radeon settings application in Start Menu&gt;&gt;all apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or right click desktop and the display setting for Radeon might be in the context menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the&nbsp;3 resolution settings it gives you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to adjust the Bravia TV settings on the TV ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you went to settings&gt;&gt;System&gt;&gt;Display&gt;&gt;advanced display settings&gt;&gt;display adapter properties for this TV monitor&gt;&gt;Monitor tab</p>
<p>and&nbsp;changed the refresh rates for the TV Monitor. or uninstall the TV drivers and update them&nbsp;or roll them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you need to restart PC after changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a PC and only 1 monitor HDMI from Video card to TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would go here and enter your card specs and download the drivers/software for it for Windows 10 if they have 10 drivers. If not, you are stuck with Microsoft generic display drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/legacy?product=legacy2&amp;os=Windows%208%20-%2064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/legacy?product=legacy2&amp;os=Windows%208%20-%2064</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no drivers for windows 10 on their website.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is the last</p>
<p>Display Driver ver. 8.97.100.7<br />
OpenCL(tm) Driver 10.0.937.2<br />
Catalyst Control Center 2012.1116.1514.27190</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you show your driver as</p>
<p>15.201.1151.1008</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Radeon HD 4600 series crossfireX Windows 10 pro v1803 </p>
<p>driver installed is</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</p>
<p>8.970.100.9001 </p>
<p>with 3 monitors connected</p>
<p>No Catalyst control installed.</p>
<p>Never any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you have the wrong drivers.</p>
<p>I would download the Windows 8 64bit, uninstall your drivers and CCC</p>
<p>restart pc and try to install the Windows 8 version.</p>
<p>Obviously mine is running on the windows 8 version.</p>
<p>But I do not have CCC installed.</p>

            Unfortunately i looked for all those thing already and they changed nothing. Went into the tv as well and there were barely any settings to change. I do not remember the resolutions that were available but checked the event log and had no driver updates
 prior to or after the update only a merge and a failed merge. I have already started a reinstall of windows and if this does not solve the issue i will look further into your driver options.&nbsp;

<p>ok well I went through the windows reinstall, the computer is back up and the display is still where it was after the update. I have noticed through my digging through setting that it appears instead of using my gpu that the pc is going through the generic
 pnp monitor instead.&nbsp; the 3 settings it gives for resolution now are&nbsp;</p>
<p>1280x1024</p>
<p>1024x768(recommended)</p>
<p>800x600</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently set to 1280x1024 as it is the closest to how it was before but icons are still much larger than previous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>also yes this is pc with 1 video card going straight through hdmi to the tv</p>
<p>&nbsp;also once I did the swap up to windows 10 it removed the amd graphics software and it is no longer compatible as it was originally a windows 7 machine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>as you can see the text in the setting screen is good but icons are huge and in apps everything is much larger causing conflict while running multiple windows</p>

<p>to be honest, I set mine at 1280x720. I like the little bigger icons and text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you plan on watching 1920x1080 videos, then you are not going to get that resolution. But 1280x720 HD is HD enough for anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I showed you a photo of my drivers for my card. With the version of drivers from Windows 8 that&nbsp;I get the top settings, But I use 1280x720.</p>

<p>Ah ha, Is your TV a 720 TV or a 1080 TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a 720p TV, then it&nbsp;might&nbsp;not be capable of processing above 1080. That is why when you buy a TV, you buy a 720, 1080 or new 4K. Check your tv video settings on TV. But since it is a monitor, maybe it can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a 720p TV can not display a signal from cable box of 1080, so you have to set&nbsp;cable box output&nbsp;to 720.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest to change the refresh rates. This might give you higher resolution settings.

<p>Yes since it is a TV and not a monitor, there probably is some issues of possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, not all HDMI cables are for TV signals. It must be a high speed HDMI cable.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>as for the 720 vs 1080 it is a 1080 as the listed resolution for this model is 1920x1080&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>all of these functions worked prior to the update, that is why I am confused and struggling. everything was fine, I was avoiding the update and it all was great. then I came home and the update processed and I saw my screwed up display but

<p><span><span>Hi Stevedenholm,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This might be caused by StarForce software that is installed while installing some games. You will find the device listed in Device
 manager. These at times block the games and give copy protection errors. You may try uninstalling the drivers and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This service automatically uninstalls StarForce drivers after StarForce protected product is uninstalled. After the
 drivers are uninstalled, the service uninstalls itself as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To uninstall device</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click on Start menu, type Device Manager and hit Enter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Expand the category Network Adapters to uninstall the TV Tuner card. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Right-click the device and select Properties. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Select the Driver tab on the device's Properties dialog box. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Click the Uninstall Driver button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also contact the game manufacturer for further help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

    <title>Problem mapping drive from Win7 Toshiba Laptop out in the network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbdavi242  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem mapping drive from Win7 Toshiba Laptop out in the network</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Laptop running Win 7 RC, It can be seen from other computers on a network, even have a drive mapped on it. however I cannot map a drive on any other network computer. one running Vista 32bit, another running Win7 RC, the Vista comp. can
 map on other desktop running Win 7 RC, also the Win 7 RC desktop can map a drive on the Vista comp. both can map to the laptop. The laptop cannot map any drive. What can this be? it seems that the laptop is blocked, (have tried with the firewall and anti-virus
 off) error is "Windows cannot access \\"Vista comp"\Drive J" Check the spelling of the name, Otherwise there might be a problem with your network. To Try to Identify and resolve network problems, Click Diagnose. ERROR 0x80070035 the network path not found.
 Same error trying to connect to other systems on network by clicking on network "computer name"
<br />
any information would be helpful. <br />
by the way I have tried pretty much everything I can find on the web.<br />
<br />
Some additional information<br />
<br />
It seems that my laptop (running Win7RC) cannot make outbound mapped drive requests also it cannot brows a computer on my network. (see above error) the odd thing is my other two computers (one running VIsta and the other running Win7RC) can not only brows
 my laptop but they can map a drive from the laptop. so for instance if i have a external drive plugged into the laptop the other computers in my network can map the drive plugged into the laptop. (freakishly odd) I have all systems on the same workgroup, have
 it set up as a business network (don't really understand the homegroup thing yet) and the Vista computer can map the other win7RC system (desktop) and the laptop, the desktop Win7RC system can map a drive on the Vista system and the laptop. so it appears that
 the problem is with the laptop as it cannot map a drive on either system.<br />

<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE: FIXED </strong></span><br />
<br />
well after much problems and doing lots of things, I have discovered the problem.<br />
<br />
I was using Windows 7RC firewall, and Panda Anti-Virus<br />
<br />
even with both off the problem was still there. (it appears that even with both switched off {not running} there was still something going on)<br />
<br />
I removed Panda Anti-Virus and installed E-Eye Digital Security "Blink Personal Edition" using the command line of
<br />
C:\...\BlinkConsumersetup.exe NO_LAUNCH_CHECK=1<br />
<br />
if you don't use the command line install, it will pop up a box with error (only for Win 2000, Win XP and Vista) and not install<br />
<br />
NOW all network features are working well, can map network drive, access through the network etc. and using the E-EYE Digital "Blink" firewall it will allow you to control outbound as well as inbound.
<br />

<p><strong>I am having problems with my laptop where windows crashes occasionally and there are drivers missing for the CD Drive, first of all would a pc restore fix these issues? If they don't fix these problems I won't bother.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do before I restore my Laptop? E.g. back up files and write down what programmes I have that I will need to reinstall after.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I think I installed Microsoft Office after, so would the restore delete Word, Power Point e.t.c? If so how do I make sure I can reinstall after.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a HP Pavillion DV6500 series with Vista 32bit Home Premium.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>

<p>System Restore and System Recovery&nbsp;are two different things, which are often mixed together here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore</a></p>
<p>A System Restore puts your Computer back in time to earlier Settings to resolve issues; read the above..</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>A System Recovery puts it back to Factory Settings: How you bought it.</p>
<p>The Hard Drive is wipe clean during the Recovery Process, in most cases.</p>
<p>HP does have a non- destructive Recovery Process, as well as Destructive Recovery; check with them about this if your Model includes that.</p>
<p>Save all Data and be prepared to reinstall all Programs that&nbsp;youu have installed from the original Media: CDs, DVDs, etc.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Try this instead:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Follow these steps to improve performance and resolve the issues:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers
 for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/83ec0ffe-ee04-4d53-8b87-25d1f05c954e1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/83ec0ffe-ee04-4d53-8b87-25d1f05c954e1033.mspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>“<strong><span>Optimise Windows for better Performance”</span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</span></p>
<p><span>Programs and Features: Uninstall unwanted Programs.</span></p>
<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

<p>It is very important, whatever you do that you make sure and have access to an Administrative user account.&nbsp; If you are not one now, change it so you are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete an account from the Control Panel User settings.&nbsp; I seem to remember something about a question to delete all info so it removes all the folders for that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the best way would be to set the system back to factory specifications.&nbsp; What you can or cannot do from your present configuration depends on what options you still have.&nbsp; Check your manuals to see if you can do a factory reset or call the store.</p>
