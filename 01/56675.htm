<h2>            Installation of Adaptec 29160N SCSI card in 32 bit</h2>
                    
<p>I am having difficulty installing this card which I wish to use with my Epson GT 7000 (same as Perfection 636S) scanner.</p>
<p>Have downloaded the driver u160_w7_ws08r2_x86_drv_b7_5_645_100.exe from Adaptec site and unzipped.</p>
<p>Windows fails to detect the card automatically. If I then elect to install manually, the only Model showing for Adaptec is AIC-7870 PCI SCSI Controller (emulated). I end up at a screen which says "please select the device driver you want to install for this
 hardware" - but there is none listed and no obvious way of inputting the details.</p>
<p>Please advise how I can get Windows to recognise the card.</p>

<p>Just to close this one off. Despite being well out of any normal support period, Adaptec were very helpful and made all sorts of suggestions. I was still persuing with them when came across another suggestion which appears to have worked. (For ref, it was
 Start, Computer, System Properties, Device Manager, Right click on 'unknown device', select 'update software driver',<span>highlight ‘browse my computer for driver software’ and enter.
 Software installed and card now recognised).</span></p>
<p><br />
Quite why this route worked when the other one wouldn't is beyond my technical assessment!!</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and effort - all I've got to do now is find the correct driver for the scanner itself!</p>

<h2>            Total Combined Screen time for Xbox and PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve seen several similar questions on the forum, but none that answer this specific question.... (unless I’m missing something)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the screen time function on my family microsoft account to limit my sons screentime for his Xbox. However, to help with his school work we purchased a laptop for him. I’ve limited his screen time for this also. However, as well as school work
 he has found the Xbox App and games! Therefore he is now playing games for twice the time originally allowed. I can’t knock his resourcefulness but I need to limit him back again and make him understand that time for school work is the priority....... He is
 quite good at working in the rules and balancing his time when it is clearly defined which is why Screen time limits work well for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can there be a maximum screentime across all devices which is less than the individual sum of Xbox and PC (i.e. maximum his user name can be on line)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Can there be a maximum Xbox screen time include the Xbox App as well as the Xbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Can the screen time function differentiate between online games and productive use of the laptop and separate these times out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen time limits your child use of Xbox and Windows 10 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen time is per device, so <span>giving your child one hour means one hour on PC and one hour on Xbox for a total of two hours.
<span>If you want to set the same schedule for all devices, switch </span></span><strong>Use one screen time schedule</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>from<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Off</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>On</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To answer your questions:<br />
</span></span><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Yes, if want him to have a separate schedule (between devices), scroll down and switch on screen time for PC and Xbox individually. Screen time determines how long they can use the device.</span></li><li><span><span>Yes.</span></span></li><li><span><span>No, it can't.</span></span></li></ol>
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have other concerns.

    <title>Billing for Microsoft Gaming &#47; Unauthorized Charge &#47; Fraud - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cosmosrealm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Billing for Microsoft Gaming &#47; Unauthorized Charge &#47; Fraud &#47; Crimeware Initiated &#47; Refund Not Issued</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The video game, Tank Force made by Extreme Developers of Russia and Cyprus has a crimeware virus in it that pops up 7 days after playing the game. In the menu, the player can purchase 11,760,000 Silver for $99.99. Then day by day the deals keep getting
 better, but anyone who starts out a game would not check on the highest prices first. I didn't check on that or pay attention to the deals yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then after a week, the daily offer showed 11,760,000 Silver for "0USD". No dollar signs, unusual. I clicked it and got a free tank mega-upgrade and thought, "woah, nice 7 day bonus." I bought all kinds of tanks and even noticed that it credited me 35,000
 Gold. I bought armor, ammo and upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My bank statement showed a charge of $99.99 on 10/31/18 from Microsoft Orders. After that, I downloaded Tank Force from SteamPowered.com to see if it was a real 7 day bonus "Silver Kit" credit or just a hack going through Microsoft Billing. Sure enough,
 the game did not show one after 7 days. I did not register any bank cards with SteamPowered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My computer crashed while trying to uninstall the SteamPowered gaming app and I reset my computer after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regardlessly, I have a record of being billed by Tank Force. I had to create a new profile in the game. I contacted customer support and was told it was "impossible" that could have happened and was ignored for months. Microsoft said they could not
 refund the charge. Well, that is not fair at all. I had to request a refund by 14 days. I don't know if it was the 90 day issue option. That didn't work either. I was not able to explain in 150 characters the accurate explanation of what happened for them
 to pay attention to what I wrote and understand. Microsoft Billing has been irrelevant, incompetent and rude on the phone and keeps hanging up after sending me through multiple supervisors. Eventually, the final "case closure answer" from Microsoft by email
 was not that "I did not meet the refund timeline" but, that it was "not a refundable item."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, the former charge of "$99.99&nbsp;SRX1451265677ID - Golden Kit 6" has disappeared from "My Orders".</p>

    <title>Surface Pro Boot Loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awesome aasim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Boot Loop</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro (2017) just stopped working. &nbsp;What happened is that it gave the blue screen of death, then it booted to the UEFI. &nbsp;Normally, I could exit the UEFI and start Windows normally, but now it won't stop booting to the UEFI after spending eons at
 the Surface boot screen. &nbsp;I suspect I just have a buggy Windows version that I need to reinstall, but now, even if I hold buttons down, it still takes a long time to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking I should just reinstall Windows from a USB drive (I am posting this from a MacBook computer and the ISO file is downloading at the same time), but I do not know what else I could try before taking the device in for diagnosis. &nbsp;Do you think
 this is a software issue or hardware issue, and is there anything I could try from the UEFI screen to maybe get my Surface to boot from Windows? &nbsp;Also, if my computer does not boot from any drive (even the ISO file I am downloading on the Mac), what should
 I do?</p>

<p>I see the standard UEFI screen. &nbsp;I think it may be a problem with corrupt files, but you are suggesting it could also be a problem with the hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see any hard drive icons. &nbsp;My computer crashed with "Windows Store Exception" and did the same usual thing: &nbsp;boot into the UEFI then I click on Restart. &nbsp;However, instead of just booting to Windows 10, it hangs at the Microsoft logo screen and the
 screen flashes. &nbsp;I also notice a three second delay between powering it up and the backlight turning on, a delay that was never there before this.</p>

<p>I just took the SP2017 to a Microsoft Store.&nbsp; They came to the same conclusion and replaced the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full answer:</p>
<p>If your Surface won't stop booting/rebooting and/or it lands in the UEFI after several reboots, then plug in a USB drive with Windows installation media and boot onto the installation media (hold volume down while pressing the power button).&nbsp; It may take
 a while to boot onto the USB.&nbsp; Choose "next", "install now", choose "custom", and see if the partition will appear in the "Choose where to install Windows" screen.&nbsp; If it doesn't, your SSD is dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the Microsoft Store mentioned that they tried "Load driver" but that did not work in the past for them.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Restore Points are being deleted</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 a couple of months ago (and isn't that turning out to be a mistake) and have been running into a a few problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After working out that my system restore had been turned off I turned it on and configured it to use ~4% space. After checking and double checking it had a couple of restore points available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I updated windows to the newest build. However, when it had installed and my system was running I found that my internet connection &nbsp;no longer worked. After running network diagnostics it informed me that the windows socket registries for network connectivity
 were missing. No one else seemed to have this problem and after scouring the internet on another computer it seemed the best option would be to restore my computer to a functioning system. However, when I tried to do this I found that all my system restore
 points had been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was extremely not happy at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I managed to work out how to fix my network connectivity, but I am left with the problem of my restore points. What is the purpose of creating them if they are deleted when they will be of actual use to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are they stored on my computer so I can back them up for future windows 10 failures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>An answer would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>thoughts</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could occur due to one of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. If the maximum storage size limit is set to low for your shadow storage.</p>
<p>2. You manually disable system restore</p>
<p>3. If you perform disk cleanup and remove all the restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you have configured the usage to 4%.&nbsp;&nbsp;In-order to identify is this is the reason, I would suggest you to increase the disk usage and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>windows key + R</strong> to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type<strong> sysdm.cpl </strong>and press <strong>enter</strong></p>
<p>3. Click on "<strong>system protection</strong>" tab and click "<strong>configure</strong>"</p>
<p>4. Under <span>Disk Space Usage</span>, move the Max Usage slider to the right to increase the disk space usage for System Restore points</p>
<p>5. Click "<strong>ok</strong>" and close the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.</p>

            <p>Restore points have a limited usefulness after which they are automatically deleted by the operating system. Trying to restore an old restore point can make your PC unstable. In Windows 7, restore points had a 90-day life; that period has been reduced for
 Windows 10, but I don't know how long it is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, all restore points are deleted after upgrades, like the recent Fall Upgrade, as they are no longer applicable and restoring them could damage your copy of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't confuse a restore point with a backup. These are two different things. Backups are easy to do, and you schedule them to run automatically. You can keep a backup for as long as you like.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't be an issue of storage space as I have allowed for ~30Gb and when I checked the 2 restore points I had created were only using 2Gb and my hdd &nbsp;generally has at least 150Gb free space.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that my system only kept the restore point for a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I definitely didn't manually disable system restore.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have increased the space to 5% to see if that will help in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would still like to know where the system restore points can be found so that I can back them up if this happens again (before this happens again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know if the restore points stick around for longer.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've been keeping an eye on things and it is still deleting restore points, but it seems to coincide with something worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason my computer keeps eating the empty space on my hard drive. It drops from 150Gb free to &lt;10Gb, in fact 20 minutes ago I had less than 3Mb of space on my hard drive. After restarting my hard drive space is restored to 150Gb and my 'excess'
 restore points no longer exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's done this a couple of times in the last week. No idea why.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating us.&nbsp;I apologize for the delayed response.&nbsp;Let me help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The deletion of restore points may be caused by any one of the following by-design conditions:</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You run out of disk space on the system drive or on any one of the available non-system drives, and System Restore stops responding and stops monitoring your system.</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You manually turn System Restore off.</p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>A restore point reaches an age of 90 days. The restore point is then deleted because 90 days is the default time to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, adjust the maximum shadow storage allocation. To do this, follow the steps listed below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press <strong>
Windows key + W</strong> on the keyboard to search <strong>Settings</strong>, type “<strong>System</strong>” in the Search box and then click
<strong>System</strong> from the list of results.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong>
System protection</strong> in the task pane.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under <strong>
Protection Settings</strong> click to select <strong>Local Disk (C:) (System)</strong> and then click
<strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under <strong>
Disk Space Usage</strong>, move the <strong>Max Usage slider</strong> to the right to increase the disk space usage for System Restore points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If protection is turned on for additional drives you might consider increasing the Max Usage for those drives as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information helps. Please keep us posted on the issue. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem: I manually created 2 new restore points last night, giving me 3 total. I have set 25% of my drive, or 94GB,&nbsp; reserved for system restore. I did not check this AM, but a couple of hours ago an automatic restore point was created,
 and the prior 3 are gone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I see nothing in TaskScheduler-SystemRestore about deleting old points, but for the time being, I am going to turn off SR in Task Scheduler to see if this is the problem, because if memory serves me right, it seems that the restore points have always been
 disappearing after an TS-SR automatic creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Addendum: Even after disabling SR, automatic restore point creation ran and deleted all but the one it was automatically creating. I am hopeful turning on Volume Shadow Copy will work because it was off on my brand-new system:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>2/23 addendum: Automatic restore point creation still occurring and still deleting all old restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/12/2017 addendum: I created a Restore Point Creation in Taskscheduler not long after this post. I am 98% sure that it was working fine. Today I ran a Win10 update - which included an NVIDIA update (12/29/16) - and as usual when an NVIDIA update occurs,
 my desktop icons get scrambled. Thankfully, I ALWAYS do an AOMEI backup before an NVIDIA update, and often any MSFT WIN update,&nbsp; and could restore. I ran WIN check for updates after restoring and it proceeded to reinstall the update without pausing/asking.
 Icons scrambled again but I took a screen print of them before hand. I was even working on this edit and it came back intact. Regardless, a non-windows backup program is mandatory IMO and I love AOMEI (I paid for professional but when I used free copy, it
 was good).</p>

            <p>I've the same problems.</p>
<p>It's nothing to do with any of your 1st 3 suggestions, or indeed any others that Microsoft have mentioned here on this website.</p>
<p>Why on earth they can't issue updates that can at least utilise my restore points instead of going back to a previous update I don't know. You might as well do away with restore points all together to save us all wasting more time, it's bad enough not being
 to turn off updates anyway.</p>
<p>To be honest they have almost made a 'sows ear from a silk purse'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all very well you saying an update renders old restore points useless so deletes them but everytime I get an upgrade I have to delete all the W10 apps that are useless to me. That's apart from waiting so long for you to install them..... don't switch
 off your computer etc etc. usually when I'm about to go to bed!</p>
<p>Having now done this 3 or 4 times it really is time for me to get back W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have created a monster......................... which takes over our lives, WELL DONE MICROSOFT.</p>

            <p><span>Win 10 restore points are vanishing from my PC, too.</span></p>
<p><span>On 04/01/17 after tweaking file backup schedules, I checked Win 10 System Restore for the first time since upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 in 2016.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Discovered no restore points at all, even though system protection for C: was configured “on.”</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I changed the max usage slider from lowest setting (~1%, 10.0 GB) to 10% (68.83 GB) to ensure plenty of space.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Then I created a restore point manually &amp; verified it appeared (by itself) in the restore point list, with proper date/time, my description &amp; type = manual.</span></p>
<p><span>On 04/02/17 in AM I opened Task Scheduler &amp; found no triggers for task SR, even though the last run time was listed as 03/31/17.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I created a trigger for SR execution daily at 1:00 AM.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Then I opened System Restore &amp; found no restore points!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The point I created manually on 04/01 had vanished.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Later on 04/02 I opened System Restore again &amp; it showed 1 restore point created on 04/02 06:57:30 PM with description &amp; type = Windows Update.</span></p>
<p><span>On 04/03/17 in AM I opened System Restore &amp; the Win Update point dated 04/02 was still listed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>However, there was no point corresponding to task SR, even though Task Scheduler reported that SR had “completed successfully” earlier on 04/03.</span></p>
<p><span>On 04/04/17 in AM I opened System Restore &amp; found no restore points!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Like my manual point on 04/01, the Win Update point on 04/02 had vanished, and still no point was listed for task SR, even though Task Scheduler reported that SR had “completed successfully” on 04/03 &amp; on 4/04.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I created another manual restore point &amp; verified that it appeared by itself in the list.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Later on 04/04 I looked again.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>My latest manual point had vanished, but a Win Update restore point created in PM on 04/04 was listed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>As of 04/04/17 09:48PM, it’s still there, but I expect it to vanish by 04/05.</span></p>
<p><span>I have read all the posts on “Windows 10 – Restore Points are being deleted” ranging from 11/16/15 to 02/09/17.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If there’s a solution for my problem, I haven’t found it yet.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>To reiterate, System Protection is configured “on” for C:, 68.83 GB of disk space is allowed, current usage (from 04/04 Win Update restore point) is only 86.17 MB, C: has 491 GB free out of 688 GB capacity.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I can create a restore point manually, and points are being created by Win Update, but System Restore never lists more than one point, and that point vanishes by the next day, even if no additional point has yet
 been created.</span></p>
<p><span>What else can I do to keep at least one restore point available at all times?</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Please provide the answers to the following for us to be able to learn more about the issue you're experiencing with restore points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your Windows 10 up-to-date?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried running the <strong>System File Checker</strong>? <strong>System File Checker or SFC</strong> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore these corrupted files. If you haven't done
 an SFC scan, you can follow the steps found on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can follow the methods below to check file system errors:<br />
<strong>Method 1 - Disk Error Checking</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>File Explorer</strong>, then click <strong>This PC</strong> from the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Right-click on the drive you will be checking, then choose <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Example: </strong>Local Disk (C:)<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Tools </strong>tab.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Check</strong> button under <strong>Error checking</strong>. This will check the drive for file system errors.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Scan</strong> drive.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2 - Running the Check Disk</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong>, then choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> to show the Command Prompt window.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>chkdsk /f C:</strong> then press the <strong>Enter</strong> key from the keyboard to check the Local Disk C:. You can also do this for the other drives that you have.<br />
</li><li>Restart your computer.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result after running the above mentioned methods.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

            <p><span>Michelle, thanks much for your kind reply to my 4/4/17 query above re Win10 vanishing restore points.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Bottom line as of 4/8: I can still create a restore point manually; task SR is “completed successfully” every day, but never creates a restore point; any restore point I create still vanishes, e.g., point created manually 4/7/17 7:59:51 PM vanished
 from System Restore by 4/8/17 12:33 PM.</span></p>
<p><span>I had already scanned C: via Properties &gt; Tools in Win10 and then via CHKDSK /R.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All OK except CHKDSK found bad clusters in one file, WebCacheV01.dat.<span>&nbsp;
</span>More on that at end of this post, following answers to the questions you asked.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Windows 10 up-to-date</span></span><span>?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Win Update has installed updates periodically. <span>&nbsp;</span>PC update history showed last “Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3150513) Successfully installed on 3/16/2017”.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On 4/7/17 I checked for updates manually, downloaded &amp; installed KB4015438, which seems to be most recent for Win10 v1607 on //support.microsoft.com/…/update-history.<span>&nbsp;
</span>More on this after report on SFC, below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>System File Checker</span></span><span>?<span>&nbsp;
</span>On 4/7/17 I ran sfc /scannow, as you recommended.<span>&nbsp; </span>When verification 100% complete: “Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FYI, installing KB3150513 temporarily inactivated Microsoft Edge after PC restart.<span>&nbsp;
</span>IE 11 was unaffected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Found suggestion on //answers.microsoft.com 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> to run Windows App Troubleshooter (didn’t work – said to sign in with my Microsoft
 account, but I couldn’t find where to sign in) &amp; 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> to run SFC, which I hadn’t yet done, so I ran SFC (A-OK, see above).
<span>&nbsp;</span>Edge still wouldn’t start at all, so I cycled power on PC.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Then Edge ran normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Here’s xtra info re CHKDSK /R result.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Stages 1 &amp; 2 ran A-OK.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stage 3 cleaned up 6073 unused index entries &amp; security descriptors &amp; compacted the security descriptor stream.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Stage 4 encountered a “disk read error” &amp; said </span>“The disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in \Users\owner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebCacheV01.dat”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Stage 5 c<span>orrected errors in the master file table's (MFT) BITMAP attribute &amp; in the Volume Bitmap.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I can send you the whole CHKDSK /R report, if you want.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After CHKDSK /R, installing KB3150513 &amp; running SFC, I can still create restore points, but they still vanish in a day.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’d be interested in any advice you might offer re </span>WebCacheV01.dat.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s the only file not backed up when Windows backs up all of C:.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I gather it stores IE 10 &amp; 11 browsing history, but my IE 11 runs fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>
My primary goal is still to create a restore point that will last 90 days.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How do you recommend me to proceed?&nbsp; Thanks again for your time &amp; expertise.</span></span></p>

                    My laptop&nbsp;Sony VAIO VGN-TZ31WN, a problem exists&nbsp;with unknown device after running recovery back up stored in HDD. Along with the purchase of this laptop was its recovery disc&nbsp;XP Pro OS. But my laptop is running with Vista business. I have some problems
 with start up, what I did I run the vaio recovery&nbsp;(F10) hoping to restore my stuff.&nbsp;To my surprise, it installing only the XP Pro OS, my pre-installed Vaio software and drivers running Vista&nbsp;were all gone. I bought new Vista business OS and installed, got
 all the Vista drivers and utilities downloaded from vaio-link, able to succeed drivers and software installation except for one unknown device. I tried to go vaio support but&nbsp;solution is&nbsp;hard to find. I went to microsoft hotfix solutions&nbsp;hoping to find answers.
 I tried to re-installed all Vista drivers of this model from Vaio-link, still not able to solve the problem. I suspect unknown device is the built-in 3G modem which it promts device not found when I open the 3G software. Here's the thread:<br />

<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Vista Answers Forum.<br />
</span><br />
<strong>Code 28</strong></p>
<span>generally signifies the drivers for the device are not installed. Recommended resolution would be to install the driver. You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in. If
 you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.
<br />
In the device Properties dialog box, click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver to start the Hardware Update Wizard. Follow the instructions to install the driver.<br />

    <title>Why Xbox is failing in Japan and how it can be fixed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nothuman99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Xbox is failing in Japan and how it can be fixed.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently read an article that said that Japan Xbox has been having very poor sales in both consoles and games and I would like to talk about what Microsoft is doing bad and what its doing great.<br />
<br />
First the good, Xbox Japan is still increasing their efforts to sell their consoles and keep working despite poor sales. Microsoft also stated that they would like to focus more on Asia which is good for western gamers in the country.<br />
<br />
Now the bad, Xbox Japan's good traits are also its problem, increasing the effort to sell their consoles in Sony's and Nintendo's homeland wastes funding in areas where western gaming is not very appreciated. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
How can Xbox Japan increase their sales? The reason why Xbox Japan is failing is because the western titles offered through xbox live are not targeted at Asian culture which is a huge marketplace home to the Playstation and Playstation Vita who keep selling
 japanese titles such as Jstars + and One Piece Pirate Warriors 3. These are just examples but comparing the Xbox's and Playstation's exclusive titles I can see why Sony is winning the war in Asia.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So its time for the harsh words, xbox I love you but you have to contact Japanese developers and increase your market to the audience, I love your western games (North American here) but I would also like to see more Japanese style indie or AAA games in the
 marketplace. I beg of you, the xbox one is my favorite console and I want it to become better and for all people around the world to enjoy it as much as I do.</p>

<p>Xbox has never done well in Japan for one reason. &nbsp;Japan supports Japanese products. &nbsp;They have a very strict culture. &nbsp;The Japanese are oppressed, and are borderline shamed for not supporting their own country and its products. &nbsp;How many American or European
 cars do you see in Japan? &nbsp;Close to 0. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read articles where a few well known Japanese Gaming Shops have removed Xbox from their shelves! &nbsp;Can you imagine if an American shop removed S*ny's game machine from shelves so they couldn't be sold? &nbsp;That would be absolute world breaking news.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know if anything can be done to help. &nbsp;Even signing on a well known Japanese Gaming studio or making exclusive deals is not easy and would not do a lot. &nbsp;Lost Odyssey was a fantastic game. &nbsp;But it didn't move consoles. &nbsp;Shenmue 2 didn't
 help a lot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion if you want to penetrate the Japanese market you must penetrate their culture. &nbsp;And that is not an easy task.</p>

<p>Pretty good post, compared to PlayStation &amp; even Nintendo, Xbox was always a failure in Japan. Since Xbox is an American thing, the Japanese will probably never buy the Xbox One unless it has a good amount of Japanese games. Japanese gamers are not really
 into Shooters &amp; Western RPGs that much, it's a fact.</p>

<p>I doubt Xbox could sell in Japan anyways. Even with a big Japanese developer on board, I don't see them doing well in Japan. It might push a few sales here and there, but it probably wont be much of a dent in sales.

            Hi Harrsha, 
<br />
<br />Upgrading to 1809 should not remove/delete your files. 
<br />
<br />That being said, I’m a huge fan of backing up in general, but definitely before big updates, regardless of the OS. That was if anything was to go awry, you have peace of mind because all your files can be added right back on. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!
<br />- C

            Hi Harrsha
<br />
<br />Yes this bug has been reported by a few users, where all their files disappeared !
<br />
<br />Microsoft are looking into this bug currently!
<br />
<br />If you are going to go ahead and upgrade to 1809, please backup all you important files before the upgrade begins
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            For some, they do get deleted. Follow the below process to upgrade to 1809
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 1809 manually to have a successful upgrade. To upgrade to 1809, you should do following -
<br />
<br />1. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can install it again)
<br />
<br />3. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10

<p>There's a lot of confusing and misleading information available on the Internet about "end of support" for Windows XP, and Microsoft doesn't make things any easier.&nbsp; As near as I can determine, Microsoft will continue to supply security updates (via Windows/Microsoft
 Update) until April 2014.&nbsp; See, e.g., <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/xp-in-2020-not-even-close-read-the-fine-print/2270?tag=mantle_skin;content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/xp-in-2020-not-even-close-read-the-fine-print/2270?tag=mantle_skin;content</a></p>
<p>The foregoing is completely irrelevant to your issue of installing an Epson NX415 on a Win XP sp 3 system.</p>
<p>Whenever computer vendor 1 says, "The problem with my product is computer vendor 2's problem," the consumer is the one with the real problem.&nbsp; If you're going to rely on Epson's failure to support its product and seek help here, it would help if you explained
 exactly what Epson claimed was the problem with Windows XP. Or did the Epson tech simply say, "We can't figure it out. It must be a Windows problem."</p>
<p>Can you describe the "great difficulty" you had in installing the Epson software?</p>
<p>In general, the best way to deal with printer problems is to completely uninstall the printer and all related software and then start over.&nbsp; I can understand that you may be somewhat reluctant to do this given the time and effort you've already apparently
 expended, but that's my suggestion.</p>
<p>The driver and software package for your printer for Windows XP 32-bit is available from Epson here:<a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=128287&amp;prodoid=63083741&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=128287&amp;prodoid=63083741&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=Windows</a>
 (it actually looks as if the same package is for XP, Vista, and Win 7, so you may already have it on your Win 7 computer).</p>
<p>Download the package and follow the directions here to clean out your old s/w before installing the new:<a href="http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm</a></p>

http://members.shaw.ca/bsanders/CleanPrinterDrivers.htm</a></p>
<p>If I were you, I'd disconnect the computer from the Internet and completely disable your antivirus application and all other anti-malware applications before starting the installation process for the printer software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might even go so far as to start msconfig (Start &gt; Run &gt; msconfig &gt; OK), and do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click "Select Startup" and uncheck "Load Startup items" </li><li>Go to the Services tab, click the box to "Hide all Microsoft services," then click "Disable all"</li><li>Click OK </li><li>Restart the computer before doing the install of the printer software. </li></ul>

<h2>            Information Request&#58; Network Discovery &#40;llmnr &#38; ws-discovery&#41;</h2>
                    Hi folks,<br />
<br />
I'm using an Acer laptop with Win 7 Home Premium and ESET Smart Security 4. I connect to the 'net via wifi, and the only other machine permanently on the network (apart from my XP desktop, which is also wifi so I tend not to have it connected at the same time)
 is a Vista desktop.<br />
I'm fairly new to Win 7, and have noticed the following:<br />
Soon after I boot and open a browser, ESET firewall pops up a remote connection attempt from llmnr or ws-discovery (usually one after the other) from the Vista machine. I have no need to connect to the Vista box, so I select Deny (tho, until I understand it,
 it's always a temporary Deny).<br />
Shortly thereafter it appears that I no longer have an internet connection, although I can still ping the DNS server. I am aware that the two above named services are part of Network Discovery. I have disabled IPv6.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me about Network Discovery, and also why I need it to surf? Is there any security risk associated with allowing those services?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Stuart<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would suggest that you <strong>temporarily disable the anti-virus</strong> and
<strong>firewall</strong> on the computer and check if you are able to connect to the network. Ensure to enable the anti-virus and firewall on the computer.<br />
</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><br />
I would also suggest that you run Network troubleshooter which would help you to diagnose and fix the problem on the computer. Follow the steps below to access the network troubleshooter:<br />
Click the <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then, in the search box, type
<strong>network</strong>. In the list of results, click <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshoot problems</strong>.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
My question is more an information request than a problem I'm having.<br />
Can you tell me about llmnr and ws-discovery, and how they relate to being able to access the internet? And do they carry the possibility of a security risk if I just permanently allow them?<br />

<h2>            Migrating from 32-bit to 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I recently&nbsp;purchased a Toshiba Satellite L550 laptop (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/yanb3pb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yanb3pb</a>) pre-installed with Windows 7 Professional
<strong>32-bit</strong> (which means&nbsp;I don't have any Windows 7 discs of any kind).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How can I&nbsp;migrate&nbsp;to Windows 7 Professional <strong>64-bit</strong>? <br />
<br />
Any assistance or advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

            Some computer manufacturers will send you a 64bit install disk if you call them, you might have to pay a small fee though. If Toshiba won't send you one you would have to buy the retail copy of Windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>32bit to 64bit Custom Clean Install Steps</strong> <br />
<br />
You can use an upgrade disk, but you can't upgrade from a 32 bit system into a 64 bit system, the only way is to do a custom clean install which means you'd have to reinstall all your programs.<br />
<br />
You will have too do a custom clean install that will wipe out all your programs, but you can save your files to an external storage before doing so with Windows Easy Transfer. Here are the steps according to Microsoft:<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (http://winodws.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy
 files you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker not saving Movie in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently upgraded to windows 10. </p>
<p>I have created a movie in Windows Movie Maker for an Uni assignment.</p>
<p>I am trying to complete the movie by "saving the Movie" in wmv format. </p>
<p>The movie is only 5mins long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that nothing is happening. The application is stopped at Step 1 of 2 : 0% complete!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried, running in as administrator, checking all my source files for the movie, uninstalled, clean rebooted and reinstalled the application. Nothing has made a difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, assignment due at the end of this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; I am running. Windows 10 Home (1809). </p>
<p>For a few days now I have been getting a blue screen error at startup, specifically "page fault in non-paged area" . I have not had this problem until the system updated to 1809.
</p>
<p>To fix it I thought I would use a restore point that predates the blue screen error, but have received the (0x80070005) file access denied error code on both attempts, one of which was run in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">safe mode</span>. So system restore is unusable.</p>

            Hi, mpfeil 
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps.
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem 
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump
<br />Check this link:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            Hi MP.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In addition have you tried running System Restore in Repair Mode when Windows is not running?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            It is the BSOD that won't let my factory reset or reset this pc or go back to previous version or start repair or go into safe mode or system restore. I don't have CD or ad stick either. All started with an update. I have nothing on this computer but windows,
 microsoft office.

            The problem is caused by  (ntoskrnl.exe)
<br />
<br />Check these drivers, I hope it helps.

<h2>            Paperport 14.5 on surface</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In order to be able to use paperport (and many other programs for that matter) on a surfacepro with screen scaling, one has to activate
</p>
<p><strong><em>"Override high dpi scaling behaviour. Scaling performed by System(Enhanced)"
</em></strong></p>
<p>in the compatibility section of the file property dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, doing so provokes the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PaperPort appears to be running in XP compatibility mode which will result in errors.&nbsp; We recommend disabling Compatibility Mode for the Paperport.exe program, see Technote 6629.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thereafter the program closes despite the fact that XP compatibility mode is not selected.</p>
<p>What can be done to allow paperport to be run on a surfacepro using system scaling?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Memory usage climbing steadily when using adobe after effects or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewshashy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Memory usage climbing steadily when using adobe after effects or having more than a few windows open</h2>
                    <p>So I recently downloaded and installed Adobe After Effects. For the first couple of hours it worked fine and then when I tried to close it it froze and I had to task manager it. AAE closed and I was left with the screen black and the computer not working.
 I wasn't able to press any buttons or press on any icons on the desktop. I let it sit for a bit and then finally it went back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to check the task manager to see if all the programs had closed and they had. But, on the&nbsp;other hand the&nbsp;memory usage indicator was way to high for there being no windows open except for task manager itself. Even as I'm typing this,&nbsp;I'm monitoring
 the usage and the memory usage is above 20% even though I only have one window open in Microsoft edge and the task manager&nbsp;open. When I have AAE on the memory usage climbs steadily all the way to 80% and won't stop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked over some possible causes as to why my usage is so high even when I'm not even pushing the computer to do much at all. Some of them said some things such as a memory leak caused by memory not being able to be dumped when it should be dumped.
 I don't really understand all that much about the depths of computer processes and whatnot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me if this is normal and I'm just now noticing it. Or is it out of the ordinary and&nbsp;I have a problem. If I have a problem can someone give me a simple version on how to possibly fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a new part of the community also, :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Matthew </p>

            <p>It's absolutely normal. &nbsp;The system also preloads information into memory too. &nbsp;Let the OS handle the memory, you just use it. &nbsp;Just like your car handles cycling the water in and out of the radiator, you just drive it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, don't fall for those fake "memory cleaner" apps that empty out your RAM. &nbsp;That guarantees slower performance because now all that data has to be loaded from the drive instead, which is thousands of times slower than RAM.<br />

            <p>The operating system will do it's best to use about 60-90% of your memory using pre-fetch and super-fetch so that everything is in memory ahead of time. &nbsp;But since memory is instant (speed of light), it can instantly clear it out in a nanosecond if you open
 a big game or something that needs a lot of memory, so don't worry about how much it says is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, if you open your resource monitor and check, all that blue "used" is really not ACTUALLY used. &nbsp;That's the pre-loaded memory that can be cleared instantly anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this, this freshly-booted system <em>looks</em> like it has 99% of the memory "in use", but in reality only about 20% of it
<em>really</em> is (the green part).</p>
