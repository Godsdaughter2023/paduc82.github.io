                    My WD HDD has crashed. As far as I know it is a software issue and the Windows 7 is unable to load as it often goes into Startup Recovery and attempts to repair for a long period of time (1 whole day with no success). The root cause I found was that the

- Yes, you can.<br />
<br />
<div>- You should treat this event as a wake-up call. Lots of people do not bother backing up their irreplaceable files regularly to an external medium until they suffer a major disaster. You might just be able to wriggle out of this one.<br />
<br />
<div><span style="font-style: italic">Browsing through the net, I learnt that there are ways to fix the HDD issue on another computer by typing commands on the COMMAND PROMPT such as CHKDSK on that corrupted disk. Are there ways that I would be able to repair

- You can indeed to this. However, you should retrieve your files first because chkdsk has a nasty habit of aggravating the damage when it finds a partially readable folder. It will repair the damage and make the files unreadable at the same time.<br />

            <p>It doesn't have to be the exact same version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect the drive to its temporary host and, assuming that the drive is readable, recover your data before doing anything else.</p>
<p>Next, either run CHKDSK on the drive from within the host or download the appropriate HDD drive utilities from the manufacturer website and run them. If the tests hang at one spot, the drive has probably gone west and it would not be advisable to use it
 for anything more meaningful than a paperweight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that any drive crash will result in Windows corrupting, but it may not always be the fault of Windows. If the clusters on a hard drive start to fail, whatever data is on the clusters will be retrieved by Windows but may corrupt in the process..

<h2>            100&#37; packets loss at same time everyday&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I keep ringing my ISP they said everything is fine on there end and fine on mine but the router had parental controls turned off for a few months, We previously had it set up to off gaming at 9pm till 6am and now
<strong>Parental Control settings are turned off</strong> but the Xbox one still goes off at 9pm but not fully I can play any games but they have faults&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. I'm playing black ops 4 at 8pm all is fine I change game to say PUBG for 1 hour play that then jump back on Blops4 at 9.10pm it wont sign me in&nbsp;<span>flickers
 from</span> <strong>Connecting to the service</strong><span> to </span>
<strong>coming soon</strong><span> not sure why that happens&nbsp;</span> after that I get<strong> a.b.c.d.-.-.-.-.-.-.- Novar yellow wolf error</strong>&nbsp;
 but if I'm playing Black ops 4 at&nbsp; 7 pm and play straight through or I've already made it past the sign in part before 9pm I can play all night with no issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with pubg <strong>if im in the matchmaking at 9pm it will kick me</strong> to the start menu if I'm in the menu screen too long without doing anything it will kick me to the start menu
<strong>if I play call of duty it will not let me get passed the start menu ?</strong> ISP still says there's nothing wrong but to me something is definitely up somewhere and nobody know what it is looked everywhere!</p>

            As another user pointed out it sounds as thought the parental controls did not completely clear out in the router.&nbsp; resetting the router to factory default may be your best course of action.&nbsp; There I normally a small recessed button that you press and
 hold for 10 second to factory rest.&nbsp; You may want to look up the manufacturer online to verify the proper procedure to do so.&nbsp; Record your settings first.

            Already tried, as a said earler weturned off all the setting for parental control and then it all started o happen at 9pm till 11pm, We never set it to come back on at 11pm&nbsp; in the first place it was 6am, when we noticed it was playing up we reset the
 router with the hairpin reset button went in to the webpage to the router setting to double check and then ...Called are ISP and they said everything is fine there's no drop in the connection which is quite true because&nbsp; nothing else gets affected apart from
 the XboxOne

<p>Hi Panax,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the packet loss. You've literally tried most of the troubleshooting. We recommend trying to upgrade or swap the router out because most of the time its the router. Sounds as if the settings are still applied in some way but at a
 different time. If its the same time daily its most likely not due to the console but something with the router. Before swapping try to disable any firewall settings in the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this and let us know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Do me a favor? On your Network setting does it say IPv4 &amp; IPv6? Sounds super weird but my boy had this same exact issue. Had to do with his router not support a IPv6 it was always for two hours from a certain time after that he was golden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also check to make sure your router has the latest up to date firmware this may also be an issue</p>

            Hi, you need to insist that your ISP does a proper line test over a minimum of 24 hrs. There could well be an intermittent line fault. I worked in the comms industry and have had this issue arise on my own home lines and there were either equipment faults
 or cable faults that took down my Xbox Live. Never bothered any of my other equipment as it was just a quick outage but enough to drop the Xbox.

            How were the parental controls applied within the route?&nbsp; Was it by the device name,IP address or MAC address?&nbsp; If it was either IP address or device name simply renaming your XBOX or giving it a new IP "may" get around the controls that were set and seem
 to still be affecting you.&nbsp; If it was done by MAC address then you could try the alternate MAC address function in network settings on the console.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Can&#39;t Run Applications From Search</h2>
                    <p>Had a strange problem since updating to the windows 10 creator update; I'm unable to run any applications from search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open open the task bar and type say, "Fire..." it will fill it out to Firefox as expected and will show the icon and program, but if I press enter nothing happens. If I click on it, nothing happens, this is true for both Microsoft (like Run) and non-Microsoft
 applications (Firefox). If I run those programs through other shortcuts or from the files themselves, they work as normal. I can still open files and folders through search, and if I search for a photo say, it will open in my default photo editor, but search
 for that photo editor, and it won't open. I am running the latest version of windows 10, with update 1703.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the steps listed by Giridhar J, but have been unable to resolve the issue, however, I did find that if I create a new user account, that account doesn't have the issue. Not quite sure where to go from here or what that indicates. I am using
 a Microsoft account (non-local) and and am the administrator of the system. The account I created was local and non-administrator.</p>

<h2>            Possible Hijack, system getting &#39;changed&#39; or maybe &#39;partially virtualized&#39;, strange virus situation very important</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem with 2 computers and its kind of a big one.&nbsp; Hard to know where to start so I will keep it short, but I think this may even concern Microsoft, as it involves the use of what I believe to be fake "terms of service" or fine print and I may
 even know where the source of this&nbsp;problem is, but I really need some help! Myself and another person both use laptops that we purchased together.&nbsp; We are living with family, however the laptops, a TOSHIBA satellite and an HP/COMPAQ F700, along with what I
 call a wireless router belong to US! We are connected via this wireless device, a PRISM which is maybe a little older but sure seems to work, it is plugged into a motorola cable modem owned by someone else in the house.&nbsp; To get things moving along, it has
 come to our attention that A: our systems are periodically changing without our permission, by this I mean that the toshiba which was purchased from walmart brand new, came with an Intel Celeron and I BELIEVE the wireless adapter WAS an atheros brand.&nbsp; I KNOW
 this was the case with the Compaq as far as the wireless adapter, and the Compaq was purchased from a rent to own store and came with a AMD processer 1GB of ram.&nbsp; For some reason, we are under some sort of Admin control, and our system is periodically changing
 ON BOTH computers to saying its an intel family chipset and our wireless adapters will change to realtek USB 2.0 , again on BOTH computers.&nbsp; When this happens, our admin user accounts, which we had the original user accounts as admin AND i have unlocked the
 hidden ones via the cmd prompt and the holding down shift + enter thing, will be signed out somehow, restricting our ability to do things.&nbsp; LAST FEW DETAILS i promise: something called intel matrix storage magically appeared with RAID monitoring software and
 we have seen our event logs, which we prob didn't know existed, being uploaded via&nbsp;a remote user, and we never accessed the remote settings, except to turn them off, as well as the file sharing options.&nbsp; However they keep changing back when this happens.&nbsp;
 Yesterday, to finish this up, I discovered some strange things after doing a complete system repair thing, not for the first time, this time on the compaq.&nbsp; after the repair, which looked good at first, i was bothered to find some readme shortcuts present
 in the recently changed folder on start menu.&nbsp; I followed them to the folder locations which led me to prog. files, THE SIMS 2, and various subfolders with T.O.S. claiming to be from MICROSOFT and mentioning no particular O.S. except with the mention of .NET
 and some virtualization programs which we had noticed running in the task menu.&nbsp; OH i shouldn't forget that it along with the processor change in both pc's THEY BOTH now say they ar x86 client or workstation pcs and a recent attempt on system repair or whatever
 by pressing f8 on the toshiba somehow led me to a weird command prompt that started with X:??&nbsp; I am prob leaving some stuff out even though this is really long, but the SIMS 2 folder is very bothering becuz an individual that lives here once gave us a CD on
 an older computer that has not been used in at least 3 years and we have certainly not installed this game ON EITHER of these new computers.&nbsp; I SUSPECT VARIOUS things but not sure what to do.&nbsp; I TRIED to get our product key off the TOSHIBA but was told previously
 by a local repair shop that it appears to have BEEN REMOVED!&nbsp; The folders in question I BELIEVE are still on both pc's and we have run the suggested software including microsoft security essentials, s.s.and destroy, and the malewarebytes thing, as well as
 having a repair shop give us some advice. they said several things, like the toshiba was trying to boot from the dvd/cd drive, and then from pxe boot or something and someone had changed the wake on lan option and maybe some other things i don't remember.&nbsp;
 OK SORRY FOR ALL THAT REALLY, but i wanted to make sure I gave as much info as possible as we have never wanted our pc's cloned, virtualized, or anything like that, and whatever realtek usb 2.0 is, it made another wireless connection icon in the bottom right
 tray AND THE COMPAQ STAYED CONNECTED WITH the WIRELESS switch turned off?!?!&nbsp; HELP!</p>

            Thank you for your graceful reply. It certainly does sound to me like your computers are compromised. As I said, the only way to secure them now is to restore back to factory condition once again after backing up your data and then set them up per the
 suggestions below. This costs you nothing but time. I will also give you my general information about setting up the wireless network securely. Unfortunately, you must have control of the wireless router to do this. If you don't, then consider getting your
 own Internet connection and your own wireless router. <strong>In addition to the general security steps below, make sure File/Printer Sharing is OFF.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>The bottom line about all of this for you to keep in the front of your mind is that in security, physical access to a machine trumps everything.</strong> If you don't trust the people with whom you live and/or the people who visit them, you must keep
 the computer with you or in a securely locked environment that no one else can get into. And of course locks can be picked. Or find better people to live with. I understand that some of this isn't possible in your Real World but I'm trying to tell you all
 the options.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Computer Security</strong> - <strong>Any computer running any operating system can be accessed by someone with 1) physical access; 2) time; 3) skill; 4) tools.</strong> There are a few things you can do to make it a bit harder
 though:<br />
<br />
1. Set a password in the BIOS that must be entered before booting the operating system. Also set the Supervisor password in the BIOS so BIOS Setup can't be entered without it.<br />
<br />
2. From the BIOS, change the boot order to hard drive first.<br />
<br />
3. Set strong passwords on all accounts, including the built-in Administrator account in XP (it is disabled by default in Vista).<br />
<br />
4. If you leave your own account logged in, use the Windows Key + L to lock the computer (and/or set the screensaver/power saving) when you step away from the computer and require a password to resume.<br />
<br />
5. Make other users Limited accounts in XP Home, regular user accounts in XP Pro. All users should be on a Standard account in Vista with an Administrator account (called something like "Tech" or "CompAdmin") only used for elevation purposes.<br />
<br />
6. If more than one person uses the computer set user permissions/restrictions:<br />
<br />
</span>If you have XP/Vista/Windows 7 Home, you don't have the built-in ability to create fine-grained limitations. In XP and Vista you can use either MVP Doug Knox's Security Console or the MS SteadyState program to set the restrictions the way you want. SteadyState
 supports Vista now but not Windows 7. Mr. Knox's Security Console may still work in Win7.<br />

<strong><span>Please understand that these are technical responses to what is basically a non-technical problem and there are ways around all of these precautions. This is a family/interpersonal issue that can't be solved by technical
 means.</span> </strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Setting up a wireless router securely</strong> - <span>
Have a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable. Examples given are for a Linksys router. Refer to your router manual or the router mftr.'s website for default settings if you don't have a Linksys. Open a browser such as Internet Explorer or
 Firefox and in the addressbar type:<br />
<br />
http://192.168.1.1 [enter] (this is the router's default IP address, which varies from router to router so check your manual)<br />
<br />
This will bring you to&nbsp;router's login screen. The default username is left blank and the Linksys default password is "admin" without the quotes. Enter that information. You are now in the router's configuration utility. Your configuration utility may differ
 slightly from mine. The first thing to do is change the default password because
<br />
Click on the Administration link at the top of the page. Enter your new password.
 username blank and put in your new password to get back into the configuration utility.<br />
<br />
Now click on the Wireless link at the top of the page. Change the Wireless Network Name (SSID) from the default to something you will recognize. I suggest that my clients not use their family name as the SSID. For example, you might wish to name your wireless
 network "CastleAnthrax" or the like. ;-)<br />
<br />
Click the Save Settings and when you get the prompt that your changes were successful, click on the Wireless Security link which is right next to the Basic Wireless Settings link (where you changed your SSID). Most computers purchased within the last 4 years
 have wireless hardware that will support WPA2-Personal (also called WPA2-PSK). This is the encryption level you want. If your wireless hardware is older, use WPA. Do not use WEP as that is easily cracked within minutes. So go ahead and set the Security Mode
 to WPA2-Personal. Do that and enter a passphrase. For example, you might use the passphrase, "Here be dragons, beware you scurvy dogs!". The passphrase is what you will enter on any computers that are allowed to connect to the wireless network.

At this point, your router is configured and if the computer you were using to configure the router is normally going to connect wirelessly, disconnect the ethernet cable and the computer's wireless feature should see your new network. Enter the passphrase
 you created (exactly as you wrote it with all capitalization and punctuation) to join the network and start surfing.<br />

If you'd like me to expand on any of that or have more questions, please don't hesitate to ask.</span>

&nbsp;Why don't you go for torrents? There are many fake sites which will give you virus with the name of the product you are searching for. Still if you want to directly download the .iso file of Windows 8.1, try with these keywords "download 8.1 iso" on google.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Laptop stuck on black screen before log in screen in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodalb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop stuck on black screen before log in screen in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I’m having a major issue with starting my laptop. It goes through normal start up procedures, but stalls on a black screen right before the log in screen. I’ve tried the start/stop method of getting to the recovery screen menu, but nothing there will help.
 Start Up Repair didn’t work. System Restore didn’t either. I can’t even get it to allow me to start my laptop in safe mode. Whenever I try, it immediately goes back to black screen, or crashes and shuts off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I noticed this problem, there was something scrolling across the bottom of the screen during start up(below the blue Windows logo) about recovering Drive C. After it finished scrolling across the screen, it went right to the black screen,
 and I haven’t been able to use my laptop since. I didn’t notice anything unusual when I shut it off the last fime before this happened. I can tell when it’s updating, and it wasn’t that time. Everything about it was normal. One thing I can think of is that
 I did receive an update a few days ago, and after that the Start Menu wouldn’t work, and neither would Google Chrome. I assumed that another update would fix both issues. Not so much...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any thoughts on how I can fix this, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, I’m using Windows 10(64 bit), upgraded from Windows 7, on a Dell Inspiron Special Edition 17R.</p>

    <title>User-ID&#47;Password problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peedub  say:</h3>
<h2>            User-ID&#47;Password problems</h2>
                    <p>On my home Wifi net, I have had my HP desktop, a Dell Venue pad and a Samsung TV. All co-existed quite well for years. Around April this year, I resuscitated my deceased wife's HP laptop, giving a new battery. All 3 computers run Windows 10. Since the May-June
 Windows updates, the following has happened: the HP desktop was unable to restart after an update, requiring me to have a local repair shop to install a complete ground-up version of Windows 10. During this time period, the HP laptop and the Dell pad also
 became more aware of the Wifi network. Unusual events were seen, such as: wallpaper on the HP laptop disappeared, but is now installed on both displays of the HP Desktop. Currently, there seems to be great confusion about MS passwords. For several days, after
 several resets, I have not been able to establish a password on the Dell pad; reset passwords are usually rejected, so I have unable to use this device. I am writing this on the HP desktop, after having logged-in using a password defined yesterday as a reset
 password for the Hp laptop. It appears I am reaching a user-name/password condition where all three computers are unusable.&nbsp; Realistically, I would like to have all 3 computers recognize my email address as user-name, and I definitely don't wnat them swapping
 passwords among themselves! Need Help!User-na</p>

            Laptop and Desktop were both account.microsoft.com, and I carried out sign-in with most recent password on both with no problem, so presumably that's taken care of. Tried to add Dell Venue pad computer, using my email address and same password used with
 other two. Then I'm asked for a "Windows password", which doesn't exist. Can't get by that request.

<p>Thanks for update. You have mentioned that "<span>For several days, after several resets, I have not been able to establish a password on the Dell pad". I would like to confirm that when you have mentioned reset, did you
 mean that you just have rebooted/restarted the tablet or reset by performing a factory reset?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have performed a factory reset, you may need to register your Microsoft Account by creating a new user profile with in the Dell pad. To do this, please press the
<strong>Windows and I</strong> keys to open <strong>Settings</strong>. Click on <strong>
Accounts</strong>. Click on&nbsp;</span><strong>Family &amp; other people</strong>. Click <strong>
Add someone else to this PC</strong>. Enter your email and password that is associated to your Microsoft Account. Sign out from your current user profile and try to sign in using your Microsoft Account again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>No, Factory Reset has not been performed on Dell tablet. I considered that at one point, but found that the Windows "Mt. Rainier Screen" prevents me from swiping-in to make the Settings charm available. By "reset" I meant passwords resulting from "password
 reset" requests from Windows on either the desktop or the laptop.</p>
<p>Most recent attempt to with Dell pad: although yesterday, using Shared Settings, I believed the password had been changed the same as other machines, it then asked for a Pin or Windows password to "double-check". Neither of those existed at that time. Today,
 I scuffled around in my desk and found a password used several months ago on the Dell pad. I find that it's willing to accept that. My main objective for the pad is find info or communicate without going to my home office, but without endless harassing password
 requests. I'm beginning to feel that there may be some basic problem the Dell and Windows 10; if so, I'll probably replace it with an iPad.</p>

<p>I attempted to follow the above procedure yesterday. When the pressed the power button, the MS Mount Rainier log-in display was presented, and the old password I mentioned earlier was accepted, and screen displayed the MS blue window, with the Start, Search,
 Task View buttons visible in the lower left margin. At lower right, icons for People, Hidden Icons were shown, and time and date were displayed. I was unable to get response from Start (or any other icon). I then noted that the battery condition icon was not
 visible. That seemed strange, but I decided to make sure power was available. The pad was connected to its power source overnight. Today I found no change in the display, and no reaction to touching any icon. I then noticed that the Time, Date display was
 unchanged, still at 1:07pm, yesterday. I assume this means the pad has suffered a serious failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked account.microsoft.com again. It still shows only the desktop and the laptop on my account.</p>

<p>Und auf Deutsch, du möchtest eine Goldmitgliedschaft erwerben? Wie möchtest du diese denn zahlen? Mein Tipp: Kauf dir die Mitgliedschaft in der Bucht bei einem seriösen Anbieter, dort zahlt man im Schnitt für eine Jahresmitgliedschaft ca.35 € also weniger
 als 3 € pro Monat. </p>

    <title>Can&#39;t use default apps after updating Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlac47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t use default apps after updating Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 automatically applied updates sometime in the past week.(I don't know the exact date or updates involved)&nbsp; Now I am unable to use File Explorer to open some file types in their default application.&nbsp; For example, prior to this update mp4 files
 would open in Media Player Classic(MPC) by default.&nbsp; This is not one of the default applications that comes with Windows, but one which I installed myself and which has worked flawlessly for years.&nbsp; After the update the files continue to use the icon for MPC
 as though it were the default, but trying to open them results in the error message "This file does not have an app associated with it for performing this action.&nbsp; Please install an app or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default
 Apps Settings page."&nbsp; If I open MPC and then use its built in "Open file" option it can play mp4 files just fine so the application itself still works, but nothing I've done will let me open the files through File Explorer.&nbsp; Things I've already tried that
 don't fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I've tried setting MPC as the default through the Default Apps Settings page.&nbsp; When I try to choose a default video player my only options are "Movies &amp; TV", "Photos", "Windows Media Player", and "Look for an app in the store". &nbsp;</li><li>I've tried opening the Default Apps Settings page and selecting "Choose default apps by file type".&nbsp; This shows that MPC is already the default application for mp4 files, though if I try to change the default application, either for mp4 or any other video
 files, I get the same options as above.</li><li>I've tried right-clicking on an mp4 file and selecting "Open with".&nbsp; MPC was not an option, so I clicked "Choose another app".&nbsp; MPC was still not an option in this longer list of apps, so I clicked "Look for another app on this PC".&nbsp; This brought up a file
 browser in which I browsed to and selected the MPC executable file.&nbsp; This presented me with the same error message as before:&nbsp;<span>"This file does not have an app associated with it for performing this action.&nbsp; Please install an app or, if one is already
 installed, create an association in the Default Apps Settings page."</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even attribute this to Windows simply forgetting about the default application.&nbsp; Even when I explicitly tell File Explorer where the application I want to use is located it simply refuses to use it.</p>

<p>Hello jlac47,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted Windows registry key is a possible cause for this kind of issue in Windows. That being said, I will need more information about your machine to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the issue isolated to the media program you mentioned?</li><li>Are you experiencing the issue when using a different user account?</li><li>Can you tell me the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 system? Click the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that your system is free of corrupted registry keys and system files, let's run the
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool and the <strong>SFC</strong> tool. These tools are designed to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. You will need administrative permission to perform this procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
 button and type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Command Prompt</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Right-click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Command Prompt</span><span> and choose
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run as administrator</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Enter
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
</span><span>and then press </span>
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Note the space before each "/".</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Enter
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">sfc /scannow
</span><span>and then hit </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span><span>.
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Note the space between "sfc" and "/".</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Restart your PC.</span></li><li><span>This step may take a few minutes to start and up to 30 minutes to run and complete.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue continue after running both tools, I advise creating a new user account. This operation is mainly for isolation to determine if a corrupted user profile is causing the file association issue. See this page for the steps on how to

 Name the new user account as <em>"Test"</em> for distinction.</p>

<p>The issue is not isolated to the one application, but it also isn't affecting all applications I've installed myself.&nbsp; For example, Blender is no longer working as the default for .blend files, but Notepad++ still works as the default for .txt, .log, and
 .conf files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was only one user account on this computer when I discovered the issue, but I created a new Test account as you suggested and it experienced the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows specifications:</p>
<p>Edition - Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version - 1803</p>
<p>Installed on - 8/17/2018</p>
<p>OS build - 17134.228</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running both DISM and SFC and neither found any problems.&nbsp; I rebooted anyway and still experience the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried uninstalling the most recent Windows updates, which did not help.&nbsp; Reinstalling them also did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experienced this same issue several months ago.&nbsp; At the time I uninstalled the most recent updates and that resolved the issue until now.&nbsp; I'll see if I have a record anywhere of when that occurred.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding back with the results. I advise performing an In-place upgrade using the
<em><strong>Media Creation Tool</strong></em> as the issue may already be caused by corrupted registry keys. Performing an In-place upgrade will replace your machine's Windows system files and registry keys. This procedure will not affect your personal files
 and programs. For the steps on how to perform an In-place upgrade, please refer to the video that
<em>PaulSey</em> created from this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a" title="How to perform an In-place Upgrade with Windows 10 Step-by-Step Guide">forum
 article</a></strong>. The video is a step-by-step guide on how to perform an In-place upgrade in Windows 10.<br />

Just because you defragment a disk doesn't mean it CAN be defragmented.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Not all files and such can be defragmented.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In any case... Try these freeware defragmenters to see if they do a better job:<br />

<a href="http://www.mydefrag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyDefrag</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Their free...&nbsp; Sometimes (many times) they work better than the built-in methods.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I doubt this is a case of disk errors.<br />

The Vendor MUST have provided a way to restore the computer to factory specification, to be in compliance with the Builders Licence. It's probably a hidden partition. Look in the documentation that came with the machine on how to restore it.

<br />To sync files in OneDrive, copy, move or drag them into the OneDrive folder in File Explorer.  
<br />
<br />To sync the entire Desktop, Documents or Pictures folders in OneDrive use Folder Protection explained here:

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Storage Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronrosen1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Storage Space</h2>
                    <p>I had to use one of the two 1TB Seagate drives I set up as a 2-way mirrored Storage Space by itself for a short time, so the two drives are out of sync. Previously, they've worked just fine for over a year. I expected them to re-sync when I reconnected the
 second drive, but I'm getting a message that the Space has Reduced Resiliency. Both Physical drives are OK (with Green checkmark in Control Panel/System and Security/Storage Spaces.</p>
<p>I cannot find any good reference to checking each drive's status and/or executing a re-synchronization. I'm not even sure which drive I'm using without tracing the hardware serial numbers. Is there some Windows utility that allows users/admins to see and
 change the status of the mirror?<br />
Thanks for any help.</p>

    <title>Windows update error 0x80010108 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update error 0x80010108</h2>
                    <p>The error 0x80010108 shows whenever I try to update my Windows 10 computer. I haven't been able to update in a long time and some of the updates listed are from 2016. Sometimes when I try to download the updates instead of saying it failed it just stays
 on 0% for hours&nbsp;and does nothing.&nbsp;I am running Windows 10 enterprise. I don't know what to do. Please tell me how to fix it.</p>
