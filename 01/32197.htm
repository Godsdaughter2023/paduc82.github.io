<h2>            BSOD - Critical driver nvstor.sys is missing or contains errors.</h2>
                    <p>Last night whilst I was sleeping my surface pro decided to update itself. This morning I can no longer startup windows which is a real pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On starting I receive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic Repair "Your PC did not start correctly" Press restart....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to create a USB bootable version using</p>

<p>
</p><p>I click on "Advanced Options" and have gone through each of the troubleshoot options with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a number of links about using advanced options-&gt; start-up repair which I have tried and still no change , running with and without USB . I have tried switching of the driver signature checking along with just about every other option in troubleshooting
 and still nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There was one site that asked me to startup a command and run a number of commands as well as chkdsk but I have lost the link to that one. I have tried a lot of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort I have followed the following</p>

<p>
</p><p>And have placed all my findings below which include the dmp file, an info file, an srt directory with logs that are mentioned on one of the start up screen messages and two photographs of start up screen messages I receive when booting which by the way remain
 for too short a time on screen to really comprehend.</p>

            <p>Thanks Zigzag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had thought I would test the memory on the surface pro 3 whilst waiting for someone to give some ideas. So I ran<strong> extended
</strong>tests using <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29343.running-windows-memory-diagnostics-tool-in-windows-10-technical-preview.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Memory Diagnostics </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This was running for over <strong>36</strong> hours and when I got home it was 95% through with no errors but when I had to go to bed the machine restarted so not sure the last 5% was OK. Unfortunately so I understand the results are saved to the event viewer
 and as I can only trouble shoot-&gt; advanced options -&gt; command prompt it is impossible to run mmc.exe as it will not start so cannot see the result, argghhh!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have used verifier as well in this journey but not with the "create custom settings (for code developers)". May I suggest verifier could do with a bit of an update so that multiple drivers can be selected with the ctrl or shift keys depressed as it is very
 tedious clicking singularly on everyone. Followed your blog and see the list of drivers selected using verifier /querysettings but unfortunately after clicking finish and restart "Your PC ran into a problem..." appears and Windows tries to automatically fix
 the problem but obviously cannot so the cycle continues. Not sure if I have mentioned that cannot start safe mode. My only option is a command prompt from which I see all my disk. A tad frustrating. Not sure if in using verifier I also need to turn off automatic
 start after system error or some other option but running out of ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for trying to fix this. Will run your memtest tomorrow as I need to go to bed but thought I would give an update. Also given 95% was OK I think it unlikely or very unlucky the last part of the test actually found an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Late addition:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgot to mention I had tried to read the event logs using <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
My Event Viewer </a></p>
<p>This starts but shows nothing inside the viewer. Not sure if this is because my windows 10 has not fully started up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also decided to try to run memtest before going to bed but even though the install has created a bootable usb the surface pro will not boot from it even though another USB that has Windows 10 on it will boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :(</p>

            <p>Have also tried to follow this very informative walk through</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5558-windbg-basics-debugging-crash-dumps-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crash dump basics</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But unfortunately none of the steps revealed an offending driver although as I said originally nvstor.sys does get a mention when I try to unsuccessfully run in safe mode. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I did want to say ZigZag was that the only minidump that my machine has is from the 23rd of September which is the original one I have linked to in my original request. I thought that each time I ran verifier I would see a new dump?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That 23rd is very close to the anniversary Windows 10 release&nbsp; 10.0.14393 (19th September). As I originally said my machine looked like it had tried to do an automatic update overnight and failed in a BIG way. When I run "ver" at the command prompt I see
 I am running the anniversary version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am going to try to create another memtest USB and hope there was something wrong with original USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Results of memtest:</p>
<p>Have found out after creating two bootable USB keys that neither will boot on my surface pro 3. They are just ignored and the usual 'Automatic Repair' cycle happens. I notice that the latest "Memtest86+ USB Installer" does not give a drop down to select
 Linux or Windows it always installs Linux. Have tried both USB's on an old Windows 7 laptop and they both boot straight away into memtest.</p>
<p>I know that the boot order of the surface pro is USB first as I can boot from an installed Windows 10 USB image with no problem except it wants to reinstall windows or repair and we already know that the repair does not work. &nbsp; :(&nbsp;

            Sorry ZigZag but could you just confirm that verifier will actually complete if windows 10 can only be started as a command prompt? Also should I see a new minidump each time I run verifier in this situation as I cannot see any result from verifier and
 yet it says it is set with the /querysettings flag.<br />

            <p><strong>NOT AN HAPPY ANNIVERSARY</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Having wasted so much time trying to fix this. I decided to visit a Microsoft Tech Session at our Sydney store. The tech guy tried a number of things to fix the issue around trying to rebuild BCD with no effect. I cannot blame him as he really did try a
 number of avenues but came to the conclusion a re-image was necessary.&nbsp; My biggest&nbsp; problem with this whole thing is that due to no fault of my own my system is stuffed by a Windows update. I know this as the crash time matches the touch time for the Windows
 directory on my machine. Why oh why was there no rollback put into this release as I do not believe I am or will be the only person inconvenienced greatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add insult to injury I have re-imaged the machine only to find that after reformatting the disk and a fresh install I now am not able to set a PIN for the machine and must constantly use my Microsoft Account password. Having searched around I find that
 many people have this same issue. More wasted time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE MICROSOFT CHANGE YOUR POLICIES SO THAT YOU ALLOW THE USER TO CHOOSE WHEN AN UPDATE IS APPLIED AND MY MACHINE IS NOT CONSTANTLY RESTARTING AND UPON RESTART I NEED TO RECOVER OPEN FILES FOR VARIOUS APPS. I realise that updates are important to stop
 a rogue app from crashing the system and making Windows unusable.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Last thing in case anyone else unfortunately finds themselves here. I thought before re-imaging I would back up everything so I thought just simply use XCopy. For some unknown reason XCopy runs out of memory when you try to copy a large file structure so
 I had to then decide what I wanted to back up. I selected the files XCopied these and reformatted only to realise this morning that I had forgotten everything in %appdata%. ARGGHHH!!!!

            &nbsp;After spending a couple of hours on windows sites, then another hour and a half with my service provider which found the problem my e-mail works correctly again. the problem is in microsoft edge which would not allow me to type a message. too bad that
 when microsoft fixes one thing they cause ten other problems. it seems that their software developers are doing their Research and Development at the expense of their customers&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Media Player and My volume control keeps popping up out of no where&#33;</h2>
                    WMP and the volume control will not go away! I have a HP Touchsmart tx2-1277nr and Windows Vista.&nbsp; I just reformated my computer when all else failed and now after I connected back to the internet connection it started doing it again.&nbsp; Everytime I close
 it WMP, it starts back up again, everytime I leave it on and i click on another program, it selects it self, and it will not quit!
<br />
<br />
There are moments where it will stop for a little but then start quickly again, and the weird part about it all it seems to be controlling my laptop sound controls.&nbsp; It keeps increasing the sound untill it is maxed.
<br />
<br />
Please help this is very annoying and its intefering with my work!<br />
<br />
Thanks

            I had the same problem with the volume increasing and decreasing constantly. I went to Control panel, clicked on Hardware and Sound, clicked on mangae audio devices and rechecked my headphones, set as default, applied and problem stopped. Then it started
 again. HP support had me do something which I don't remember which again temporarily stopped it only to start again. I have Logitech headphones which has a round button with a clip on it and it has a blue light. When flashing, I can change the volume. When
 not flashing it doesn't. I discovered I was accidently leaning on the button and also I was changing my volume up and down. Otherwise my volume behaves itself. Now I check my headset control first.:)
<br />
<br />
Whatever HP support had me do may have also helped? I am not computer illiterate totally, but don't know what WMP is. But it was me unknowingly changing the volume.

<h2>            Movie Maker not saving project correctly - getting black video screen and only audio</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 ultimate on my laptop.&nbsp; I'm using Window Movie maker as I have in the past for an end of the year DVD for my Kindergarten class gift.&nbsp; My project file works great, but it is not saving into the movie maker file.&nbsp; When saving in either
 file format, I only have audio.&nbsp; The video screen is black.&nbsp; All pictures and video are accepted file formats.&nbsp; What is wrong?&nbsp; The program is updated, my drivers are updated.&nbsp; I don't know what else to do!&nbsp; I've been&nbsp; on this for a week and I'm going to give
 up and not use this program anymore!&nbsp; I would love a magic answer from anyone out there.&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I'm sorry to hear that you're getting a black preview screen in Movie Maker. Let me assist you with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate this issue first, please answer the following questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the file types that you used in your movie?</li><li>When you said that you saved the file in either file format, do you mean saving this as both MPEG-4 and WMV file?</li><li>If you play the movie using a different player such as Windows Media Player, do you also get a black screen?</li><li>What is the version of your Movie Maker?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, kindly e<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">nsure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio file since audio and video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.</span></p>

            <p>As far as I know Firmware updates for Canon Cameras are applied from the CF card, not through Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to use Windows to transfer the Firmware update to the CF card.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
<strong>Copy the firmware update file to the CF card.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Insert a CF card that has been formatted in the Camera into the CF card reader.</li><li>Copy the firmware update file to the first window that appears when the CF card is opened (the root directory).</li><li>Remove the CF card from the card reader.<br />
<br />
*When removing the CF card, be sure to do so as described in the documentation for the computer or the card reader. *If the firmware update file is placed in subfolder of the CF card, the camera will not see it.</li><li>Rotate the Mode Dial to select &lt;P&gt; mode (or any mode other than Fully-Automatic Modes).</li><li>Insert the CF card with the firmware into the camera.</li><li>Turn the Power Switch &lt;ON&gt;, and then press the &lt;MENU&gt; button to display the menu.</li><li>Rotate the Main Dial and the Quick Control Dial to select the "Firmware Ver.x.x.x" item at the bottom of the "Set-up 3 (Yellow)", and then press the &lt;SET&gt; button.</li><li>The firmware update screen will appear.<br />
<br />
*If the firmware update screen does not appear on LCD monitor, the firmware update file may not have been properly copied to the CF card, so please try again starting from step (1).</li></ol>
<p>
<strong>Update the firmware.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The firmware update screen will appear on the camera's LCD monitor.</li><li>If you press the &lt;SET&gt; button, a confirmation screen will appear, so check the firmware update shown, rotate the Quick Control Dial to select [OK], and press the &lt;SET&gt; button again to start the firmware
 update.</li><li>A message that the firmware is updating will appear during the update.</li><li>When the update is completed, the message will appear on the camera's LCD monitor.</li><li>Complete the firmware update by pressing the &lt;SET&gt; button.<br />
<br />
The firmware update is now completed.<br />
<br />
When the firmware update operations are finished, turn the camera &lt;OFF&gt; and remove battery from the camera for at least two seconds. This will cause the new firmware to take effect after the battery has been reloaded and the camera is turned on.<br />
<br />
Format the CF card before using it again.</li></ol>
<p>
<strong>Verifying the firmware Version</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Turn the Power Switch &lt;ON&gt;, and press the &lt;MENU&gt; button.</li><li>Rotate the Main Dial and the Quick Control Dial, and you will see the "Firmware Ver.X.X.X" at the end of the settings shown in "Set-up 3 (Yellow)".</li><li>This is the currently installed firmware version number.</li></ol>

<p><span>Hello Chrisatola,</span></p>
<p><span>You should check in the settings of the Everio browser to check capacity of the data that you are trying to burn.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How many scenes have you inserted in the video that you are trying to burn?</span></p>
<p><span>Everio Media Browser only allows a maximum of 99 scenes at a time to be burned onto a DVD. Regardless of the total size of the scenes, once they
 are burned onto DVD the total capacity of the DVD is used up with no space left to add more scenes.</span></p>
<p><span>Try to reduce the number of scenes you have added to the video and then try to burn it.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try to burn the video file in Data format with Windows Media player or Windows Explorer. Refer this article to burn DVD with Media
 Player: </span></p>

            When albums are split up in WMP's library, then this usually means that not all the tracks have the same value for the&nbsp;<strong>Album Title</strong> and&nbsp;
<strong>Album Artist</strong> fields. So first make sure that those two fields contain the same for all of the album's tracks. You may need to switch to&nbsp;<strong>Details
</strong>view for this, by clicking the little arrow on the left of the Search field.

    <title>Grouping similar buttons in the taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> comixbrad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grouping similar buttons in the taskbar </h2>
                    My taskbar will only start to group similar buttons after 10 of them are present. I want it to start earlier than that (the example in the Windows Help and Support shows 6 similar buttons grouped together). Is there a way I can change this? I've checked
 the taskbar properties and Windows Help and Support and neither provided any way to change this setting. Does anyone else have this problem? I am running on Windows Vista Home Premium Edition. I would appreciate any help I can get. Thanks.

<h2>            How can fix music to have it play as long as the pictures in Windows Movie Maker&#63;</h2>
                    I "added music" to pictures I assembled in&nbsp; Windows Movie Maker and even though I selected the "Fit To Music" option in the "Project Tab", the music (green bar) doesn't carry throughout the entire movie of about 70 pictures?&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I try to remove the
 music and re-add it again ?&nbsp; If that is the correct action , I can't figure out how to remove the music and re-add it.&nbsp; For clarification I did not import videos, I am only working with pictures and music.&nbsp; I greatly appreciate anyone's advice on this! Thank
 you!<br />

            <p>How long is the song?&nbsp; The 'Fit to music' option will adjust the duration of all your pictures&nbsp;(longer or shorter)&nbsp;to match the length of the song.&nbsp; My guess would be that the combination of 70 photos and transitions can't be reduced enough to fit the length
 of your song.</p>

            Hello and thanks for your response. Unfortunately it didn't help.<br />
I already have Photo Gallery installed on my computer. That's <br />
not the problem. The problem is that when I get to the pop up window,<br />
it is blank. There is NO device there so I can't get any further. When I <br />
press the "Refresh" button, nothing happens. That's why I asked you <br />
which device I need to download in order to import my photos.<br />
I have no device---or it isn't showing in the pop up window.<br />
Please help.Myra.<br />

<h3> kevin cook  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to repair wsock32.dll when an oridinal is missing&#63;</h2>
                    My Windows XP SP3 system recently contracted one of those nasty pieces of malware that hijacks your entire pc .. browsers etc and says you have to purchase their software to remove the virus
<br />
<br />
Luckly I had both Spybot resident .. and McAfee Endpoint Protection enabled .. so it didnt go far ...
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately .. it did seem to do some damage to my wsock32.dll ... and here is where I am seeking help
<br />
<br />
Now when I attempt to scan a file .. or the entire system for virus' I receive the following error:
<br />
<br />
SCAN32.EXE - Ordinal not found .... The ordinal 1112 could not be located in the dynamic link library WSOCK32.dll
<br />
<br />
I have attempted to repair this using several methods including uninstalling and reinstalling McAfee EPP
<br />
<br />
Most recent attempt <br />
<br />
1) Removed all McAfee software via Add Remove Programs (plus some internal tricks)
<br />
<br />
2) Attempted to remove \Program Files\McAfee in explorer.exe <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several files in this directory could not be deleted as they were in use
<br />
<br />
3) Booted safeboot with command prompt <br />
<br />
4) Installed a new wsock32.dll from a previous backup <br />
<br />
5) deleted all files under \Program Files\McAfee<br />
<br />
6) Rebooted<br />
<br />
7) Reinstalled McAfee Endpoint 4.5.0.1852 <br />
<br />
8) Noted that the McAfee options for <br />
<br />
Scan computer for <br />
Manage Features <br />
Quick settings <br />
<br />
Were missing <br />
<br />
9) Rebooted <br />
<br />
10) Checked options ... still missing <br />
<br />
11) Checked \Program Files\VirusScan Enterprise for presence of scan32.exe .. it was present
<br />
<br />
12) Executed \Program Files\VirusScan Enterprise\scan32.exe and received <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scan32.exe Ordinal not found <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ordinal 1112 could not be located in the dynamic link library WSOCK32.dll
<br />
<br />
13) Ran sfc /scan now with my original install disk which ran to completion<br />
<br />
14) Noted that the options <br />
<br />
Scan computer for <br />
Manage Features <br />
Quick settings <br />
<br />
Had returned .. but hwn Scan computer for ... is run ... received <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scan32.exe Ordinal not found <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ordinal 1112 could not be located in the dynamic link library WSOCK32.dll
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? <br />
<br /><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner on your computer and check if it helps:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install the latest Microsoft Security Essential antivirus program on the computer and check if it helps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important Note</b>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run check disk and then try running SFC scan and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Anti-aliasing and frame rate drops.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Basically I've been playing GTA 5 Xbox One version online recently and I've been noticing a few framerate drops whilst I've been playing which I never noticed on the Xbox 360 edition. Is this because there are more people in each
 game now and it's just going to be like that? I've noticed also that there jaggies and a few anti aliasing issues which are really annoying me. Could that be an issue with my TV? It's not the best TV on the market, kinda just one to do the job. Any tips or
 things I could to possibly improve the performance of the game would be appreciated! Also, it's downloaded, I don't have a disk for it.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I run my Xbox One on a 720p TV (so bare that in mind in my comments), I also have a Playstation (Vita) TV connected to the same TV.</p>
<p>I've been doing some side by size comparisons with GTA V on Xbox One and with PS4 remote play. &nbsp;Both running 720p. &nbsp;Xbox One is wired to router (75mb fibre) and PS4 is wireless (with Playstation TV wired). &nbsp;Yes a crazy set up just now, but its what I've
 got to play with.</p>
<p>I too have noticed in GTA Online that Xbox One has frame drop issues (especially in busy session, 30 players), and its most noticeable when driving fast in a built up area. &nbsp;I haven't seen this at all on PS4.</p>
<p>Also I've noticed some cracking glitches, like Palm trees where the texture is missing on part of the tree and its just a patch of black and white spots (like an underlying wireframe). &nbsp;Never noticed this on PS4 remote either. &nbsp;Final thing I've noticed is
 is strange lighting glitches at night i.e. when driving from Los Santos Customs over the stone bridge towards the Templar Hotel, on PS4 I can see it lit up as I crest the bridge, but on Xbox One the lights tend to "POP" on when your quite close to the building.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I tend to mainly play in a crew session on XBox One, and its faultless. &nbsp;Ok a bit less shrubbery, and I tend to find Its semi permanently night time, but as my crew is on Xbox One thats where I play online most. &nbsp;I'm doing Story on PS4 with an
 occasional burst of online.</p>
<p>Good game on either Console, specially during a rain storm.</p>

<p>Well that is true, I have consistant Broadband connection and I find it ironic that I have less glitches on the console thats connected on the poorer of the connection types.</p>
<p>I did ask fellow crew members if they'd see the frame drop stuttering in busy sessions and they said they had. &nbsp;They range for standard Bt broadband of about 10mb to Virgin 150mb broadband. &nbsp;So its not a Broadband connection issue in that respect. &nbsp;It seems
 like either an Xbox One issue / game issue / or server issue.</p>

<p>I run my Xbox One at 1080p and use a wired connection. I have a constant 64mbps fibre connection and I too have experienced this. It's definitely an Xbox/GTA server/service issue.</p>

<p>Thank god I'm not the only person whos having this issue, I thought it was only me. I seem to notice it more when driving fast, the game stops and then starts like it's trying to catch up with its self. It's really annoying.
</p>
<p>I've also had problems with the buildings not loading so here i am driving down the street and all of a sudden a building pops up in front of me.

</p><p>I have HP LaserJet M1005 MFP with me 3 years back. Ever since I have upgraded to windows 10 it has not been functioning properly. It prints only from Windows LIVE MAIL. There is no fix conditons to it. more often I find job stuck in que, not getting deleted
 nor printed. I have updated my drivers and uninstall and re-install couple of times. Now it is not getting removed also. even after multiple re-boot, status of the printer is
<strong>removing device</strong>...thus not letting anything happened...there is no printermanagement.msc to execute anything....there is no possible way (I could search on net to resolve this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, as I am a entreprenuer and I can't print any of my bills. My business is upset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted or outdated network driver is one of the possible reasons why you're unable to connect to the Internet. For us to isolate the issue, kindly provide the answers to the following questions: &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you able to connect to other networks available?</li><li>Have you tried connecting other devices to your WiFi connection to see if it makes any difference?</li><li>Can you send us the screenshot of the test that you've performed in Command Prompt?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that the network adapter shows disconnected, we suggest running the
<span><strong>Network Adapter troubleshooter</strong>. </span>The troubleshooter will perform a diagnostic process on your system that will check and resolve issues related to your network connection. If the troubleshooter finds any issues, it will be listed
 in the result with additional instructions you may need to follow. However, in most cases, the troubleshooter will find and apply fixes automatically. To do so, refer to these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong>Search </strong>bar, type <strong>troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>From the results, select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>View all</strong>, then select <strong>Network Adapter.</strong></li><li>Wait for the scan to be completed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also update your network driver. Here's how: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15046/windows-8-download-install-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Download and install drivers in Windows 8.1</strong>.
</a>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try checking for one on your device manufacturer's website.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we also recommend performing the additional steps provided in this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15287/windows-why-can-not-get-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why can’t I get connected?.</a></strong> The article contains series of troubleshooting steps that you
 can perform for any network related issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. <br />
