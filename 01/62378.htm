<h2>            Cannot make Windows 8.1 desktop search .PHP file  contents.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The File Explorer search finds files ok and meta data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need it search the contents of .PHP files. I have found PHP in the File Types list of the Control Panel's Index options. I have changed the PHP listing<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>from "File properties Filter" to "Plain Text Filter" and then, to test the result,<span>&nbsp;
</span>searched<span>&nbsp; </span>a single folder containing 2 .php files for a word which I knew existed. If found no results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then used the Control Panel Index options to re-build the index which it warned could take hours. Before starting it reported 63,828<span>&nbsp;
</span>Items indexed. I pressed the Rebuild button and it either did nothing at all or it managed to rebuild the index in less than half a second. Either way, it failed to have the desired result of letting me search the contents of my php files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have put the folder<span>&nbsp;
</span>and subfolders holding my php files , which is itself<span>&nbsp; </span>a sub folder of C:/xampp/htdocs, into my Library.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have also specifically added the same folder<span>&nbsp; </span>into<span>&nbsp; </span>
the Index options Search in<span>&nbsp; </span>as a folder/s<span>&nbsp; </span>in its own right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seem be hundreds of frustrated references to the failure of Window search to work and to go through every suggestion made is a daunting task with no obvious outcome of success
 that I have found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am putting up this question just in case that, by now, someone has found that Eureka moment and would like to share it!<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I agree.&nbsp; But I think that's what you need to do:&nbsp; create (or find or hack) an iFilter for .php.&nbsp; If you're lucky maybe it would be enough to say it looks like HTML.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd940431%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd940431%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>(BING search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintext ifilter unicode<br />
)</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g. would this constraint be satisfied by the more generic one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;quote&gt;<br />
&nbsp;It does check for the Unicode byte-order mark at the beginning of the file.<br />
&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then what happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see if some&nbsp;other existing iFilter would be a better choice&nbsp;what happens if you rename (or copy) all your .php files that you wanted to search so that there is a more specific iFilter associated with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW currently in a somewhat related thread we are trying to understand the diagnostics that Windows Search may provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/bb6cc2d5-1386-4d55-878a-355532cf49b4/windows-search-in-file-explorer-brings-results-if-i-stop-windows-search-service?forum=w8itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/bb6cc2d5-1386-4d55-878a-355532cf49b4/windows-search-in-file-explorer-brings-results-if-i-stop-windows-search-service?forum=w8itprogeneral</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you may get some ideas there too, especially my idea of trying to see what a modified saved search might do for us.&nbsp; They seem overspecified to me.&nbsp; So, if they could be customized that might be an alternative to dealing with iFilters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The <strong>Ctrl + Alt + mouse scroll wheel</strong> keyboard shortcut only works for zooming in and out the desktop icons, files and folders in your File Explorer and the like. If you wanted to zoom in and out pages on a browser or most of the icons on your
 computer too, you may do it by using the <strong>Ctrl + mouse scroll wheel</strong> only.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for an update and let us know if you need more help.

            I think that is incorrect. Ctrl + mouse scroll wheel enlarges icons with or without Magnifier being turn on or off.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
This documentation </a>is specific to Magnifier and says "Ctrl+Alt+mouse scroll wheel" to zoom in and out. If by "Zoom in and out" the documentation means simply to enlarge icons, it should explicitly say that.&nbsp;

            Hi Anthony,<br />
<br />
<br />
It is possible that different Windows build and version makes the options and commands different as well.<br />
<br />
Are you still experiencing the zooming in and out issue? If yes, have you checked if the two different devices are in the same build and version of Windows 10?<br />
<br />
Do you have administrator rights on both of your PCs?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Hi MoutonLecoq,<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ctrl + Alt + mouse scroll wheel function should work on every Windows 10 version and build.<br />
<br />
However, it is possible that the said function is being limited by the company. That being said, you may ask for an advice from your company IT group.<br />
<br />
Let us know any update.

<h2>            fable 3 III purchase product key</h2>
                    I bought fable III used on e-bay, I installed it, but it won't take the product key, it says it is already registered. I didn't know when I bought a used copy it can only be registered once. How do I purchase a new key? I don't want to buy the game again
 since I already have it, just the key, can you buy it from microsoft? I can't be the only one who got a used copy, I'm sure other people have bought one also.<br />
Any help would be great,<br />

<p>Hi Casacoco,</p>
<p>1) Is the mobile device detected under Devices and Printers?</p>
<p>2) Do you get any error message or error code when you connect the device to the computer?</p>
<p>If Windows can't detect a wireless device that you want to add to your computer, here are some tips that can help.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Make sure the device you're trying to pair with (connect to) isn't turned off, low on battery power, or in sleep mode.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Make sure you haven't already added the device to your computer. Devices that have already been added aren't displayed in the list of devices you can connect to in the Add a device wizard.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Make sure the device is within wireless range of your computer, typically within six to nine feet for most Bluetooth devices, or within 100 feet for a Wi‑Fi device. If you aren't sure if the device is in range, try moving it closer to your computer. If
 there's a wall between the device and the computer, try putting the device and computer in the same room.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Make sure there are no other devices interfering with the wireless device, such as microwave ovens, cordless phones, or other wireless devices.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; If your computer uses an external Bluetooth or Wi‑Fi adapter, make sure the adapter is working correctly and is attached and installed properly.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; If Bluetooth capability is integrated into your computer, make sure the Bluetooth radio transmitter is turned on. This might also turn your wireless network receiver on and off. Many laptops have an external switch for turning the transmitter on and off.
 If you aren't sure how to turn it on, check the information that came with your computer or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Make sure the device is discoverable. When a Bluetooth device is set to be discoverable, it sends out radio signals to advertise its location to other devices and computers. If you aren’t sure how to set your device to be discoverable, check the information
 that came with your device or go to the manufacturer’s website. A device (such as a wireless mouse or a keyboard) might have a button on it that you need to push, while others (such as a Bluetooth mobile phone) might have a setting in their software menu that
 you need to select to make them discoverable.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; If you're trying to add a wireless network device, it must be configured for your wireless network before you can add it to your computer. If you aren't sure how to do this, check the information that came with the device or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>

            Are you able to better describe your impossible problem and provide more information about the patient?<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
Does your system boot or does it not boot?<br />
<br />
Are you able to access the Internet?<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If you are thinking of reinstalling XP, I would approach it with the expectation that everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong.&nbsp; With expectations properly managed, there will be less heartbreak if things do not work out.<br />
<br />
If you reinstall XP, you will also have to reinstall all your applications software and hopefully you will backup your personal data beforehand.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't even count on a Repair install working.<br />
<br />
We would much rather work on fixing it.&nbsp; Reinstalling, Repairing and Restore Points are not on my list of options (except once).<br />

            <p>Sorry about the lame - I actually think it's less harsh than inept!&nbsp; Here's the long story.&nbsp; I have a Dell 3250 from about 2003.&nbsp; I have two hard drives that diagnostics list as healthy.&nbsp; One had XP sp 3 and the other had XP sp 1 (it was more of a backup).&nbsp;
 It might be a little slow for others, but It has to do for me.&nbsp; The one with sp3 was drive d, the other was drive c.&nbsp; It's the d that I'm having the problem with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have an external dvd rw as well as an external hard drive (I have a total of 4 extra USB slots).&nbsp; I was using the dvd rw to burn some video of mine for a law suit when it just stopped working (and it worked fine for a long time).&nbsp;The Microsoft site said
 it was because of a Vista something or a program something or an installation or uninstallation of a DVD burning program which is what I had done.&nbsp; It gave a fix for the VIsta, it gave a fix for the other but nothing for the third&nbsp; I searched for the answer
 and did all the registry stuff and restart , etc. but nothing worked.&nbsp; . So I got to this one (I also did an general internet search and this fix was mentioned often - but I only do things from the Microsoft site):</p>
<p>"<em>Use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager. If you are not comfortable with advanced
 troubleshooting, try the steps in the "<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/817900#workaround" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Workaround</a></span>" section.<br />
<br />
To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps: </em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run</strong>. <br />
<b>Note</b> If you are running Windows Vista, click <strong>Start</strong>, and then use the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box. </em></li><li><em>Type <span>devmgmt.msc</span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. Device Manager opens. </em></li><li><em>Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.
<br />
<b>Note</b> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item. </em></li><li><em>Right-click the first USB controller under <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove it. </em></li><li><em>Repeat step 4 for each USB controller that is listed under <strong>
Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>. </em></li><li><em>Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.
</em></li><li><em>Check the USB device to see whether it is working."</em></li></ol>
<p>Here's the lame part - the controllers did not reload when I restarted!&nbsp; I had a bunch of "?" or other yellow thingies in that folder on the device manager. I tried to load drivers from my Dell driver disk but no go.&nbsp; I had keyboard but no mouse - got really
 good at keyboard mouse!&nbsp; I was planning to format this drive (it was my working drive but smaller than the c drive) and use the c as the working drive and the d as a storage drive (along with the external).</p>
<p>I did format the C drive and installed days of updates etc. (as I said it was a Dell XP sp 1 disk).&nbsp; I've installed my virus software (running Mcafee on both drives as well as IOLO System Mechanic).&nbsp; C is working fine and the job of reformatting and reloading
 is going decently.</p>
<p>After I installed the second hard drive,&nbsp;it automatically gave me the option of booting into either c or d - d was the system drive and it was always first.&nbsp; I guess that's a dual boot (?).&nbsp; Now it will only boot into c (even though d has xp sp 3 also) and
 I can't get it to boot into d at all - I get the infamous "NTDLR is missing).&nbsp; That's where the system cd recovery came in but I was too afraid and seemingly too dense to use it!&nbsp; Some of the microsoft fixes are over my head - but it's probably the stress
 and lack of sleep that's making me a bit stupid cuz I'm really quite smart!</p>
<p>I can access the internet on C; internal CD R and DVD ROMs have been working but I haven't tried but they are on lists of hardware.&nbsp; It's only the external I had a problem with.&nbsp; I have the orignal Dell operating system cd (which installed on the formatted
 C drive beautifully) and had used it to access recovery console.&nbsp; There was no power problem.</p>
<p>Possibly the problem occurred as I was installing updates on the newly installed XP on C drive.&nbsp; It does appear that I can't have two XP sp3 and have a dual boot - but I did with an XP sp3 and an XP sp1.</p>
<p>I think this is all the info you asked for.&nbsp; All I want is to get back into D to get the POP and STMP info off Outlook Express to put into the same program in C.&nbsp; I can get most of the info I need off&nbsp;Windows Explorer and have all my disks for installation
 of printer, scanner, etc.&nbsp; I know this sounds a bit "petty" but I have ATT internet and they have screwed up my computer on more than one occasion and I do not want to have to call them for the info. I have already put all my personal stuff, etc. onto my external
 hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at my wits end because I have lots of stuff to do and once I plug in printer and scanner etc. my D will never open because the USB stuff is all screwed up!&nbsp; Because Microsoft said to do it and it was LAME!!!&nbsp; hehehe (ok, off the lol).&nbsp; Gosh golly gee
 whiz, this is one long explanation!&nbsp; But since Outlook Express is installed with the system installation, might I still be able to get the original info off the one that's there now?&nbsp; I know for a fact that the POP etc. stuff is NOT what ATT told me to do!&nbsp;
 What they told me didn't work and I had fun trying to find a way to get my email without using a server.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the help!</p>

<h2>            Unable to map a network drive on Windows 10 System</h2>
                    <p>I know there are many threads on this subject - I have been going through them one at a time trying to resolve the issue. No luck so far. Here are the specifics:</p>
<p>
</p><p>New Lenovo X1 laptop w/ Windows 10 Ent. edition, version 1703. Laptop and OS provided by employer. Running Symantec Endpoint Protection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to map to a Seagate Black Armor NAS Device. I can see the device in my Windows explorer.&nbsp; I can open the NAS device dashboard via double click on the icon in the windows explorer and log in via a web browser.&nbsp; I am able to access the NAS device
 via FTP from the Laptop. However,&nbsp; I can not map a drive - I get "The specified network name is no longer available".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the NAS device on another Windows 10 Lenovo device - I went through network and firewall settings that are generally available on both systems and ensured they are the same - I found no differences in basic settings
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used both the device name and the device IP address - Same error</p>
<p>I have tried to use the option "Connect using different credentials" (via device admin) same error</p>
<p>I have tried to use the option "Connect using different credentials" (via a trusted user configured on the device) - same error</p>
<p>I have enabled SMB protocal on the laptop - same error</p>
<p>I have disabled virus protection - same error</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Fall Creator Update Start Menu Missing Tiles and Action Center Missing Items</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have updated my desktop pc yesterday from Windows 10 Home x64 v1607 Build 14393 to v1709 Build 16229.19. The Fall Creator update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Specs</p>
<p>
</p><p>IBUY Power model # BB901 I series 506 Built August 2014</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Genuine Intel i5-6400 2.7Ghz 6th Gen Processor</p>

<p>
</p><p>Optical drive: LG 24x DVD \RW</p>
<p>WiFi USB Adapter: Edimax AC600</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prepped desktop PC for this update. Had some minor problems with start menu, action center, Cortana, and system tray that were not working. Managed to get them working before the update with the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. DISM.exe /online/ cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup. Ran DISM /online /cleanup-image again with /restorehealth&nbsp; switch.</p>
<p>2.SFC /scannow</p>
<p>3. Chkdsk c: /f</p>
<p>4. Powershell as administrator&nbsp;<span>Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></p>
<p>5. Updated all apps and software.</p>
<p>6. Checked and updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No third part antivirus or firewall installed at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk and sfc no problems found. DISM completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated with upgrade assistant. No go. Gave error message. Do no remember what it was . Did not write it down. Possibly because I did not disconnect secondary HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powered down and disconnected secondary HDD. Attempted upgrade. This time went well. No error messages. Logged in and find normal OOBE process. Wait until the desktop is released to user. All appears fine until I check the Start menu. Some Built in App Tiles
 are missing. System tray works. Cortona works. Task bar works. Action center missing lower right item. Sub menu works. Win + x works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How Do I fix, reset, or repair the start menu and action center missing tiles or item?</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is a possible that the recent changes made after installing the update could be causing this issue. To properly troubleshoot the issue, you can try rolling back from the recent update.
<br />
<br />
You can refer to the article below for instructions:<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-recover-restore-your-previous-version-of/94368560-9c64-4387-92b9-82a9234216ad">How to recover / restore your previous version of Windows
 using the Rollback feature in the Anniversary Edition and the Spring / Fall Creators Update
</a></strong><br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for the results.

            I had the exact same problem you are experiencing. I made sure I installed all my drivers, including my creative x7 soundcard. Once that device was installed, everything worked just fine.

<p>Hello Romel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post that you replied to is my brother's PC. We have the same Desktop PC. The only differences are is I have Windows 10 Pro x64 with version 1709 Build 16299.19 rs4 for Insider's Preview Release Ring. Primary system drive
</p>
<p>is 3Tb and secondary is 1tb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been the one maintaining both PC's. And on my brother's PC I have done an in place upgrade in an attempt to repair the OS.&nbsp; I even created a new user account with activating the built in administrator account to copy the tile data layer database over.
 This did not work. I found a temp folder in c:\users that has the previous tile data layer database. I am thinking of logging into the built in administrator account and copying this over to C:\Users\%username%\Local\AappData\ original location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done the rollback yet. And I can pin the missing tiles back to the start menu from a screenshot I made earlier. So, that is not a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your information I am a PC technician with A+ Certification albeit I am outdated now as the last Windows OS I have extensively worked with was Windows Xp and Windows 2000. This version has a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note why is there a missing button in the Action Center in the lower right corner? What is missing? Or is it a missing button?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reply to my brother or myself.</p>

<p>I only received the Fall Creators update today on the 18th November, and straight away it seems there are still issues with the Start Menu and system stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem where my Start Menu didn't work at all. Click on the Start Menu icon and nothing, nada.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I resolved it by reinstalling my NVidia video driver to the most recent version.&nbsp; I had to select the 'clean install' option during the driver install to clear out any old video driver settings for it to work. note: I first tried an update to the latest
 driver, without a clean install, but that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was on an Acer laptop with integrated Intel video on an i7 6700HQ CPU and an additional NVidia 960M GPU. Additional specs, 16GB Ram, and Windows is installed on an SSD. I only had to update the NVidia GPU video driver to get my Start Menu working again.
 I've had to do no other updates and my laptop seems to be functioning normally now. Although I do notice on the odd occasion that the Start Menu is not as smooth as before though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating the NVidia driver also fixed some other third party software issues I had too.</p>

<p>I had the same issue.&nbsp; I first updated from 1607 to 1709 and had the issue.&nbsp; I then performed a clean install, which I had planned on doing anyway, and the issue was not there.&nbsp; This was on my desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop also had the same issue, though I did not plan on performing a clean install on that.&nbsp; Because of the issue, I had to.&nbsp; On the first clean install, the problem was there again, but I tried again and it then worked the way it should have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the desktop, I thought I had solved the tile issue by uninstalling whatever was supposedly downloading (this is what it would say on the tile), but when I restarted the computer the tiles were there again, though they showed nothing, save for the message
 that "an exciting app is being downloaded" or something like that.&nbsp; It was REALLY annoying.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed the clean installs using a DVD I had created with the Media Creation Tool, but, of course, right now some people are having problems with that, as well.&nbsp; It figures, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            What type of wireless, Bluetooth? If so, you need to peer it with your Windows 7 PC.
<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Devices and Printers<br />
Click Add Printer on the command bar<br />
you may try the Printer troubleshooter, which will attempt to automatically diagnose and fix your problem.<br />
<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.<br />
<br />
If Windows can't detect a printer that you want to use, follow these steps to find and add the printer manually:<br />
<br />
1. Open Devices and Printers by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , and then, on the Start menu, clicking Devices and Printers.<br />
2. Click Add a printer.<br />
3. In the Add Printer wizard, select Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer.<br />
4. On the Searching for available printers page, click The printer that I want isn't listed.<br />
5. On the Find a printer by name or TCP/IP address page, choose how to find the printer that you want to use, based on the type or location of the printer, and then click Next.<br />
6. Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click Finish.<br />
<br />
To make sure that printers on the network are being displayed, check to see if the network is working correctly. For more information, see View the status of your network.<br />
<br />
I’d also suggest you to refer the link below and follow the steps mentioned in the article to troubleshoot network printer problems:<br />

            Hi,<br />
Sorry for late reply. The issue cased by Firewall. In my case, McAfee Firewall was casing the issue.Disabling the FW feature will solve the issue and I am in touch with Support for resolution.

<h2>            opting out of advertising &#40;and 3rd party cookies&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Friends,</p>
<p>While setting up a new Windows 10 system, I came across the Privacy settings and this page:&nbsp; http://choice.microsoft.com/en-us/opt-out</p>
<p>
</p><p>There, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To opt out of personalized ads in this browser, your browser history must allow first-party and third-party cookies and you must have your browsing experience set to NOT delete browsing history on exit. Instructions for enabling cookies and configuring
 your browsing history may be available in your browsers settings, privacy, or help documentation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems incredibly counterintuitive to opt out of advertising, that a user must allow 3rd party cookies.&nbsp; For goodness sakes, aren't 3rd party cookies one potential source of advertising??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to try and understand this.&nbsp; I wonder if someone could explain it for me.&nbsp; I want neither 3rd party cookies or advertising.&nbsp; Isn't there some way to accomplish that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much&nbsp; :-)</p>

<h3> patrickbrandonmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft fix low mic volume in Windows 7 Yet&#63;</h2>
                    I am thinking about buying Windows 7 and am wondering if Microsoft has fixed the low mic volume issue yet.&nbsp; I still use XP at times for my recording, and my mic works fine on XP.&nbsp; But I have tried out 7 and the mic volume issue seems to be for many people,
 and would prevent me from going to Windows 7.&nbsp; I mainly use Linux, and have had no problems with my mic.&nbsp; Yes I have tried every forum idea there is.&nbsp; This is a Window 7 issue no doubt.&nbsp; But if it isn't fixed yet, I will not purchase it.&nbsp; And I have looked
 all over to be able to send Microsoft a message like this, and cannot find a place to do that.&nbsp; I would think if it is stopping people from buying it, that they would want to know.&nbsp; Or is it that they are just TOO big to care?&nbsp; Any feedback or help on this
 would be deeply appreciated.<br />

            There's a decibel boost option for Microphones in the audio settings that you might want to be sure is selected, if volume itself is coming in as too low. &nbsp;Also, if you are using an actual sound card that isn't on-board, you'll certainly want to make sure
 you've got the latest, up to date drivers that are compatible with Win7 set up. &nbsp;If the sound card is a recent piece of hardware, it should be completely compatible.
