<p>How exactly did you install Windows on the new drive?&nbsp; Tell us every step you took starting with how you attached the new drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you then format the old drive?&nbsp; Again, we need everything you did.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming since you can't boot media that you just ran the installation media from the old drive to install to the new one.&nbsp; This leaves the boot manager on the old drive and creates a Dual Boot Menu.&nbsp; I&nbsp; asked you if you saw such a Dual Boot menu and
 you didn't answer.&nbsp; We need to know this, because if you formatted or unplugged the old drive and there was no boot partition on the new drive then it needs special steps which depend on whether you have

</p><p>To boot the disk or flash media created by <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a>, power up the PC while pressing the ESC key. On some HP's this key is different so check the chart here:
<a href="https://craftedflash.com/info/how-boot-computer-from-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BIOS Boot Menu Key</a> . &nbsp; Choose BIOS/UEFI Boot Menu?&nbsp; Choose the UEFI version of the disk drive or flash drive if offered.&nbsp; At first screen after media loads, press Shift + F10
 to open a Command Prompt, type each command followed by Enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISKPART</p>
<p>LIST DISK</p>
<p>SEL DISK # (substitute the # with each disk shown number)</p>
<p>LIST PARTITION</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now take a picture or carefully write down everything shown in the partition list for each disk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the disk or stick doesn't boot, test that it boots in another PC.&nbsp; If not then create it again using only
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> to know for sure it's bootable for either UEFI or Legacy BIOS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative you can burn the CD for <a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Partition Wizard</a>, boot it (as a UEFI device if offered) and then take a picture of it's full drive map showing all drives so we can read their labels.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The presence of an EFI System partition or MSR Reserved partition means it is a UEFI install.&nbsp; We are looking for this and also whether there is any small System partition at all on the new disk install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then unplug all but the new hard drive and boot the media again to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not receive the Boot Menu then try pressing the F10 button while powering up the PC to Enter BIOS/UEFI Setup, look on all the tabs for Fast Startup or Fast boot to disable it so it will pause long enough to give a Boot menu.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will take patience and trying everything given.&nbsp; If you have questions or problems, keep asking back and we will help you until you get it done.</p>

<p>Apparently, you can get <a href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>Fallout 1</em></a> on GOG for free.&nbsp; I don't how long the deal will last for, but for those of you who haven't played it and are maybe looking to understand some of the references
 in <em>New Vegas</em> a little better, I'd recommend checking it out</p>

<p>Awesome, I wish I could download. Use to play 1 and 2 so much. But now I have a mac, so it won't work. =(</p>
<p>[/quote]There are Mac ports of <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> (the majority of my time spent with them was with the Mac ports, interestingly enough), but they stopped working after OS 10.6 released.&nbsp; However, you can get the PC version of
<em>Fallout 1</em> to run on Macs through Wine or Crossover, just not in fullscreen.&nbsp;
<em>Fallout 2</em> works also, but it's really, really laggy, which eventually led me to just buy a new gaming PC so I could play all my old PC games again (albeit, I had to re-buy a lot of them because I sold my disc versions to help pay for a Mac and the
 Mac ports of <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> way back when, but good investment overall).&nbsp; Still, if you're stuck with only a Mac but want to play
<em>Fallout 1</em> again, I'd recommend giving Crossover a try (it's free for 30 days; Wine is free in general, but it's hard to set up)</p>

<p>[/quote]If you have Windows 7, It should be in your downloads folder under users...I think.&nbsp; I know all of your GOG games end up in C/Program Files/Good Old Games, so see if you have a file extension like that.&nbsp; But an easier way to find it would be to search
 for "setup_fallout.exe" in My Computer (or just use the run command and run that), or just re-download it from your GOG library and select "open file" instead of "save file" (that's what I normally do). That way, you'll go right into the installer without
 having to find it<br />
<br />
Also, if you have Windows 7, I would recommend installing the <em>Fallout 1</em> High Resolution Patch before you play it.&nbsp; I forget the link, but I think you can find it on the GOG forums (or just Google it)</p>

<p>Não amigão, não precisa apagar sua conta, isso é um problema da livre, apos ela ser hackeada ano passado, bom, faz o seguinte, exclui cache do seu Xbox, e coloca download pra baixar dnv, se der ***, apaga o jogo do disp que vc esta baixando, e coloca pra
 baixar de novo, e desliga o Xbox e baixa enquanto esta desligado (baixa em segundo plano) apos ele terminar o download vc liga e confere se foi pra aba de jogos, caso não tenha ido, repita o processo.</p>
<p>Eu consegui baixar tombraider e bioshock agora nesse mês, pra tu ver como a livre tava ruim.

<p>A dica do amarelo funciona mesmo, mas também você pode anotar estes procedimentos:</p>
<p>1- Exclua o arquivo corrompido de seu sistema em Aramzenamento&gt;Aplicativos e Jogos.</p>
<p>2 - Faça a manutenção/limpeza de seu cache.</p>
<p>3 - Ao baixar os jogos, você tem a opção de baixar em segundo plano com o aparelho desligado ou baixar com ele ligado, porém, com ele ligado você deve deixar a tela de downloads visível e não poderá navegar livremente pelas abas ou qualquer outro conteúdo
 do console que requer conexão de internet para visualizar os itens, caso faça isso, o download sofrerá novamente o erro.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update Home Version 1511, 10586</h2>
                    <p>When trying to download and install windows 10 Home version 1511, 10586 this is what happened. There were two downloads a short one and then a long one. As soon as the long download was completed at 100%, the install was never started. Windows update said
 there were errors trying to install. Please retry. When I retried window update said my computer was up to date, but when I check system information I still have the old version10.0.10240 Build 10240. The same thing happened on two of my computers. What's
 wrong and what do I do to correct the problem.</p>

<h2>            1903 will not install</h2>
                    I'm under the impression that 1903 can now be installed. So, as I poked at the issue, I saw that windows10.0-kb4504369-x64...msu should first be installed. It was downloaded and successfully installed. I then downloaded and attempted to install windows10.0-kb4505057-x64...msu.
 And got an error message to the effect that it was not appropriate for my system. Huh?

            Hi TT.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Ttrout,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />kb4504369 is not a prerequisite for Windows 10 1903.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest feature update 1903, should resolve this.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

<h3> opalchip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hosts file being ignored</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I have 3 Windows 10 machines, and the hosts file is being ignored by ALL browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox) on ALL 3 machines.&nbsp; Yes, I know how to edit the hosts file, been doing it for 20 years. But just actually checked a few websites, and the 127.0.0.1
 entries are ignored (or not read at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old days, there was a Registry Key pointing to the hosts file, at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DataBasePath.&nbsp; The whole thing is still there EXCEPT for DataBasePath.&nbsp; What is going on???</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, it now seems impossible to run Notepad as administrator, add entries, then save as "all files". Windows simply won't accept the "all files" choice and saves as .txt&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any body have an idea about this? This is extremely problematic!</p>

</p><p>I was to replicate the issue regarding with the 127.0.0.1 entries being ignored. Please report the issue by providing a feedback using our Feedback Hub app. This way you can directly communicate with the developer team with issues that you encounter as well
 as suggestions on how to improve Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regard to "<span>impossible to run Notepad as administrator, add entries, then save as "all files",&nbsp;</span>hosts file is considered a part of the system files and files under system folders cannot be directly edited or
 overwritten. a workaround is to open via Notepad, edit it, then save it to a non-system folder (e.g. Documents folder). After saving it as a document, access the saved copy of hosts file from Explorer, set File explorer &gt; View &gt; check "File name extensions"
 &gt; delete the ".txt" extension from the saved copy of hosts file. Afterwards, copy and paste it to Windows\System32\drivers\etc folder and overwrite the existing hosts file. You may also create a separate feedback item if you wish to directly change the file
 from NotePad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<p>Wow - this one of the most useful, on-target answers I've ever gotten from a Microsoft agent! Thanks very much - I'll try the above re: saving Notepad as all files (since it's possible doing that correctly could be the solution to the Hosts issue itself).
 If not, then I'll report the Hosts issue through the Feedback Hub.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi - I used your method of saving the Notepad as "all files" in drivers, and that indeed worked, however the properly saved Hosts file is still being ignored, No problem opening any URL that is listed in there. And this is on 3 different machines. It's not
 a bug on a unique device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if someone could check if they have they also have this COMPLETE registry key, or is DataBasePath entry missing like on mine. My machines all look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they should AFAIK look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DataBasePath</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see how the Hosts file can function without the OS knowing where it is, and the question is - why is that missing now?</p>

            <p>Your 1st solution is not easy to carry out! I do not want to lose my existing messages or have the complex hassle of trying to get the same account back again. Fail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your 2nd solution in Windows 7 is incorrect. You can only delete ALL Live Essential! You ought to make it plain WHICH version of windows you are referring to in giving advice on how to resolve problems like this. I have therefore been through all the bother
 of deleting Live essentials and re-installing and it has not resolved the problem that has suddenly occurred of just two Sent emails that i cannot now open or delete!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anybody on here who has a simpler answer/solution than this drawn out procedures and complex answers the MS keeps putting out?</p>

<h2>            4K Blu-Ray movies are juddering, freezing periodically</h2>
                    
<div>
<blockquote>I wanted to know if anyone with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Console-Standard-Edition/dp/B00CMQTVUA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385654618&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=xbox+one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One</a>&nbsp;S
 has been experiencing hang ups or freeze framing with 4K Blu Rays, particularly in HDR mode? I haven't seen much mentioned about this, so I figured I'd check if it was just my&nbsp;<span>Xbox One</span>&nbsp;S and I'd need to exchange it.<br />
<br />
I have a 65"&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=samsung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Samsung</a>&nbsp;KS8000 and I purchased the 1TB&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Console-Standard-Edition/dp/B00CMQTVUA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385654618&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=xbox+one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One</a>&nbsp;S (Madden bundle) to replace my original X1 to play 4K HDR Blu Rays on it. I purchased Star Trek (2009) and Independence Day 20th anniversary so far, both with HDR capabilities. Both have had issues with periodic freezing
 and lagging, and it doesn't matter what scene it's in. The freezing and lag is mostly quick, but sometimes there are major freeze ups that last a second or so. It's like the movie is experiencing lag.<br />
<br />
The only thing that seems to help is putting the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Console-Standard-Edition/dp/B00CMQTVUA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385654618&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=xbox+one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One</a>&nbsp;S
 in offline mode, although lag periodically occurs, albeit very subtly.<br />
<br />
My video settings on the X1S:<br />
<ul>
<li>Resolution: 4K </li><li>Color depth: 10-bit (30 bits per pixel) </li><li>Allow: everything checked except 3D </li><li>4K TV Details: Everything has green check/passes </li></ul>
<br />
My KS8000 Settings:&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>Resolution: 4K </li><li>Mode: Movie (switches to HDR mode upon detection) </li><li>Local dimming off </li><li>HDMI color activated </li></ul>
One thing to note is that I've used this on two different KS8000 Samsung's (had to return previous one) and both experienced the same issue. It seems to be coming from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Console-Standard-Edition/dp/B00CMQTVUA/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385654618&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=xbox+one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One</a>&nbsp;S itself due to lag.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions or similar issues?

<p>Oh, derp. I saw that but it definitely didn't register fully, sorry about that!</p>
<p>On your Xbox One console, try changing your resolution to 1080p. This setting won't affect content that has 4K capabilities as long as you have your console set to allow 4K and HDR, that only affects upscaling content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give that a try and see if you still experience the stuttering issue. Keep us posted! :)</p>

<h2>            Surface 2 Tablet - practically unusable &#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am so frustrated ! My Surface Pro 2 has been such a great tablet, and still could be, if it didn’t have this terrible OS ! Windows RT 8.1 has rendered my tablet literally unusable ! Can’t watch hulu, on IE or the app, IE crashes all the time, and forget
 about compatiblity. &nbsp;Is there anythjnf Microsoft will do at all ? Why sell a tablet that in just a few short years will be so outdated that they will not be making an option to update to Windows 10 ? Any advice besides throw it in the trash ? I spent a lot
 on this tablet when I bought it and I don’t currently have the means to get a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>A not so tech savy person, but I try.&nbsp;</p>

            You do not have a Surface <strong>PRO</strong> 2 if you are running RT 8.1, you have a Surface 2. Microsoft isn't going to provide compatibility updates for third party programs like Hulu. Sorry..

            Thank you for explaining the difference to me. I did not know that. It is more than just hulu. I am not able to go to many websites because they aren’t compatible with IE but there aren’t any other web browers in the app store. Do you have any reccomendations
 for that problem ? Everything I have ever used my tablet for I am not able to do anymore. Will Microsoft do anything at all if I were to take it into their store ? Any kind of credit for trading it in ? Sorry, I’m truly just looking for a way not to be out
 of luck. Really the only thing the tablet can be used for now is playing apps and that isn’t why I bought it.&nbsp;

<p>Yes,&nbsp; the same problem.&nbsp; Paid for a very expense Surface 2 to be able to use the Office software and now it won't work with IE most of the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;and to make matters worse, Microsoft has closed the store in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Can't load Chrome or other programs.&nbsp;
 It was a great tablet, but with no support from Microsoft I'm not a happy camper.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How To Upgrade From Windows XP PRO To Windows 7</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>I need to put Windows 7 on my Inspiron 1545 laptop 4GB Hard Drive, 256GB Memory. I have Windows XP PRO on it now. Please help me get started with some recommendations/suggested websites for performing this task. Also, can you please
 advise a source for purchasing the OS Windows 7. Thank you.</div>

            <p>First off, I suspect you mean 4GB of memory and 250GB hard drive.</p>
<p>What processor is inside?</p>
<p>How old is the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you can do this, probably.&nbsp; It depends on whether all the device drivers are available and which version -- 32 or 64 bit is supported.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and run the Windows Upgrade Advisor and run it.&nbsp; There is a specific one for XP to 7.&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=20&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your equipment is probably not new and may be quite worn.&nbsp; Check the hard drive to make certain it is worth going to the effort.&nbsp; You may wish to replace it first.&nbsp; If you will provide me with the model number of&nbsp; your hard drive, I can give you a link to
 the right tester software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are limited sources left to buy Windows 7.&nbsp; I believe you can find it on Amazon and several other places, but it will be pricey.&nbsp; Make certain you are buying from a legitimate source and you want to make certain it is NOT a one-time only licence that
 may be a problem for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this on about 50 computers and if the CPU and memory are fast enough, they can be very good.&nbsp; As a matter of fact the PC I am using right now is an XP to 7 upgrade that performs very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have made these decisions and are certain you can proceed, come back here to the same thread and I will provide you with a detailed check list of how to do this upgrade.</p>

</p><p><span><span>If your WiFi card is a Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini-card then there are special considerations.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When you install Windows 7, the default driver will be a Microsoft one version 4.176.75.21 dated 1 Oct 2008 and the card will function properly.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span><em>Despite whoever is noted as the source, all driver versions originally come from Broadcom as they made the card.</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Many of us found that installing the Dell WiFi card management utility or even just the Dell driver reduced the reception capability of this card to such an extent that it was unusable.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Similarly, allowing Windows update to install an updated driver also messed up its reception.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There used to be a section of the Dell website [“My Dell” or a similar name] that allowed you to download new copies of some Dell utilities.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>As far as I can tell, that is no longer available.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It was always pretty hit &amp; miss anyway so it’s no great loss.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You might have used Dell DataSafe Backup Local to make a USB backup of your Dell Factory Image Restore partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If not then consider doing so - restoring to factory condition [albeit with the computer’s original OS] might be a recovery method you would wish to keep available for the future.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

<p><span>For a quick initial assessment, search this forum for anything identified as a problem by the upgrade checkers and post a note about it in this thread as well.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Naturally, you can also search publisher/manufacturer support sites &amp; user forums for guidance.<span>&nbsp;

</span></span><span>Dell started selling the Inspiron 1545 with preinstalled Windows 7 sometime in 2009 so its compatibility can be taken pretty much for granted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you had reported having any other model of Inspiron then everything I have written would have to be modified with innumerable ifs, buts and maybes.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>As our models are the same, I expect only minor differences in hardware to exist so I don’t expect you to have any major Windows 10 incompatibility problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The major benefit of upgrading to Windows 10 is that there is no end-of-support date so you will not have any equivalent of the 8</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> April 2014 that effectively prevented any further secure use of Windows XP
 computers online.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>The end-of-support date for Windows 7 is

<p><span><span>As long as your hardware has drivers that work, Windows 10 will continue running as well as it does on day one.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>However, future Windows updates might require updated hardware drivers that you &amp; I will never have therefore those updates will not be installed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It follows that we will not know if our hardware is up-to-date or regarded as insecure unless we search for warnings from other users every month [which I am certainly not going to bother doing].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>We will be forced to rely on our antimalware applications to keep us safe.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 10 is, to all intents &amp; purposes, Windows 7 with a different appearance and with some different annoyances.<span>&nbsp;

</p><p><span><span>You can try to buy a “retail” licence for Windows 7 but this would be expensive.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This licence can be transferred between computers so, if your needs changed, you could buy a new computer and transfer your licence to it.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>However, if you bought a new computer then it would probably come with Windows 10 preinstalled so you might end up wasting the extra money you spent on getting a “retail” licence.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can definitely still find “OEM” [also commonly known as “System builder”] licences for Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>These are much cheaper than “retail” licences &amp; can be found more easily but they are tied to the first computer-motherboard-CPU they are installed on.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>In your situation, I would buy an OEM licence.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Whichever licence you buy, you must check that you are buying both the installation DVD and the Certificate of authenticity [the card that contains the Windows 7 Product Key].<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Anybody who offers to sell a Certificate of authenticity or a Product key without the installation DVD is definitely selling a fake.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Most OEM licences include just a 32 bit installation DVD or a 64 bit installation DVD whilst all Retail licences include both DVDs.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are lots of dishonest sellers out there.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Some enable your computer to show up as genuine Windows 7 at first and only later get recognised as non-Genuine.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This gives the seller time to escape.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span><span>You really need to buy only from a seller that you can still seek redress from at any time in the next few years and who you are prepared to think would be bothered enough to sort the situation out for you.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So, for example, </span><em><span>Amazon</span></em><span> should be okay but

<p><span><span>I believe that you will come to appreciate the benefits of making System images.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If you “partition” your single HDD into an OS drive and a Data drive then you can make smaller System images that can be made / recovered in 25 minutes and take up to only 40GB each even for a 64 bit system.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I partitioned my HDD into 70GB for the OS and the rest for Data.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>For this to be useful, I had to “relocate” my user folders to the Data drive.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I can explain both tasks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are ever going to partition your HDD then now is the time to do it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Installing your new OS directly onto a partitioned drive is much better than trying to partition an HDD afterwards.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Honestly.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You probably did not want to hear recommendations for doing even more work than the OS installation you intended to do but the effects on the ease of subsequent System image making are so great that you would regret not getting this done before or
 during your new OS installation.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two suitable stages for partitioning your HDD:-</span></p>
<p><span><span>1<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Whilst you still have Windows XP installed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>For this you could use a free utility such as </span></span><a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">EaseUS Partition Manager</span></a><span> or

<p><span><span>Both Windows 7 &amp; Windows 10 include tools for making System images.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>In both cases, the opening dialog of Windows backup contains a direct link to making a System image so you can make a System image without having to bother with Windows backup itself.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>In both cases, Windows backup can be set up to include making a System image if that’s what you prefer.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span><em>Whilst you need to do something to make backups of your own files, there are lots of ways to do this and Windows backup might not be your preferred solution.<span>&nbsp;
</span></em></span><span>In all cases, making System images or file backups on a drive within your computer is only slightly more reliable than a chocolate teapot - external drives are the reliable choice.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have the WD Edition of Acronis TI on my Inspiron 1545 and Seagate DiscWizard’s version of Acronis TI on my other computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I make a Windows-based System image for each computer every other week.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I make an Acronis TI-based System image for each computer every other week.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If I have a problem with either computer that cannot be rectified with straightforward troubleshooting, I restore the latest System image from before the problem’s appearance.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So I might waste an hour not fixing a problem and then I let the computer spend 25 minutes restoring a System image so the problem is bypassed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Even if the problem had been caused by a Windows or application update not installing correctly, I find that I can then repeat the update and it is all fine [in other words, I find that most problems are caused by unknown errors during updates,
 because update installation procedures are less than perfect, but the faults do not reoccur when the update is repeated].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Making and later restoring a System image can also allow me to experiment safely - when I worked through choosing all my Windows settings in Control panel &amp; elsewhere and all my applications’ options, I had a System image ready to restore
 in case I made a pig’s ear of the whole thing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I keep at least two Windows images and at least two Acronis images so the space needed does add up but this habit ensures that I have a month’s worth of images to fall back on.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I also keep important System images for longer so I need even more space.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I still have the System image I made straight after I reinstalled Windows onto a new [WD] HDD at the end of 2011.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I still have the System image I made straight after I fitted an SSD in place of an HDD in mid-2015.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>My external HDDs need to be big enough to hold all these images as well as the latest file backups of my own files, installation files etc; that’s why both my 500GB external HDDs are full and why I would not recommend anything smaller than
 1TB now.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows System images are just as easy to make as Acronis TI-based System images but Acronis TI has a better reputation for being able to restore System images onto different hardware.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>For example, when I decided to get an SSD, only Acronis TI WD Edition could restore my System image onto the new drive.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The Windows System image turned out to be useless in this situation so I would have had to reinstall everything from scratch if that was all I had.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I only continue to alternate between the two types of System image because I feel I am hedging my bets that way.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My use of the free utilities Seagate DiscWizard and Acronis TI WD Edition mean that I can only replace my existing HDDs with Seagate or WD ones unless I decide to pay to get the full Acronis TI version.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The only flexibility the free ones have is that they work however the qualifying make of HDD is connected [so it could be in a USB enclosure, for example].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some descriptions of these free TI versions state that the qualifying make of HDD is only needed to make System images but is not needed to restore them.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This is false, they will not restore without being able to find the qualifying make of HDD connected.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

<p><em><span><span>There is a point to this apparent diversion.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>It comes at the end.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span>On my Inspiron 1545’s Windows 7 installation, I had Microsoft Security Essentials.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>On both my Windows 10 installations I had Windows Defender.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>[</span><em><span>My router prevents my Windows XP installation from accessing or being accessed by the internet</span></em><span>]</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I updated them every day.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>I did full scans weekly.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I also kept Windows updated at least monthly.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I used to have Malwarebytes free version as well and I’d run a full scan of the systems every month so I had a second opinion.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>But I fell out of this habit a year ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sometime after I had last scanned with Malwarebytes, a piece of “Registry” malware called Poweliks crept onto my Inspiron 1545’s Windows 7 installation and spread from there across my network to my Inspiron 9300’s Windows 10 installation without
 causing any noticeable symptoms.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Neither MSSE nor Windows Defender detected it at the point of infection or at any time later.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When I investigated this malware online I discovered that it has been around since 2014 so the fact that MSSE &amp; Windows Defender failed to detect it was very disappointing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When I realised I had lapsed from the good practice of using Malwarebytes to get a second opinion, I updated it to its latest version and scanned with it expecting everything to be alright.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It found Poweliks straightaway and deleted it.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>But deleting malware does not necessarily delete its payload; my online banking security utility IBM Trusteer Rapport now keeps telling me that something tries to screenshot my login passwords.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>That’s why malware removal always needs to be followed up with either a full OS reinstallation or a System image restoration from before the moment of infection.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I worked my way back to before I fitted the SSD six months earlier and every one of my images was infected.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So, despite all care I took to make them, my System images cannot save me unless I revert to 2011 and then update from there.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>So I’m having to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 on the 1545 and reinstall Windows 10 and everything else on the other computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So irked was I that I went into great detail reviewing available antimalware applications.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I found that online reviews tended to focus their own efforts on usability issues and to quote the same test organisation when it came to measuring effectiveness -
</span></span><a href="http://www.av-test.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">www.av-test.org</span></a><span><span>.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>AVTest reported that both MSSE in Windows 7 &amp; Windows Defender in Windows 10 were significantly below industry averages for “zero day” malware detection despite having improved markedly during 2015 [from extremely poor levels in MSSE’s case].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Bitdefender detected practically 100% on every test including zero day attacks so I have bought that now [</span><em><span>I installed a 30 day trial version and that triggered a 50% discount offer for the first year; so it’s £25 this year
 &amp; £50 each year afterwards to get protection for 3 computers</span></em><span>].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Norton came close to the same level of effectiveness but their Poweliks removal utility failed to detect Poweliks &amp; their online support was very poor so I binned it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>ESET also came close to the same effectiveness and their own Poweliks removal utility actually worked; I had no contact with, so I have no opinion about, their online support.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Bitdefender online support is also quite disappointing; they get there in the end if you persevere but they start off giving the same useless responses that we see in this forum from “Microsoft” “Support” “Engineers”.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The only excellent standard of online support was from Malwarebytes; I got an email answering my questions correctly &amp; fully within a couple of days.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>They had read my questions, they had understood my questions, they also understood their own products so they answered my questions - if only their AVTest effectiveness measures had been better I would happily have upgraded to their paid-for
 versions and stayed with them for a decade.</span></span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>The point of this apparent diversion is that I ruined my own backup procedures by failing to get a second opinion before making System images.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Six months of System images were infected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even though I now have Bitdefender with its excellent test results, I always get a second opinion by running Malwarebytes before making System images.</span></strong></p>

            <p>Upgrading from XP to 7 is not possible. You either have to do a clean installation of Windows 7, or else do a two-step Upgrade:&nbsp; XP to Vista, then Vista to 7. I recommend against trying to do a two-step upgrade since it doubles the risk of having problems.</p>

<p>
</p><p>MSI z97 guard pro board, i5 processor, 16GB ram, Samsung 850 Pro 500gb drive, Nvidia 620 card latest (as in Tuesday) drivers.&nbsp; I've done and reverted the W10 Upgrade about 4-5 times because I just can't get network connectivity.&nbsp; I've downloaded the W10
 Drivers and MB stuff from MSI, but the drivers don't load properly (according to the event Tab in Device Manager). I've also tried uninstalling and disabling, rebooting, waiting for hardware detection etc...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NIC link light and traffic lights are on and blinking, but there is just nothing showing in the Network &amp; Internet part of settings, so it can't even get on line to sort itself out....</p>

</p><p>I've been an Insider since October and my HP laptop has been a breeze through that process, I've been recommending people to sign up because the Insider experience was so good, now I wish I hadn't....</p>

            I'm updating this from 8.1 to 10, and I've already gone through those articles. &nbsp;There are no error boxes popped up by the OS. &nbsp;I've uninstalled the NIC drivers, and tried to reinstall in Win 10, with absolutely no luck. &nbsp;I've used Drivers from the MSI
 UK website for the NIC and the chipset. &nbsp;I will try downloading the ISO again, but as the device is trying to update through the reservation icon, this appears to prevent me downloading the ISO

            <p>Oh great... After a lot of issues, including after using the USB setup losing my ability to revert to 8.1, Windows refused to access the hard drive, and in changing the BIOS crashed out, leaving me to have to reset the BIOS, and format my System drive to
 get an installation.&nbsp; Now (despite the promise "skip the windows key" and it'll be all right, I cannot activate Windows 10, despite my MS account being registered for the upgrade....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok MS, what do I do now? and don't say reinstall 8.1, because I did the cheap upgrade from 7 to 8, then 8.1, so I don't have an 8.1 key and don't really want to revert&nbsp;to 8, patch it then upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one good thing? Win 10 now works fine, it installed the same drivers as before but&nbsp;with a clean install, it works....&nbsp; But don't tell me, having put all the effort in on the Insider Preview, I have to shell out for a&nbsp;License!</p>

Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported.

<em>no</em> success.&nbsp; I have <em>never </em>had a problem connecting this device or others until the last update a week or so ago.&nbsp; The update screwed up my NVIDIA drivers as well, but I sorted that out.&nbsp; I use the UE Boom for decent portable sound from my

<p>Thank you for this information, however it did not fix the problem.&nbsp; Also, fyi, the Windows+X menu no longer has Control Panel on it, although I managed to get to Troubleshooting&gt;Systems and Security etc. another way.</p>

<p>We appreciate your FY1. Since the Windows update troubleshooter did not fix our concern, let us isolate the issue and initially work on your portable speaker.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>As I have previously mentioned, </span>
</span><span><span>issues may also arise from outdated drivers. Our concern on both devices may also be addressed by following the steps under

<p>Dear Islander14,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, yes and no.&nbsp; I deleted all the Bluetooth&nbsp;device drivers (not just the device on the setting page) and the MS Bluetooth driver.&nbsp; Then I (with my IT son's help) I reinstalled the MS Bluetooth&nbsp;drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This allowed me to pair my Bluetooth&nbsp;devices with MS 10.&nbsp; The problem is, once you pair a device, then turn off the device, or reboot the computer, you have to remove the device and re-add it everytime&nbsp;you want to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still not happy, but at least I can use my Bluetooth stuff with some stuffing around.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's in the skype to go settings &gt; update your nearest location. If you select Canada, British Columbia, Vancouver - the Vancouver option doesn't allow you to enter a phone number the the new prefix 236, you can only enter a number with 604. I was given
 a SIM with the 236 prefix, I had no other option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Temp Accounts Being Created</h2>
                    <p>When I log in to my account, MS or local, a Temporary Account keeps getting created.&nbsp; Also a Temp folder under Users folder. Which is empty. This has been an ongoing problem for a month and is very annoying. I have to log out, then restart my system in order
 to clear out the Temp account. And when the Temp account is created, it flags me that&nbsp; my files and folders are inaccessable. I have created new accounts per Microsoft to clear up this problem and nothing seems to resolve the probem. I even did a reset of
 the system and still this problem exist.</p>

                    I have done something that now shows my pictures in a slideshow whenever I leave my computer idle. It even continues when I try to put it in the Sleep mode. Does anyone have any suggestions how to remove/change whatever I did? Thank you so much.

    <title>Files included in Libraries stored on USB cannot be accessed on other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.w.s. ii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files included in Libraries stored on USB cannot be accessed on other computers</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 7 and added my Documents, Music and Video folders from my USB hard drive to the relevant Libraries as that is where I store all of my data. It all worked quite well on my home PC and I was happy with it.</p>
<p>However when I went to college I could not access any of the files. When I tried to open the folder I received an access denied error message. When I checked the properties of the folders they were all reported as being empty despite the gigabytes of data
 in each.</p>
<p>When back at home I can access the files and folders. Evidently the issue is tied to the folders being added to the Libraries. I suspect I can remove the folders from their Libraries to restore regular access however I will not then be able to access the
 multimedia files via Windows Media Center. Also having all my document folders accessible via the Documents Library is very convenient.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can have these folders included in the Libraries yet be able to access them on other computers not in my HomeGroup?</p>
<p>My operating system is Windows 7 Professional x86. College operating system is Windows XP Professional x86. USB hard drive is formatted to NTFS without any security restrictions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help :)</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Jeff,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No, you cannot have the folders included in the Libraries and be able to access them on&nbsp;<strong>non-Home Group</strong> computers. However, this is possible
 on the same&nbsp;</span><strong><span>home group</span></strong><span>computers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you delete files or folders from within a library, they're also deleted from their original locations. If you
 want to remove an item from a library but not delete it from the location it's stored in, you should remove the folder containing the item. When you remove a folder from a library, all the items in the folder will be removed (but not deleted). For more information,
 see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Include-folders-in-a-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Include folders in a library</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, if you include a folder in a library and then delete the folder from its original location, the folder
 is no longer accessible in the library.</span></p>
