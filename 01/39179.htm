<p>Hello Marc and Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of issue occurs when the account signed in doesn't have permission to install a program. If the account currently signed in is a member of the family, they will need to ask permission from a parent in order to modify the restrictions set on the

    <title>Why do people hate the XBOX One&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tunsil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do people hate the XBOX One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>All I hear are rumors being told at why it is bad. I think the XBOX One looks like a great console as:</p>

<p><strong>Innovation instead of an upgrade</strong></p>
<p>With the XBOX One, I see much innovation through bringing it into entertainment and adding the dual-tasking which to me seems to bring me in love with the console especially as shown in interviews, watching my NFL Fantasy while watching the actual game.
 Also although is is not as powerful as the PS4 gaming wise, it still has added much to it through exclusive games and bringing the community more exclusives in-games by signing contracts with EA and extending it with Activision to recieve CoD downloadable
 content first.</p>

<p><strong>The Controller</strong></p>
<p>Same classic control even better with a new d-pad and has the same feel as the best controller, the XBOX 360 controller. This design was obviously taken seriously as seen many models were printed out through a 3D printer until the final design was chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Kinect</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I am aware about the "privacy concerns" but you have the option to turn the camera off. XBOX One is features voice integration at which I find a lot more unique rather than holding a button for five seconds. Kinect also is now amazing looking through
 every joint of your body and even seeing your heart rate.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to write about but these are some of the basic things that I will come to love about Xbox One.</p>

<p>Inovation is good only when people are in a position where they are able to accept the inovation without drawbacks of reality. And reality states that 24check in is allready cuting off around 40% of the world population from x1 and Cloud gaming which requires
 a good internet conection is cutting off another 40% which leaves only about 20% of people ready for sayed inovation and out of them atleast 10% Will choose not accept it for one reason or another. Also aside from Kinect which is not an inovation in technology
 as Siri already exists (and can even speak with you and do many things x1 can't) all X1 inovations are all PC downgraded PC features.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>CoD exclusive first download content is a joke as there are a lot of people who don't play or even dislike it. And EA is the most hated gaming publisher on the face of the planet. I think Osama is more popular then they are.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>You speak of inovation yet you are happy with the same old controler? Ps4 controler has been inovated,while xbox stayed mostly the same and while thats a good thing, controler alone won't be enough to sway people to accept all of x1 limitations,RRODS and
 restrictions.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Why the hell would I want to know my heart rate? And it is also can function as another DRM for the movie industry which insures there is only a number of people in the room watching movie that is alowed by your licence. And why would I pay 500$ for a voice
 command controller? I will admit that gaming made me lazy. But I am not yet living in the Lazytown.</p>

<p>I don't like the drm policy as it would be like a telemarter calling you every day to make sure you were you and you had to give all the paperwork for everything you own every day or someone comes in and takes it away if you miss a single day.</p>
<p>Kinect forced upon players if they like it or not kinect fails on you because a pet or human breaks it or earthquake makes it hit the ground.. you can't play xbox.</p>
<p>More apps while nice I want a game system not an cable box app system that plays games (day one there will be 4 times the apps as games on xbox one)</p>

<p>I love Xbox it has been my favorite gaming system for years. I've been with them from the begining. I have over 34 titles that I &nbsp;play for the 360 alone. I want an Xbox One but I can't play old games which means I have to have two systems. Restrictions on
 selling back games, check in time is like checking in with a parole officer every 24 hours. Can't play on a system I pay for at will because it has to be online all the time. &nbsp;The price is not the problem it is the restrictions and the heartlessness of the
 Microsoft officials who do not believe that the customer is always right. I don't want to by a playstation 4 but what are my other options.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start button not working from keyboard or from the screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many posts on here about Windows 10 button not working, and have tried the various solutions, to no avail. &nbsp;I recently got a Windows update which afterwards rendered my start menu useless. I received a blue screen saying there were errors after
 Windows updated and restarted my computer, but I was not able to retrieve the actual error messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did do a restore, but nothing changed. I did the powershell command, with no changes. I also restarted the explorer.exe, and created a new application, with no changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other options do I have? Am I totally out of luck, and do I need to start backing up all of my files, and just reinstall windows?</p>

 it appears that the McAfee software is running a virus scan on the disk and hence showing a high disk usage. If you see the memory usage tab, you will see that the “McAfee service host’ and the ‘McAfee On-access scanner service’ are consuming the highest memory

<h2>            Xbox One and Forza 5</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Xbox forum,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forza 5 disc won't load and play on xbox one and kicks back out to the dashboard. &nbsp;Does doing a factory reset on the xbox one delete all your game progress? &nbsp;I have heard that the game will automatically download to the cloud, so will I be able to get back
 my progress, because I don't want to loss over 50% of my progress?</p>
<p>Thank you for your grateful respond</p>
<p>Frosty&nbsp;</p>

<p>A factory reset will not fix your Forza issue. I have tried that. I am having the same issue with DR3. Xbox support told me to unplug the power for 2-3 min. Plug it back in and fire it up. They say it clears a corrupted cache. Did'nt work for me, maybe it
 will for you.</p>

<p>They should stop selling this game nice way to take people's money and not have a solution to a problem that many are having. &nbsp;To think that I was going to buy the steering wheel for this stupid game that does not work. &nbsp;Consumer Affairs complaint is next.

<p>Try a hard reset you can do this by holding down the power button on the front of xbox one for 5 secs</p>
<p>Then wait for a min or so before restarting.</p>

<p>I can't even get XBOX to remove the game off my console. &nbsp;I don't understand if we have the ability to download why can't they have the ability remove it. &nbsp;This game is the most frustrating game that I have ever tried playing. Spoke to agent yesterday told

<p>I talked to several agents - all they want to do is clear history and reset this or that it is crazy. &nbsp;It is a Turn 10/xbox one problem, they need to fix the Road America update and patch it cause thousands of people can't play and it is going to wreck them
 in the long run.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

</p><p>There are multiple bug checks, but there is one that takes great priority due to its meaning.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (124)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>A fatal hardware error has occurred. This fatal error displays data from the Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA).</em><br />
<br />
If we run an !errrec on the 2nd parameter of the bug check (address of the WER structure) we get the following:<br />

</p><p class="contentStandard">This implies that this was very likely not a software issue, but an IRQ or another hardware related issue. Essentially there was a bus communication issue (CPU, RAM, video card itself, etc).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">----------------------------</span></strong></p>

Please uninstall either software ASAP! If you cannot find either software to uninstall, or it's not installed, please navigate to the following filepath:<br />
<br />
<em>C:\Program Files\ATI Technologies\ATI.ACE\Fuel\amd64\AODDriver2.sys and rename
<strong>AODDriver2.sys</strong> to <strong>AODDriver.2old</strong></em> and then Restart.</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>2. </strong>Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only
 issue. If you have already experimented with the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>3. </strong>If the above fails, please run Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Memtest86+:<br />

<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Which should I download?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
Do note that some older generation motherboards do not support USB-based booting, therefore your only option is CD (or Floppy if you really wanted to).
<br />
<br />
<strong>How Memtest works:</strong><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
<strong>Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:</strong><br />

 and install its drivers (if 2nd video card available), or use integrated graphics.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">----------------------------</span></strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If all of the above fails, there is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -

http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />

            <p>to start off i assume you meant to change it from&nbsp;<em><strong>AODDriver2.sys --&gt;&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>AODDriver2.old&nbsp;</strong></em>not
<em><strong>AODDriver.2old</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>i ran memtest on a different format with same computer for 2 passes and it didn't come with any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however i think it may be the faulty processor and i ran prime 95 and that is supposed to test the processor and the ram, and upon running prime 95 it crashed my computer i took a picture of the results, and the results were showing possible hardware failure
 also. if you would like i can get a picture of both the end results and what they said the results meant</p>

    <title>Transfering Live Account From One Windows Profile to Another, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bamfmaster 69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfering Live Account From One Windows Profile to Another, </h2>
                    
<p>So i did something stupid and I bought the Black ops season pass on the wrong windows account. I am reletively new to X-box live and was not aware that I had two accounts nor that the one I was
 using was not connected to the Gamer tag I use. So I looked at the help page and I created a third windows account and tried to do the switcharoo that they say you have to do in order to get the correct gamertag assigned to the Season pass holding account.
 It did not work as it told me that I could not do it at that time. which i assume to mean that i have to wait a month in order to try this again. I also assume this is because i tried to transfer the licenses which also did not work because the Season pass
 cannot be shared across the same X-box apparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you know the situation, my question is, Is there not an easier way to switch gamertags from one profile to another? and if not, is there a number i can call or a person i can contact
 which would be able to make the changes for me since I am not allowed to. If not, who do I talk to about transfering or refunding the Season Pass so that i can re-buy it from the correct account.</p>
<p>If anyone thinks they can help me out it would be appretiated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>In situations like this, it might be easier to talk to someone in billing especially since you've done all the online suggestions. &nbsp;Not knowing where you're located, here is the listing of all the Xbox international support numbers:

<p>Also, if you go to the bottom of the Xbox.com site, you'll see a link for Support. If you click that, you can see if someone from Support can call you back so you don't have to wait on hold.</p>

<h2>            Update Won&#39;t Install</h2>
                    <p>For the past several days, update KB4041994 did not install correctly and an error message was left. I researched Windows Update Catalog, and there is no reference available to this update.. 'File does not exist' when queried for specific update. Today another
 update attempt was made, and this error appeared..</p>

 revealed. I have done a 'Clean Boot' and no help .. I just did a fresh 'Over Copy' using the Windows Media tool, and am refusing to redo another clean boot, since one was done at the time of the release of Version 1709, as I encountered numerous problems with
 that update.</span></p>

<p>Lou, Today February 9th, 2018, I found the solution to my problem with update KB4041994 failing to install. It was posted on this link :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/77gawp/kb4041994_fails_to_install/ .</strong></p>
<p>By uninstalling my HEVC Media Extension on the Settings&gt;Apps page, and then reattempting the download and installation of&nbsp; update KB4041994, the update installed successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just have to wonder why that was not the first suggestion to try?&nbsp; I hope any other users with this problem with update KB4041994, can find this solution helpful, as I have.</p>

<h2>            Latest update unable to complete</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to do the latest windows 10 update for the past 3 days. Each time that I do I get a blue screen with 2 options.
</p>
<p>1. Cancel. 2 restore to previous date. Option 2 will not work. When I click on cancel it give me other options advanced , exit.</p>
<p>I have to go through a number of steps to get to restore - which I mentioned don't work. Last night 3/8/2016 I did a system restore.&nbsp; About an hour later I get a windows notice to update, which I do not want to do as there is something that keep the update
 from completing each time and then I have to go through all these steps in order to get my computer back up and running.&nbsp; I have run all trouble shooting with no luck.

    <title>Malware on computer, unable to run SFC Scan. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Malware on computer, unable to run SFC Scan.</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title: admin a/cs now standard user, cannot reverse, cannot run "sfc /scannow"
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously posted initial impact of 12/24 malware attack injecting and installing illegal and possibly criminal "pcspeedup" application {referred to state's attorney, dept. of cyber crime for prosecution-pending) which tries to scare user with first browser
 screen opened when pc is started again, "critical report"&nbsp; of a seemingly endless list of first class problems, recommds installation of full version paid "pcspeedup"&nbsp;to clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AVAST BOOT SCAN, FULL SYSTEM SCAN found nothing, did not detect installation of "pcspeedup" as unauthorized, but program showed up on list of installed apps so the attack must have falsified legitimate request for dld &amp; authorization to install somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HitmanPro 3, cloud-based forensic s/w&nbsp;recommended by another poster was used when HiJackThis did not show "pcspeedup" as a type 04 or any other hit: found files buried in . . . /IE5/temp and&nbsp;showed non-existent path as "c:/windows/sysnative"; hmp3 cleared
 and quarantined pcsup.&nbsp; System Restore and Configure Setpoint seem to be working again after pc restart w HTMP3 running startup scan still reporting no threats found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to run system file check as "sfc.exe /scannow" from cmd line from admin a/c&nbsp;system replied, with "sfc must be run from an admin a/c.&nbsp; Checking I found all existing accounts on computer are downgraded and locked as standard user a/c's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Posts have provided me with ways to reverse previous damage, now what to do about no administrator level access &amp; privileges accounts: cannot add new a/c, cannot upgrade locked 'standard user' either?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks -would be interesting puzzle if I had not had it happen to me: new PC, new 1TB hdd, clean install of Windows 7 64-bit just 01OCT2015!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Addendum:&nbsp;- search showed many sites still green light "pcspeedup" as harmless freeware, or adware, only a few show it as potential danger, even Avast said to report it as a "false positive" when I uploaded it by auto upload next update; classified it as
 a 'PUP' possibly unwanted program.&nbsp; Have filed follow up report w Avast recommending escalation from PUP to serious threat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else?&nbsp; Do we submit malicious code to the FBI cyber crimes section?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for assistance in advance - this event 12.24.2015 has me stymied - like an onion or nested Russian dolls each layer peeled back reveals more damage, and w/o SFC worry about further damage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance I can boot to cmd prompt and run sfc to get around no admin&nbsp; class account in Windows?</p>

            <p>Hi GG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the underlying issue to proceed with more global fix is the lack of an available admin account, it may still be possible to enable (or show) the non-removable (but hidden by default)&nbsp;Built-in Administrator Account and from that fix issues regarding visible
 user accounts (maybe even in the absence of a noticeable Admin Account of any type).&nbsp; Please see the following:
</p>
<p>

 enabled/visible Admin Account) - this is likely the better option (if anything less than radical is possible) from your explanation.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Blank blue Desktop, Microsoft not responding</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new Windows 10 Toshiba Satellite laptop. This has been my 2nd day of use. I was using a Microsoft word and was having issues with the program not responding and had to close it and restart my document several times. I finally got frustrated
 and sat my laptop down because I didnt have the patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I come back 15min later to start again, and my desktop screen is blank blue and the few desktop icon i have are gone. The taskbar at the bottom is also missing its program icons and at the bottom right there are other icons missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer wont let me do anything (if i click on the start button a message comes up saying Microsoft Windows is not repsonding). I click "End Process" and nothing happens. I cant even restart my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi, Kiki.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, and we in Community will try to help you in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First of all I would suggest that you&nbsp;force shutdown your laptop, by pressing and holding the power button for few minutes until the computer shuts down.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then restart your computer and check if you can log into Safe Mode. To access this mode while restarting, after the manufacturer logo is displayed tap F8 button rapidly until you access
 the&nbsp;Boot Environment. Check if the same issue occurs in this mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If not perform the steps below and check if you find any error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span><br />
I would suggest you to run System File Checker.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. (Also applicable for Windows 10)<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method2:
</span></strong><span><br />
I would also suggest you to Run DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors. (Refer to Windows 8/8.1
 also applicable to Windows 10)<br />

<h2>            How do I get the programmable Microsoft wireless mouse to keep button programming in Win-10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Explorer Mini Mouse Model 1363 with 5 buttons.&nbsp; Microsoft driver version 9.59172.0&nbsp; dated 12/12/2013. X &nbsp; Upgraded Win-7 to current version of Windows-10.&nbsp; NOT the preview.&nbsp; Problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The side front button default is "Magnify" and it worked OK in Win-7.&nbsp; In Win-10 it will not always toggle off magnify after toggling ON.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The side rear button is programmed to copy (Ctrl+C)&nbsp; and works sometimes and mostly doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; The Wheel Button is programmed to Paste (Ctrl+V) and works sometimes and mostly doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the mouse looses the programming for these buttons.&nbsp; I have even gone into Program Specific programming for 10 programs and set all buttons to the same programs and it didn't help.</p>
<p>Is there a new Windows 10 specific driver available ?&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            XP-Pen tablet&#58; Can&#39;t change the settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an XP-Pen tablet that i use for drawing. I'm not really a technology expert, and i've never tried configuring the tablet before. What i want to do is change the sensitivity/speed of the pen, but i don't know if that's even possible. I am using Windows
 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i go to Devices and Printers, i can see my tablet as "TABLET G3 4x3" in the list of devices. But when i go to the properties, it's labeled as a mouse in the Categories section. However, when i go to the Device Manager, it doesn't show up as a mouse,
 (and i can't find it in the Hardware section of the mouse properties, either) instead it shows up under Human Interface Devices as "HID-compliant device". I tried messing around with the properties, but i couldn't find a solution there, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried going to the Pen and Touch settings, and clicked "Practice using flicks", but when i try to use my pen on the tablet, it says: "You cannot use a mouse to perform a flick. Try again using your tablet pen or finger." I even tried using my finger, but
 it didn't even react to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Tablet PC Settings, where the input panel should be at the bottom, instead it just says "Costumize Tablet PC Input Panel features in Input Panel Settings.". Then i went back to the tablet properties and then tried the Input Configuration Device Properties
 of that. I checked the driver details, and then tried running "C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\MTConfig.sys", but i just got the error message saying no program was able to open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like i've tried everything. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the tablet device twice, and i've made sure to update all of the drivers. Am i missing something? Is it even&nbsp;<em><strong>possible
</strong></em>to change the settings? Like i said, i'm no expert on any of this, so i apologize if i'm asking stupid questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            mobile hotspot feature broken on pc since build 14393.187</h2>
                    <p>Since the recent cumulative update to build 14393.187 (i have Win 10 Home 64bit, production ring) the built-in mobile hotspot feature of the Windows 10 Settings App is broken for me. When i try to open up my Ethernet connection in form of a mobile hotspot
 from the Settings App of my Laptop, the switch immediately greys out and slides back to "off", with the error message "mobile hotspot can't be set up. Please activate the wlan function" (not the exact words, had to translate it into English, sorry).</p>
<p>I really don't know why this doesn't work anymore, i did everything exactly like always before this last update, and there it worked without problems this way.</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for trying to help, i finally figured out how to solve this problem today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager, in the category network-adapters (not sure if this is the exact term in english language, sorry) among some others i saw "Microsort Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter #2" and "Microsort Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter #3". Under Properties-&gt;Drivers
 i saw, that both were labled as "disabled". After i enabled both of them, they dissappeared from the list in the device manager, and the mobile hotspot feature in the Settings App worked again.</p>

    <title>shell32.dll replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> koolkid22  say:</h3>
<h2>            shell32.dll replacement</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I used a program to modify the theme of my windows 7 machine. When I uninstalled it, the custom icons didn't seem to revert back to the default icons that come with Windows 7. I know that this might have something to do the with Shell32.dll file, so I ran
 a SFC scan on my computer. It said that it found corrupted files and has restored them successfully, and that the changes will take effect after a system reboot. So I restarted my computer, but when I logged onto my desktop, the icons still didn't revert back.
 I already tried a system restore before the SFC scan, but it said that it didn't restore successfully. So I think that I need to replace the Shell32.dll manually. I don't know how to do this because first of all i don't have a replacement of the Shell32.dll
 file, and I don't know what directory it's located in to begin with. Any help with this will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Could you try clicking <em>WIN</em> +<em>R</em> and typing <em>regsvr32 shell32.dll</em> here? It might solve the problem.<br />

            Wait a minute. It seemed to fix it self... I don't know what happened but ok. But I still am concerned about the system restore part. I tried it 2 times and it failed. Anything on that? What if a virus gets on my computer and system restore fails... wouldn't
 want that to happen!<br />
