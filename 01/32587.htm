<h2>            Any way to set schedule or time limit for only internet or web browsers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to limit my son's access to internet or at least web browsers to certain specified times of day. &nbsp;I still want him to have access to other tools like Microsoft Word, etc. for his schoolwork while limiting web-based distractions outside
 of specified times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see anywhere in Microsoft 10's parental controls where I can do this - only time limits that completely log him out, or settings that block programs outright. &nbsp;Is there a way to do this within Windows, or do I need to look for a third party program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>You cannot just create time limit for using Internet using Family Safety. However you may turn on web browsing limits if you want to block sites that provide adult content, or to allow or block individual websites or webpages by using their web
 addresses or </span><strong><span>URLs</span></strong><span>. For young children, you can set up web browsing limits so they can only visit a small number of sites that you specifically allowed.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Setting TV on top of Xbox One X</h2>
                    Hi, will it cause any issues with my console if i set my TV on top of it sitting horizontally? I have my TV on a dresser and there is no more room on the surface of the dresser and it would overheat if I put it in a drawer.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Craft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us!&nbsp;To answer your question, we wouldn't advise that particular set up as it doesn't follow
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/position-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"How to position your Xbox One console"</a> article.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Place the console on a stable surface. </li><li>Do <strong>not </strong>place the console on speakers or subwoofers. </li><li>The console should be in a well-ventilated, relatively cool place and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
away from direct heat sources</span>.</li><li>The space should be uncluttered. </li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Do <strong>not </strong>put other objects on, under, or right next to the console.</span>
<ul>
<li>For example, don’t put an object on the top right of your Xbox One console. This may block the vents and cause your console to overheat.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and let us know about any other questions or concerns :)</p>

<h2>            Want to find the IP address from a hard drive that was in a PC. Win XP</h2>
                    I have a PC that got thermal errors and will not boot. We have ordered a new PC. I would like to recover the IP address off the hard drive. The hard drive works and I have it attached to another computer. Where on the drive would this information be?

            Hard drives don't have IP addresses. Computers and network devices are assigned IP addresses (or have a static IP set). What are you trying to accomplish (end goal)?

            We use static IP address. What I am trying to find is where the information is stored for the network device on the hard drive. The IP address is what I want. Is it in a file or a reg key. If it is in a reg key how do I access the regestry on a drive that
 is not the boot drive. I have this drive attached to another computer drive letter&nbsp;F.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>For "the network device"? What "network device"? You can't access the registry without booting the computer with a rescue system CD. Because you are using XP, you can try mounting the registry using a BartPE disc. Here's an article about doing that:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/peboot.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/peboot.htm</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea where or if you would find what you're looking for since it's unclear to me what you really need or why.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue (question seems clear to me).&nbsp; I had a working computer with a hard coded IP network address (not one issued by DHCP).&nbsp; The drive has boot up problems so I can't load the registry and other normal boot up items.&nbsp; I can read the hard
 drive, extract information, but the boot sectors are damaged and I want to extract as much disk information before I even attempt to repair the boot sectors with a system repair disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IP address info has to be located somewhere on the hard disk (other than the damaged boot sectors, such as a Registry entry, or .ini file somewhere on the hard disk).&nbsp; I would like to know if it is possible to recover what this work stations fixed IP
 address was.&nbsp; There has to be some file on the hard disk that still holds this information, and I would like to know how to access it.</p>

            I don't know what you think you're going to do with the information, but the TCP/IP configuration information for each network adapter on an XP machine is stored in the Registry under<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />

            1. Regedit<br />
2. Click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
3. Click on File, Load Hive<br />
4. Browse to %SystemRoot%\System32\Config of the attached drive<br />
5. Open System.dat<br />
6. Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces<br />
7. There may be several interfaces listed. Just start clicking, and you'll find the correct interface. The IP address, as well as any other static network information (subnet mask, default gateway, etc), will be there.

<p>Tried creating bootable install media but that says you cannot upgrade using that method .</p>

            Hi, TommyGaming
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor&nbsp;
<br />
<br />try the following
<br />
<br />
<br />Steps to follow to solve problems with the microphone in Windows 10 April 2018 Update
<br />The first thing we are going to do is open the Windows 10 Configuration page and navigate through the Privacy&gt; Microphone options. Once there, we must make sure that the switch of the option Allow applications to access the microphone is in the ON position. If not, we must activate it.
<br />
<br />Just below this option, we will see a list of applications that can access the microphone of our team and from where we can control the access to the device of each of them individually. Therefore, for each application we have a switch with which we can indicate if we want to use the microphone of the equipment or not. In this list, we must check if the switch of the applications in which we have detected that the microphone does not work is in the ON position.
<br />
<br />It is important to know that if access to the microphone on our computer is disabled, we will not be able to manage the microphone access permissions for the applications individually. If we find this case, then we must allow the operating system to access the microphone.
<br />
<br />To do this, from the configuration page of Windows 10 April 2018 Update we go back to Privacy&gt; Microphone and verify if the access to the microphone for this device is activated. If not, click on the Change button a small window will open with a switch that allows us to activate access to the microphone on our PC. After all this, we should check how the problems with the microphone in Windows 10 April 2018 Update have been fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your microphone
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.

<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager

<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.

<h2>            Freelancer Installation error.</h2>
                    Hi I am installing the game freelancer on my computer, when I get to 37% I get this error. "Freelancer Setup encountered a disk error while writing the file C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Freelancer\data\audio\pilot_f_mil_m01a.utf. Make sure your hard
 disk is not full ( I have 18gb of free space), and the file is not in use.<br />
<br />
also is this game compatible with Windows XP service pack 3?<br />

<p><span>Hi Ragsmuffin,</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hello Salmangul,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
<span><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to remove all the external devices connected to your computer and then try it.</span></span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also i would suggest you to perform a system restore from WinRE mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point
 in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>To
 access the System Recovery Options menu</span></a>. Please follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a
<span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to system restore your computer will not appear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you have a Windows installation disc:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert the installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button , click the arrow next to the <strong>Lock</strong> button , and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Note</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more
 information, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BIOS: frequently asked questions</a>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose your language settings, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the System Recovery Options menu, click on system restore.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Also remove all the external devices connected to your computer and then try it.<br />
<br />
I hope that this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</span></span></p>

<h3> nick of gem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one stereo headset mic not working</h2>
                    
<p>my xbox one stereo headset is currently not working. i can still hear game and chat audio through the headset, I can mute the headset, but I can not talk. It does not work on either of my controllers, I was just wondering how I can go about troubleshooting
 to see whether I need to replace the headset or controller. All of this just started happening within the past week after the latest round of beta invites. My mic was working fine, then it started making very loud noises for anyone in my party and now I cannot
 speak at all. I'm assuming I broke something removing the mic or adapter from controller.</p>

<p>It's because the adapter and the headset your using are 2 different standards, the Adapter is CTIA while your Headset is OMTP there are CTIA to OMTP or OMPT to CTIA converters(either one will work) you can get from any Tech store RadioShack, BestBuy, etc.
 or online at Amazon or eBay. </p>
<p>This YouTube link better illustrates and explains what I'm talking about:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=z5f-8WF2tdw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Here's a link to the one I've got which costs me just under $6 after shipping:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00ON7PXFS/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?qid=1414194105&amp;sr=8-3&amp;pi=SY200_QL40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com/.../ref=mp_s_a_1_3</a></p>
<p>Also if like me you have Actual Headphones(w/ a detachable cable)(NOT earbuds) such as Beats by Dr. Dre(any model) or other brand and want to use your Beats or other but want a better quality Mic that doesn't pick up cord russel or rubbing sounds from your
 clothing or skin because like many brands it has a cord with an in-line remote/Mic.... Below is a link to the other option I went with in this YouTube video showing what you'll need and how to use it, the items info is in the description. I got both items
 off of Amazon for $15.46 w/Free 2-day Shipping with a Free 30 day Trial membership to Amazon Prime, which is way more reasonable then buying the single dedicated use XBOX One Stereo Headset for $90</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EATKv3agkY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youtube.com/watch</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/9EATKv3agkY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/9EATKv3agkY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>I hope this helps everyone, I know I was extremely irritated trying to look up and find out what the problem was with my Headset Adapter because its very difficult to find the very little info out there as to why everyones Headset will work but not the Mic</p>

<p>I use Turtle Beach X11's with my console along with the official headset adapter. &nbsp;They are always stored safely when not in use so I can't attribute my fault with accidental damage.</p>
<p>Today when joining an Xbox party, nobody could hear my mic. &nbsp;I can hear everyone fine and myself breathing and speaking into the mic boom but nobody else can. &nbsp;The mute button on the adapter no longer lights up and the volume controls no longer beep.</p>
<p>I did a hard reset, updated the controller software etc etc but have found no solution. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access desktop stuck in  &#34;Choose your Keyboard Layout&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Win 10 from Win 7 on my HP PC.&nbsp; Several weeks later (2 weeks ago) I rebooted my computer and now I get the Blue Screen&nbsp;message "Choose your Keyboard Layout".&nbsp; I've rebooted a few times and get it every time.&nbsp; I can not use my keyboard
 or mouse at all. Nothing works.&nbsp; Is there any way to fix this issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have any Boot Media of any kind.&nbsp; I've searched online and seen that a lot of people have this problem and nothing has fixed it short of a completely new reformat/Install
 of Windows, which will cause me to lose my data.&nbsp; Can anyone help with this. please.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I was able to resolve this issue 100%.&nbsp; This issue occurred to me when I ran an update to my Windows 10 yesterday, and then after PC rebooted, I saw the blue screen of death with a message that says, "Choose your keyboard layout", but my keyboard and mouse
 were not functioning so I was not able to choose a keyboard layout at all.&nbsp; This "Choose your keyboard layout" issue seems to be happening all over the place when a user upgrades/updates Windows 10.&nbsp; I'm surprised Microsoft didn't test their Windows 10 updates
 extensively to avoid this very common issue before releasing it to the world.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I did to resolve this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Downloaded the Media Creation Tool, and then ran it on my PC to create an ISO file to burn it to a blank DVD disc. I recommend to use DVD instead of a USB flash drive.&nbsp; I didn't have luck using the USB flash drive because, my PC kept freezing when it
 got to the Repair your computer option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; After the ISO file was burned to the DVD, I then inserted it to my computer's CD/DVD ROM.&nbsp; Turned on my PC, went to the BIOS immediately to boot directly from DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; After my PC booted directly from the CD/DVD ROM drive with the the DVD that contains the installation media disc, I clicked "No" on the first window prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; From there, it then took me to the "Install Windows" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I hovered down to the lower right corner of the "Install Windows" screen, and clicked on the "Repair your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Selected the "Troubleshoot" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; Selected "Restore from the previous build..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; Selected Windows 10 as the target OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.&nbsp; Waited for about twenty minutes while Window was going back to the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.&nbsp; After the previous build was restored, my PC was back to life.&nbsp; No more issues.&nbsp; All my files and installed software were untouched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11.&nbsp; I was backed in business.</p>

            First confirm that you can still access Windows Media Player (assuming that's what you want to use to play mp3 files):&nbsp; click the start Orb and type Windows Media Player in the search box.&nbsp; If you find Windows Media Player, then follow the first set of
 instructions below to associate mp3 files with WMP.&nbsp; If you don't find WMP, go to the section below headed "If Windows Media Player appears to be missing from your system."
<ul>
<li>Find one of your mp3 files.</li><li>Right-click and select "Open with" and when the sub-menu opens, select "Choose default program"</li><li>If Windows Media Player (or your preferred music player) is shown under "Recommended Programs" select it.</li><li>If Windows Media Player (or your preferred music player) isn't included in "Recommended Programs" click the downward-pointing arrow at the right end of the "Other programs" line; if Windows Media Player (or your preferred music player) is shown under "Recommended
 Programs" select it.</li><li>If the program you want isn't listed under either "Recommended Programs" or "Other programs," click the "Browse" button.&nbsp; This should open to C:\Program Files.&nbsp; If you want Windows Media Player, for example, click the directory "Windows Media Player" and
 find the file named wmplayer.exe. Select the file and click "Open". <br />
</li><li>After you have selected the program you want, make sure to check the box at the bottom of the "Open with" screen to "Always use the select program to open this kind of file" and then click OK</li></ul>
<p>If Windows Media Player appears to be missing from your system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</li><li>Click the link at the left to "Turn Windows features on or off"&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>When the "Windows Features" window opens, click the + next to "Media Features"</li><li>Then ensure that there is a check in the box next to "Windows Media Player"&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>If there was no check, check the box, OK your way out, and reboot the computer.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>Now start over from the top of this post.<br />

            I get to where the wmplayer.exe is supposed to be and only find something that says wmplayer. When I click on it and go to open, I am directed to the media player site. That is, the site doesn't download on my "choose file you want to open with" site.
 I clicked on other sites from the windows media site and they download fine. So &nbsp;it is that the wmplayer is connected elsewhere. What do I do? And how do I get rid of new sites now on my play option.&nbsp;

            Your response is very confusing.<br />
<br />
Did you get here (the screen you see should say "File: somename.mp3" rather than what is shown below)?<br />
<br />

<br />
And you didn't find Windows Media Player listed on that screen so you clicked the "Browse" button.&nbsp; Did you then get to this screen?<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fxmgaaq.blu.livefilestore.com%2fy2pK9XIU3Hm3I_KxW2UFLe4niD88Q2FrU8rXoDhATEKnMYfnU-VT_ocuMpJBEoDhsOB-3_3eCKSYvbJ5negTGZfODKNrNnD0T8byyF97a4wekBCZf2xI2EGloH22hB1uSIB%2fOpen%2520with.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
Assuming that you got that far, you should have double-clicked on the "Windows Media Player" folder to get the following screen:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fxmgaaq.blu.livefilestore.com%2fy2pdPvC9dM07qB6Bu2LEB_H0E127TzP5MkvSCBArtEO_yuUVp2CmMLXmIclDnLWNyLmxbZlkGxDIKsWsfZUhBiANDhT2JS3UCvad2cYZWLowpEqj-k0KCr3sE0IBtrbrw2r%2fdirectory%2520view.jpg%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
If you only saw "wmplayer" rather than "wmplayer.exe" that's because your folder settings are configured to "Hide extensions for known file types."&nbsp; That's OK.&nbsp; As long as the dropdown box in the lower right is set to "Programs" (as shown above), the files
 you see are all exe (or similar) files even though the "exe" file extension is hidden.<br />
<br />
Click ONCE on "wmplayer" and then click the "Open" button.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What do you mean that you "are directed to to the media player site"?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You should not go to any "site".&nbsp; If fact, you need not be connected to the Internet when you do all of the above.<br />
<br />
So, what exactly happens when you click the "Open" button as described above?&nbsp; Please provide the complete text of any message or "direction" that you see, without paraphrasing.<br />

    <title>Does the Xbox One use Lossless Audio on Blu-ray and HDMI in&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does the Xbox One use Lossless Audio on Blu-ray and HDMI in&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've noticed that there is no Bitstream option on the Xbox One so I can't look at my receiver and check what the Xbox One is outputting.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if Blu-ray's played back by the Xbox One are in Dolby True HD and DTS Master Audio and then output in LPCM like a normal Blu-ray player does when not Bitstreaming?</p>

<p>Also I have a Samsung 3D Blu-ray Player with a built in Freeview TV Tuner/DVR connected to my Xbox One's HDMI in. If I use that to play my 3D Blu-rays while I wait for 3D Blu-ray's to be added to the Xbox One will the signal going through my Xbox One's HDMI
 in retain it's Bitstreamed lossless audio or is it going to get down sampled by the Xbox One to a lossy format?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The output is the absolutely amazing raw PCM, the X1 does all the decoding for you and saves millions of people the headaches of upgrading receivers to get whatever DTS / DD HD decoder they previously had to get (and no messing with analog outputs)</p>
<p>When I get home, i'll see if my receiver shows the bitrate, but you should be able to validate the bitrate on yours too.</p>

            <p>Hello Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your recommendation that I resort to System Restore.</p>
<p>This is an option I have used in a number of situations. In this case, I was hoping to reverse the process by understanding what caused the pictures and documents to emerge fron their folders in the first place and cover the desktop. What&nbsp;I did was to make
 a new folder and sweep all the pictures into it, and likewise with the documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This took&nbsp;longer, but I am wary of using SR after the last time, on another laptop, when it failed and caused the machine to refuse to boot, a situation so far still unresolved despite several rescue discs being used to do their best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ron&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which port are you using to connect to pop-mail.outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking an interest in my problem. </p>
<p>Here are the ports used by Outlook Express and which have always worked:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff9f3352-e0ba-47a4-91d6-16db5f703d89?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff9f3352-e0ba-47a4-91d6-16db5f703d89?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, pop3.live.com and smtp.live.com servers are reachable and working. </p>
<p>They started working again today.</p>
<p>When this pair of servers stop working, I change the servers to pop-mail.outlook.com and smtp-mail.outlook.com.</p>
<p>I don't change any other settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a66bdadf-1a94-482b-b40a-7f247ff71cb4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a66bdadf-1a94-482b-b40a-7f247ff71cb4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b3fb653-69dc-4f34-957b-50904972da65?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b3fb653-69dc-4f34-957b-50904972da65?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a summary of all the problems to date. The very first time the .live.com servers failed was on July 2nd, so I switched to the "new" .outlook.com servers. They worked for a day. When they failed I switched back to .live.com servers.</p>
<p>Then each pair of servers worked for varying periods of time - from one day to a couple of weeks:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dfcd3e0-1915-4c93-8ec1-2941ab8d6665?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dfcd3e0-1915-4c93-8ec1-2941ab8d6665?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One annoying effect of this problem - apart from having to change the server names in Outlook Express - is that I get old and therefore repeated emails resent to me. The longer the time period that the servers were working before they failed, the more repeated
 emails I get from the alternate servers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's as if both pairs of servers store my emails, and when I have to change to using a new pair because the other pair have failed, the new pair doesn't know I've already received the old emails and sends them to me again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all very frustrating.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how many of you know about this but I was suprised how may of my friends didn't know about it. &nbsp;It's a great rewards system! Just click the link below to sign up, do Bing searches and special events every now and then and you earn Bing Rewards
 Points. You usually earn 1 point per 2 searches up to 15 points per day. &nbsp;You can cache out 125 points to get 100 Microsoft Points! ( You can also get other things like gift cards and months of Xbox Live Gold) &nbsp;I can usually get 100 MS points every 10ish days.
 &nbsp;The stuff adds up quick! You can make a new email account to sign up for Bing Rewards with if you don't want to use your Gamertags email, but since it is with Bing, which is still Microsoft, it isn't a problem. &nbsp;Enjoy the MS points guys!</p>

<p>Yeah I am a fan, but less of one now. After I moved back home I told my family how great it was and got them all signed up. After about three months Bing just up and deleted my families accounts. Have no idea why, we had five accounts total for the household,
 one for each family member, and that is the limit according to Bing. Broke none of the rules. My brother tried to contact Bing and ask why they deleted his account, but you can't contact them unless you have an account. My dad got pizzed off and said screw
 'em and now none of them want anything to do with it. I'm still doing it, since my account was the only one not deleted, but it sure took the fun right out of it. Hate to recommend them to anybody and then have them treat people this way and just deleted accounts
 with hundreds of points in each one.</p>

<p>I thought I would try and cheat the system and make 4 other accounts to rake in Rewards Points and they deactivated the other accounts, I made 4 more and they deactivated them and then my original one. &nbsp;I was fairly upset about it (knowing I was in the wrong)
 so I contacted them through customer support and asked for a second chance and they re-instated my account and gave me a bonus 50 credits. &nbsp;I was very excited, but to be honest I was also quite shocked. &nbsp;If you guys are still interested then I would certainly
 recommend trying to contact support and explain what happened.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>msisadrv.sys</strong> is a system driver file on Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a possibility that there are some errors on the hard drive causing the error message at boot.</p>
<p>To check if there are any bad sectors on the hard drive would suggest running chkdsk which would scan for any bad sectors on the hard drive and if those errors are repairable if would repair and if it cannot at the end of the chkdsk scan you would see a
 message “found one or more unrecoverable error on the hard drive” which means the hard drive is damaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You may run chkdsk from WINRE.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot this issue will run chkdsk from WinRE(<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong> )mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Chkdsk (Chkdsk.exe)</b> is a command-line tool that checks volumes for problems. It runs automatically only if you have any problems. The tool then tries to repair any that it finds. For example, Chkdsk can repair problems related to bad sectors, lost
 clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run check disk, you have to have Windows Vista DVD, boot the computer to Win RE from the elevated command prompt, and try to do a CHKDSK. You can follow these steps to run CHKDSK :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Use the <strong>Windows 7 DVD</strong> to start the computer in
<strong>Windows Recovery (WinRE).</strong></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In WinRE, open a<strong> command prompt</strong>. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.
</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the Windows 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /p </b></p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /r</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Chkdsk disclaimer: </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer to this article. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to open command prompt, you may try to perform System Restore from Windows Recovery Environment and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>What are the system recovery options in Windows?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong></p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry, these consoles are no longer for sale and they have been long discontinued. If you wished to purchase one of these consoles specifically you'd need to look at used game stores or online at a place like eBay but I wouldn't personally recommend it. Original
 consoles like these when sent in for repair are replaced with whatever is in Microsoft's warehouses (usually an Elite console).</p>

<p>Your best bet would be to try a retailer like gamestop to find older consoles, or if you are comfortable with online hardware purchasing ebay or amazon is chock full of these items. &nbsp;Good luck!</p>

    <title>Nothing works after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickdul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nothing works after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I just did the "threshold 2" upgrade in Windows 10. Now, nothing works. I can't open any program, nor Start the menu or the Search panel. Nothing appears in the taskbar either. Windows key+R does open the Run window, but when I try to access the CMD window
 (in the hope of running a system file check), it says "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142)". When I right-click the desktop to access either "Personalize" or "Display seetings" it says "This file does not have a program associated lwith
 it for performing this action. Etc.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be very appreciated.</p>

            <p>To elaborate on the problem, I can't even restart in safe mode or use F8 when rebooting. When I try to restart from the "Ctrl+Alt+Del" menu, the computer doesn't go through the authentification page, but "restarts" very quiclky. I can't even shut down the
 computer. It does the same weird restart.</p>

            I had major problems after the threshold 2 update, only 5 items appeared in the taskbar, nothing would open, tried system restore but wouldn't restart, I couldn't even enter settings to do a system repair, forced restart didn't fix the problem &amp; was resigned
 to a clean install, I unplugged all my peripherals &amp; restarted the device with the usb drive but it restared into windows but this time everything worked, dont know if plugging in the usb windows 10 drive ran a quick repair or wether the problem was one of
 the peripherals.

<p>
</p><p>Just unplug all hardware you have connected to your computer except for any wired keyboard and mouse and try rebooting the PC to see if it works normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, then try reconnecting the peripherals, e.g. Printer, external Hard Drives etc. one at a time.</p>

 works as it should so far.

            <p>Try chatting with a tech support : their answer - your system is not compatible with windows 10. Issues coming due to drivers incompatibility of the hardware. Its a Samsung SF511 6gb I-5. if the system was not compatible then why MS updated it to Win10.
 Failed with phones. Will fail with software too.</p>
