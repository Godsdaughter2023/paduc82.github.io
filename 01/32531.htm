            Hey DaimondsPucko,
<br />
<br />I'm afraid this is not an issue with me. What you can try to do is repair and reset the app. Look for Photos in the Start menu and right-click it, then click App settings. You then click Repair, then once that's done, reset it.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if the above doesn't work, you can also right-click the Start button and click "Windows PowerShell (Admin)", then enter the following:
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage *photos* | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Then reinstall Photos here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJBH4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if this does anything, good luck.

            Thanks for your response, mine was able to repair, there might be something up with your installation of the app.

<br />Have you tried the alternative above with the PowerShell commands?

            DaimondsPucko,
<br />
<br />Thanks for letting me know. This sounds like more of a fundamental issue than the app.
<br />
<br />If you have time to spare, try doing a repair upgrade. This will not delete your files, settings, apps, and so on, this will only repair your current installation.
<br />
<br />You can perform a repair upgrade on Windows by using the Media Creation Tool, here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Once downloaded, select "Upgrade this PC now" and let it perform its magic. Make sure it says it'll keep your files, apps, and settings before the repair upgrade so you don't accidentally perform a reinstall somehow.
<br />
<br />Let me know if anything happens after this. Good luck.

<h2>            Do you own this game or app&#63;  If you have a game disc, insert it now. Otherwise, make sure you&#38;&#35;39&#59;re signed in to Xbox Live.

<p>Bought a digital purchase of Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain about a month ago, and recently I can't play it because the " Do you own this game or app" notifications pops up. Not only this but if I go to the Xbox Marketplace it appears as $59.99 instead
 of install like I haven't bought the game. So I go to my recent purchases and it doesn't appear that I bought, any solutions to this issue?</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Ok, are you signed in to live when you are trying to play it? and I assume you purchased it with your own account seeing as you can see it on the commerce site.</p>
<p>When you look at it on the xbox.com website, does it show as purchased there? </p>
<p>Also worth giving your console a hard reset, which you can do by holding the power button down for 10seconds (when the console is on), until it turns off, leave it for a minute, then turn it on a try again. It may or may not help, but won't hurt trying it.</p>
<p>Failing all of that, I'll have to hand this on to a support agent. At least we have the basic stuff out of the way, so the support agent can pick it up and hopefully know exactly where the issue lies :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Denaz</p>

            <p>Hi Gaverenee,</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your wireless keyboard doesn’t work when you login to the system using Microsoft Account while it works when you login as normal account.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer and wireless keyboard?</li><li>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>If the on-screen keyboard is working fine, then we can confirm that the issue is caused due to any hardware or keyboard settings related issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you have turned on Filter key for the Microsoft account and hence your keyboard is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filter Keys is a Windows feature that ignores keyboard input unless the key is held down for a significant period of time. It’s also triggered when you hold down a button such as SHIFT for 8 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to disable filter key <br />
1. Press Windows + X keys and click on Control Panel.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on Ease of access.<br />
3. Click on change how your keyboard works.<br />
4. Uncheck the option "Turn on filter keys." <br />
5. Click Ok to save changes.</p>

<h2>            Sudden loss of network access</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I am running a new Windows 7 laptop, and am having difficulties staying connected to the internet, both wirelessly and by LAN. &nbsp;After an arbitrary amount of time, my machine loses all internet access, and my network adapter says that my connection has "no
 network access". &nbsp;Automatic troubleshooting has found no problems with either connection. &nbsp;Attempting to disable either adapter during this problem causes Windows Explorer to lock up. &nbsp;Restarting, however, always solves the problem.</p>
<p>My wireless connection is set to automatically obtain an IP address as well as DNS addresses, and my LAN connection is set to a static IP and has a preset DNS. &nbsp;Both suffer the same issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an AtherosAR9287 wireless adapter and a Broadcom NetLink Gigabit Ethernet LAN adapter, both with the latest drivers (at least according to the automatic updater).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Assuming that your Computer is clean of Viruses and Malwares.</p>
<p>==================</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.<br />
<br />
Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />
<br />
TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.<br />
<br />
Typical TCP/IP status looks like this.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong> is the card manufacturing data.<br />
<strong><br />
Physical address</strong> is the card's MAC number.<br />
<br />
The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).<br />
<br />
yy should be from 0 to 255<br />
<br />
zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.<br />
<br />
<strong>The lease date</strong> should be valid to the current time.<br />
<strong><br />
*Note 1.</strong> IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.<br />
<br />
<strong>*Note 2.</strong> There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Also Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called
 the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Still a problem?</strong></p>
<p>Try this process.</p>
<p><strong>WinSock and TCP/IP refresh.</strong> <br />
<br />
When the parasites install themselves on your computer, they might create hooks in the system directing related computing activities to the "Junk" program's files.&nbsp; When you get rid of the "Junk" the hooks might stay in the system, in the absence of the target
 files (they were cleaned out) problems are created in the Network and Internet related activities.<br />
<br />
If after Uninstalling the "Junk" the Internet connection is not working as it should, you have to revive the parts of the OS that get Trashed by the process.<br />
<br />
WinSock and TCP/IP Refresh.<br />
<br />
Type Cmd in the Start Search text box.<br />
<br />
Press Ctrl-Shift-Enter keyboard shortcut to run a&nbsp; Command Prompt as an Administrator.&nbsp; Allow elevation.<br />
<br />
Type <strong>netsh winsock rese</strong> t in the Command Prompt , and then press the Enter key.<br />
<br />
Do the same process for refreshing the TCP/IP just replace the typed command with.<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh interface ipv4 reset</strong> &nbsp; press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh interface ipv6 reset&nbsp;</strong> press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>ipconfig /flushdns&nbsp;</strong> press Enter<br />
<br />
Restart your Computer.<br />

<h2>            Start Menu Shutdown or Sign Out options Not Working Correctly</h2>
                    <p>When I right click on Start and select any of the options, they do not perform the actions they indicate and several are completely broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign Out - Does nothing at all.</p>
<p>Sleep - Computer sleeps, but cannot ever be woken from sleep state. It will PERMANENTLY stay in sleep unless I physically remove the battery.</p>
<p>Shut Down - Will sometimes go into sleep mode and experience the same issues as the Sleep option. Other times it will restart the machine.</p>
<p>Restart - Will shut down the PC most of the time. Sometimes it will just Sign Out instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave the machine on long enough for the power settings to trigger sleep or hibernate, the Sleep issue occurs and I am unable to ever wake it.</p>

            Hi <span>HomeDecorGenie,<br />
<span><br />
Thank you for your submission! To better settle your concern, we will need more information. This will help us correct possible issues with your Windows Live Hotmail account.<br />
<br />
</span><span>• Does the incident happen when accessing your account using webmail?<br />
<br />
• Does the incident happen on a different computer? (If applicable)<br />
<br />
• Does the incident happen on other Windows Live Hotmail accounts being accessed on the same computer?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I havent' tried it on a different computer.<br />
Not sure about other accounts on this computer.&nbsp; No one has used it except me in the last few days.<br />

            Hi&nbsp;HomeDecorGenie,<br />
<br />
<span>I suggest that you optimize your browser. This will serve, as initial troubleshooting that shouldn’t be overlooked. All bases should be covered, and browser efficiency should be ensured since
 Hotmail is a browser dependent service. Check this link out to know how to do this:</span><br />

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c09d2633-bd78-4c8c-accd-d824150245a8" title="ElsLB1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify and ask of you if the same issue&nbsp;is happening when you are using the Skype for Web version as well as using a different internet connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use the Skype for Web version using this link: <a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://web.skype.com</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same would still happen, can you provide a sample screenshot of what is exactly happening on your app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward to your updates. </p>

<p>The problem is there wether I use Skype for Web or the app on my phone, using 4G or the internet connection at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see in the image:</p>
<p>- green: says 'Today'</p>
<p>- red: says 'Has been seen for the last time 4 days ago'</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's difficult in this way to know if someone is available or not</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking the screenshot, there is a yellow clock icon which is the "Away" status. This means that the user manually changed their status from Active indicated by a green dot icon to "Away" status&nbsp;4 days ago which points to the red box.

<p>
</p><p>The green box indicates the date of the conversation which points out why it says "Today". For more information about what statuses are available with the new Skype, you might want to visit this FAQ:

<p>Yes! Finally someone who speaks up against these kinds of people! Let me tell you guys a story: I am 30 years old and have been playing games since I was 6 and got the NES back in December of 1990. My first online attempt with games was Battlefiled 2 on
 PC. I bought it not knowing it was an online only game until I opened it, oops. I played it since I couldn't return it at first having fun until I learned that people could type messages for everyone to see. The range of homophobic, to racial and even threatening
 insults shocked me. I tried to brush it off until one day I said enough. After that I swore to never play an online game ever again. Throughout Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii all my interactions with all those platforms and every fame was single player only. Then I
 got Xbox One. Quickly getting into Destiny when it came out, I slowly got into the habit of leRning to communicate through a headset and playing with people who share the same love of gaming that I do.</p>
<p>In some ways, I felt kind of reborn. I made tens of new friends through that fame and now reflect on how much I'd been missing out on. Then in the crucible, an opposing player killed me then proceeded to stand and crouch, stand and crouch, stand and crouch.
 I hadn't a clue as to what they were doing so I brushed it off. Then it happened again, and again, and again. I asked one of my good friends what was going on and he informed me it was a form of taunting jerks do when they kill someone known as t-bagging.
 I won't go into the exact definition as I'm sure you all know what it means yet nevertheless when I bought Battlefield Hardline I went in hoping, praying in fact that this game did not have a kill cam. It did. I prayed again that I wouldn't run into t-naggers.
 I did. This insulting, insensitive, immature and inappropriate behavior has become an epidemic like a rampant zombie outbreak. Infect very, very angry when someone does it to me since I gave killed about as equal as I have died and yet I have never, never,
 never did that to another player.</p>
<p>I know who it feels to be on the receiving end of gloating as if they're mocking your playing skills and rubbing it in your face. More importantly it's stupid to be a sore winner. Yes, it is a competition of sorts and yes in first person shooters you are
 supposed to kill the enemy but in flies in the face of showmanship, very much lik when Samuel L. Jackson made a face and cursed upon learning he did mot win the supporting actor Oscar for jus work in Pulp Fiction. Yes Mr. Jackson, there is a camera on ALL
 the nominees faces when the envelope is opened. I noticed that this trend is more common in M rated games which is ironic since M rated games are supposed to be made up of adults although I find mostly kids and teenagers are into this stupid fad. Never mind
 what this says about their parents parenting skills, it's downright rude to do and quite literally I'm sick of it. Since playing this game, I have sent messages to each and every person that has exhibited this activity essentially telling them what I am telling
 you here but in a shorter sense. </p>
<p>All but one has either defended their actions as free choice or free speech or simply sent me homophobic or racial slurs, or threats against me and me family. I meanwhile got furious by the Rangers and stupidly tried to match wits with them by talking back.
 That thus far had only banned me from all communications for a week. The main point of this reply to this post is relatively simple. We play games to have fun, not be bullied. I am spreading the word right here right now that the honest gamers who play the
 games ethically are sick of a few bad eggs who poison the whole experience for us. Yeah I've probably died several hundred times in this game and about 95% of those times the kill cam shows the opponent continuing to play the game as normal. So either we convince
 every online shooting based gaming company to kill the kill cam or we take my suggested measures.
</p>
<p>So far I noticed sending said person messages saying their act is wrong does not work. I have reported every last t-bigger to Xbox feedback but unfortunately there is no way to check if that gamer has in fact received a suspension or not, I just asked through
 the chat option with an ambassador. So unless we all manage to start some anti-bullying campaign, I doubt there is anything else we can do. If anything I know exactly how you feel fury x assassin. It happens all too often and mostly seems to go unpunished.
 If I can offer some advice it's this: don't bother t-bagging back. Two wrongs don't make a right so all you'll be doing is enforcing such behavior, spreading the word like that smile dog creepypasta. You can try telling them they're acting selfish but that
 usually backfires but if they respond to you in a way that violates the code of conduct then I would definitely report not only the message with a detailed description but also their unsporting behavior also with a detailed description.
</p>
<p>Also always block anyone who acts to you in such a manner. Thus far I have never seen another player return to bully me through another name yet in any case just block and report them again. Never under any circumstance start out with a rude message as that'll
 be all the excuse the person needs to report YOUR conduct and get YOU into unnecessary trouble. And if you do decide to message them in a civil manner, do not flip out if they rage on you. That again only pleases them to know they're succeeding in their harassment
 which is exactly what they want. Don't give them what they want. Remember the saying that two wrongs don't make a right. It's been proven. In closing let me say that I am aware that Microsoft cannot stop people from bullying yet I do hope they can take appropriate
 action when it unfortunately happens. Also know fury x assassin that you are not alone in your frustration. There are plenty of honest gamers out there so try to find people you can relate to, stick by them like glue and just shut out the aggressors. To anyone
 who reads this post in full. I thank you for your time and hope to see you on the battlefield.</p>

<p>^Reporting t-baggers to Xbox enforcement team does nothing. It doesn't go against any rules. At most you can leave negative feedback on that person but that doesn't really seem to do much either. It's supposed to eventually lower someone's rep to bad and
 force them to play with other players with bad rep but no idea if it actually works and how much the person has to receive negative feedback. Not to mention, I have a hard time believing they'd actually care enough about t-bagging when there's so much worse
 behaviour out there. Blocking them does nothing either as they are free to enter the same server with you again. You just won't be getting messages from them but then again you shouldn't be getting any messages from them to begin with unless you provoke them
 by sending a complaining message to them.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you can't beat them, just join them. See someone who always t-bags you? Kill that person and t-bag them back. T-bagging has always been there and will forever be. If you can't take it, I'm afraid you need to switch to another genre or find a shooter
 where you can't crouch.</p>

<p>Yeah I know what you mean man. I personally don't care if Microsoft doesn't consider it a major offense but in any case I am still reporting them just for the sake of having it on record. I tend to find through my messaging them immediately afterward, nearly
 everyone who does in fact do said act are a majority of the time a selfish jerk in real life. To do it on someone who they just run into and kill is severely unwarranted. However if said deceased victim has been resorting to cheap tactics or formally shows
 a grudge or vendetta against you by targeting you specifically, than maybe, and I mean the term maybe in its exact definition, it would be justified. Yet me on the other hand find people just do it to me with the benefit that no other member of my team is
 around to kill them so they pounce on the opportunity to taunt without fear of leaving themselves open.</p>
<p>I personally never resorted to any tactics or behavior while in this game that would make me deserving of such a thing so every time it has happened it just enfuriates me to the core. As if these abusers have nothing better to do than bully complete strangers
 they do not know in real life and most likely never will. Even if I see someone on my own team degrading an enemy, I frown upon that as well. But you Sipuli91 do make a valid point that it is just that, a frowned upon act. Very much like not tipping a waitress,
 unless she served you in a questionable manner, it's not like whatever restaurant you are in will ban you from entering there ever again. Very much like with this stupid trend mostly going untreated through the code of conduct policies. In any case I am still
 remaining vigilant and will continue to inform people that it's not the kind of thing to be proud of doing. I've been reprimanded like I've said before for acting out through messaging so lesson learned,</p>
<p>Hopefully by exposing these people for who they really are by raging, maybe then Microsoft can intervene as part of enforcing their code of conduct. But for every bad player out there let it be known that there are mostly good ones compared. The bad ones
 probably do this on a regular basis so I doubt that one day they just snapped and went on a t-bagging agenda, no, they are idiots all the time and they are probably never going to stop being idiots. Looking back on my post and your reply I can agree that we
 can't just deal with all these annoying people head on. In regards to the gamer who created this topic and anyone else who is fed up I will say that you should just try and enjoy the game by focusing on the many positive players and shut out the negative ones.
 As for the blocking system I would like to know if it's only limited to matchmaking a blocked person in the same team as yours or also the opposing team. If Microsoft could implement that in a future update, then we would never have to deal with an abusive
 player ever again. Are you sure Sipuli91 that the blocking system lets people continue to be in a same match as you? Cause if so then it's a broken flaw that really needs to be fixed.</p>

            <p>It really depends on the laptop hardware more than Windows itself. Any capacitive screen pen will work but generally speaking that applies to the rubber tipped pen which will not have the focus of a pointed tip stylus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because it is touch screen does not automatically mean it will support a focused stylus tip, Sony are the only ones that would be able to confirm that other than trial and error.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Sticky Notes 3.0 update won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael vansickle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Sticky Notes 3.0 update won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to update to the latest version of Microsoft Sticky Notes on my Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; I have 4 computers, and all of them except the Surface automatically updated from version 2 to version 3.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling and re-installing the app, and
 even though the Microsoft Store shows me version 3, I keep getting version 2.&nbsp; I have tried removing the app with Powershell and re-installing, I've tried to reset the Microsoft Store (wsreset.exe) and II've tried "pushing" the app from another computer -
 keep getting version 2!&nbsp; I have deleted the "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\MicrosoftSticky...." folder multiple times hoping it would force a re-install and I keep getting version 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone think of anything I haven't tried?&nbsp; Thanks!!</p>

<p>3) Do you get any error message on the computer regarding the Ethernet Network Adapter?</p>
<p>4) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue. Let us first run the Network and Network Adapter Troubleshooters and check if that provides any useful information regarding this issue.</p>

When I connect LAN Wire to the computer it tries to identify the network and a yellow caution mark is showed on left bottom side of the Network icon<br />
<br />
No error message regarding Ethernet Network Adapter<br />
<br />
Prior to the issue there was a windows update other than that nothing much.<br />
<br />
Method 1</p>
<p>I tried all the methods for troubleshooting, the result was the same- "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".<br />
<br />
Method 2</p>
<p>I re-installed my network adapter 2-3 times to no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Update icon gone</h2>
                    The Windows Update icon is gone and so is the little box that should allow me to return all the system icons to default and recover it. Windows 7. Can't update. Is there any way to fix short of returning to factory-new and reinstalling everything? My computer's
 manufacturer recommends that I NOT upgrade to windows 10.

<p>I may not be understanding your question, but here's a possibility based on what I think I'm understanding: Click on the Start orb, type "Windows Updates" (without quotation marks) in the search box, open WU that way. You may also be able to drag the icon
 from there to your desktop. If I'm not understanding your problem, my apologies.</p>

Thanks for trying! No, it's the little update icon - it looks sort of like a miniature planet Saturn - in the system tray that's missing, and without it, I can open Windows Update in the Control Panel, but Windows Update can't download and install any updates
 unless that icon is available in the system tray! Once before, it disappeared, but I was able to recover it by clicking on the little arrow box next to the system icons and tell it to restore the defaults. This time, that little arrow box in the system tray
 is gone as well, and without it I can't get the update ion back in the system tray.

<p>Just for the hey of it, I opened my WU; you're right, the little "Saturn-like" icon doesn't show up in the system tray -- I hadn't even noticed that. I clicked on "Check for updates"; it checked, and a Windows Defender update came in a few minutes later,
 and I was able to download and install it, without the icon in the system tray. I'm telling you this so that you can use it as a comparison with your issue -- don't know if it'll help any, but I hope so.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you go to the "Notification Area Icons" place in Control Panel, I'll bet you'll find the Windows Update icon is still in there, but hidden, which still allows you to download and install updates. Mine is GONE as in not there anywhere. Trying to
 download and install any updates is futile. I select an update, tell Update to download and install it, and select the OK box. Windows immediately returns to Windows Update and nothing happens, because Update will not function without that @#$% icon. &nbsp;I need
 a fix for that!</p>

I finally contacted Windows Support for help with this issue. The tech was able, while controlling my computer, to go out into DOS and stop and then start the Windows Update service. When he did, the Update icon returned to the system tray and all updates since
 have gone smoothly. I would NOT recommend doing this on your own unless you have a high level of experience.

<p>I'm so glad you came back here and posted the outcome.&nbsp; I only have the WU icon while I'm doing any updates (Windows Defender, primarily, between 2nd-Tuesday updates), but I have a shortcut icon on my desktop and I'm able to open WU there and check for updates
 or&nbsp;by typing it into search and opening it that way.&nbsp; The main difference was that I am able to check for updates and yours wouldn't allow you to.&nbsp; I was wondering if something had&nbsp;disabled your WU and that was why you couldn't check, but I'd have no idea
 where to find that out!&nbsp; Glad that it worked out for you!</p>

    <title>Child Account Setup on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Child Account Setup on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to migrate my child's Microsoft/windows account from windows 8.1 to windows 10.&nbsp; I've followed the steps on the Microsoft family site but the process is not working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: I signed into the PC that was just updated to windows 10 under his login.&nbsp; Went to settings, accounts, and selected to sign in with Microsoft account instead and was successful in doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS family website said that after this step was complete return to the web site to proceed with step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:&nbsp; Enter the email address from step 1 above and hit send.&nbsp; I did this.&nbsp; The site then says that the invitation has been sent to my child's account.&nbsp; Once the invitation has been accepted I can then move to step 3.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the website says the invitation has been sent.&nbsp; But where to?&nbsp; I've logged into my kids outlook.com mail and there's nothing there.&nbsp; So I can not proceed to Step 3.&nbsp; What am I missing?</p>

<h2>            Red Dead Redemption won&#39;t finish downloading after 4 attempts. Gets to 98&#37; and then stops</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried 4 times now to download Red Dead Redemption. Each time it almost finishes and then says, "Can't download Red Dead Redemption." I have downloaded other large games just fine with no problems at all. Is there any support service that can actually
 look at my account and tell me what the error is? Or can I just get a refund and I will get the disc version instead of the downloadable one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>

 Print preview is typically located on the File menu for a program. You should be able to preview each page of the document. In some programs, you can choose print options in the preview mode, and then print directly from the preview. In other programs, you
 might have to close the preview, change the document or your printer settings, and then print it.</font></font></span></p>

            Specifically the metro apps like mail and maps. To get to the print feature I learned you need to use crtl-P. In choosing the printer to use it doesn't use the printer dialogue we are used to seeing and I haven't found a way to choose print preview or
 select the pages to print. Also in Bing News I was trying to print an article and find no way to do it. Very strange this metro interface.
