<h2>            Unable to use RATTV3. Logging fails with a Kernel-EventTracing Error with EventID 2</h2>
                    I'm trying to troubleshoot some&nbsp;intermittent&nbsp;performance problems on my new install of Windows 8 Professional. I ran dpclat and found that I have an average latency of 1000us.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand that this is generally caused by a misbehaving driver, so I'm trying to identify it by running RATTV3. Unfortunately I can't get this to work at all. &nbsp;After the first loop after I installed it I got the following error in my event logs.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not download and install language packs and doesn&#39;t give explanation</h2>
                    <p>As stated above in Windows 10 when I try to install languages it gives me an error, and when I click on that error, it won't tell me what is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So here is the workflow in pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;First I click to install. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d4efe66-026a-4152-9ecb-ff68c0f6eb42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d4efe66-026a-4152-9ecb-ff68c0f6eb42" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it fails.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47b928fc-6156-4bf6-8127-08d2cc519e8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47b928fc-6156-4bf6-8127-08d2cc519e8a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I try to see what happened and get to this screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/faa4046b-388d-4093-966d-048fab4ede37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/faa4046b-388d-4093-966d-048fab4ede37" /></a></p>
<p>Then after&nbsp;clicking on more details, it just takes me to optional&nbsp;features<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d85a07a2-aae6-4932-bb36-d3ae48648650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d85a07a2-aae6-4932-bb36-d3ae48648650" /></a></p>
<p>Not sure what happened, not sure how I can fix it or find out what happened.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that after upgrading to Windows 10 operating system your computer is not detecting and installing the HP Printer. I will certainly help you in getting this fixed. I would appreciate if you could help me with more
 information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this a wired printer or wireless printer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to tell you that you have to make sure that the printer is enabled in “devices and printer” by following below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press “<strong>Windows key</strong>”, click on “<strong>Settings</strong>”</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong>Devices</strong>”, now click on “<strong>Printer &amp; Scanners</strong>” in the left pane</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong>Devices and Printers</strong>”</span></li><li><span>Right click on the printer and “<strong>Enable</strong>” it, Now try to use the printer.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 1in">
</p><p><span>There might be a possibility that while upgrading/installing Windows 10, printer drivers might get corrupt. Hence you are facing issues while printing. I would suggest you to follow the below methods and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span>:<span>&nbsp; </span>
Printer Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The built-in Printer Troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings and errors that could cause issues while printing. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if there is any issue while printing. Refer
 top these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Control Panel</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select the <strong>view all</strong> option on the left pane.</li><li>Click on <strong>Printer</strong> troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try method 2, if the issue persist</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: Uninstall the Printer's Drivers</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Click on “Device Manager” from that list.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Search for the Printer from the device list, right click on it and then select “Uninstall”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “Delete the driver software for this device” you may select that and then remove
 the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and then restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the restart, please go ahead with the next steps to install the latest drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Peggle 2 Add-On</h2>
                    
<p>I paid and downloaded the Owl Add-on for Peggle 2.&nbsp; It doesn't show up in the game.&nbsp; I go to the purchase screen and it says its installed.&nbsp; When I go to that icon in upper left that shows all recent notifications, it says it downloaded and to press to play.&nbsp;
 When I do, it says its unavailable.&nbsp; I can still load game from game list, but add-on isn't there.&nbsp; Only $1.99 so no big deal but anyone know what happened?&nbsp; Hope this isn't what to expect with this console.</p>

<h2>            Windows Journal functionality issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I open a windows journal file at a small zoom level, I only see the top three lines of the document:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e47bc7f4-4700-41d2-937d-f46ee29c7034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e47bc7f4-4700-41d2-937d-f46ee29c7034" height="256" width="246" /></a></p>
<p>... when I increase the zoom level, all the rest is vissible as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb02f51-8b77-42e3-b7d2-bbabdab26899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb02f51-8b77-42e3-b7d2-bbabdab26899" height="301" width="279" /></a></p>
<p>This happens on three different computers in the same way. They all run Windows 10 with all updates.</p>
<p>Has someone an idea for that?</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I have the latest version of windows journal:</p>

<p><span>Hi Cherylwycoff,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the following methods and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Anti-virus scan.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Scan your computer for viruses with your antivirus software and see if it is some malware that is causing this popup</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>MS Safety Scanner Disclaimer: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner is a scan tool designed to find and remove malware from Windows computers. Download it, run a scan to find malware and try to reverse changes made by identified threats.<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Disable VPN Network Adapter.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>Start</strong> .</span></p>
</li><li>

</li></ol>
<p><span>After disabling the first adapter, check if the issue still persists. If it fixes the issue, no other adapters have to be disabled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong><strong><span>Give permission to the apps to pass Windows Firewall manually</span><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>control panel</strong> and then select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>

<h2>            WSAPPX&#40;2&#41; - Windows store error</h2>
                    <p>Original title: WSAPPX(2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a windows 10 update and my computer now starts with a black screen. &nbsp;In looking at the Task Master this program - wsappx(2) shows up and seems to be hogging my processor and keeping me from getting to the desktop. &nbsp;This process deals with Microsoft
 Store and was for Windows 8. &nbsp;When I tell it to end process it immediately goes to desktop BUT this is a temporary fix as when I shut down and reboot the problem reappears. &nbsp; How can I delete this malicious and frustrating download since I do not have a restore
 point nor can I go back to Windows 8.2 as I am over the 30 day period? &nbsp; I have tried several command options and it appears Microsoft does not have a fix to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Gary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We are glad to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the methods given below and check if it works:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For better understanding of the issue, please reply to the following questions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>How did you install Windows 10? Did you do a clean install or upgraded?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>How are you connected to Internet? Is it a wired connection or a wireless connection?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you installed all updates?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This p</span><span>rocess is related to the windows store and is a program that runs in the backgrounds to keep track of the apps you have installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would suggest you to keep task manager
<strong>on</strong> when you start your computer and kill it once it appears. It will take two to three kills before it stops restarting itself.<br />
Also, note that it will usually start automatically when you link to a wireless network - you will have to do the 2 or 3 kills again after connecting to the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Feel free to get back to us for further queries. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>I have responded but no one got back to me - can you please use<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> my email address</span> and NOT this forum as I have difficulty finding answers to my questions etc. &nbsp;My email address is
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 from a link and upgraded from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>The install was done on my All In One computer and not this desktop.</p>
<p>Afterwards my Kaspersky also had numerous problems. &nbsp;Those were fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a wireless router with high speed cable connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the updates from Microsoft, Windows etc have all been accepted and installed as far as I know. &nbsp;I very much DISLIKE the fact that Microsoft can upload data into my computer whenever they feel like it and NOT let me schedule any of this. &nbsp;I am a professional
 and get huge downloads to work with on my home computer - they get interrupted and often I waste time waiting and then trying again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since this upgrade I notice the windows icon (start) in the lower left corner is difficult to open on that computer and does not give me the same options (all apps, power.....) that my other computers offer - all using windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any support you can give me. &nbsp;The computer had a black screen and would not boot into my desktop.</p>
<p>I opened task manager and found part of the issue to be this wsappx(2) program taking over my system. &nbsp;I could not delete it - I use a bypass and at least can get into the desktop. &nbsp;EVERY SINGLE TIME I power down and restart this happens - frustrating. &nbsp;Please
 respond to my email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely</p>

            <p>None of the suggested options helped me in getting my All In One to boot properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AS I STATED - this wsappx(2) program is related to Microsoft Store - an app I did not want on my computer. &nbsp;This program runs in start up and takes over my Task Manager and keeps my computer from opening properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to delete this item three times and then my computer boots ok - as long as I do not turn it off I am fine. &nbsp;If I turn it off the nastiness of Microsoft and it's hidden programs reappears. &nbsp;This issue reminds of how insidious AOL was in loading its
 program into almost every nook and cranny it could so you could never seem to delete it fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will figure this out as it seems the Microsoft team is having its own hard issues. &nbsp;Why do they push out products on unsuspecting users when all the issues have not been resolved. &nbsp;Just once I wish they would remember how great Windows 7 and 98 were -
 that was why people kept them on their machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to rant but it seems like we end users dont seem to have a choice anymore in what invades our systems.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reply.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b) If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Run <strong>System File Checker</strong> (sfc) scan.</span></span></p>

<p>Please be more specific.</p>
<p>Was your gamertag changed automatically and costed money or do you want to change it but it cost money?</p>
<p>If it is because you want to change it but it cost money, It was your fault in the first place for violating Xbox's Terms of Service, Next time make sure to choose a more appropriate gamertag.</p>

    <title>Editing the registry of a WIM Image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hanso_l0w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing the registry of a WIM Image</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we begin, I am aware that "Microsoft does not support changing the location of the Program Files folder by modifying the ProgramFilesDir registry value"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that if you change this after Windows is installed you get an error with applications like IE as Windows looks in the wrong place for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need help with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 64GB SSD and a 500GB HDD in my laptop and I would like to install only Windows on the SSD and all program files on the HDD.</p>
<p>I would like to do this by modifying the OEM install.wim registry before installing Windows so that all paths are written properly to Windows and so that applications such as IE will install to the HDD and not create errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have copied the install.wim file to D: (No DVDRom in my MicroFormFactorPC) on my AIK computer and I have I have mounted the registry using DISM to a mount folder on C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the drive letter of the mounted image reflects D: which is the source location. How can I disassociate the folders? It must be possible as I know that Microsoft makes use of %ProgramFiles% %SystemRoot% etc to "dynamically update/identify"
 paths. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Which registry keys can I edit to make this more rigid and to ensure that the Windows folder and the Program Files folders are not expanded to the same drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your interest on windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed, I would like you to answer the following question:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Do any &nbsp;receive any error message while accessing<span>&nbsp;
</span>start menu or search option on the task bar?</span></span></li></ol>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This is a known issue that may occur when you first install build 9926 of Windows 10 Technical Preview. You may find a fix for the issue by checking for Windows Updates.
 To do this without the Start menu:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Tap or click the Internet Explorer icon.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type </span><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://update.microsoft.com</span></span></strong></a><span> into the address bar
 and hit Enter.</span></span></li><li><span><span>If you are prompted to run a control, click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>This should bring up the Check for Updates window. Install updates.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If no update is available, or the available updates don’t resolve the issue, reboot the device. The Start menu should come back. To reboot without using the Start
 menu:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Hold down the Windows key and press L to Lock the device. Swipe up or press Enter to get the log in screen. Use the Power icon on the log in screen to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
OR</span></span></li><li><span><span>Hold down the Windows key and press R to get a Command Prompt. At the prompt, type
<strong>shutdown –r</strong> to reboot the device.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>You may be able to correct this by re-registering the package. Run a Powershell script using the following steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press Ctrl+Alt+Del. Select <strong>
Task Manager</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, select
<strong>Run new task</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type <strong>powershell</strong>, put a check mark next to
<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong> and tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Paste or type the following at the Powershell prompt, and hit Enter:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If none of these solutions are working, please check that your User Account Controls are set to the default recommended settings.&nbsp; You can find this control by going
 to <strong>Settings</strong> and searching for “<strong>User Account Control</strong>”. &nbsp;Once the control page opens, set it to “<strong>Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer</strong>” and click
<strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, make sure you’re using an administrator account, and that you are not on a child, guest or standard user account when attempting these solution steps.&nbsp; To check
 this, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt;<strong>Other user accounts</strong>.&nbsp; This will list all the active users and whether they have administrator privileges. &nbsp;If you’re current account is not an administrator account, you’ll
 need to sign out and then sign into one of the existing administrator accounts listed.&nbsp; From there, go back to this page, click the entry for the account you were using, click
<strong>Edit</strong>, and then switch the account to Administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>you can also refer to the suggestion by Ravinath P from the following link for more information.</span></p>

    <title>Canon MG5450 - Windows 7 NT 4.0 Driver Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalefinnegan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon MG5450 - Windows 7 NT 4.0 Driver Error</h2>
                    <p><u>Here's my issue I'm having:</u></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought a MG5450 2 days ago and began setting it up yesterday however stumbled across an issue where the printer driver would not install regardless of the compatibility setting. Being as it's a newly released printer I thought the drivers would be up to
 date and new, however I think there may be a issue with NT 4.0 driver policy as when I try to install the drivers through the device manager, it gives me that message that there's a policy in place stopping me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows update always fails when trying to install the printer, however the scanner, and software included all work fine. I can scan images on wirelessly and have them saved on my computer without an issue, however there is no way to print.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried disabling the policing through the 'MSC' and adding a local group policy or something along those lines. However none of this has worked. How can I get the driver to install or disable the policy to allow the printer to be installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Running Windows 7 Ultimate 64x</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tried installation of the drivers both through wireless and wired, both come to the same outcome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any other information needed, then please ask.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><u>I have tried the following:</u></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>No.1 - Tried&nbsp;</span><span>compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;setti</span>ngs to which they failed and said was no compatible with my operating system</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>No.2 - Disabled the option 'Disallow for kernel drivers to be installed' I have disabled this in the Registry and another method (Something.msc)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No.3 - I have downloaded Canon's up to date Windows 7 64x drivers from their website, and the drivers still fail</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No.4 - Windows update finds the driver find, installs and then fails</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No.5 - Tried the 'Add Printer' function and that's where the NT 4.0 message appears.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>I am complete stuck and baffled by this issue!<br />
<br />
Dale.</b></p>

            Hi Vinod,<br />
<br />
I have been through all the support and information given by Canon on trying to fix this problem. I have routed the problem down to my own version of Windows 7, as my current version of Windows 7 Ultimate gives me the NT 4.0 driver issue. However on a secondary
 partition the printer installed fine, including on my other laptop running Windows Professional the drivers installed fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think it's simply down to a past driver issue or hardware issue that has changed my version of Windows to not support the drivers however a fresh install or another version works fine.<br />
<br />
<b>My Solution:</b>&nbsp;<span> </span>
Needed a fresh installation of Windows, something corrupted or went wrong on my current version which is Windows 7 Ultimate 64x SP1 to stop the driver from installing. Whether there is actually a method to fix the issue I am unsure as I have tried everything
 possible to let printer drivers freshly install.<br />
<br />

    <title>Epson Perfection 1650 Scan or Scan Print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markwebber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Perfection 1650 Scan or Scan Print</h2>
                    <p>This problem has gone on for about 1 to 2 years. Epson never has given a 64 bit driver for this scanner. They no longer even provide their perfectly good scan utility and now only provide scan/print utility which does work in a 64 bit environment. The problem
 is the Twain5 driver that once worked in VISTA 64bit is no longer recognized. I should point out the 64 bit version was written by some third party but they never bothered to repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the TWAIN5 driver is missing a "hash" therefore will not even install whether it works or not. The scanner should have stopped working after I upgraded to Win7 64bit. Some 3rd party provided the 64 bit driver and it worked for Win7 and Win10
 till some time mid 2017. Every time Win10 had a major update I had to uninstall and reinstall Epson Scan utility and the Twain5 driver but not after mid 2017. I had a lot of Office 2007 updates at that time and I wonder if my old Office is the problem. I have
 another laptop with Win10 Home on it without any type of Office on it so I'll try to install it on that and post the results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I got Win7 Ultimate 64 bit because it had the Virtual XP and compatibility mode that worked better than the Home version. The upgrade to Win10 Pro I was hoping would make up for the Virtual XP loss with advanced compatibility mode but it has failed here.&nbsp;There
 is no compatibility mode for 16 bit drivers for old Windows 98 games as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fully aware of the security issues Microsoft has trying to keep back doors closed with old programs which is the reason they have supplied the Win10 upgrade for free to Win7 OS owners. Just the same I am suspicious over the Epson 1650 Twain5 driver
 missing a hash that is not compatible with Win8.2 and above. The scanner simply doesn't communicate certain variables like the new scanners. I noticed this with Microsoft's provided Fax/scan program with Win10. The scanner doesn't allow for the new programming
 to communicate or tunnel through for the settings now does it? To make this happen it opens the back door to hackers doesn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of 3rd party virtual programs and having a multi boot partitioned system so I'm not looking for answers there. Point of interest I remember WinXP Pro allowed for private owners to install as many instances of the OS on as many computers they wanted
 to. Then they set a number like 3 computers and now only one computer. Am I remembering this right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of Hamrick Industries VueScan utility. I know it works but you have to pay them $50 a year for the darn thing to work without that watermark. Might as well buy a new one for that price. I suspect the same people made that 64bit driver a while
 back but got smart and realized they were sitting on a gold mine. Their driver only works with VueScan and no other. They must have had to completely re-write the macro and scramble it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not too well versed on the subject but any insight would be interesting as I have wanted this scanner to work again for a very long time on my main computer. Getting my old XP computer to share files with the Win10 computer isn't working out either so
 any help there would be good. Trying to find the original Epson Scan for 32 bit systems seems to be lost to time as well. I don't want to use the scan/print program as I need to have a printer attached to the old XP computer. Epson's Scan/print will not work
 unless both the printer and scanner are attached directly. Yes Microsoft's Fax/scan works on XP with the scanner but it forgets the setting every time you&nbsp;scan.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the compatibility and updated drivers of your printer, we recommend contacting the manufacturer of your device for further assistance.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for other Windows concerns.

            I will vote this as the worst answer I have ever received. You never read my question and do I really need to advise you on this? Don't give answers to things you don't understand. You are not only risking your career but the quality and reputation of
 Microsoft. Are you new to this country and get this job with a H-1B VISA?

<p>OK, so cant update my xbox, and therefore cant play online.</p>
<p>Code it C000-0001 which by there eyes is I've modded my Xbox. Ok yes I"ve got a new drive(cause XBOX told me it would cost 150$ compared to 20$), but I have never modded, never bought or downloaded a stolen game, and I've been a XBOX live custumer since
 day one (look me up E mortal) </p>
<p>Now I&nbsp;cant get help, cant get online, what support tells me (all the way up past manager) is to buy a new XBOX, are you kidding! I've been playing/paying XBOX live since day one, paid for over 50+games.
</p>
<p>In my eyes&nbsp;I've got a car, got an oil change at the local oil place, and my car stoped working 1 year later, and the dealer told me just to buy a new car.</p>
<p>Thats my rant, hope everone else isnt dealing with the same issue, cause I know your pain!!</p>

<p>Technically, you have modded your console.</p>
<p>Installing a new disc drive is modifying the original equipment. Although you haven't inserted any special chips or custom OS, it still counts that as a mod.</p>
<p>It's really a bad move on Microsofts part, having something like this treated like such, &nbsp;but all they can tell from their end is that the console has been opened and tampered with.</p>
<p>Sorry dude...</p>

<p>As an IT support professional, simply replacing a failed HDD with another compatible industry standard model should not be construed as modifying nor would it need to be if MS included suitable system tools to format the replacement HDD with their proprietary
 console HDD format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As much as I like the 360 platform (it's my preferred console), this is plain &amp; simple a money grab to force consumers to buy over-priced hardware (ie. standard PC/laptop parts in custom MS cases).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one area where I feel that Sony's PS3 design is superior to MS's 360 platform. Let me head of the PS3 haters by saying that Sony's network security on the other hand is NOT superior to MS's XBL platform (based on known information at this time).</p>

<p>Maybe they should have giving me a new XBOX instead of the faulty one they had given me. If they had I would not be in this postion now. I see it as if my home computers dvd drive stoped working, I would go out and get a new one. In this case MS told me
 a new drive would be 150$ plus taxes, so instead I got a new drive for 20$ </p>

<p>What's being consistently overlooked is that Microsoft has spent millions, if not billions, researching, designing, testing and producing a product that they own the patents and all associated content for. &nbsp;They are simply trying to protect this investment.
 &nbsp;Put yourself in their shoes for a moment and think about how you would feel if you had put time, money and energy into a product only to have someone come along and essentially "piggyback" on your hard work.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are that Microsoft has produced a consumer product at their expense, they are protecting this investment and product with a ToU and CoC, you must agree to said Terms and Code if you wish to use this product online, failure to do so
 can have undesirable consequences for the user, users are responsible for their own actions and negative consequences of not following a contract that they agreed to.</p>
<p>If the user disagrees with Microsofts rules or business practices, they are free to buy any other product they desire, no one is forcing them to buy an XBox. &nbsp;</p>

            Kania, previous to the Windows 10 conversion, my solution was for my wife to use Outlook and for me to use Mozilla Thunderbird.&nbsp; I have used Thunderbird for years and don't have problems with it.&nbsp; My solution after the conversion was to allow my wife to
 use the new Windows 10 email and I reverted back to using Mozilla Thunderbird.&nbsp; It's not the optimum solution, but it works ok for us.

            I uninstalled Office 365 as well and yes, it did then work, for a couple of days.&nbsp; Now, it is back to not synching.&nbsp; Frustrating.&nbsp; Emails show up on my iPhone (for my Outlook.com) account but never on my SP4 unless I open it and "sync".&nbsp; Must be something
 to do with Office 365 interfering with syncing somehow.

<h3> hintsa sandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Support Chat</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I need your assistance with something. I recently purchased a 12-Month&nbsp;Xbox Live Gold card from Amazon (the one with the 25-character code). But, the code will not work. I've tried redeeming the code on my Xbox and even on the Xbox website. I get
 a message saying 'This code has already been used", which it hasn't (unless I was scammed).</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Anyway, on to my main problem; I've tried contacting Xbox support, on the live chat, to speak with support staff about the issue and hopefully get it resolved, but there is one HUGE problem. When it's time to submit a description
 of the problem, along with my name, I cannot input my name into the required field; the areas are greyed out. But, your name must be inputted for you to submit your problem. Therefore, I cannot contact Microsoft staff, or have them contact me. This is incredibly
 frustrating. Does any one know why this may be happening? Does it have to do with my region (Trinidad &amp; Tobago)? Though I doubt it would.<br />
<br />
Things I've tried to resolve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used the latest version of these&nbsp;other browsers (Firefox, Opera, Edge and Internet Explorer) - the issue persists.</li><li>Cleared the cache and other data on these browsers - the issue persists.</li><li>Tried using UC Browser on my mobile phone - this actually allowed me to input my name, but after I hit 'submit', nothing else happens.</li></ul>
<p>I'm completely stumped, and I do not want $60 to go down the drain. Can any of you guys help me, at all? Thanks.</p>

            Sounds like the DVD laser has died.&nbsp; Optical drives have two lasers, one for the CD side and one for the DVD side.&nbsp; It it will read CDs but not DVDs, and you are sure the disks themselves are not dirty/scratched etc, then the DVD laser could have died.&nbsp;
 Replace the drive.

<h2>            &#34;your computer could not start.&#34; Startup repair will try to repair your problem. </h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 7 Professional Upgrade, using custom install to make a clean install. When starting up, the Windows logo starts to come on, but stops with just 3 color dots and doesn't complete. I ran a diagnostic, and it said it was timing
 out because of the driver for my coprocessor. It gave me a link to my Nvidia driver and downloaded it. It seemed to help a little, but I still get an error when I start up. I first get the freezing logo, and then when I restart, I get a startup repair screen
 that says "your&nbsp;computer could not start." Startup repair will try to repair your problem. After that, it starts. The only problem is, I have to do this everytime I startup my computer.

<span>Hi Bobbyk1,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to boot to desktop at least once after the installation of Windows 7?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was the installation of Windows 7 successful?</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suggest that you boot the computer in Safe mode and check; safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only
 the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p>
<span>i. Restart the computer</span></p>
<p>
<span>ii. Start tapping F8 key</span></p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In modern 64bit Windows, System32 is where 64bit DLLs are stored, and syswow64 (stands for sys Win-on-Win64) is where 32bit DLLs are stored. This is quite confusing. The reason is that a few applications always look for their DLLs in System32. To maintain
 compatibility, windows actually maps syswow64 onto System32 when loading 32bit applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for opencl.dll, windows has its own "official" version, which sfc uses. However, every graphics driver seems to come with their own version of opencl.dll. So whenever you install Intel or NVidia driver, your original opencl.dll gets replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is certainly a bad design, and MS should be solving the conflict. But generally speaking, this is not a critical problem, and the vendor-specific opencl.dll is supposed to work better than the official MS version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This theory is confirm by a senior MS engineer somewhere on this forum. Sorry I can not find the thread at this moment. But not all MS employees know this problem. MS supports may be taught that "sfc corrupted files" == "corrupted system", which is not the
 case for opencl.dll. They will insists on restoring a corruption-free system, which in this case means a corrupted graphic driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of reports about fixing sfc errors and the system goes much more smoothly. The reason is either the vendor graphics driver is buggy at that moment, or sfc fixed other issues (file permissions, etc.) that makes the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

</p><p>Hi....I dont know if this will help you, but with MS Tech Support two months ago we discovered that all 5 of my 512 Surface Books came with missing and corrupt files in Windows 10 edition 1511 - the so called Threshold Update released late last Fall &nbsp; all
 of my SBs came with 1511 pre installed &nbsp; I found that the missing and corrupt files were revealed every time I ran comman Prompt Admin: &nbsp; sfc /scannow</p>
<p>I ran this scan after connecting each SB to wifi and setting brightness level and screen timeouts but BEFORE I ever downloaded or installed any of the mandatory updates waiting to be installed &nbsp; so we then ran the DISM Command that ends with: RestoreHeaqlth
 and found the corrupted and missing files still were not removed or repaired &nbsp; Thats when Lee frrom Tech Support, with the MS Community posts of other here in the community, took a bunch of ideas and created the MS TechBench solution to reove the corrupted
 files and repair others &nbsp; I performed this exact process last night on a brand new SB 512 for a new staff member.. Corrupt and missing files were there immediatley after connecting wo wifi and running: sfc /scannow</p>
<p>I did do a complete recover from the cloud which pulls Windows 10 from the MS cloud insteaqd of pulling it from the Partition in SB that stores the saved OS &nbsp; even when performing a complete reset whether it be recover from the cloud OR the standard Remove
 &nbsp; aqll Files and wipe the hard drive from Recovery in Settings, the missing and corrupt files were there again &nbsp; so I ran the MS TechBench solution described below and tall was repaired in less than two 10 minutes &nbsp; now I can not say as a lay person that this
 process will fix any of the other issues you are experiencing it helped me a lot becasue there were no more Driver crashes or freezing or blue or black screen problems &nbsp; maybe you will want to try this after you run scannow and later the DISM that code ends
 in RestoreHealth Call Tech Support for Surface. here you go:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 1: Download the Tech Bench Upgrade Program using this link:</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: you download it only after you choose: Windows 10 from the drop down menu and hit Confirm &nbsp; then choose Laqnguage: English and choose Confirm &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 2: Delete any existing CBS Log file. The path is: "C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log " :now you may not find these CBslogs as your issuesw may be different thaqn mine &nbsp; so if you do not plainly see: CbSlogs option when you open either the C drive or
 the DVD Drive in This computer where the TechBench Win10 1511 is downloaded and saved to, then just skip this step about deleting CBslogs and go righ to step 3</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 3: Mount the downloaded techBench with file name: "Win10_1511_English_x64", make sure not to install the setup.exe.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: &nbsp; you go back to downloads where you see with Win10 1500 file and you open it and click on the word MOUNT &nbsp; &nbsp;then you go back to Command Prompt:s Admin and Run the DISM command in Command Prompt (Admin): DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
 /source:WIM:D:\Sources\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess</span></p>
<p><span><br />
* Note: Make sure that the source is correct, for example "/source:WIM:D:\Sources\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess" in this case the source of the Mounted ISO is D:\. If you will use a USB stick, most probably it will become E:\, just check the file explorer after
 mounting the ISO.</span></p>
<p>Note that I am including all of this info as originally sent to me by MS Sur'face support Tech, Lee as you will see his closing remarks below &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps it has worked for me 9 times on all my brand new Surface Books &nbsp; maybe this will help you and others &nbsp; Mark</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp; I have had corrupt and missing files reported on every one of the 5 Surface Books I bought recently for me and my staff.&nbsp; All are 512 i7s.&nbsp; After deleting the corrupted wowsys files highlighted in yellow after MS engineer ran AUTORUN on each, the
 corrupt files were still present when we ran Command Prompt Admin:&nbsp; sfc /scannow.&nbsp; Bur after we found detailed posts that showed how to download and install the tech bench files directly to the hard drive of each Book, after running that program on each, all
 5SBs work perfectly.... And now, after installing successfully all of the May 9 and 10 updates including today's 1511 Cumulative Updates, I ran scannow and again - there are no integrity violations and all the Books are clean and running with no problems...even
 attached to Surface Dock and third party monitors.&nbsp; This was not true before we discovered the process to correct the corrupt wow files/opencl.dll&nbsp; Are you saying that even when the corrupt files are reported that they are always replaced and therefore this
 is not one instance where there actually are corrupt and missing files when I ran sfc /scannow?&nbsp; Are you saying definitively that MS is saying that error is ONLY an error in reporting and that there is no truth that actual files are corrupted and missing when
 1511 was installed or updated (at least before today's Cumulative updates?)&nbsp; I am confused because all my books displayed various problems until we did the tech bench process for each.&nbsp; I appreciate your clarification as my experiences with 1511 and those
 of my staff are that our Books would not be running perfectly as they are (even before the updates of May 9 and 10 including Windows Hello Camera was working and recognizing us even out of sleep mode)....if we had not performed the 1511 tech bench process.&nbsp;
 It seems you are reporting that the error is not real in ALL cases.&nbsp; We all do appreciate your reply as this differs from our real-life experiences with Surface Book 512.&nbsp; Best, Julian</p>
