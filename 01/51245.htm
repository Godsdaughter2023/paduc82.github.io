            Hi Jenish9
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can add firewall exception manually.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows security &gt; Firewall &amp; network protection &gt; Allow an app through Firewall &gt; Click Allow another app button &gt; Then you can put the path which you have shown in your picture.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>Ainol inovo 8 Win 8 activation issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_spain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ainol inovo 8 Win 8 activation issues</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Ainol iNOVO 8 8 inch tablet around 10 months ago and upgraded it to 8.1 with no issues. My concern is that although for the most part it seems to work fine, under control panel its shows that windows is not activated. Attempts to activate it
 from time to time over the past 10 months fail with no useful indication as to the problem and no error code. &nbsp;All I get is a dumb "Windows cant activate, try again later".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: If I touch error details it tells me error oxC004F47074 which apparently means No Key Management service could be contacted. I know I'm connected to the internet with no issues so whats going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The activation window shows the last 5 character of the product key and this matches what I get when I use a 3rd party product key app. I don't have any original product code as none was provided so I am at a loss what the problem is. I believe Microsoft
 did a bulk low cost deal for small tablets of which this is one but so far, I haven't found anything helpful on their support site. I would like to get it activated as there are a couple of minor changes I'd like to carry out but it prompts me to activate
 Win 8.1 which I cant and dont know why. If there is a problem with this copy of Win 8, can I buy a product key at a sensible price to fix the problem as Win 8 DVDs on Amazon costs nearly as much as the tablet cost in the first place !!!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW - I cant get Blue tooth working on this tablet at all, its flaky on my HP Win 8.1 notebooks but works like a charm on Android tablets and phones. Any ideas on this as well, as BT and Windows is certainly not a walk in the park ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be welcome, thanks.</p>

<p>original title:&nbsp;New Toshiba Laptop Reboot and Stuck on "Preparing to configure Windows. &nbsp;Do not turn off your computer." Screen... HELP ME PLEASE!</p>
<p><strong>Hi All</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just bought a new Toshiba Satellite notebook today with Windows 7 pre-installed. &nbsp;I booted it up and got the some of the usual initial screen setup queries such as timezone, keyboard layout and computer name. &nbsp;Once at the desktop I connected to the net by
 wi-fi and activated the trial Norton Security (maybe a mistake?) as well as try to get burn a recovery DVD (but this failed, another issue). &nbsp;Anyway, I thought I would try and restart the notebook (I think the notebook did download updates which were to take
 effect after reboot) and now I get the dreaded "Preparing to configure Windows. &nbsp;Do not turn off computer" screen, stuck for at least an hour. &nbsp;I have tried powering off a couple of times, including disconnecting power and yanking the battery out. &nbsp;Still no
 joy and still stuck at this screen for some time now. &nbsp;How long am I supposed to wait for this? &nbsp;If it isn't stuck, it is certainly is &nbsp;moving at continental drift speed with whatever it is doing, in which case I may be an old man before this is finished.
 &nbsp;Help please!!! What do I do?</p>

<p>Since the computer is brand new call Toshiba's support team as there is a chance you may have a defective unit. In any case they will guide you throufg the steps necessary to restore your computer at which point your laptop should be restore back to the
 point when you first opened the box and powered it up for the first time.</p>
<p>It imposible to tell exactly what caused the problem in the first place but I would suggest that you purchase an external USB drive and create a "System Image" immediately and then a new image prior to installing any software or Windows updates. The image
 backup is your means to recover Windows 7 back to the point of the last image backup should any problems occur.</p>

<h2>            Texture Pack on Minecraft Xbox one</h2>
                    So I have the version of minecraft that is free on the xbox one store however I cannot seem to get the texture packs to dowload. For example I have bought the egyptian mythology mash up and i can use the skins, but the world and texture pack still says
 0.00MB out of 160.00M. I have enough storage and my xbox is up to date. How do I fix this?

                    I can´t play any video on windows 10, I thought that it was the graphics card or something but it isn't because I can still use youtube. I've tried&nbsp; VLC, the native videos and tv app, all of them have crashed. I also thought it was the format so I tried
 with other videos but it didn´t work.&nbsp;

                    I downloaded Windows 10 on Nov 25, 2015 onto a Windows 8.1 machine that is almost two years old. &nbsp;I found that anything having to do with the new Windows 10 will not allow anything but numbers to be typed from the keyboard. &nbsp;The numbers only comment has
 been made before on the forum with no solution found. &nbsp;I have found that I can type letters from the keyboard for about 15 seconds after the desktop shows up on the screen. &nbsp;That is, Cortana, Edge, and Settings will take keyboard letter inputs for about 15
 seconds and then the letters turn to numbers that do 012345678901234567890 in a continuous string no matter what key I press on the keyboard. &nbsp;I can type normally from the keyboard for Chrome, Microsoft Office, and Firefox. &nbsp;I bought a new keyboard to see

            Hi Richard,<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.
<div>
<p>We understand your concern, that&nbsp; keyboards that don't respond or that type wrong characters on Windows 10 and I'd be certainly help you.
<br />
<br />
Before we proceed, answer these queries, for a better understanding of your issue:
<br />
<br />
• Do you receive any error code or error message?<br />
<br />
•What is the make and model of the keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If the wrong characters are typed when you use the keyboard, follow the steps in the "The Keys Do Not Strike Correctly" section to clean the keyboard that are described under "The Keys Do Not Strike Correctly" earlier to make sure that no obstructions
 under the keys are causing this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue continues to occur, connect the keyboard to a different computer. If the keyboard functions correctly on a different computer, the port to which the keyboard was connected on the original computer may be damaged. If this is the case, contact
 your computer manufacturer to ask about how to repair or replace the damaged port.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the keyboard does not function correctly on another computer, the keyboard may be defective. If this is the case, and the warranty on the keyboard is still valid, you can exchange the defective keyboard for a new keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue still persists, uninstall and reinstall the keyboards driver from the manufacture's website and check, if it works.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's refer to these following steps to uninstall the keyboards driver from the Device Manager.</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;a. Click on Windows key + X and then, select Device Manager. <br />
&nbsp;b. Locate and expand “Keyboards” in the Device Manager Window.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;c. Right-click on the “Keyboards” and click on “uninstall".<br />
&nbsp;d. Restart the computer and check, if it works.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>What game is he playing? The reason I ask is because some games like Fifa do not require you to sign in so you can bypass the screen time limit. It only starts when you actually sign in with that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He could also be using a different account. My son made one up when he was 10. He Googled how and it only took him a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen time works very well. If my son is at home and signed in and playing, and he is being good, my wife will sometimes call me and ask me to add screen time since she doesn’t know how. I’ll do it from my phone and it instantly adds to it without him even
 needing to sign out.</p>

<p>He plays online games like fortnite. And he is using the right account. When checking the activity on line it shows he played more than his allotted time and beyond the permitted time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this screen time actually stopped working around s couple months ago. It was working great before that.&nbsp;</p>

            An example, i have set the screen time , like till 8 pm, meaning he would not be able to play after 8 pm. Even xbox shows the screen time stops at 8 pm ( on the lower right corner) , but he would be able to continue playing well beyond 8 pm...till whenever
 he likes..

            So i'm back here again.&nbsp; Screen time just does not seem to be working at all. No matter what I do , the screen time just keeps showing that "Screen time ends at 12:00:00 PM" , not matter what time i set that to end at.

<h2>            ASUS DRW-24B1ST not working</h2>
                    <p>The ASUS DRW-24B1ST was working in Windows 7.&nbsp; Upgraded to Windows 10 using this drive.&nbsp; System reboot and now the CD-ROM will not work.&nbsp; It shows up in Device Manager but has an error indicated.&nbsp; On the general tab of properties, I have this message: "Windows
 cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code 52)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything on the forum including editing the register and reboot.&nbsp; Still have the same problem.&nbsp; How do get by CD-ROM back?</p>

            Just to make sure can you check the following registry key: 
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} 
<br />
<br />At that registry key, in the right window, is there, under "Name", either an UpperFilters or LowerFilters value? 
<br />
<br />If so, for each of the UpperFilters and/or LowerFilters value, what is listed under "Data"?

            Neither Upperfilter or Lowerfilter line are present. I tried that already. The bios, Explorer, and device manager see the CD-ROM. It just will not read the disk in the drive. It worked fine in Widows 7 but not Windows 10.

<h2>            Vista Black Screen &#38; Cursor After Login &#40;Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Del Does Nothing &#38; No Alternate User Accounts&#41;</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I am running a Toshiba Satellite A135 with Windows Vista Home Premium SP1.&nbsp; Actually, this is my SO's computer and it ISN'T running.
<br />
<br />
A while back it started blanking out completely after he logged in. I am the more computer-savvy one, so I said I would give it a look. I did, and so far, I am at a loss.<br />
<br />
Post-login, all I see is a black screen and a white arrow/cursor. When I start in Safe Mode I see the black screen, cursor, and the Safe Mode banners.
<br />
<br />
I have looked online (on a different computer) and all the fixes I can find direct users to press Ctrl+Alt+Del to get to the task manager. Unfortunately, nothing happens when I do this.
<br />
<br />
Other posts say that this is a problem with the user account... but I can't try a different user account because there isn't one. My SO never set an alternate user account up. For my part, I don't know how to set one up pre-login -- so changing the UA settings
 is a no-go. <br />
<br />
I have even tried using the "Ease of Access" feature (to see if he changed the monitor settings or something ridiculous) but I can hit the link all the live-long day and nothing happens.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any troubleshooting advice for me?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
NaWaiLohi<br />
<br />
PS: I have run a memory diagnostic (from startup) and (apparently)&nbsp;there is nothing to see there.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device
<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to
<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe .<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />

<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a
<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />

Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your system<br />
maker will sell them cheap. <br />

You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it only has to
<br />
be bootable).<br />

<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/141820-create-recovery-disc.html</span><br />

<br />
These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -<br />

This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

                    For the past week Cortana would entertain with some great Christmas songs. Suddenly today, whenever asked to sing one of the delightful tunes, she would belt out on top of old smokey or Danny Boy. This happened to both the Windows 10 and Android versions.
 What happened? Microsoft suddenly became a Grinch or what? I'm so disappointed. Cortana is a lovely singer.&nbsp;

            Well it seems she is a moody girl. She's back in the spirit of the season with a few more songs than before. Must have been some glitch that resolved with the automatic updates. (I'm guessing that when I installed Cortana on my phone, Galaxy got jealous
 and erased a few files, then the sync made her the same on my PC). Anyhow, all is well now. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year.&nbsp;

            Figured out, the Android version is quirky. It is the real culprit, but if the request is worded correctly she will continue to sing Christmas songs. I have to say please first "please sing a Christmas song". Then she does. The Windows 10 version is never
 the problem until the Android does that. Must be something about the syncing process. If I refrain from using Cortana on my phone for some time, seems the pc version will eventually correct itself. &nbsp;As Cortana sometimes tells me, "One of us needs to take a
 deep breath, and I do not have any lungs." LOL

<br />
A couple of articles that addresses this problem follows.&nbsp; The first one was fixed in Service Pack 3 -- so if you would have told me that you are using SP3, I would not need to include it:<br />

"Error message on a Windows XP-based computer when you work with a network share: "STOP: 0x000000C2 BAD_POOL_CALLER""<br />

<br />
Note that the above article instructs you to limit your computer to a single processor.&nbsp; You do this by bringing up msconfig&nbsp; (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "msconfig") and then click on the "Boot.ini" tab.&nbsp; Then click the "Advanced Options" button and then check the "/NUMPROC="
 checkbox and enter a "1" in the box.&nbsp; Then "OK" your way out and reboot.<br />

<h2>            Max Cached Icons - String or DWord</h2>
                    As I'm sometimes having the problem that my desktop and start menu icons get updated very slowly (and sometimes wrongly), I came across this KB article:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2396571/en<br />
It suggests to create a value "Max Cached Icons" (it has to be with the spaces, that much I could find out using procmon) and increase it to 2000. The text says that the value has to be a string. When I use the MATS package to have it done automatically, however,
 it creates a dword. Can anyone from inside Microsoft confirm which is corrrect?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
no, there were no issues following the suggested steps in the KB article, they're quite clear and easy to follow.<br />
It's just that after I had the fix done by the automatic Fix It wizard I realized that it created a
string</span> (REG_SZ) as instructed in the article, so there's a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
discrepancy</span>. As only one version (string as said in the article or dword as created by the Fix It wizard) can be the correct one, I'm wondering which of them...<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Media Center, Home Server, &#38; Compatability issues</h2>
                    <p>It sounds like Windows 10 will not come with Windows Media Center, which is a huge disappointment in this day and age, especially considering that many folks are pulling the plug on cable and would like a DVR for over the air signals and/or to act as a media
 hub for all entertainment. Is Microsoft providing a replacement for Media Center that is more robust? Not that I have any issues with the current version, but I can't see why they'd get rid of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, will Windows 10 be compatible with Windows Home Server Connector software? I don't want to upgrade and not be able to connect to my server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, what about other things, like printers (specifically HP OfficeJet 8500 Premier &amp; HP Officejet 100 Mobile)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate all responses, but it would be nice to get an official response from Microsoft on this. I'm in the market for a micro-desktop to serve exclusively as a media center and will have to forgo that purchase if there is no MediaCenter and it doesn't
 work with my existing hardware (i.e. server). </p>

<p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade.

1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) <br />
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) <br />

</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for Windows
 10.</p>

            <p>I have little to add except to register my disappointment that Microsoft has decided to abandon Mediacenter.&nbsp; At least we all have 4+ years to find a replacement.&nbsp; I suppose that, as with Microsoft Money, which Microsoft abandoned half a dozen years ago,
 there was just no profit in their maintaining the products and too many ongoing costs associated with them.&nbsp; I was happy to purchase annual upgrades to MS Money, but apparently Intuit was able to prevent Microsoft from building sufficient market share to make
 their annual cost of maintaining their OFX servers worth it.&nbsp; Now the world is left only with Quicken (which even today isn't as good as MS Money was in 2010!) I'm not aware of a single bank or investment house that supports any product other than Quicken.&nbsp;
 And to prevent any competition, Intuit has acquired every credible competitor to Quicken.&nbsp; And, though they have repeatedly raised the price of the product, they have made essentially no improvements to the product since MS Money left the stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect a similar thought process applies to annual maintenance cost for the servers that support updates to the EPG and channel databases.&nbsp; There are significant ongoing operating costs and just not any profit in it for Microsoft to keep Mediacenter in
 their product line.&nbsp; As I said earlier, I'm disappointed.&nbsp; Hopefully, within 4 years, I'll figure out something.</p>

</p><p>The biggest cost for Microsoft is royalties. Here's an excerpt from their engineering blog:</p>
<p>
<em>These traditional media playback scenarios, optical media and broadcast TV, require a specialized set of decoders (and hardware) that cost a significant amount in royalties. With these decoders built into most Windows 7 editions, the industry has faced
 those costs broadly, regardless of whether or not a given device includes an optical drive or TV tuner.
</em>
</p><p><em>Our partners have shared clear concerns over the costs associated with codec licensing for traditional media playback, especially as Windows 8 enables an unprecedented variety of form factors. Windows has addressed these concerns in the past by limiting
 availability of these experiences to specialized “media” or “premium” editions. At the same time, we also heard clear feedback from customers and partners that led to our much simplified

Windows 8 editions lineup</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Given the changing landscape, the cost of decoder licensing, and the importance of a straight forward edition plan, we’ve decided to make Windows Media Center available to Windows 8 customers via the Add Features to Windows 8 control panel (formerly
 known as Windows Anytime Upgrade). This ensures that customers who are interested in Media Center have a convenient way to get it. Windows Media</em>
<em>Player will continue to be available in all editions, but without DVD playback support. For optical discs playback on new Windows 8 devices, we are going to rely on the many quality solutions on the market, which provide great experiences for both DVD and
 Blu-ray.</em></p>

</p><p>Wow.&nbsp; I hadn't even _thought_ of royalty costs for the embedded components.&nbsp; What a shame that something as critical (and at the same time as trivial ?!) as a codec ends up killing a truly useful and desirable product like MediaCenter.&nbsp; I guess that explains
 why it's impossible to find any 3rd-party products that are able to play the MediaCenter-produced .WTV files.&nbsp; It's too bad that MediaCenter is locked into creating files that simply cannot be handled by any other product made by man.&nbsp; Why couldn't Microsoft
 simply implement MediaCenter to record to some other format - ANY other format besides .WTV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Of course, in an upgrade scenario, if we are upgrading from a previous version of Windows that includes Windows Media Center, we've already paid for those royalty costs.&nbsp; In the case of Windows 8 or 8.1, that was a specific, add-on cost that we paid for
 exactly that reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could understand maintaining the current licensing structure to include the add-on cost (yes, I'd pay the extra $10-15 again to keep Media Center, exactly as is and without any additional features).&nbsp; I would even be willing to pay something more along
 the lines of $35-40, which would be pretty competitive with other Media programs if it included native Blu-ray playback.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always said that Microsoft could easily be making even more money if they had any idea how to market their products.&nbsp; Media Center became a niche product only because they didn't market it well.&nbsp; There's still (and perhaps even more) a place for WMC
 that should allow for plenty of profitability.&nbsp; With the unified Windows platform, Xbox movies, etc., there's no reason WMC couldn't be a cross-device, integrated streaming software.&nbsp; Store digital copies of movies on OneDrive and watch them from WMC on your
 PC, laptop, or phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no reason Microsoft can't reintroduce WMC at a later time...perhaps we loyal users just need to make a little noise.</p>

            That's not how royalties work. And the villain in this melodrama isn't Microsoft, it's a company called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rovi</a> that <em>charges the royalty</em>. They have a monopoly arrangement with the U.S. Copyright Office to inject their encryption code in various media.

            <p>I'm not blaming Microsoft for the charging of the royalty, I'm blaming them for not offering a for-profit product that I can choose to purchase and pay those royalties myself.&nbsp; Even package WMC up as a totally separate product with all of that functionality
 built in instead of integrating it so much into the OS...whatever.&nbsp; Killing WMC as of Windows 10 is only going to keep me from upgrading to Windows 10...and if that means hanging on to 8.1 until it goes end-of-life, so be it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my point is that Microsoft has missed the boat on WMC for years because most people never knew it existed, let alone knew what it could do.&nbsp; People come to my house and see me fire up WMC, watch TV, browse recorded TV, choose one of my stored DVDs,
 etc. and they are amazed because THEY'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.&nbsp; If Microsoft is dumping WMC because it wasn't profitable, they have no one to blame but their marketing department.&nbsp; It's the best kept secret in Microsoft's lineup, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still holding out hope that WMC users can convince Microsoft to offer some form of WMC in Windows 10, and again I'm not wanting that for free.&nbsp; I'd gladly pay $50 (or, to go along with their "cloud focused" strategy, $14.99/year) to run WMC in Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I need to quit complaining and just go write the software myself...</p>

            <p>I agree completely that WMC was never properly marketed, and that it was one of the best consumer programs they ever assembled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft ended WMC development long before Windows 8 went to market. It only survived through windows 8 and 8.1 as an add-on because
<em>it didn't break anything</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that's no longer the case. And a stand-alone app would probably have to cost more like $500 than $50 and there's not enough demand even for that.</p>
