<div>When you got that error message, was your Internet connection being obtained from nmax.net? Make sure you have send authentication enabled.</div>
<div>Go to Tools, Accounts, select that account, Properties, Servers. Enable the "My server requires authentication" option.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that setting was already checked, which antivirus are you running? Some of them cause problems with Windows Mail over time. Make sure your antivirus is not configured to scan emails.</div>

<h2>            My windows 7 64bit laptop keeps losing the printers.</h2>
                    My windows 7 64bit laptop keeps losing the printers. They show in the devices &amp; printers section, but are not there when I try to use them (i.e., in Word, Sage, etc.). All my printers disappear, local &amp; network. If I restart or log off they reappear and
 I can use them! What can I do?

<span>I would check the status of the Print Spooler Service.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate Print Spooler in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suspect that it has stopped and that just starting it will not solve the problem.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may need to show hidden files. Type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders"
 is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now access Windows Explorer and select c:\windows\system32\spool\printers. Normally this folder should be empty but there is a problem when files with “spl” and “shd” extensions stick there. Delete
 the files and restart your computer. This may resolve your immediate problem.</span></p>

<h2>            How to get the Thunderbird email notification in the Notification Bar&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title:&nbsp; View email tab on task bar</p>
<p>Before I installed window 7 on my laptop I could minimize my gmail in Mozilla and I was able to see if I had incoming mail by just looking at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; i.e.Email removed for privacy&nbsp;(3)</p>
<p><br />
Now, I can minimize gmail in Mozilla or pin Mozilla to the task bar, but all I see is the Mozilla icon. I want to see if I have mail when I walk by my computer or am working with a different application without having to click on the Mozilla icon.</p>
<p>Is this possible?&nbsp; If so, I'd greatly appreciate directions.</p>

            Can you configure your BIOS to boot from it? Because if its saying operating system not found, its trying load the operating system from the local drive already.

            unlikely that there is a driver for the USB device or software designed to do this (RT can only use Windows Store apps because it isn't an x86 processor)

<h2>            Using a Skype Number abroad</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm looking to move abroad (from UK to Portugal) but still do business in the UK.
<br />
<br />
If I buy the Skype UK number in the Skype Numbers List, will I be able to make and receive calls if I'm working from Portugal? Even if though there is no Skype Number for Portugal? Or does that not matter?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            That’s the benefit of Skype numbers. You can get a number from another country even if you aren’t in that country.

                    In Event Viewer I have over 1200 events logged, both Errors and Warnings. They were all added today and I understand that many events can cause problems with Windows. Can anyone let me know how to delete all of these entries? Step by step? Thank you.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Windows Event Viewer is a tool that keeps log entries for each program, service, security and update change on the system. These logs are separated into separate categories. Depending on how much monitoring you do on the machine,
 they can grow to be several megabytes, taking up hard disk space on your computer. You can clear the Event Viewer log to free up some of this used space. Event Viewer logs should be cleared periodically as a part of your maintenance work on the machine</span></p>

            <p>Apart from the space taken up by a large log the number of events recorded have no effects on Windows. Once an event is logged Windows itself does not do anything with them, they are for you to read and evaluate. If the problem that caused them has been
 resolved then they can be ignored</p>

<p>You will have to reinstall Windows 7 to access the Product ID. If its a preinstalled Windows 7 license, look for the Certificate of Authenticity on the chassis of machine, there you will find the Product ID.</p>

<p>Windows 7 was installed as an upgrade on a self assembled unit. There is no Certificate of Authenticity on the box the software came in, only the product key. Now I will have to re-install XP, so that I can upgrade to 7. This is one of 4 computers I am using,
 and&nbsp;I installed 7 because I bought it at a pre-release price from Best Buy. I didn't like the fact that too many programs and hardware was not compatable with 7. I only booted that drive for my grandson to play Halo. Thanks for the reply</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrites technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore,
 it helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled with the latest improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option. We recommend that Windows users who are running any of the above operating systems enable this feature to improve the security
 profile of their systems.</span></p>
<p><span>However, after you enable Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), existing versions of Cygwin, Skype, and Armadillo-protected applications may not work correctly.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> To resolve this issue, contact the software vendor for an update.</span></p>
<p><span>For SEHOP, see the link:</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to enable Structured Exception Handling
 Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) in Windows operating systems</span></a></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Professional &#34;unknown directX error&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod_hauge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Professional &#34;unknown directX error&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am having a small crisis.</p>
<p>I recently purchased what I thought was going to be a powerhouse computer from Toshiba.&nbsp; It has an advanced graphics card, 32GB of RAM and two 1 TB hard drives.&nbsp; I also purchased a docking station to support two additional monitors and
 the various other peripherals.</p>
<p>Everything ran fine for a month or so, and then I began having issues with a specific game.&nbsp; At a point in the program’s process it switches to the higher graphics requirement, and I get “An unknown directX Error has occurred…”&nbsp; Because
 this started at nearly the same time as a program patch was distributed, I assumed that it was an issue with the software, and or the directX / NVIDIA settings.</p>
<p>I have worked with the software developer’s technical support, which has been more than helpful for nearly two months now, and we have exhausted all possibilities we can come up with.&nbsp; WE have uninstalled, installed, and confirmed current
 drivers on the video drivers, directX controls and drivers, and have uninstalled and&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;the program.&nbsp; Their Support team lead has confirmed my settings are identical to his own and yet I continue to have this issue.</p>
<p>As a test I created a Steam account and downloaded and attempted to run several higher end graphics games, and I have not had any success running any of them even though my graphics card is supposed to be more than sufficient for all
 of them.</p>
<p>I contacted Toshiba technical support, and was informed there was no way that this could possibly be hardware related (which is all that they cover under warranty) and if I wanted any additional support I need to pay a subscription fee
 of $160, after which they would help me&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;Windows 7 professional, because in their opinion (without asking many questions or performing any diagnostics) the system software has to be corrupt, even though I am running all of my other development and
 programming &nbsp;software (VB, C#, etc) and other programs (Microsoft Office) and games with lower graphics requirements.</p>
<p>I have omitted a few things we have tried in the past months, but that is a good overview.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions (other than using this thing for a $3500 doorstop)???</p>

I assume that the laptop the support team lead is using is <span style="font-style: italic">
identical </span>to yours, but I rather doubt he has the same software installed. The problem could be from a software conflict.<br />
- Have you run via Clean Boot to verify <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> of the potential for software conflicts ?<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>
<br />
<br />
What is the <span style="font-style: italic">specific</span> game are you referring to when the problem started,&nbsp; and what are you
<br />
referring to when you say -<br />
</span>?<br />
<br />
-What was the program patch you refer to ?<br />
-You say you have exhausted all possibilities, but we are not privy to that information, so to avoid a<br />
repeat of the same process you should list <span style="font-style: italic">everything</span> you have done to correct the problem.<br />
While the over-view is interesting, the details of what has been done is what is needed.<br />
<br />
 for all of them."</span><br />
<br />
-If the support team lead's laptop is not exactly the same as yours then you may have been mislead<br />
regarding the graphics capabilities of your laptop, or are expecting too much graphics performance regardless. Not an uncommon scenario with laptops. Having said that a $3500 laptop (depending on country of origin) should have very good graphics capabilities
 when using one monitor.<br />
-I assume you have the same problem running high end games with only one monitor connected ?<br />
- Although you may actually have a use for 32GB RAM for one of your professional programs, anything more than 8GB is of no benefit whatsoever with any game. Dedicated VRAM and high bus speed is
<br />
what drives multiple monitors.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking though, (if only using one monitor) it sounds like Toshiba is giving you the run-a-round as it is only high end games that are crashing.<br />

            I have had similar issues with the latest nVidia drivers and currently use the 306.23 WHQL version. I still have an occasional issue in BF3 where I get a DX_ERROR and have to re-connect to the server. I have a GTX 680 video board and don't know if the
 laptop drivers have the same issues but I suspect that they might. I hope this helps. Good luck.

            Sorry, I should know better than write a post when I am that angry.
<div><br />
<div>First point of confusion.</div>
<div>The laptop support team did virtually nothing, they did not ask about any diagnostics, or run any checks or remote into my system. &nbsp;They instantly told me it was a software issue and I would have to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;windows 7 Professional&nbsp;because&nbsp;it had to be
 corrupted. &nbsp;When I said that our settings were identical, I was&nbsp;referring&nbsp;the the developer tech support for the game,&nbsp;whose&nbsp;has been exemplary through all of this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The&nbsp;specific&nbsp;game is from Riot Games and is League of legends. &nbsp;After logging in there are many options, one of wich of course is to play the game. &nbsp;After selecting to play the game, you have to select your champion. &nbsp;At this point the software switches
 to the higher&nbsp;graphics&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;and loads the software based on your selection and those of the other players. &nbsp;this is when we get the unknown direct x error. &nbsp;The program runs fine up until this point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have an intell HD Graphics 4000 and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670M video card. &nbsp;I have updated, removed and re-installed the drivers for both, and the device manager does see both devices and thinks they are working appropriately.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The lead support was only&nbsp;referring&nbsp;to the video settings in regards to NVIDIA, and DirectX and in those regards we we had identical systems, and oddly enough our systems are in fact very similar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In regards to software conflicts, no new software was introduced to the system at all other than the patch for the game when this occurred. &nbsp;All of my development software and applications were all loaded prior to loading the game, and as I said the game
 did work for about a month before I started&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;this error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the number of&nbsp;monitors&nbsp;and other&nbsp;peripherals, yes if I un-dock the laptop and run with just the laptop monitor, I have the same issues. &nbsp;Additionally when the program ran before it did so with both of the&nbsp;auxiliary&nbsp;monitors on and running, often
 with other websites or programs running on them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you think it is&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;I can post all of the system specifications, but you are correct, it should in theory be a very nice laptop, and I should not be getting this kind of run&nbsp;around&nbsp;from Toshiba like this. &nbsp;I never had this&nbsp;kind&nbsp;of problem in getting
 support with my previous Toshiba, and why I invested in this one. &nbsp;A mistake I will not make again.</div>

Thank you for the good wishes, I am just hoping that&nbsp;someone&nbsp;might have a suggestion other than having to start over completely. &nbsp;However, as I said, I can at least remove all of Toshiba's files and games that I have no interest in, I just never did it yet&nbsp;because&nbsp;the
 system has two 1TB hard drives, so I am not hurting for storage space.

            Most games install all required versions of DirectX when they are installed. There are some DX9 files missing from the Windows installation that might need to be installed. They can be updated from this site:
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35</a></div>
<div>There should never be any reason to have to re-install Windows 7 and anybody who suggests it doesn't know what they are talking about. If you still have problems after updating the DX9 files then you can run the SFC utility:</div>

<div>Use option two and run from the Command Prompt.</div>
<div>Let me know if it finds any corrupt system files that cannot be repaired and I will try to help you further.</div>

            Actually I had done both of these&nbsp;before, but I attempted again, what could it hurt right?

<div>This is the same notification that I&nbsp;received&nbsp;when I attempted this working with Riot's technical support. &nbsp;That is why we chose to completely uninstall DirectX and&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;it. &nbsp;That did not have any change on this issue either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>They also suggested your second suggestion and upon&nbsp;running&nbsp;the SFC utility, there were no corrupt files found.<br />
<div><br />
<div>You are&nbsp;correct&nbsp;that there are many other gamers&nbsp;complaining&nbsp;about this issue. &nbsp;the difference is either one of two things. &nbsp;Many of them do not have cards that provide the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;HD support, or&nbsp;re-installing&nbsp;the drivers, or other suggestions that are
 posted&nbsp;in the&nbsp;forums have worked for them. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don't fall into either of those categories. &nbsp;Riot has and continues to be more than&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;with regards to this issue, and are not blowing me off. &nbsp;We just have collectively exhausted all options
 we can come up with (other than reinstalling Windows 7 Professional, which still seems absurd to me) &nbsp;Of course, I am sure that there have been some that could not resolve the issue, and just abandoned playing the game, and possibly even more that are not
 aware of the issue, or just don't care.</div>

Hmm, so the machine is switching from 2D to 3D mode only after the game loads ? <br />
Do you have Control Panel &gt; Windows Power Options&nbsp; setup for&nbsp; High Performance ?<br />
"DirectX setup has determined that a newer or equivalent version of DirectX has been installed already.&nbsp; No installation is necessary."</span><br />
<br />
This indicates that you do have all the Direct X files installed, but as the Web Installer does not overwrite existing DX files it does not indicate if there are any corrupt DX files.
<br />
It would seem that SFC should repair all corrupt system files, but maybe not.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could go through System 32 and SysWOW64 and manually delete all the DX files, if you know the name for all of them, but you cannot uninstall Direct X.<br />
What you can do is&nbsp; run the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">DirectX Redistributable (June 2010</span>)&nbsp; as&nbsp; it will overwrite the existing DX files<br />
and replace corrupt files in the process.&nbsp; I assume this is what you have done, but -
<br />
I have to ask - Did&nbsp; you run the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">DXsetup.exe&nbsp; </span>
that is in the folder after unpacking the download ?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
<br />
<br />
Or - If "Riot" can tell you which Direct X files the game uses then you could delete these particular files from both System 32 and SysWOW64&nbsp; and run the Web Installer again and it will replace them with new copies.<br />
<br />
Error messages are often misleading so -<br />
<br />
<br />
When you say&nbsp; 'loaded' do you mean installed, or they are running when you try playing the games ?<br />
Have you tried troubleshooting potential software conflicts&nbsp; via Clean Boot ?<br />

            Do you have a BIOS option to disable the Intel graphics and use the GeForce video board as a single dedicated graphics device? There are some nVidia users with the Z77 motherboard and GeForce video boards that need to disable the Intel graphics for proper
 performance.
<div>I recently did a clean re-install of Windows 7 and it was a PITA that took me almost a week to get all of my programs and tweaks re-installed. This was voluntary on my part because I was constantly trying newer IRST RAID beta drivers and started getting

Do you have Control Panel &gt; Windows Power Options&nbsp; setup for&nbsp; High Performance ?</i>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, as a test early on we did change this to see if we would get a different error, but it was returned to high performance.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>This indicates that you do have all the Direct X files installed, but as the Web Installer does not overwrite existing DX files it does not indicate if there are any corrupt DX files.&nbsp;<br />

<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>We had similar thoughts regarding this, and were not sure if SFC only checked for files, repaired all corrupt files or what exactly, but it never provided any errors or concerns.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>You could go through System 32 and SysWOW64 and manually delete all the DX files, if you know the name for all of them, but you cannot uninstall Direct X.<br />
What you can do is&nbsp; run the&nbsp;&nbsp;DirectX Redistributable (June 2010)&nbsp; as&nbsp; it will overwrite the existing DX files<br />

<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>I did manually delete the files, and then was able to see that the web install replaced them all. &nbsp;I am not certain that I deleted every directX file, however that was not really my intent. &nbsp;I just wanted to know if the web instal would replace the files
 that I deleted, and it did. &nbsp;I did also install the Redistribue (June 2010) but having nothing to lose, I did just perform that again, and test, and still have the unknown directX error.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>When you say&nbsp; 'loaded' do you mean installed, or they are running when you try playing the games ?<br />
Have you tried troubleshooting potential software conflicts&nbsp; via Clean Boot ?</i></div>
<div><br />
<div>My mistake, and thank you for the correction, I do mean that they were all installed prior to installing the game, and nothing was installed after installing the game. &nbsp;Additionally as I am trying to help troubleshoot this issue, because I am not the only
 one having it, I never have any other application(s) loaded when attempting any suggestion, and I only make one change and then test before making another change so I can try to determine what&nbsp;change&nbsp;had a change on the outcome. &nbsp;In regards to the clean boot,
 yes each time I test, the test consists of both a restart under the normal boot mode, and then again as a clean boot. &nbsp;The unknown directX error is represented&nbsp;regardless&nbsp;of the boot method.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>You mentioned problems with all high end games, but refer mostly to League of Legends and the&nbsp;<br />
games update. Have you done a clean uninstall (including all folders in your User folders) and&nbsp;<br />
reinstalled the game ?</i></div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, this was one of the things that we attempted to do early on, and several times again since. &nbsp;I have also installed and run the software as administrator, which has the same resulting error as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>You have updated graphics drivers but have you updated&nbsp;all&nbsp;the drivers and Motherboard BIOS&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
for the laptop with drivers from Toshiba (graphics drivers for the 640m are also from Toshiba) ?&nbsp;</i><br />
<div><br />
<div>Well, that is somewhat a touchy subject with me at the moment. &nbsp;I have updated all of the drivers that I can find to update, and as I mentioned, Toshiba has not thus far been overly helpful other than to tell me it was going to cost more for me to get
 them to help me with anything software related, or to tell me that my OS was corrupt and needed to be&nbsp;re-installed. I have posted on Toshiba's forum, and I am getting similar suggestions there as here, and all have been attempted already, which is what keeps
 making me think this is a hardware (GeForce Card) issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I did install Microsoft's Driver Manager prior to all of this, which is supposed to monitor and automatically update any of the drivers on my system as new drivers are published. &nbsp;Again this was installed prior to installing the game and the game did
 run for a period of time with that software installed. &nbsp;I did just force it to scan and it came back with no drivers out of date. &nbsp;I have never had any issues with this software in the past on other systems, but I am not opposed to uninstalling it if you think
 it may be causing some form of conflict.</div>

<div><br />
<div>Not that I can find, the Riot Tech support suggested that thee may be a high performance mode in the BIOS as well, so after spending 20 minutes figuring out how to even get into the BIOS, I finally figured out is was fairly basic and straight forward,
 and nothing related to graphics at all that I can find.</div>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for this suggestion and information. &nbsp;I have access to many .iso files and one of them is the Windows 7&nbsp;professional. &nbsp;If I do go to that level I will use it&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of the branded files from Toshiba.</div>
<div>I have several external hard drives that I can back up this system on, and create my own image files of the system before I do. &nbsp;I would really just like to do that as a last recourse instead of the first thing, just because a tech support specialist does
 not want to invest any time in trouble shooting the issue first. &nbsp;I am in the middle of a term at school so I don't have a week to dedicate to this, and all of my other applications that I need for programming and classwork are running fine, so I can live
 without a game for a while as long as I can still do my assignments.</div>

<p>I have problem with install prev. Anniversary update; (last update installs was in October 216 and looks like during updates apply some goes wrong (PC was rebooted but update failed)); after that winupdate go in error loop and redownload and create folder
 '$WINDOWS.~BT' ten or more times (bad win update eat 80 Gb of my net traffic) and after that shows failed again without reboot, cleanup of 'SoftwareDistribution' and winupdate service restart was not helped too;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on Saturday 08 I go to ms site and try new feature&nbsp;Windows10UpgraderApp it create backup, work a lot of time, create small diff. esd file with required system files update and go to reboot and apply changes without NVidia drivers etc;</p>
<p>
</p><p>after that I reconfig minor features, reenable antivir, install NVidia driver etc;</p>
<p>Store app work fine, and 3D paint and 3d builder work fine too;</p>
<p>Appears problems with old metro apps, that I used before (some were installed under win10 some under 8.0 or 8.1);</p>
<p>I have fixed dcom activation issues with RuntimeBroker and registry access rights;</p>
<p>but uninstall and install again old apps from store work fine and old apps now work fine;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears only that issue with&nbsp;Microsoft.Microsoft3DViewer_1.1703.13029.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe (Ukrainian title 3D-моделі) according to error desc and lib&nbsp;ucrtbase.dll looks like system issue OpenGL maybe old NVidia driver and old NVidia card is also related;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win update work fine without issues apply some security updates on some Monday before;</p>
<p>tried <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>Windows Update troubleshooter</span></span></a> looks like it 'reset service registration' but I can't see any changes in system or UI;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd very much like a watch running W10 for my Lumia 950, similar to what Android Wear can do, obviously with Microsofts design and functionality. I know of the band 2, but a surface-watch or something that looks more like a traditional (round) watch would
 be really nice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What alternatives are there?<br />
Are there any plans from Microsoft to make a Surface-watch or Lumia-watch?</p>

            some of best options are Garmin Vivoactive HR and fitbit Blaze, both fitbit and Garmin have apps for windows 10, with Blaze you can't receive notifications but with VHR everything works fine, but personally I think the VHR it is very ugly, I picked up
 the fitbit blaze

    <title>Accidentally uninstalled bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianbailey4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidentally uninstalled bluetooth</h2>
                    In an effort to repair my Bluetooth connection after updating Windows 10, I accidentally uninstalled Bluetooth. Now everything says the computer is not Bluetooth capable. I have already downloaded the manufacturer (HP) driver and tried to install, but
 Bluetooth is uninstalled so the driver won't update. Is there a way to reinstall Bluetooth without having to reinstall Windows 10?

            Hi Brian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Bluetooth and Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />How exactly did you uninstall Bluetooth?
<br />
<br />Unless there is a bluetooth switch on the laptop, when there should be a Bluetooth Device in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Click on View tab to Show Hidden Devices and scour all categories.  
<br />
<br />There is also no reason the driver should not install unless Bluetooth is somehow shut off or the device has died.  What happens exactly when you try to install it for the correct version  and bit rate of Windows? 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for your response Greg. I actually uninstalled it from device manager on accident. I was following a support procedure to fix bluetooth connectivity issues that involved finding the BT device using the show hidden devices option in device manager.
 It was subordinated under a parent device, and I accidentally deleted the BT when I intended to delete the parent device. So now there is no bluetooth on the computer at all. Is my only option to reinstall windows 10? Will that even fix it? Thanks again for
 your help!</p>
<p>

            Brian, there is still a bluetooth device on your computer, it just might lack a driver, that's all.  
<br />
<br />I just gave you a list of things to try.  Have you started yet?  If those don't work then I'll continue to help you until it's working again.  But you have to actually perform the steps I give.

            I'm not by the computer at this moment, it's at my office and I'm at home. I wasn't expecting an answer so fast. You asked me how exactly I deleted BT in your response, which was what I was answering. I will try the troubleshooter tomorrow morning. When
 I tried to install the updated driver everything went normally until it actually would start the install, then the window would just close and nothing would happen. This would happen right as it started to install the driver, and afterwards there was no change
 in the state of BT availability on the computer. It also still does not show up in device manager anywhere, even under hidden devices.

            Brian, the driver download could be corrupted. Can we see the download link?
<br />
<br /> Try downloading it again, right click Setup to Run as Admin.  It should at least install and then error if it is not the right driver or otherwise fails.

<h3> feridpw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Error&#58; Fatal&#58; Could not create work tree dir &#39;folder&#39;s name in repository&#39;&#58;No such file or directory while running git clone &#60;repository name&#62; Command.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. My operating system is Windows 10 Home. It's default operating system when I bought my laptop from official store.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't know is it my real problem or not , but most probably it is write permission, I guess.</p>
<p>So I want to describe my problem precisely.</p>
<p>In three situations I encounter with this problem:</p>
<p>1) When I want to clone some project from Git to my laptop there is an error. So basically what I do is writing this command on CMD -&gt; "git clone &lt;repository name&gt;" and getting this result -&gt; "fatal: could not create work tree dir 'folder's name in repository':
 No such file or directory." I searched online for this problem on Stackoverflow.com and in answers people say that the folder that I want to clone my files dont have writing permission. But I check it and see that everything is okey, I have full access to
 everything. I did same things on Git bash, but same result. So even running both Git bash and CMD as an administrator gives same result.</p>
<p>2) As a programmer I tried to write small code on C language. The process that my program does is just creating a .txt file and writing some text inside it. But again same kind of problem. When I run program there is no any .txt file. Then I tried to create
 .txt file manually, but this time after running my code it didn't write any text inside it. I'm pretty sure there is no any problem on my code. Because the exact same code does what I want on other computers.</p>
<p>3) Sometimes after editing some file in some programs Windows doesn't let me to save it and gives error "this file doesn't exist".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as a result of these three situations I suppose that there is something wrong with permissions on my laptop, although it shows me that I'm administrator and have full access to everything.</p>
<p>What can I do about this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>***Moved From: Windows 10/Security &amp; privacy***</em></p>
<p><em>***Changed Original Title From: Don't have write permission***</em></p>

<p>Three weeks ago I was working I use my computer for work. I closed out my program and when my computer went to sleep my screen saver I have had for years was changed!. I am the ONLY ONE that use my desk top computer. I did not do it. I noticed after this&nbsp;update
 the computer started going to sleep within one minute of not touching the key board or mouse. Yes, I timed it.
</p>
<p>I contacted my internet provider and they reset my screen saver and reset my screen timer. did a computer&nbsp;check and even ran a full scan. &nbsp;As soon as they finished it happened again. I spent three days in a row with my tech support people and it was not
 resolved. I contacted Microsoft and spent two days with them "Fixing" the problem even to the point of them reinstalling my Windows 10. It still shuts down within two minutes. As long as I am typing or moving the mouse the computer stays awake. It is if I
 sit reading an article or viewing a video the screen goes into sleep mode the program is still open but I have to click a key or hit the sign in &nbsp;button to wake it up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also seems that<strong> I AM NOT </strong>the only one voicing this complaint! There are plenty of comments on this chat&nbsp; that are complaining about the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is time to bring this issue to the public that Microsoft has a known "BUG" in the Windows 10 that cannot be fixed and is leading us the users and also the poor tech support people on trying to lead us on that the problem is fixable. You know what
 happens when you&nbsp; AssUME!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell me why the screen goes to sleep when it is set to NEVER?</p>

<p>Well, you're the only one who's ever mentioned such a problem in this forum. If it was widespread then we'd hear about it pretty quickly. At this stage we have no idea if the problem is caused by hardware, the operating system, software, a rogue driver or
 human interference. It's much too early to draw any conclusions!</p>

<p>I have a lot of experience with Windows problem solving. Whenever I came across a query relating to a setting that would not "stick" I found that it was due to one of these causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A poorly designed program that changed the setting by itself without telling the user.</li><li>A rogue program deliberately doing bad things.</li><li>Human interference.</li><li>A poorly written program that modifed the access rights to the registry location that stored the setting in question.</li></ul>
<p>If a screen saver timeout does not stick then I would immediately examine this registry location:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop/ScreenSaveTimeout</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing how Windows works helps a lot but it requires patience. Jumping to conclusions by declaring a national emergency (which the OP suggested) does not.</p>

<p>I never wrote anything personal. Instead I suggested some serious debugging action which unfortunately you chose not to carry out. It might have shown you the cause of your problem.</p>

<h2>            SD card reader not working</h2>
                    I have a laptop with a built-in SD card reader, but when I put my SD card in the drive, nothing happens. No lights change on the laptop itself, no hardware appears to be activated and no drive appears in the Computer window. I have tried the Device Manager
 and it says "This device is working properly." I know the SD card works because it works in my camera and I've tried another card and got the same result. It's only a 1GB card so it's not an issue with the size. Anyone have any idea what could have happened?

            If you type Windows Disk in the Search box you should see Windows Disk Management at the very<br />
top of the list.<br />
<br />
Another way to Disk Management is Control Panel (Classic) - Administrative Tools - Computer Management -<br />
under Strorage on left - Disk Management<br />
<br />
In USBDeview did you check the 1st 3 Choices&nbsp;under Options?<br />
<br />
If all that did not work you have a hardware issue and need a technician. Another solution would be<br />
to DISABLE the present drive if it shows at all in Device Manager and use an external reader.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

            Hi brianwhite007 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should execute these steps to optimize the system for best experience
<br />
<br />1. Run through Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist by Greg Carmack, MVP to make sure that your Windows installation is rightly set up and optimized. Take all recommended steps outlined there to have best experience  - 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If problem is not solved, Post entries corresponding to this event and few minutes preceding this event in Event Logs. 
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type eventvwr and Enter &gt; See if any log corresponding to your date and time is there (Look under all entries under Windows Logs such as System, Application, Security...) &gt; If yes, right click on that log &gt; Save Selected Event &gt; Zip all event files which correspond to your event, upload them to Onedrive and share the link here.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi, brianwhite007
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk  with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            Hello brianwhite007,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:
<br />
<br />1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, perform clean boot:
