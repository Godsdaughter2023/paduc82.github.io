            I have spent 45 minutes with Serif reguarding this problem. They have no answer and seem unwilling to address this problem.<br />
I have purchased all of Serif products at one time or another but can no longer support a company that takes this attitude.<br />
Web Plus is one of the best web design programs out there, but if you cannot reload when required then what use is it.<br />

You can disable the notifications and the service:

1) Click Start &gt; Control Panel and then double-click Administrative Tools.
2) Double-click Services.
3) Scroll down and double-click Interactive Services Detection.
4) On the General tab, change the Startup type to Manual or Disabled.
5) Click OK and restart the computer

Please do let me know, Good Luck

            Thank you so much! That really helps. However I still concern about the Message itself that says the "unsupportable 16-bit application" which is in my system folder. Is this a problem I have to fix or just ignore it?

<p>Thanks for the reply. I call often on the 19 tickets I have had opened the past 8+ weeks on this same reported systemic issue. They repeat to me:</p>
<p>1) They can not "see" the update in the ticket</p>
<p>2) This is a unique issue and can not be resolved at their level</p>
<p>3) They will escalate to the next tier (who no one can talk to)</p>
<p>4) Tell me to call back in 24 hours</p>
<p>5) Microsoft then closes out my ticket as resolved</p>
<p>6) After 24 hours, tell me to wait 72 hours...open new ticket&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Call back again, rinse, and repeat (I have called 27 times on this issue and I have not received any call back on this issue to date)</p>

            I am so sorry to hear that. Perhaps a member of the Microsoft team will come across this thread and help. I wish I had more in depth resources to help you. But alas I am just a user of Microsoft products such as yourself. I am limited to providing tech support and triubleshooting assistance based upon my own knowledge and experience. But this is beyond and requires in depth access on the back end of things

            This is a "MS feature" (real world calls it a bug) of Office, since at least 2010. I see it there sometimes, more often in 2016.  I have not found anything that fixes it. I just wait for it wake up.
<br />
<br />To me it seems to be a "timeout" effect.  The program is trying to find "something" that is not there, so it keeps searching until a hard coded time limit expires, then it moves on to the next command in its "stack".   I saw the same effect a LONG time ago when we had a network logon that was trying to map a drive on a server that was no longer present.  The network logon process would hang, then proceed. The fix was simply removing the obsolete logon. That was a trivial fix compared to finding the one (or more) places this happens in a huge program like Word. Trouble shooting this sort of intermittent bug is almost impossible (kinda explains why it hasn't been fixed yet ... ) 
<br />
<br />Frankly they lie, (OK, to be polite call them "overly earnest" or "optimistic") when they say someone will call back. It is a way to blow you off. On the other hand, I have talked to a few people who have actually (shocking!) received a call back. But most people report similar experiences to yours, no call back. 
<br />
<br />2nd level support is real. It is made up of real experts, or at least of technicians who are smarter than front line support (easy).  You can (sometimes) get front line support to transfer you by constantly asking the front line support to transfer you all through their irrelevant script questions. 
<br />
<br />Bottom line, sorry but support is not going to fix this, you are just going to get ulcers trying to get them to help you with it. 
<br />
<br />Your best approach is to use the Feedback process to create a bug report. Actually on this problem it is likely you will find existing entries.  If you do find existing complaints, vote for each and add your (vitriolic) comments to them. While you are there, get a Share link for each and post it back here (so we can easily vote in support).  As well get everyone you know to vote and comment on the link(s) you collected. (In theory) the more votes, the more likely MS is to work on the problem.  It is not an absolute guarantee, but it helps get their attention.

            <p>Hi LinKav1967,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>These are the possible causes why you are receiving the error message "<span><strong>0x800CCC0F</strong>"</span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;would advise you&nbsp;to reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail. To do this,&nbsp;refer to this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For firewall issue,&nbsp;you can try to disable the security software/ firewall to isolate the issue. You can refer
 to this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/how-can-i-resolve-machine-configuration-issues-in/7462aa67-6131-4504-a11b-7060a95c694b">

            I got the very same problem. but I did find a solution Iwhich worked for me.<br />
<br />
The solution:<br />
<br />
On my email server I had enabled the spa option which Live Mail also supports, however in the properties for outgoing mail server the choice 'Use same settings as my incoming mail server' should have worked, however in Live Mail you can't use that is the mail
 server is setup for spa for both incoming and outgoing mails, so the solution was to reenter my credentials again also I selected the check box for 'Log on using Secure Password Authentication' and that was it.<br />
<br />
The error status windows wasn't much help either because it told me that it was a logon error while trying to retrieve mails and not while trying to send mails so yes it did took me halv and hour to solve the problem.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium - Can&#39;t Change Username in Authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sai-itmgr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium - Can&#39;t Change Username in Authentication Dialog Box</h2>
                    <p>I was hoping someone might be able to answer a question on how to get a computer running Windows 7 Home Premium to display both the username
<em><strong>and </strong></em>password fields when attempting to authenticate to another Windows-based computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the situation:&nbsp; we allow the executives and other authorized staff at our organization to establish a VPN connection to our corporate network (via Fortinet Forticlient, for what it's worth.)&nbsp; Once the VPN connection has been established, on the remote
 computer, the user should be able to access the UNC path to our file server (\\servername\share).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the remote user hasn't yet authenticated to the corporate Active Directory domain, a dialog box should appear prompting the user for a username and password.&nbsp; Enter the username (domain\username) and password, and the share should open, and the user
 should then be able to access the files contained within the share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I (and several other staff members) have been using this method successfully to access files over the VPN connection, and it works fine.&nbsp; However, it doesn't work whenever the president of the company connects to the VPN from his home computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever the president connects to the VPN and attempts to access the UNC path, he reports that the dialog box that appears on his home computer has only a field for a password; the username field seems to be set to his local user account, and he doesn't
 have the ability to change it.&nbsp; (I've asked him if there's a "use other credentials" option, and he reports that there is not; just a dialog box with only one field, the password field.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The president is running Windows 7 Home Premium on his home computer, so I thought that the problem might be because he was running that edition of Windows.&nbsp; However, I installed the VPN client and tested connecting to the file server share using my wife's
 computer, which is also running Windows 7 Home Premium, and I received the two-field authentication dialog box as expected, and was able to successfully authenticate to the domain and open files from the share without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any recommendations on what I can try in order to enable the president to successfully authenticate to our server share?&nbsp; I'm stumped, and he's anxious to be able to get remote access to files from his home computer.</p>

<h2>            Dell Inspiron N5050 Laptop and windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I am upgrading a Dell Inspiron N5050 laptop&nbsp;to Windows 10 from window 7 for a neighbor of mine.&nbsp; The install went okay.&nbsp; However, after it boots up, I get a light blue screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a fashion I can hit the space bar(no password) and I can here it boot up
 the rest of the way, but no screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried looking on Dell website and was told they weren't updating any drivers for this machine. I have tried safe mode and at one point I got a picture for about one second.&nbsp; I want to go back to Windows 7 but can't figure
 out how.&nbsp; Data on the machine has to be saved(he didn't have a backup).&nbsp; Is it at all possible to get back to Win 7?</p>

<h2>            Problems after repeated hibernation</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Surface Pro 4 for a couple of weeks now.&nbsp; One of the problems was it wouldn't wake up from sleep correctly some of the time, which required a hard shut-down in order to get out of that stuck mode.&nbsp; The "solution": force Windows to use hibernation
 instead of sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That has been helping, but today ran into a new issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The stylus tip wasn't recognized (but the eraser button would start One Note just fine).</p>
<p>2) Windows Hello stopped activating the camera for facial recognition for logon.</p>
<p>3) Pinch control in browsers was not working (for zooming the display).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything looked okay in device manager, so tried restarting the computer.&nbsp; All three of those items started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up with this?&nbsp; Sounds like a memory or resources leak.&nbsp; Whatever it is, it's frustrating.&nbsp; I have a gut feeling that this may be a side-effect of repeated hibernation cycles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?&nbsp; Solution?</p>

<h3> franciscosanchez21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 reset &#40;Some files are missing.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I want to reset my computer and delete all my personal files. That is it. That is all I wish to do. Nothing more nothing less. I don't want answers or suggestions other than that.</p>
<p>Restore my computer, reset it, that is it. This should be a fairly simple action, a feature that has been around for a long time. A feature that Microsoft, like always, decided to over complicate. What should be a simple "Would you like to reset and delete
 all your files?" has become a train-wreck the likes of which only Microsoft could engineer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do this on my own here is what happened: </p>
<p>When I tried to reset my computer I was given the error "some files are missing your recovery media should blah blah F***ing blah"</p>
<p>I decided to look up what the problem was and I was sent to this page: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</p>
<p>Apparently upgrading to windows 8.1 from windows 8 was a no no. I had to re install windows 8 from a burned disc. after the installation was done I installed updates and planned to upgrade to windows 8.1, because the windows 8 interface is simply trash.
</p>
<p>I downloaded windows 8.1 and I was given the go ahead to restart my PC for the installation to begin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized too late that when I installed windows 8 again that didn't delete my personal files they were still there. I restarted my PC windows 8.1 re-installed and I'm back at square one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know What I should do, step by step, to reset my computer.&nbsp;<strong>THAT IS IT!&nbsp;</strong>Nothing more nothing less. This &nbsp;should be simple, I should not have too jump through all these jumps and hoops to do something that in previous version

<p>And how is this suppose to help you if you're now on Windows 8.1? I did this as an online upgrade and just have a Windows 8 key. I'm now on Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I started with a Windows 7 laptop. Had a spare Windows 8 key. Updated to Windows 8 then ran through
 a ton of updates and finally 8.1. Now I want to wipe and reset so I can sell the laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would any reasonable person now think they have to jump through hoops to do a wipe and reset? I can't do it easily to sell the laptop. The father buying it can't do it to use it himself. And then he can't wipe it and reset it to give to his daughter
 for college next year. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole point was to be nice and smooth and easy to do a factory reset and the brilliant Windows 8.1 update with windows 8 keys being useless to do a straight to 8.1 install and now a simple reset, a complete joke.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did someone completely overt hink pirating or something? This is just stupid and way too time consuming to do something that should take 20 minutes. Not how I want to spend my weekend.

<h2>            How to remove phone &#40;bluetooth device&#41; completely from the computer</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Need help with Bluetooth devices on Windows 8?</p>
<p>I'm trying to remove my phone (Blackberry) from my Bluetooth devices, because it's not working properly (I want to delete the device and then try connecting to it again) . I've completely removed it from my phone, but am having trouble removing it from my
 pc.<br />
<br />
I thought i removed in the win 8 settings menu (in pc settings &gt; devices), then tried removing it from there, but when I tried connecting to my phone after that, it still said to remove the device from the computer then try again.
<br />
<br />
Also, The (empty) bluetooth folder for my phone's bluetooth folder won't go away in My Computer. The phone isn't even listed under devices and printers in the control panel.
<br />
<br />
How can I remove it completely?<br />
<br />
(laptop is a Lenovo g580)<br />

<h2>            Windows could not connect to the group policy client service on startup - Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Windows 8.1 Windows could not connect to the group policy client service on startup - seems to be solved by a restart&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having this issue on a new Windows 8.1 machine for some months now and have tried many different solutions to getting rid of it, but find that it comes back within a week or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine is a Dell Inspiron desktop 3847, purchased late May 2014. &nbsp;It came with Windows 8.1, not Pro and onto this I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created an account that it prompted me for as part of the setup it went through when I first turned the machine on (from factory image). &nbsp;And I've created a second admin account to use in case I have trouble with the first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the McAfee Anti Virus that came with the machine and installed Avast Internet Security 2014 and more recently 2015 instead.</p>
<p>Installed VMWarer Player v6.0.2</p>
<p>Installed Google Chrome and Hangouts video chat plugin</p>
<p>Installed Microsoft Office 2013</p>
<p>Created a custom image I could refresh to if I ran into troubles and I also used the Dell backup and recovery tools to create a factory image I could restore back to.</p>
<p>I also use File History to keep my files synced to a separate external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it. &nbsp;I do all the rest of my configuration and changes in VMs that I run on this host machine. &nbsp;The other thing to add is that I shut down my machine at the end of each day and power it on in the morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month from new, I started up the PC and logged in and saw the message Windows could not connect to the group policy client service... in the popup bubble on the right hand side of my desktop. &nbsp;As a result, I then see hangs when using right click
 in File/Windows Explorer, I see empty folders when I navigate to a folder that has only files in it and when I click on Google Chrome, nothing happens for approx ten mins (yes - really 10 mins) before the browser window opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happened the first time, I searched for solutions online. &nbsp;This included:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Reviewed the event logs and could see a slew of 7011 events reporting a timeout of 30000 milliseconds for different services. &nbsp;gpsvc was included and I also saw the event message that matched the error I saw on the popup on the desktop. &nbsp;I do also have
 some other Parity check errors reported occasionally, along with a message saying that the McAfee cleanup process exited abnormally, but from googling these, these do not seem to be significant from what I can tell.</p>
<p>- In local services, I could see that the Group Policy Client service was stopped and I couldn't start it.</p>
<p>- running sfc /scannow and it reported no integrity violations. &nbsp;Basically no problems.</p>
<p>- Checked registry settings to verify that I had all the settings correct for gpsvc matching windows 8/8.1, not windows 7.</p>
<p>- Shutdown, powered back on and saw the same behaviour on login each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I refreshed to the custom image, and this was then good for about another month. &nbsp;Then I ran into the problem again. &nbsp;I refreshed again. &nbsp;This time is was good for about another month and a half.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third time this occurred I restored to the factory image, then reapplied all Windows updates I could find and then re-installed all the above software, and thought I was good. &nbsp;A week later the problem arose again and I've been struggling with this ever
 since. &nbsp;The strange thing now is I've found that if I power on the machine and then login, I see the error message. &nbsp;If I do a restart, not a shutdown and power on, then everything looks ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if the issue reappears linked to windows updates being installed, a hardware error or windows repair or something else. &nbsp;If anyone has any suggestions or can point me to any potential underlying causes and long term fixes here I'd be very grateful.
 &nbsp;I've never had any similar issue with a previous version of Windows and this is really puzzling me as to why it occurs. &nbsp;If I can help provide more information, please feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update is stuck at 5&#37;</h2>
                    Upon turning on my computer this morning, Windows 10 started installing an update. &nbsp;After a few minutes, it was at 5%. Now 12 hours later, it is still at 5%. I have a complete blue screen with the words "Working on updates 5% Don't turn off your PC. This
 will take a while. Your PC will restart several times." None of the keys work on the keyboard and I have no cursor. Can I just shut the computer off? Or will that make even more of a mess?

            Have you tried doing a system restore before you installed the software?<br />
<br />
Using Windows 7 or Vista System Restore - How-To Geek<br />
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/<br />
<br />
<br />
If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.<br />
<br />
open the Microsoft System Configuration Utility, click Start, type: msconfig then hit Enter on your board.<br />
<br />
Under the General tab, select Selective startup then click Apply and OK<br />
<br />
Restart your computer. Once in Selective Startup mode, proceed to uninstall the program, go back to msconfig and select Normal startup so Windows will load normally.<br />
<br />
Suppose Diagnostic mode fails to uninstall the troublesome program? Here is another solution? This will require that install a freeware utility called Revouninstaller, there is also a paid version, but the free version should be enough for most users needs.
 Revouninstaller is very detailed and provides insightful details about the program it is attempting to uninstall, including things like registry entries and where the program places files on your hard disk.<br />
<br />
You can find Revo Uninstaller at http://www.revouninstaller.com (freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and registry
 items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.<br />
<br />
After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.<br />
<br />
The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.

<h2>            Move My Documents to the network shared folder</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Doing a save as if a user hits the my documents folder it takes them to the local my docs. Want to change to network share.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;several users running windows 7 with MS office 2003. When using MS office products and doing a save as the box comes up correctly and correctly mapped to the network share of thier my docs. However, I constantly have a problem where the user hits
 the my documents button in the save as box which saves thier my docs to the save location&nbsp;on the local drive. The settings in MS office are set to save to the network share as well as having the my documents mapped to the network share. I just need to figure
 out how to remap that button. Unfournately user trainging on this has not worked and they are saving files all over the place. thanks for any help</p>

            <div>Because Norton is a resource hog. I would suggest removing it and using a more Windows friendly program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Norton and McAfee are the two least Windows friendly security programs and resource hogs to boot. My ISP offers McAfee security suite for free and I refuse to use it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I used to use Avast in conjunction with Windows Defender, (still a decent option), but since MSE became of age, I have been using that. MSE is an Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware and Anti-Malware program all in one. IMO, this is one program MS got right.
<strong><em>And all of these options are freeware</em></strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Should you choose to give it a try, download and save MSE. Remove&nbsp;Norton and install MSE.</div>

            I have a similar problem with my desktop. The last couple of days, the minute I go online it freezes. I can't get it to turn off either so I have to unplug and re-plug the power. It happens just first thing in the morning and then works fine the rest of
 the day. It is frustrating and I have no clue why it happens; unless as you said it is because of the latest download. I think we need some help here.

My problem is that when it freezes I have to hard reset it. Even taking the power cable out doesn't help. The first time it did this nothing would help and I had to take the battery out and I don't think doing these things (taking battery out or hard resetting
 it all the time) is good for my laptop.

I am still waiting for a reply on my problem. It freezes at least twice a day and I have to hard reset my computer. This is not on. Why am I not getting any replies to my question.

<p>I have the same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just noticed last event in my event log prior to it freezing is a warning from gupdate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just disabled the gupdate service.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is intermittent, typically for me it freezes overnight and I have to hard reboot in the morning.&nbsp; Recently it has frozen during use.</p>

            <p>Same problems with hard freezes over here. It was once in a while before the November update, &nbsp;now it's at least once a day. I have just disabled both gupdate services, and will update with any other troubleshooting I perform. I'll also update if disabling
 gupdate took care of it once and for all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is ridiculous, and fairly widespread from what I've seen, I'd like for Microsoft to figure this one out as all those hard resets can't be good for my hard drives.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, so far so good. &nbsp;No freezes in about 36 hours now. &nbsp;Just to reiterate what I did, starting in Services (can be reached from search), on my computer there are two services names Google Update Service, one with gupdate in parenthesis, one with gupdatem.
 &nbsp;For each service, you right click &gt; properties &gt; startup type &gt; disabled. &nbsp;I'm not 100% sure this is the fix I needed, but like I said, so far so good. &nbsp;I'll post again if I have any more freezes.

Well that fix only lasted for about 24 hours and I was so happy until this morning when I saw it froze again and has done it twice today so not sure what is going to fix this. I left my laptop on all the time to see what it does and same problem. So despondent
 with this stupid windows 10 upgrade. I wish I concentrated on the roll back time then I would definitely have gone back to Windows 7. Still the best on the market in my opinion.

    <title>Windows 10 update stuck in reboot cycle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> termina7or2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update stuck in reboot cycle</h2>
                    After installing a windows 10 update, it froze at 100% and I decided that it wasn't ever going to unfreeze so I turned it off. After that it tried to undo the changes from the update but whenever it gets past the post screen, it flashes "Undoing changes
 made to your PC" and restarts. Nothing I've done to reinstall windows has worked. There is no reset option when I insert a flash drive containing the windows media creation tool. Neither the revert versions or the repair windows options work. They both just
 say "Shut down and try again".&nbsp;

            Hi T7.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

                    <p>I was reading something online on Firefox, when all of a sudden my windows 10 start menu opened on its own asking me if I wanted help searching for something. I already turned Cortana off , so why is it popping up ? How do I uninstall it COMPLETLEY for good
 . </p>
<p>Then my start menu opened on it's own to tell me that Rosie Odonnels daughter had been found . I don't care about Rosie Odonnel OR her daughter. WHY is this **** opening MY start menu behind such NONSENSE ?
</p>
<p>I turned off that news feed the day I installed Windows 10 . Why did it turn itself back on , and how can I delete it for good?</p>
<p>If I wanna watch the news , I'll watch the news . </p>

            This old reply from a few years ago does nothing to stop pop ups from the worthless Cortana. I had a chat with MS &nbsp;tech support, 04/27/2017. He gave me this link. He told me this was the do it yourself link, or for only $149 ransom, he would fix it remotely.
 Of course the guarantee did not include fixing the problem of Cortana being a useless pain in the ****, but a solid promise to keep my money either way. ****.I hated the forced upgrades of fully functioning versions of Windows on previous computers. It used
 to be you bought a new computer to get the bundled new version of Office. Now, it is a damn annual subscription. I had the CD so just loaded the previous mine-to-use-forever version.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going either Android tablet, Lexus or Apple.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 Reboot Error Message - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reboot Error Message</h2>
                    <p>After a seemingly normal startup, my screen goes black and shows this message "Reboot and select proper boot drive or insert boot media in selected boot drive and press any key"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This typically occurs after 15 minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Dell Inspirion ONE2320. </p>
<p>64 bit</p>
<p>I "upgraded" to Windows 10 last week. No problems prior to the upgrade. I have (I believe) made certain all drivers, including the Nvidia driver are updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not terribly tech savvy, but I can follow directions. I need help, please.
</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion. I rebooted in safe mode, ran the sfc and received this error message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>...found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran DISM Cleanup and received this message: </p>
<p>
</p><p>error 0x800f0906</p>
<p>The source files could not be downloaded ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>.net framework 3.5 is enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>What next?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the plus side, the Cumulative update finally installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help in this matter. </p>

            I am having a similar issue, except that I am getting the message early in start up so I am unable to get into safe mode.&nbsp; I've tried all the usual keys to interrupt the start up cycle (F1, F4, F8), but all that does is forces a repeat of the message on
 the screen.&nbsp; Any ideas?
