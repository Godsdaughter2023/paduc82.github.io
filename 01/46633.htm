<h2>            Nightmare On Firebase... &#40;Horror Stories&#41;</h2>
                    With Operation Silencer finishing up, I was wondering if anyone has any horror stories from this past weekend? Gold matches with randoms, Silver matches against Reapers, etc... I don't really have any myself but I know I've seen enough Banshee's for awhile
 but for some reason I like fighting the Reapers. A friend told me he did a few gold matches with some randoms and it was INSANE. He said they kept dieing on WAves 3-5 and said the Husk were humping all over the place (LMAO) with the Ravengers being relentless.

<p>That made me lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only horror stories I have involve a couple randoms that were either freeloading or dying non stop.&nbsp; Other than that it went well.&nbsp; I am learning not to use equipment unless I play with friends. I refuse to carry a free loader around.
 So if we get one of those, I have everyone die, then we go back to the lobby and kick that person.&nbsp; Sometimes I lose equipment doing this but its better than trying to carry someone around thats not playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last few days were interesting to say the least..yesterday morning I was with a friend and we picked up 2 RANDOMS (with mics) and even after the plan was made they STILL ran off and died..one guy just left but before hand said "I'll be right back I gotta
 do something" in the middle of gold match vs GETH on wave 9 I think and he didn't comeback till 11!! I was seriously angry lol..</p>

<p>Hosting some games of Bronze on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; It was set to Any Ememy and Any Map.<br />
<br />
One game of Firebase Glacier against the Reapers.&nbsp; Wave 10 fail.<br />
<br />
Hacking objective on the lowest level, I came round the back with my Krogan Soldier with Wraith and saw a team mate being bulldozed by a Brute.&nbsp; So I ran to his aid.&nbsp; Had the sucker down to one bar after hitting him with a couple of Carnages and Inferno Grenades.&nbsp;
 Then I get downed by Cannibal.&nbsp; I didn't have any MediGel at the time so I francially hammered A to extend my life but was flabbergasted when 2 remaining team mates were downed in quick succession.<br />
<br />
I was so ashamed lol.&nbsp; I've started playing Gold now so Bronze should have been really easy.</p>

<p>That's why 80% of the time I do silver now, because of randoms. It's rare to get four friends together at the same time. At least on silver if I get one crappy random and one decent random, and have a friend in the match it's not much of a problem and it's
 still fun/successful.</p>

<p>Nothing too bad. Played with a random who probably died around 50 times during a gold match. I bet the Banshees had horror stories to share though. We were literally killing them in seconds on Gold. This is why we need a platinum difficulty.</p>

<p>I had one epic fail with my Quarian Infiltrator (on wave 10) got downed by a random Grenade and had a teammate walk right over my dead body to kill two husks then decided to ignore me with no threats nearby I still passed on using the medigel...the next
 guy downed after I bled out was the same guy who walked over me..no one could get to him by then and he bled out</p>
<p>Oddly they failed not because of death but because they failed to activate device #4 in time....if only they had had an Infiltrator on the team..or anyone with decent eyesight as it turned out the remaining two walked right past #4 (granted that arrow is
 sometimes tough to see)</p>
<p>Now maybe I should have used the Medigel..but come on dead uncloaked Infiltrator..why not revive?</p>
<p>Oh yeah and starting a Silver Game and having it be two handed by wave 6 was a riot..we got full extraction and each used one cobra and one medigel</p>
<p>Did two laps around the map to get the extraction...really didn't think that would work on Silver but it did.</p>

<p>Speaking of nightmares on Gold, I played with an N7 16 today on Firebase White Geth.<br />
<br />
No joke.&nbsp; I was like CAMA in another thread, I wanted to help him out, to get him 70,000 credits and the Commendation Pack.<br />
<br />
Game starts and the guy runs off to the overhang where Bronze can be done and I'm like "Dude, get back here!&nbsp; This is Gold!".&nbsp; The wave starts and he gets downed.&nbsp; I'm occupied because a team mate quits and the other tries to rescue the downed guy and gets
 downed himself.<br />
<br />
So I'm left there to try and survive pretty much the entire wave on my own.&nbsp; I do my best but I'm not Superman and I wasn't an Inflitrator.&nbsp; It was a Wave 1 wash.<br />
<br />
So&nbsp;I send the guy a message telling him to stick with me so I&nbsp;can help him out and get him his Commmendation Pack, get back to the squad screen and find he's quit the lobby.<br />
<br />
He didn't even have the decency to reply.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>I&#39;m unable to access my partition drive in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I&#39;m unable to access my partition drive in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows 10 (version 1607) on my new computer. The computer's drive is partitioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my previous computer (running Windows 7) set up in much the same way, I was able to see the other drive partition in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I forgetting something that I have to do, or is this a result/bug of the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- The other partition is macOS Sierra, freshly installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I am running no encryption software or tools (like FileVault) for the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- The drive is visible in drive management, but it has no name and the file system is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help that can be given is much appreciated,</p>
<p>-Tanner</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi Tanner,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate your issue regarding with partition issue, give us details on the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to do a dual boot?&nbsp; </li><li>Are the files save on the missing partition appearing on the other disk drive?
</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime you can try to run chkdsk /r and see if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

            <p>Heya John, thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am running the partitioned drive as a dual boot.</p>
<p>And I am able to boot up to the other drive and access the files that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, chkdsk /r didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm very much lost with this, and again, I really appreciate the response.</p>

    <title>Media Control Interface &#40;NMCI&#41; not working properly on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fritsjansenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Control Interface &#40;NMCI&#41; not working properly on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p class="contentCodeblock">Like previous Windows versions, Windows 10 offers application programs a “Media Control Interface” (“MCI” hereinafter) allowing application programs various multimedia functions, like playing an audio file (e.g. .MP3, .WAV or .MID
 files).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><span>On Windows 10, this works OK right after the system is started, but if the user types control-break for whatever reason, the MCI interface no longer works properly: notably, a call to play a music file terminates
 immediately, while normally (if the MCI_WAIT option is specified in the call) it only terminates after the file is played. Remarkably, no error code is given if the file is not played.</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><span>This is clearly a bug in the Windows systems software. The functionality of Windows as it is sold offers various application program interfaces need by programs from Microsoft and third parties.</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><span>I have been using the MCI API in Windows XP for years without any major problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><span>For demonstration purposes, I wrote a minimal program containing nothing more than needed to demonstrate the bug:</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">/* PLAYSIM - very simple program to play sound files using the Windows Media Control Interface */<br />
#include &lt;stdio&gt;<br />
#include &lt;windows&gt;<br />

<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0 ;<br />
}</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">This program can be compiled as a C program (no C++ functionality needed). Invocation: PLAYSIM.EXE &lt;audio file name&gt; (e.g. MP3 file).</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">This program always works fine under Windows XP. Under Windows 10, it
<em>says </em>"Play OK" too, but it does not - after the first ctrl-break issued by the user.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Note that the MCI interface always suffered from the somewhat strange but not really problematic phenomenon that issuing ctrl-break for any other application in the system causes the playing of the sound file to stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">For completeness I note that I am aware that there are other, more modern interfaces to achieve the same functionality. But Windows 10 formally supports the MCI interface, and a conversion of applications using MCI to another API
 is a major effort I would like to avoid.</p>

            Hi Frits, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. &nbsp;<br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Multimedia control allows you to manage Media Control Interface (MCI) devices. These devices include: sound boards, MIDI sequencers, CD-ROM drives, audio players, videodisc players, and videotape recorders and players.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The MCI MIDI sequencer is the MCI system component that plays MIDI files. Applications can play MIDI files easily using MCI, but MCI imposes the following restrictions on MIDI capabilities:</div>
<div><br />
•&nbsp;MCI supports MIDI output only.<br />
•&nbsp;MCI does not allow close synchronization between MIDI events and other real-time events (such as video).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For further assistance, I suggest you to post your question in the MSDN Forums, where we have support professionals, who are well equipped with the knowledge on issues with Media Control Interface (NMCI).

            <p>Sorry to say, but this reaction is really very inappropriate:</p>
<p>1) It basically repeats the text of the manual</p>
<p>2) I told you I am familiar with the functionality of the MCI and try to use programs that worked OK for many years on XP, and work OK on Windows 10 as well if no control-break sequence is entered (which is not always avoidable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue is not how to write programs using the MCI, but a flaw in the operating system code. And if the operating system fails to execute a MCI call, it ought to respond with an error code - but it does not: it ends with return code zero (which means
 "OK" for this particular interface).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Perhaps I confused you by adding a piece of code.</p>
<p>My problem is <em>not</em> how to code a program using the MCI ingterface, but a bug in Windows.</p>
<p>The code can be used by an engineer to recreate my problem.</p>

            <p>Referral to the other forum was not helpful at all: no result.</p>
<p>Note that this is a "defect oriented" problem. I do not expect Microsoft to solve al Windows bugs overnight, but I do expect&nbsp;Microsoft say "thank you for informings us about the bug, and we will file it for future resoluton". Note that I even provided a
 sample to reconstruct the problem. No, the ameple is not the problem itself. Anyone with a basic knowledge of programming will understand that the program is too simple to be the problem, even more so since the program works OK right after system &nbsp;startup
 but fails after I once pressed CTRL-BREAK. Now the solution is to avoid that, but that is a functional limitation.</p>
<p>I have my new laptop now for six weeks and I am still struggeling with unexpected behaviour of Windows 10. It's a shame! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <span>I'm new to Xbox and for Xmas I bought the Minecraft Master Collection for my 8 year old daughter who's a big Minecraft fan. Not knowing better I redeemed the game codes to my account and now my daughter can't access any of the DLC or Minecoins.
 I didn't think this was going to be a problem since we both use the same Xbox system and it's our home system. However after much research I learned that some DLC including Minecraft must be applied directly to an account. I've contacted Microsoft supported
 and they can't or won't remedy the mistake. So now I'm going to have to rebuy the Minecraft DLC and Minecoins for my daughter Xmas present.&nbsp;<span>I think Microsoft is trying to do something good by allowing people share content between devices however
 there's just a lot on confusion about what can be shared and where it can be shared. Microsoft could do a better job educating people on these features and be more flexible on being able to remedy peoples mistakes like mine.

</p><p>As for that stuff not being shared. That is because it is content bought "In game" Stuff that you spend on a in game store can not be shared because it could easily be used to game the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Too many problems to have to deal with just to do a simple upgrade.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First time was after a new install on a new hard drive after 13 updates and most of my programs were reinstalled. Then lock up while trying to type a document in open office.</div>
<div>Restart no hard drive seen.</div>
<div>Second time &nbsp;another full new install on same formatted drive. Get all updated all apps on and I fall asleep watching youtube. Wake up computer is hibernated tap the spacebar and it comes on with a black screen but never gets and farther and no hard drive
 action or led.</div>
<div>restart ......locked out</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Third time i tried installing over windows 7 as an upgrade so it would keep all my factory drivers that it could and apps.</div>
<div>Have all my programs loaded and all windows updates have finished installing with only hangs of a minute or so at times when a program opens but it was working.</div>
<div>win 8 was just done installing an update for Zune program when the screen froze but the mouse would move .Left it like that for better than an hour no change no way to see task manager or anything else.</div>
<div>Powered off and when tried to reboot the message ppears.&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Reboot and Select proper boot device"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>THIS SUCKS!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whats the use of having an expensive cutting edge laptop if you cant get the OS to run more than a few days before it locks you out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 8 boot disc cant auto fix the problem and I cant get in to see any restore point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now if i do a full install of windows 7 to put it back the way i bought it i cant get drivers for half the hardware because they dont have the PROPER freaking digital signatures</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Connected hard drive to wifes computer with a sata to usb.</div>
<div>Can read all the files....They are all read only.</div>
<div>Selected properties for all of the files on that partition.</div>
<div>Unchecked the boxes for hidden and read only.</div>
<div>some files had to be bypassed but it seemed to work for most.</div>
<div>Reinstall harddrive in to laptop and booted windows lauched little swirling dots while it checked and repaired drive then restarted</div>
<div>.....Holding breath ..yes it worked ....... i can get to password screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Used computer for a couple hours working and shut down normally.</div>
<div>Go to bed .</div>
<div>Go to work, come home &nbsp;10 hours later hit power button</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Reboot and Select proper boot device" again</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What gives with this OS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft a little help here.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try entering your BIOS or hit the button at post to select boot options.</p>
<p>It is possible that your machine is trying to boot from the old HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, would this new Drive be a SSD by chance?</p>
<p>If so, there can be issues of how your drives are configured in BIOS...for AHCI or IDE mode.</p>
<p>Some of the SSDs require AHCI mode. In my case Windows would install, but somewhere after the&nbsp;1st reboot I would get a boot device error or just simply a black screen.</p>

            thanks for the suggestions.
<div>The hard drive with the os on it is brand new and is a WD black 2.5 ",750 GB hard disc.</div>
<div>I have never messed with the BIOS on this laptop yet.</div>
<div>My original issue that got me here was a Segate 500 GB (momementus)drive was starting to go having some write errors and taking too long to access info.</div>
<div>Should have been a simple swap with the new drive but it wouldn't run windows update after the swap. since had no win 7 disc at the time figured why not try win 8 if had to buy an OS.</div>
<div>Drive (the WD) got formatted on my wifes computer and you know the rest.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last night after wrote the question on the forum and went through the uncheck the read only box on the properties of all the OS files again it booted up fine when I put it back in my laptop.</div>
<div>Something is locking the drive to read only when it shuts down.</div>
<div>I don't use bitlocker or anything else to lock it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So guess until I hear of an answer cannot shut it down anymore.</div>

            <p>Hello Again,</p>
<p>You might take a look at the Permissions in the Security Tab under Properties.</p>
<p>You may be able to add some permissions to your user name to fix the problem. If that doesn't work, you could try the Advanced settings, and change the Ownership of the C:\ drive to your User Name.</p>

            Hopefully this helps anyone else but I've corrected all that was an issue (with fingers crossed.)
<div>It's taken two months to work it out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My initial problem was correct, one of my original Seagate 500 GB hard drives was starting to fail.</div>
<div>I had bought 2 WD Caviar black 750 GB drives, One to replace the failing drive and one to replace the 2nd drive in the laptop for data.</div>
<div>Both of these drives turned out to be bad and were RMA'd for 2 more of the same and one of those also turned out to be bad but it would only show up after better than a week of use...as of this writing the fourth one is also just starting to click but
 I'm getting ahead of myself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I didn't know in the beginning was that i had gotten an email with a&nbsp;Trojan&nbsp;that none of my scans by any virus scanner found until i had downloaded and tried malware bytes on a second computer.</div>
<div>(I had tried windows security essentials,&nbsp;Norton, avast, avg, and a few other free ones on another computer with the original drive being hooked up by usb cable.)</div>
<div>This particular nasty somehow gets in to the bios so until i flashed the bios i kept having issues with windows 7 &amp; 8.</div>
<div>When I did get either one to install but would reload user data, the email info must of somehow been accessed and the malware would return fouling the bios if there was a restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now combine this with bad hard drive sectors which windows 8&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;like to deal with.</div>
<div>Windows when trying to read from bad sectors would ramp up the hard drive to 100% use but the read and write activity would drop to 0 (as shown by task manager.)</div>
<div>Then for the final curve ball....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Every time that i tried to reload windows 8 eventually it would lock up at some point sometimes i could move the mouse (this was a lot more likely when the hard drives were going bad) sometimes the window or screen would just freeze up with no mouse movement
 at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once everything else stated above was fixed (I have as of this time installed an Intel 520 solid state drive for the OS and programs) i still kept having the lockup issue. Even would lock up in safe mode but aha it was safe mode with networking.</div>
<div>I had let windows&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;download and install updates and one of them is for Qualcomm Atheros - LAN - Qualcomm Atheros AR8131 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.30)</div>
<div><br />
<div>by&nbsp;deactivating&nbsp;this driver as soon as windows started &nbsp;there was no more lock up.</div>
<div>When i was still using a Western digital drive windows was loading too slow to ever get in and deactivate before the computer would freeze.</div>
<div><br />
<div>there was a thread confirming this:&nbsp;</div>
<div>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/where-do-i-report-a-bug/3fdcaa2d-bbe3-4965-b880-03d35942eaed</div>
<div><br />
<div>I installed the driver:</div>
<div>Qualcomm Atheros - LAN - Qualcomm Atheros AR8131 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.<b>2</b>0)</div>
<div>and now my computer is 100%.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So i must retract some of my original post...Windows 8 is now working great and boots in about 8 seconds on this SSD and is amazing when doing any task but i still must get used to it since all this time has been fixing things.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really hope others see this as it was to the point i was going to buy another computer and from what i can find in forums windows is getting a bad reputation for a lot of issues that may have nothing to do with the OS itself.</div>

            <p>I had the same problem after using Paragon Backup 2013. My Windows 8.1 would not boot anymore and gave me this error message. After five hours of making myself acquainted with the issue, I found the solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the computer with the Parted Magic (open source, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/partedmagic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/partedmagic/</a>) boot CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then chose the EFI partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the flag to "boot"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer then booted like nothing had ever been wrong with it.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer Search very slow, and a couple of other things - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wfmc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer Search very slow, and a couple of other things</h2>
                    The search window in the upper right corner of Windows Explorer offers no options that I can identify.&nbsp; I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
1&nbsp; Is there a way to access search options you would like to use as were available in XP?<br />
<br />
2&nbsp; I just went the first hour into a search for a filename beginning with "cv1".&nbsp; I think I am searching the C: drive, but this search has run so long now, bringing about partial filename results that do not display "cv1" in the truncated name, that I am wondering
 if it is also searching the other drive in this laptop, of if a default exists, somewhere, that is also telling it to search within the file for that string.
<br />
<br />
If the default is to search not just filenames but every last byte in every file can this be changed or somehow made available as a list of search options as existed in all previous versions of Windows?<br />
<br />
Now it could be that my system is pretty old and slow.&nbsp; It's 2 months old tomorrow and is a HP Envy 17 Extreme version with an i7 940 XM quad-core extreme processor, 8 gigs of RAM and a very slow (almost glacial) 256GB SSD main drive.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can you shed some light on why a partial name search takes so long?&nbsp; I thought System 7 was built for speed?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
3&nbsp; I store some data files on the C: drive, but mostly all my data files exist on the 1TB D: drive, arranged in various large and deep file systems.&nbsp; A growing problem for those that actually do know what a file is, and how to construct logical folder systems
 to manage them, is the overbearing insistence built into the operating system to urge users to store them somewhere under Documents and Settings.&nbsp; In fact, the first items listed, suggesting they might be of some importance, are actually not top level folders.&nbsp;
 Things like "desktop", "downloads", "recent places".&nbsp; I really do not know where in the file system these things are, since they are not top level folders, but apparently someone's interpretation of what might be a user's primary choices.&nbsp; Because I do not
 know where these things are, I am loath to even click on them.&nbsp; Surprisingly enough, since I do my best to place anything I download in the folder where I want it to live, why on earth would I want to visit a download folder?&nbsp; Are there additional copies of
 all my downloads there too?&nbsp; If so, why store additional copies of downloads for users that have somehow managed to figure out how to store downloads where they want them to go, each and every time?<br />
<br />
The "desktop" link is equally fascinating.&nbsp; What a useful feature?&nbsp; I can boot it up, wait until the desktop shows up and the indecipherable Apple progress circle stops, click on the desktop icon for Windows Explorer, then click on "Desktop" and get a different
 version of what I had already seen on my desktop.&nbsp; Definitely a useful, first order, top of the list tool!<br />
<br />
Is there a way to simply eliminate these completely useless (at least for me) top level choices?&nbsp; And is there a way, regardless of how complex and deeply hidden from the user, way to set your very own, as in "personal computer", defaults?&nbsp; I actually do know
 what/where locations I would like programs to default to.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
4&nbsp; System Administrator.&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; Laptops, to some extent, should be considered rather of a personal computer.&nbsp; Being somewhat personal, and in this case owned by me and occasionally shared only with my cat (when she walks or rubs up on it), who should
 the System Administrator be?&nbsp; Is there a way that I could become the System Administrator of my very own computer?&nbsp; That would be nice.<br />

<p>3. I saw this problem in windows 8 and 8.1 also. Please try this: Change your microsoft password. You can connect remotly likewise with old password.</p>

    <title>Hidden power off button&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard__s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hidden power off button&#33;</h2>
                    I'm currently suffering from two new Windows 8 installations - an upgrade from Win 7, downloaded from Microsoft, and a pre-installed version on my wife's Acer Laptop. The only good thing about the Acer installation is that it has a power button on the
 task bar, whereas my own requires me to take the cursor up to the top right corner, wait for the right hand bar to appear, then cursor down to "settings" at the bottom, click there, and finally find the power button. Is there some way of migrating the power
 button out of settings, where it certainly doesn't belong, onto the task bar, or even, the desktop?

<p>-This issue started after installing tablet drivers</p>
<p>-Yes, updates were installed, it's new laptop I have and everything is freshly installed including all updates</p>
<p>-No. As I said I have this pc from yesterday so I just installed a few things here.</p>
<p>-It's Windows 10 tablet. It's graphic tablet. It's supposed to be plugged to my laptop. Model of it is Pentagram Designer p2700 + HP laptop</p>
<p>-Yes, I already tried. But back then pressure of my pen didn't work too, after installing it 6th time pressure started to work but lag stayed.&nbsp;</p>

            We appreciate your response. There may be a possibility that this lag is caused by driver incompatibility. We suggest that you get in touch with your device manufacturer's support site and request for the latest available driver that is compatible with
 your current Windows 10 version.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            No network connection available - PPP Device drivers missing</h2>
                    <p>I was gifted a Windows 7 laptop <span>(details below) </span>for an orphanage in Mexico. When I received it, Device Manager showed an error on all of the following Network Adapters: Atheros AR8152 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller, Broadcom Virtual
 Wireless Adapter, WAN Miniport(IP), WAN Miniport(IPv6), and WAN Miniport(Network Monitor). All of them were for the OS being unable to load the device driver,
<span>(This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31))</span>. I was able to clear the first two errors by uninstalling the driver and reinstalling it.&nbsp;</p>
<span>(This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31))</span>. I was able to clear the first two errors by uninstalling the driver and reinstalling it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three WAN Miniport errors could not be cleared by doing this. I was able to clear them by using the process described in this question:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/windows-8-wan-miniport-issue/e8b95e1f-ac58-452f-9096-6d923533a536
 but I do not have the devcon_x64.exe files described, so now the WAN Miniports do not appear in the Device Manager list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still unable to connect to a network, either wired or wireless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer details: Dell Inspiron N7010 (Core i5 M460 at 2.53 GHz) running original install of Windows 7 home premium 64-bit, SP1. 4 GB RAM. Last installed Windows Updates appear to be dated 11/10/2016, I think this was the last time the computer was powered
 on before today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, perhaps it's related, if I try to run the Network Diagnostics, it fails because the Diagnostics Policy Server is not running. The Diagnostics Policy Server cannot be started manually or automatically at startup.</p>

<p>Update, since there was nothing on the computer that I cared about (no personal docs, etc), I did a factory reset. I still have the same issue, however, no WAN Miniport drivers and not able to connect to either wireless or wired Ethernet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw another post that describes how to edit the netrasa.inf file for this very issue, but I get an "Access Denied" error when I try to save the edited file. (I'm running an administrator account).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no restore points available, BTW, or I would have tried that first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can't get an answer here, I'll try downloading the Windows 7 ISO file from Dell and just do a clean install. I just hate to do that, as I know I'll have to spend many days installing updates.</p>

<p>I was able to get the wired Ethernet port working after the factory reset, so I used that to begin the cycle of updates. Eventually after numerous cycles of search/update/reboot, I was able to also get the wireless port to work as well. Still no WAN Miniport
 drivers, but apparently they are not required for this. (Other posts imply that they are only needed for dial-up access, but who does that now?)</p>
<p>It is now fully up to date, and I've installed the other software needed, so it's ready to go. Still not sure why neither the wireless nor wired ports worked before, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for future reference, if anyone knows how to get permission to edit the .inf files, I'd like to know. (I suppose you could take the drive out, mount it as a non-boot (auxiliary) drive in another computer, and you could edit it that way. If I'd had personal
 files that I wanted to preserve, I could have done that, but I didn't, so the factory reset seemed easier.)</p>
