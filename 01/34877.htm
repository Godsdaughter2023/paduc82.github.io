<h2>            Windows Update for Vista and NVIDIA issues</h2>
                    <p>I updated Windows Vista yesterday (9/16) and 'accepted' all recommended and 3 optional updates.&nbsp; The optional updates were regarding NVIDIA Controller and NVIDIA GeForce, as well as HP Quick Launch.&nbsp; When I try to play the games installed on my PC (e.g.
 Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, etc.), the display is black and white and fuzzy.&nbsp; I've tried making changes in the display settings with no success.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>There is a saying if it ain't broke don't try to fix it. </p>
<p>-=- </p>
<p><br />
Updates come in three flavors. The first are Important, or Critical, Updates, which are
<b><i><u>necessary</u></i></b> to install in order to fix security holes or major issues within Vista.
</p>
<p>The second type is Recommended updates, which are updates to various components of the operating system that
<b><i><u>should</u></i></b> be installed for proper functionality. </p>
<p>The last type, called Optional Updates, are new features, updates, or Ultimate Extras that are<u>
</u><i><b><u>not</u></b> </i>necessary to install for proper functionality of the operating system or applications</p>

<h2>            &#34;password is incorrect&#34; after using Windows 7 Easy Transfer</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>The problem is that the "password is incorrect" after using Windows 7 Easy Transfer.</p>
<p>I have already&nbsp;researched this problem on the Internet and in online forums.&nbsp; Many people seem to have the same issue/problem/question stated above.&nbsp; Noone has a solution.&nbsp; Several Microsoft technical support personnel have provided answers that do not solve
 the problem, explain what is going on, or are directed at solving the wrong problem.&nbsp; For example many answers&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;that Microsoft policy does not allow providing help in retrieving passwords.&nbsp; OK, but that is not what is being asked for.&nbsp; There is a
 problem and it would be good if someone acknowledged that there is a problem and -- at&nbsp;least -- it is being researched if there is not already a solution.&nbsp; Anyway, as many have already asked, here is my take on trying to get a solution to this problem:</p>
<p>Used Windows 7 Easy Transfer to move user accounts and files between an old Vista 32-bit PC to a new Windows 7 64-bit PC. The transfer was done over a network without using an Easy Transfer cable. There were no errors during transfer and user accounts on
 Windows 7 PC seemed to be correctly transferred. After logging in to a user account on the new PC a window titled "Protected Content Migration" opens. Text states that protected content was transferred and requests a password be entered in a password field.
 I entered the correct user account password from the Vista PC, but the password was not accepted and this error message is printed "The Password is incorrect". All accounts transferred had exactly the same issue even though the correct original Vista PC account
 passwords were entered correctly.</p>
<p>Researched this problem on the Internet and a suggestion to resolve issue is that the password being requested is the Easy Transfer PIN used to start the transfer. I re-transferred user accounts and entered the Easy Transfer PIN when the "Protected Content
 Migration" windows requested a password. Still receive the same error message "The Password is incorrect" on all user accounts.</p>
<p>Need to determine what password is being requested. I believe it should be the original user account password on the old computer, but maybe it should be the Easy Transfer PIN. If it is neither of these what should it be? If it is either of these, which
 one? If it is the original user account password on the old computer or the Easy Transfer PIN, why aren't these being accepted since I tried both. Once the correct password is available is it possible to open the "Protected Content Migration" window to enter
 the correct password without having to use Easy Transfer to transfer the accounts?</p>
<p>Finally, what is the protected content that is transferred? How do I find out what it is?&nbsp; There does not seem to be anything missing from the user accounts that is easily visible to me. If the protected content is not necessary then not being able to access
 it may not be a problem. Since I do not know what the protected content is, I have no way to evaluate if not having it available is important.</p>

<p>Pegasus,</p>
<p>Which password? The Windows logon password? Yes</p>
<p>Have you tried logging on as Administrator? Yes</p>
<p>Or using your USB-stick based password key file? No, but why?&nbsp; I know what all the logon passwords are and they were all correctly entered.&nbsp; Again, the question that needs to be answered -- by someone who knows -- what password is being requested?&nbsp; Why are
 all the suggestions "try this or try that".&nbsp; No one seems to be able to state what password is being requested or why.&nbsp; What is the protected content that is transferred.&nbsp; I don't believe there is anything like DRM content on the original system.&nbsp; Why does
 this request appear?&nbsp; Does anyone know?</p>

<h2>            Resizing a dual boot drives</h2>
                    Computer is a Gateway ZX6800 all in one touch screen computer, 1 TB HD, 8 Megs RAM, running Win 10 Pro on a dual boot system. One drive is 762 Gig with 609 Gig usable, The other 155 Gig with 27 Gig usable. Can I shrink the 762 Gig drive by 162 Gig and
 extend the 155 Gig by the same amount?&nbsp; Can I do that without destroying the info on the 155 Gig drive. If so, how can I do that? I have EaseUS Partition Master installed but do not want to use it until I get more information on the process.

            Hi  frajul2,
<br />
<br />Yes you can do that with EaseUS without any data destruction it is a very good utility for that sort of work and is non-destructive when resizing partitions . ..

            In disk Manager, does it show just DIsk 0 or is there also a DIsk 1.
<br />
<br />If there is only a DIsk 0, then yes you can resize the partitions the way you want.
<br />
<br />If there is also a Disk 1, then there are 2 separate physical drives, You won't be able to move space from one physical device to the other.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>thank you for your help. 2 days ago a Microsoft technician has done the PC clean boot with no success. Windows 10 and the former windows 8.1 they do start on SELECTIVE STARTUP by default. Yesterday Microsoft technicians did take control of my PC and they
 went into Local Service, in windows audio endpoint builder,&nbsp;and tried to remove this file with no success. Both technician hung up on me because they could not fix the problem. Now I have a different file that I cannot delete in %temp%. I have followed your
 instruction for a clean boot but is not working. This problem came with the windows 10 installation but Microsoft cannot fix it so far. I still have problem with LibreWriter and the new file that I cannot delete is a LibreOffice file.</p>
<p>I hope somebody will help me because I cannot use the PC in this condition and I don't want to perform a factory reinstall because Microsoft has not provided us with any CD.</p>
<p>Thank you again</p>

            <p>This file is still in my PREFETCH. Several Microsoft technicians have tried to remove this file with no success.</p>
<p>Cannot go back to windows 8.1 because some files are missing in Windows.old. </p>
<p>The Pc refuse to do a Restore without giving any reason. The only thing available to me is the complete reinstallation of the OS. This file does not belong in Windows 10 because Windows 10, DO NOT SUPPORT MKD file. Thank you&nbsp;Microsoft, you have brought a
 VIRUS in my PC and you refuse to fix the problem.</p>
<p>2 Microsoft technicians have hung up on me when could not fix the problem. One&nbsp;supervisor has tried to remove this file going into Service, Windows audio endpoint builder with no success.</p>
<p>I found something else wrong on this PC. When I start the PC,I write in my password and the PC start booting. After few seconds the screen becomes black and after 4-5 seconds return to booting.</p>
<p>LibreOffice is not working properly. It opens documents in LibreDraw when should open in LibreWriting.</p>
<p>When I am writing a letter in LibreWriting the page stops and start.</p>
<p>Well I must conclude that this is the wonderful new Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thank you for sending me the Email.</p>

            I have already tried what you are suggesting. This MKD is not a windows 10's file. What is doing in windows 10 I don't know. This file changes when you remove it and then comes back,like in safe mode leaves and then comes back. It changes the name and
 you delete the file the MKD file comes back.Microsoft does not care at all.They want me to reinstall the OS.My PC came with windows 8 and If I must do a reinstall I will stay with windows 8.1. &nbsp;

            <p>I have the same issue and question about this file as I routinely clear out prefetch temp and %temp% as instructed by Microsoft techs many years ago. I posted a question to the community in early April and never got a decent response . You can not and I
 mean never delete this file. I have been able to rename and delete but another file comes immediately to replace. The message says that it is open in the windows audio endpoint builder. My question is what is it why is it there. I have repeatedly called Microsoft
 no one can answer. The response I get vary from did you try to take control of it??? DUH of course. I do not think that anyone even read the question or looked into the prefetch folder- I think everyone must have this file and my thinking is it is similar
 to predate file that used to be in this folder during earlier versions of windows but &gt;MKD is persuasive&nbsp;sql and the Microsoft reps say it is not a Microsoft file. I want to get it out of my system if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PfPre_405196c1.mkd file </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This file is in my prefetch folder and can never be deleted. It is dated the same day I "upgraded" to windows 10 . Does anyone know what this file is and what application the .mkd file extension might be coming from&nbsp;? &nbsp;I looked online&nbsp;and there is very little
 about the .mkd extension . I never had file in prefetch that could not be deleted under any circumstance. &nbsp;One site stated that the .MKD is from persuasive SQL. Please any information</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not&nbsp; the only post about this particular file on the Microsoft support site. There are no solutions posted that I can find</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I should have included the error message that you receive when you try to delete the file. "<strong>The action can not be completed because the file I open in the Windows Audio Endpoint builder. What is this and why is this file open</strong>. Should I close
 it and how. I've tried everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response by the way. The file did not delete in safe mode or with admin rights. However when I renamed it I was able to delete the file dated 3/11/2016 .
<strong>The same file named PfPre_405196c1.mkd file dated 4/10/2016 immediately replaced this. It this the "predat" data file that used to show up in the prefetch folder one per day when I was using a previous version of windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really want to know is what is this .mkd file?? It showed up when I "up"graded can not be deleted unless the name is changed and to the best of my knowledge the .mkd extension is not a Microsoft file.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

 ficar te dando dicas de como conseguir baixar o jogo.</p>

<p>isso quer dizer q vc precisa cancelar antes da fatura do cartão ser fechada q ai a ms remove ele, se vc só cancelar depois, não tem mais como ser removido e eles não ressarcem no mês seguinte (pois como diz: sem re-embolso, por isso é preciso cancelar)</p>

    <title>Windows 10, User Access Control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckdufresne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, User Access Control</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 10.&nbsp; I used it for about a month and I then decided to change my password.&nbsp; In doing so, something happened and now I am listed as a guest and not administrator.&nbsp; When I go to control panel and try to change the account type the User
 Access Control screen pops up and says to continue, type an administrator password,, and then click yes.&nbsp; Problem is no box pops up so I can enter the password and even if there was, the "yes" box in the UAC is gray and not functioning.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I try to go
 to into safe mode or try any function to answer the problem the UAC pops up again.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's very frustrating because when I search for answers I get them but can never get by the UAC probably because I am signed in as a guest.&nbsp; Help!

            <p>Hi Pditty1741,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ksuser.dll issues are caused by issue with Microsoft DirectX.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ksuser.dll file is one of many files contained in the DirectX software collection. Since direct X is in-built in windows 7, I would suggest you to run SFC (System File Checker)
 scan on the computer to fix the system file errors on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then type
<b>cmd</b> in the Start Search box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b>cmd</b> in the Programs list, and then click
<b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><b>sfc /scannow</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer:</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased a&nbsp;Seagate PersonalCloud (NAS) and installed it on my laptop which runs Windows 10 V1803.&nbsp; I can see the NAS in Network and via the IP address, however I can't access the files for the NAS on my computer.&nbsp; When I double click the NAS in Network
 it just opens up a new browser and goes to the IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted Seagate on several occasions to troubleshoot, however they are determined it's an issue with Microsoft.&nbsp; They said they are aware of this so-called issue and are working through it with Microsoft, however they won't tell me what the exact
 issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would greatly appreciate any help anyone can give me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>windows xp repair&#47;reinstall, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> needhelpwithwindowsxp  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows xp repair&#47;reinstall,</h2>
                    <p>Questions about windows xp repair/reinstallation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my laptop I have preinstalled windows xp.&nbsp; I use windows xp sp3 and I have a disk from dell that is a reinstallation cd Microsoft windows xp home edition service pack 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have microsoft office 2003 and if I have any problems with it I reinsert the cd and it enables repairs.&nbsp; Alternatively i can remove it and reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am considering a repair/reinstallation of the windows xp sp3 and I do not have a windows installation disk.&nbsp; I only have a reinstallation disk and it is for sp2 and not sp3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Can windows xp be repaired in a similar fashion as office 2003 if I use as windows installation disk as compared with a reinstallation disk?</p>
<p>2) What are the pros and cons of an installation disk in comparison to a reinstallation disk?</p>
<p>3) Once i replaced a hard drive and it came with preinstalled windows.&nbsp; Is this how&nbsp;to go from sp2 to sp3&nbsp;or was sp3 downloaded as part of a windows update?&nbsp; And if I reinstall windows xp sp2 will I then be able to use windows update to go to sp3?</p>
<p>4) When I had replaced my hard drive in 2007 I remembered that I needed to get drivers from support.dell.com.&nbsp; If I need new drivers can I download them now and save them to the desktop and then install them later or must they be downloaded after either
 a repair or a reinstallation?</p>
<p>5) I currently only use wifi and do not use a cat 5 ethernet connection.&nbsp; If I repair windows will I not be able to connect to the internet to download drivers unless I have an ethernet connection or will I somehow be able to get wifi to work without having
 new drivers?</p>
<p>6) Can I&nbsp;use a external hard drive or flash drive and download files to them now and then use them as the source later for the files before I attempt repair or reinstallation?</p>
<p>7) What are the pitfalls in the repair process and what failsafe methods are available in case of an unexpected problem?</p>
<p>8) What are the pitfalls in the reinstallation process and what failsafe methods are available in case of an unexpected problem?</p>
<p>9) Besides the my documents section and the deskttop what other areas should I check to make sure that i save and transfer all needed files? ( common programs that i&nbsp;have used&nbsp;include office 2003 with outlook which has a database of contacts, turbo tax for
 multiple years, adobe reader pdf files, and AOL installed software with mail accounts with sent and saved emails.</p>

            <p>The computer I am using has a slow boot of approximately 7 minutes after installing MSE which added approximately 1.5 minutes to the boot per the information in Soluto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have scanned in full mode using MSE for 15 to 21 hours several times and it found no malware.&nbsp; I scanned in full mode using malwarebytes it found no malware.&nbsp; I also used Hijackthis and Kapersky TDDSKiller and it found no malware.&nbsp; Others were used too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although no malware was found per the other thread it would be safer to go through the repair/reinstallation as though it is contaminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a reinstallation cd for windows xp from Dell and anticipate getting a windows installation cd.&nbsp; I was told this would provide more flexability for the installation but I do not understand what this means yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each web site that I have visited adds another precaution or another pitfall and it appears to me that I need to learn a lot more before I get started so that I can have a working system and the shortest amount of downtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had found a video tutorial by pc world (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/157673/how_to_reinstall_windows_xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.pcworld.com/article/157673/how_to_reinstall_windows_xp.html</a>&nbsp;) with apprximately 200 recommend and 100 did not recommend
 so if you know a better video tutorial that would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled many programs and reinstalled them and they work better with a reinstall.&nbsp; This may be the same thing with the operating system.&nbsp; This may be corrupted software as opposed to malware.&nbsp; In any case please let me know the steps as though
 it is a malware issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In viewing another web site it reports that I should use add remove programs to uninstall my programs one by one for licensing issues to get the uninstall registered on the server web site?&nbsp; Please explain for windows or office or any other programs.&nbsp; Each
 web site has something else to watch out for and this step was not mentionned on many of the other web sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please indicated the steps and pitfalls and fail safe methods as per the first entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            First of all, the Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD <u><b>is</b></u> an installation CD! The only difference is it's a branded OEM CD and they just like to use the word "reinstallation." I guess they figure that since they are the ones who install XP at
 the factory, if a Dell purchaser will ever use that disk, then by definition, he or she will be reinstalling XP.
<div><br />
<div>What's nice about the Dell XP CD is that it is tied to the BIOS and XP is pre-activated. There is never a need to activate Windows since it's already (and perpetually) activated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your Dell XP CD is at the SP2 level, then you will need to install SP3 and then all the other post-SP3 security updates. PA Bear already provided good instructions in one of the other threads you began. Here is the link he provided again:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&amp;t=44636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&amp;t=44636</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>You should definitely have everything you need to successfully reinstall Windows (and upgrade it) saved to your external hard drive first, including your SP3 standalone executable, IE8 installation file, antivirus installation file, all your drivers, etc.
 Make sure you have everything handy before you format your drive!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>You are making things more confusing about using the word Repair. Repairing WIndows through the Recovery Console or running a Repair Install of XP ain't gonna get rid of malware. If your goal is to be 100% confident you are malware-free, then a Clean Install
 is your ONLY option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By all means, copy your data to an external drive. Then copy it back whenever you'd like. Backing up "program files" like those belonging to Microsoft Office won't work. You will need to reinstall all your programs. As far as saved AOL e-mails, that is
 not a Windows question so I can't help you with that. You can Google for more information or post to an AOL user forum.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the data you do want to save, only you know the answer to this. Yes, most will likely be in your My Documents folder, but you may have saved files to any old place on your hard drive. Just go through every folder and see what you want to save.
 If you're not sure, copy every single file you have!</div>

            <p>Some of the information in your post I did&nbsp;not understand.&nbsp; What did you mean by tied to the bios?&nbsp; And what did you be by pre-activated?&nbsp; What does activating windows mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the reinstallation disk for reinstallation then at a later time if the operating system need to be repaired is that possible with the reinstallation CD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have the option to install the operating system using an installation cd will I then not have more options in case a later repair is needed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime in 2012 Microsoft will have windows 8.&nbsp; If there is a small chance that this computer which is 1.6 ghz, 2 mb ram, 256 video ram can use windows 8 I would then consider another reinstallation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise I will have used either a dell reinstallation
 cd which has windows xp home sp2 or a new windows xp professional sp2 depending on which gives the most flexability or options for any possible future operating system repairs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had bought my dell inspiron 9400 laptop computer in 2005 and had the hard drive replaced in 2007.&nbsp; When the hard drive was replaced under extended warantee dell sent to me another set of installation disks.&nbsp; So I no long can tell which is the old and which
 is the new on some of the disks.&nbsp; I'll list all the disks I have and their contents.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Application already installed on your computer:&nbsp; for reinstalling dell tools system software:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above 12 disks are what I have for the reinstallation and some are either duplicates or updates.&nbsp; I do not want to install the McAfee antivirus and I am not sure whether it will be automatically installed or whether it is an option.&nbsp; I would like to
 reinstall MSE.&nbsp; I may need to install the McAfe and then uninstall.&nbsp; If i have to install Mcafee then the add remove programs failed to uninstall all of the antivirus software and I will then need to run the special removal tool again.&nbsp; Is this something I
 can download now onto the external hard drive and use when needed or must I have a downloaded browser and an internet connection to get and properly use this antivirus software removal tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.A. Bear indicated that with the combined issues that i am having that I have malware.&nbsp; This is in spite of the numerous malware scans whether norton, trend micro, hijackthis, kapersky etc.&nbsp; There was a period of time in which i did not actively update
 the antivirus definitions and this convinced him that this must be a malware problem.&nbsp; So it seems sensible to replace the operating system and just make sure all the bases are covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time I would like to understand if there is a way to determine if corrupted files are the problems and if there is no detected malware by numerous scans whether corrupted files can be fixed.&nbsp; That is does windows xp give you the option to run
 a repair with either the reinstallation disk or&nbsp;a brand new&nbsp;installation disk?&nbsp; If you have no detected malware and then perform a repair and the system&nbsp;appears to work&nbsp;normally again is the problem that the malware still has altered the registry and this
 is missed by the repair tool?&nbsp; So it is essentially an incomplete repair?&nbsp; Is that the reason for always doing a complete reinstall or is it something else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i really have not read enough about the process and must spend the time to read what was in the prior threads.&nbsp; Based on what I know as of this moment I would make these steps and i bet there are lots of errors.&nbsp; But here goes anyway. Please correct me anywhere
 I get the steps out of order, make a mistake&nbsp;or miss a step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) back up all files to an external hard drive.&nbsp; Currently I am backing up my documents and desktop but I will need to learn how to backup files of contacts within microsoft outlook, aol etc</p>
<p>2) run a malware scan on the external hard drive.&nbsp; This has already been done with MS and malwarebytes.&nbsp; These are potentially malware contaminated&nbsp;files but since they are not the operating system files and since they passed the malware scans they are safe
 to reinstall?</p>
<p>3) go to control panel &gt; add remove programs &gt; uninstall programs one by one so that i will be able to install them on a computer with the same or different operating sytem (office 2003 etc)</p>
<p>4) insert the reinstallation (#7 of the disks listed above)&nbsp;or installation optical disk ( I may get a windows xp professional sp2 operating system disk)&nbsp;into the optical drive and turn the computer off</p>
<p>5) upon reboot press f8 with the dell computer and boot from the cd rom?</p>
<p>6) this cd will then format the hard drive and install the operating system on the hard drive</p>
<p>7) I will not be connected to the internet so i do not need the firewall or antivirus yet.</p>
<p>8) insert the drivers cd&nbsp; (choose between #2 or #6 of the disks listed above)</p>
<p>9) open control panel&gt; security center&gt; turn on windows firewall</p>
<p>10) insert the dell tools system software cd to be able to connect to the internet (disk # 1 of the disks listed above)</p>
<p>11) somehow get windows instead of intel software to set up wireless?&nbsp; somehow connect to the internet?</p>
<p>12) will there be a prompt to perform windows updates? or will I now do this manually?&nbsp; Will one of the windows updates convert xp sp2 into xp sp3?&nbsp; Will there be numerous reboots with numerous updates.&nbsp; This is likely to take one or more hours?</p>
<p>13) when will I have a browser to&nbsp;download and install MSE (will IE be installed with the windows xp sp2 operating system so that I can open the browser to get to MSE, or will IE be part of the windows updates?)</p>
<p>14) go to suppot.dell.com and download updated drivers</p>
<p>15) use copy and paste to move files from the external hard drive to the my documents section of the &nbsp;internal hard drive?</p>
<p>16) install office 2003 and other programs</p>
<p>17) download browsers (mozilla, chrome, safari etc)&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I was having the problems I checked the hardware on my computer by booting and pressing the f12 key.&nbsp; This opened dell diagnostics and all of the hardware passed.&nbsp; It skipped one step and that was flashing the bios.&nbsp; I have a dead battery and it indicated
 that it only can flash the bios with battery power.&nbsp; If flashing a bios is a part of the windows installation process then It would fail at that point as I will only have electrical power.&nbsp; I hope that this is not a part of the reinstall process.&nbsp; If it is
 then I would need to get a battery before I replace the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not set up microsoft outlook since 5 years ago and no longer remember how to do that.&nbsp; But I anticipate I will need to get isp codes or use smtp or something like that?&nbsp;I'll have to google search for the aol configuration too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using wifi and speed test.net my download speed is 1.45 Mbpsand upload speed 0.36 Mbps.&nbsp; With this speed in mind approximately how long does it take for the operating system reinstallation and how long is it expected to take for downloads/installations including
 reboots&nbsp;of all of the windows updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is for a sp2 download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28</a>&nbsp; Do I need to download it first or instead go directly to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24</a>&nbsp;and download sp3.&nbsp; How do I download now and them get them to the proper place on my internal drive after the operating system installation.&nbsp; Is it somehow a simple copy and paste somewhere
 or does the operating system look and find it on the external hard drive to place the files in the right place?&nbsp;The download options are run, save and cancel.&nbsp; If i click on save&nbsp;now can it go to the extrnal hard drive for use later?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am guessing that this is a lot diffrent than the word, excel, powerpoint, adobe files etc which is a copy and paste to my documents?&nbsp; And the same for the drivers,&nbsp; the updated drivers could be downloaded somehow to the external drive and then somehow
 go to the right place after operating system installation?&nbsp; How do i find each driver that is old to make sure it seeks a new driver that is on the external drive?&nbsp; Where are all the drivers populated to go through the process? Do I somehow skip this step
 by not installing the drivers on the dll cd and somehow install drivers from the external drive the first time.&nbsp; How do I do this?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            @needhelpwithwindowsxp, first of all be cool. I will try to keep it as simple as possible.
<div><br />
<div>Service packs (SP) are actually the updates of their respective programs. In this case, Windows XP SP2 is mostly used and sold. So you have got Windows XP SP2.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>As @Daavee clearly said:</b></div>
<div><i><span>"First of all, the Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD&nbsp;</span><u><b>is</b></u><span>&nbsp;an
 installation CD! The only difference is it's a branded OEM CD and they just like to use the word "reinstallation." I guess they figure that since they are the ones who install XP at the factory, if a Dell purchaser will ever use that disk, then by definition,
 he or she will be reinstalling XP."</span></i></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>SP3 is nothing but just an update of Windows having the latest security and maintenance features. So SP3 can be installed (ie. Windows can be upgraded from SP2) as well as it can be removed (ie. Windows XP SP3 can be downgraded to SP2).</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>1) </b>Yes, Windows can be repaired in a similar fashion, but you can install SP2 and then you can upgrade to SP3. Installing windows XP SP2 takes about half an hour and even SP3 takes about 25 minutes (in an average computer). Here there won't be a
 reinstallation disk, but you will have the Windows Setup disk, which will have the reinstall command.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>2) </b>However I have not seen any difference between an installation disk and a reinstallation disk (as reinstallation means a complete deletion of the program and installation of a fresh copy of the program - like installing the program). The disk
 you are having is probably the one with the Windows XP setup, as I have. So, I am sorry I can't help with this point.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>3) </b>SP3 may be available for installation through CD but it is always available at Microsoft downloads website.
<u>Do not change the hard drive for a different service pack.</u>&nbsp;If it was preinstalled, then it means that it has a setup pack. THUS, YOU CAN GET THE SETUP OF YOUR NEEDED SERVICE PACK from Microsoft. Just download and install it. If you want to downgrade,
 just uninstall it.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>4) </b>Drivers are nothing but just those accessories to the operating system that help it to&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;the special feature / hardware etc. (eg. video, sound, gamepad etc.). Thus you need them to identify the specific hardware. However you can install
 the driver at anytime. IF YOU DOWNLOAD IT NOW AND SAVE ON THE <b>DESKTOP </b>THEN THEY WILL BE DELETED WHILE THE REINSTALLATION AS A REINSTALLATION FIRST FORMATS (Deleting the drive and creating a new one) THE SYSTEM DRIVE (C:\ for most computers) AND INSTALLS
 THE NEW WINDOWS. So it would be waste to download now and save on the desktop as it will be deleted during reinstallation.&nbsp;<b>If you want to save the drivers, then save them in a CD or some other external drive (pen drive etc.) and install them after the reinstallation
 is complete.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>5) </b>Windows XP comes with preinstalled WiFi drivers (according to my knowledge). But I have never tried this thing before, I automatically got the ethernet connection read by my System. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND
<b>Download the drivers now and save them to a CD and install it afterwards.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>6) </b>Yes you can surely use an external drive for saving your files. I would recommend you to do so. It is always better.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>7) </b>Please make sure that during the repair process, the power supply is correct and there is no interruption in between the process. Even if something bad happens, don't worry until your repair CD is not broken and you can't get another repair CD.
 Nothing will happen and try it again until the repair is done.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>8)&nbsp;</b>During reinstallation, suddenly the power may go out and the installation might stop. So ensure that the power is there. If something like that happens, don't worry, once again charge your laptop and start the installation once again.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>9) </b>While the reinstallation process, the setup will only try to uninstall and reinstall the windows OS and will only format the windows drive. So until you don't format the whole system for reinstallation, you should mainly concentrate on the ones
 in your system drive. However the main place is "Windows Directory \ Documents and settings". So you can see and save all that you need from this.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>So, I think that this might be useful, but I would once again suggest not to completely rely on my article, as I am not a professional person, just a person using Windows XP since 6 years. I have experience but since this is a bigger issue of OS, you
 might want to rely on a professional for this case.</b></div>

<h2>            How do I Minimize All Open Windows Except The Active One in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to minimize open windows except the active one (similar to on a Mac)&nbsp;in Windows 10?&nbsp; I find this to be a really useful feature that helps to quickly declutter the screen while keeping multiple windows and applications running.&nbsp; I tried Windows
 Key + M but that hides all the windows and then one has to press Alt + Tab to tab back to the active window.&nbsp; Is there a single key combination that will do this instead?

<li>When I try to change the speech settings in the Speech option, I am unable to choose anything apart from English(UK) or English(US). I am from India, and while I was able to select English(India) for 'Region and Language', I only got 2 options for Speech.</li><li>Due to this reason, Cortana is not up and running in my laptop. I had a previous laptop which was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7. Cortana worked just fine there.</li></ul>
<p>Can you please help me out here!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attaching some screenshots to help you out and get a better clarity on the issue<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7f8d792-0240-4fb3-aba4-7a57105ae5b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7f8d792-0240-4fb3-aba4-7a57105ae5b5" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3320045a-e858-4cff-8220-f2260778ca23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3320045a-e858-4cff-8220-f2260778ca23" /></a></p>

<h2>            &#39;Use automatic configuration script&#39; enables after reboot pc</h2>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using a proxy server environment in our company.</p>
<p>But some of our users (all using Windows 8.1) are having problems reconnecting with the internet, after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we see in the internet options &gt; connections &gt; LAN settings, is that windows created an automatic configuration script.</p>
<p>We can disable this, but every time we reboot it enables again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable the 'use automatic configuration script' permanently, without jeopardizing our proxy server - settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>#Nele</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are these computers connected to a domain network?</li></ul>
<p>If these computers are not connected to domain, you may try the following and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start computer in safe mode with networking</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step&nbsp;2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I am missing calls and pissing clients off because Skype does not ring for incoming calls.&nbsp; It did but just stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the audio settings and they haven't changed.&nbsp; The desktop audio is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This v8 Skype desktop is a 2 star compared to Classic v7.&nbsp; So many little things that make it clunky to use and none have been fixed after a year of feedbacks.</p>

            Hi  Rafisher1
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />In Skype, click the More menu represented by the three dots (...)
<br />Click Settings
<br />Click Calling
<br />Click Advanced
<br />
<br />Toggle off 'Answer incoming calls automatically'. If its already off, toggle it on then check if it works.
<br />
<br />If the problem persists:
<br />
<br />Uninstall then reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 8 or earlier, open Control Panel &gt; Programs and features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

            Hi Rafisher1
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Xbox 360 controller keeps disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 controller keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>Lately I have had some trouble with my wired Xbox 360 controller for PC. &nbsp;Occasionally (not always) it disconnects from my computer, and usually it just reconnects a few seconds later; sometimes the time between the disconnect and reconnect is so small there
 is no disruption in controller response and the only reason I know it disconnected is the disconnect sound plays.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, yesterday, the disconnect problem got even worse and my computer stopped recognizing my controller (the sound you get when you plug something into a USB port didn't play and the controller lights didn't come on). I plugged it into different USB
 ports and the controller didn't come back on. &nbsp;And yes, I tested the USB ports to make sure it wasn't the ports, and my computer recognized my USB headphones and flash drive perfectly in those slots. Strangely enough, my computer decided it would start recognizing
 my controller again five minutes later. &nbsp;Heck, I even had it unplugged while typing this post and when I plugged it back in, my computer didn't recognize my controller. I then unplugged it, blew into the USB connector, connected it again, and it was recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my wired Xbox 360 controller failing? &nbsp;I'm pretty sure the problem isn't with my computer since the USB slots work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;My driver version is 6.3.9600.17054</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit*<br />
I think I have discovered the problem: when my controller's cable is in certain positions, it disconnects, which I think is a sign of a fraying/frayed wire.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for not closing this sooner.&nbsp; The issue is due to a fraying wire.&nbsp; I did some experimentation and when the wire is in several positions, it loses connection.&nbsp; If the problem were a corrupted driver this would not be the case.</p>

            Roslyn,
<br />Without knowing what failed and how, the safest fix is to use the downloadable recovery image from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> - you will need a 16GB USB Stick, formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in.
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files s.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).
<br />
<br />You will, unfortunately, lose any local files or data stored on the Surface (but if you are using the default storage, docs, pictures, etc. would be saved to OneDrive) and you will need to reinstall apps and programs. 
<br />
<br />Sorry you are having issues. I hope that reimaging gets you up and running. If this was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

<h2>            MASS EFFECT 3 COMPLETE</h2>
                    
<p>A couple of days ago I finished my 60 promotions and became a Best Of The Best. This was the cherry on top. So in this game I have played through the story at least 10 times, played the hardest difficulty play through including all DLC, got all the achievements
 including all DLC. Then on to multiplayer. I have collected EVERYTHING. Every last piece. I have all weapon mods Level 5, all gears level 5, all characters with all training cards (outfits), and every gun level 10. Through out my time in this game my team
 of awesomeness was able to beat every map on Platinum including Hazard maps using well thought out plans or strategies that were put together by my dude Bad Med and myself. I may post our complete strats in a different thread later on for the purpose of helping
 people (that cant play Platinum) play Platinum. My all time top score and my teams record is 218,000 points. Retirement? For sure but not quite yet. I have some victory runs to do and will continue to play with my team on Fridays. Props go out to Bad Med who
 was a huge help in so many ways. The latest was his help in my promotions. When your a low level its great insurance to know that you have a great player and such a nice guy watching your back when things get tough. If his help is required for him to get his
 precious Cerberus Harrier 10 then I will continue to help him until he achieves his goal. Because thats what we do and thats why we have been so tight for some 4 or 5 years on x box live. Everybody needs a Bad Medicine. Dont know what I would have done without
 one. This whole story takes me back to my first week of playing. Med insisted on picking this game up even though I told him that i would be playing story mainly. I had no idea multiplayer was going to be so good. He said that he read that you would need multiplayer
 to get the best ending of the game. So I was like ok get it then. Back then we didnt play with randoms. It was just a two man show on Bronze barely able to make it to round three let alone complete round three. Since we had a team of players we invited them
 to buy the game and help us. Thats when things got good. The four of us worked our way from the bottom up. We played bronze for about 2 or 3 months until we had mastered it. Then on to Silver for another month or two until mastered. Then onto gold for about
 another month or two until mastered. Then we tried Platinum and today we destroy that Sh*t on an epic scale. As we got better we received better guns until we had our perfect gun for ourselves. Everyone did and still today have their mastered weapon of choice.
 So for any late bloomers I would say keep going. The barrel is deep and there is a ton of fun stuff to find. My current stats are: Time played 1,408 H, 27 M,&nbsp; 31 S. Games played 4065. N7 leaderboards 2220, Rank 11,343 (I got a really late start on this) top
 1%. Challenge leaderboards 27,120, Rank 1,165 top 1 %. I only had 420 N7 level about 2 months ago. I beat everyone on my friends leaderboards except for Deaths Head and Diesel. Thats where I will stay. Done with those, thank god it took forever. I will still
 be sticking around these boards for a while but I would like to say that it has been great meeting most of you. Give or take a few LOL. I have the ones that I feel are great people and that I would want to remain friends with beyond ME3 on my friends list.
 Anyone that needs help or information of or about ME3 please feel free to hit me up. Good luck and happy hunting.</p>

<p>Thank you Deaths Head. I had been working on the promotions for quite a while. I was taking it slow. About 1 set per week. Took around two months. I am so happy to currently be all level 20's. After being at the most a level 19 its nice to have that extra
 power. On the bright side i now have one really good character per class and a huge amount of training with each. I busted out my Destroyer last night on Platinum. He was tearing it up with his Venom shotgun and his Geth Spitfire. I have never been THAT good
 with him. We really need to hook up with some victory runs together. Dont worry about Outlawed Saint he actually just sent me a nice heart felt message a few days ago.</p>

<p>The manifest. If you didnt know about it you can view almost anyone's inventory, challenges, guns. I pulled mine up for you in the link. I hide my profile because to many people try to look at it. Its open for friends because in my opinion they are the only
 ones that need to be able to see it. If you are really that curious you could send me a friend request, take a look around then delete the FR. Im an honest person and certainly not a person that would make such outrageous claims unless it was true. My team
 used to use the manifest every week for weekend challenges. Beats having to shut the room down check to see if challenge was complete then re-open the room and invite everyone back in.</p>

<p>Ah so comfy in here now. I am currently confused. In almost every game I play I need to be working for something. I need a goal to achieve. There is nothing left for me in ME3 and yet I just cant seem to put this game down. I love my sims but after a couple
 hours of it im just like I need some action then out comes ME3. I truly believe that the only game that will allow me to put this game away is the upcoming GTA.</p>

<p>I just cant seem to put this game down.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>There's no denying the addictive nature of this game, it's not just with the ME3 Multiplayer but the Single Player Campaigns as well.&nbsp; Everytime I fire up the BOX or&nbsp;view the ME Icons on my PC's Desktop,&nbsp;there's always contemplation followed by resistance
 to fight the urge.&nbsp; Adding to the mix is the "gambling" dynamic of the game's store which is another narcotic (bordering on "subliminal") aspect being offered, another game ("the upcoming GTA") or another addiction will ultimately replace this one, but having
 said all of that, I can certainly can think of worse addictions than MASS Effect...:-)</p>

<p>Hello "BAD 2020" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I totally agree with you, I love Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer (despite the fact that I prefer to run solo) and I can't seem to stop playing it. &nbsp;I do play other games too, but ME3 MP is a game that I always come back to for more even after more than a year
 of playing it &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The only other game that has grabbed my attention as much as ME3 MP is Diablo 2 with the Lord Of Destruction expansion pack &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>So true Arkham. GTA is a true addiction. One of my favorite series of all time. I am looking forward to it very much. My all time fav's are GTA, Mass Effect, Dead Rising, and The Sims. I have heard great things about Diablo Lei. I think I heard that its
 coming to x box one, or maybe it was PS4 cant remember. My latest goal in ME3 is to help my dude Bad Med get his Cerberus Harrier 10.

<p>I must point one thing out. Since promoting 60 times and running around on gold with less than level 20 characters has improved my playing ten fold. Im back to level 20's now. So for some time I have been playing pretty much gold only. Platinum with friends.
 There are just not enough enemys on silver or bronze anymore. Its to easy. Gold is at least challenging depending on your teammates. I have even been playing pretty well playing 2 versus gold with a friend. Its been very fun. My trip around the world (60 promotions)
 I have also learned so new secrets. Will I share? Only with the privileged. I will be sending some interesting messages out today.

<p>Hello "BAD 2020" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Diablo 3 was incredibly glitchy when it rolled out for the PC; some glitches messed things up to the point of making your game unable to connect on-line completely or even create / choose your character class. &nbsp;I will not deny that I am very impressed by
 Diablo 3, but I am going to wait to see that the console translation gets done properly before I would purchase it. &nbsp;I've heard that the single player mode is now off-line (a major issue back then becauase no on-line verification / authentication equals no
 playing single player mode at all. &nbsp;I don't keep up with the patches / updates on this game but at this point of time, everything should be fine now).</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night &nbsp;:)</p>

The XP does not show the other drives and the only way I find is that all three computers appear in the workgroup, but the workgroup does not appear to be tied to the network - but of course it is since it shows up elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I have done the wizard several times and I am obviously on the network but XP does not show the other computer drives in "My Computer" etc.&nbsp; Everything is shared.<br />
<br />
Why is XP misbehaving and not simply displaying the drives on other computers?<br />

            Check the firewall on XP and make sure it has user accounts/passwords that match the ones on the other machines.<br />
<br />
<span>Problems sharing files between computers on a network are generally caused by 1) a misconfigured firewall or overlooked firewall (including a stateful firewall in a VPN); or 2) inadvertently running two firewalls such as the built-in
 Windows Firewall and a third-party firewall; and/or 3) not having identical user accounts and passwords on all Workgroup machines; 4) trying to create shares where the operating system does not permit it.<br />
<br />
A. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, this means allowing File/Printer Sharing on the Exceptions tab. Normally running the Network Setup Wizard on XP will take care of this for
 those machines.The only "gotcha" is that this will turn on the XPSP2 Windows Firewall. If you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp; With third-party firewalls,&nbsp;I usually
 configure the LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party security program's Help or user forums for how to properly configure its firewall. Do not run
 more than one firewall. <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS; CONFIGURE THEM CORRECTLY.</span>
<br />
<br />
B. For ease of organization, put all computers in the same Workgroup. This is done from the System applet in Control Panel, Computer Name tab.<br />
<br />
C. In Vista/Win7, turn Password Protected Sharing <span style="font-weight: bold">
ON</span> . Create matching user accounts and passwords on all machines. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist and match
 on all machines. <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT NEGLECT TO CREATE PASSWORDS, EVEN IF ONLY SIMPLE ONES</span> . If you wish a machine to boot directly to the Desktop (into one particular user's account) for convenience, you can do this:<br />

 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

D. If one or more of the computers is XP Pro or Media Center, turn off Simple File Sharing (Folder Options&gt;View tab).</span>

            I have a question about firewalls.&nbsp; You stated that file sharing problems could be caused by running 2 firewalls - Windows and a 3rd party firewall.&nbsp; But in your next paragraph, you said DO NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS.&nbsp; I'm running Kaspersky Internet Security
 and I also have a router with a built-in firewall.&nbsp; So which firewall should I be running or how should they be configured if I'm not suppose to turn them off?

            You shouldn't run two software firewalls in Windows. All Windows machines should run a software firewall. The router firewall will normally not interfere in Local Area Networking but you would need to refer to your router manual or its tech support site
 for how to configure it correctly. If you must turn one off, I would disable the router firewall. But I'm not saying to do this. I've never had to turn off a router firewall to have LAN file/printer sharing work.

            I forget to mention that I also have Windows Firewall.&nbsp; i'm not concerned about my router firewall.&nbsp; So if I'm not suppose to turn off firewalls, i would then have 2 software firewalls running which could then be causing problems.&nbsp;

            If Kaspersky Internet Security has a firewall then you don't want the built-in Windows Firewall running too.

                    <p>I downloaded Windows 8 for the "Bargain Price of £24.95 and it is without doubt the worst decision I have ever made! I want to uninstall Windows 8 as soon as possible, how can I revert back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is not Start Button on 8-I want one!</p>
<p>I cannot open anything on my desktop in Windows 8-why not?</p>
<p>If I had wanted tiles I would have gone to a tiling shop NOT downloaded what I consider to be the worst version of Windows ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can somebody tell me how to get rid of this abomination on my computer! I hate Windows 8 so much I am seriously thinking of taking my now somewhat useless laptop in to our local computer repair shop and having everything deleted and starting again
 with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a way of getting rid of Windows 8 for good can somebody please be good enough to tell me how I go about it.</p>

            <p>I like many people like some of the 'new' features of Win 8, but unfortunately the actual usefulness of the OS seems to have been not considered in it's design and implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want rid of this OS. It should NEVER have been sold as an OS for a desktop machine. I have actually started to discuss this with our Consumer rights as 'This product is not fit for the purpose for which it was intended'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me specifically, I have had a workflow loss of approx. 20%. i.e. I am now getting 20% LESS work done using WIndows 8. This is not good enough. This Operating System IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get round using Win 8 (which I trialled for 8 months - so am not an 'instant' hater... I have had to install the ClassicShell program and am now looking for some program (note a 'program' NOT an APP!!!) to make Windows Explorer work again in a useful
 manner (Why give me only 2 choices re. how I show my data etc easily but not the others! wtf??).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't even talk to me about spending 25 MINUTES LOKKING FOR THE DISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO ADD A NEW HARD-DRIVE IT HADN'T PICKED UP. OR the completely useless help system that couldn't find it when I looked for it... but didn't even bother to tell me that
 it couldn't locate anything, it just leaves me with a blank empty area. </p>

<p>Maybe when Microsoft have finished this operating system it might be ok, but I won't be using it AND NOR WILL ANY OF MY USERS OR ANYBODY ELSE I SPEAK TO.</p>

So you're saying that the Windows 8 Windows Explorer is the same as the Windows 7 Windows Explorer? 



Are we using the same Windows 8?  



So I used to be able to click on the Icon selector and get 'List|Details|Extra large icons/Medium Icons etc etc and that way I could choose how I viewed the contents of the Windows Explorer window very quickly, but now the Icon selector has moved to the bottom right and it only offers 2 choices. To get further choices I have to bury into the toolbar (or as MS call it - a ribbon (it may pay for Windows designers to learn what words mean in the English language before using them, but that's another point..)) 



Anyway, that's one difference... I'm not going to spend the rest of the day listing how many things now require 2 or 3 clicks extra to get the same information or formatting I used to get. 



I've solved most of my Windows 8 issues by running a Virtual box with Windows 7 running in it. That way, I only have to use Windows 8 to shut-down (another ex

            <p>You do realise you can add commands and groups of command to the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar - the row of icons above the ribbon)? And it's going to take you at least 2 clicks to do the same thing (change the view)&nbsp;in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>And I hope your statement that it take you "ten minutes" of trawling to find the commands in the Explorer ribbon is a gross overstatement - if it isn't then your application skills are sadly lacking.</p>
<p>And yes you can eliminate the Start page. With a third-party utility, but you CAN eliminate it.</p>
<p>You can sign on with a local account - you aren't FORCED to sign on with a Hotmail or Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So two or three clicks instead of one cost you what 1.5 SECONDS? How much "work" can you do in 1.5 SECONDS?</p>

            <p>Been struggling with Windows 8 for weeks and&nbsp;absolutely detest it.&nbsp;I'm by no means a novice (have happily migrated from Windows 2&nbsp;&gt;95 &gt; XP &gt; Vista, and&nbsp;switch between PC and Mac daily)&nbsp;but Windows 8 is unspeakably awful. It may be fine for a tablet or other
 touchscreen device but for a&nbsp;PC laptop I find it unusable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read this thread hoping to find how to downgrade to Windows 7 but most&nbsp;of the replies seem to be telling the OP to learn to love 8. The most helpful reply was Vijay's "<span><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can use Windows 7 DVD to format Windows
 8 and reinstall Windows 7 on the same drive" but I could do with more clarification.&nbsp; By "format Windows 8" do you mean uninstall?</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">It's a new Samsung laptop that shipped with Windows 8 already installed. I want to uninstall it, remove all traces, and use Windows 7 Ultimate instead.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Thanks guys.</font></span></p>
