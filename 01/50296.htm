<h2>            Flight Simulator 2004 not working on Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>I installed FS2004 on my system and it's been giving&nbsp;me&nbsp;an error to run the application using administrator privileges. There is only one account on the computer (which is mine)&nbsp;and it's noted as administrator already. After checking the user accounts it
 shows that I am getting all the privileges for running this game. Everything else on this computer us up to date. Is there anything else that I can do in order for FS2004 to work properly again? I was also thinking of doing a system restore to restore my computer
 to an earlier point. Maybe this will solve the problem if there was some Windows update that caused FS2004 to not work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would greatly be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If your game is on a disc then you are a victim of Microsoft's heavy handed security updates....join the club.</p>
<p>Recent updates include piracy blockers and one of them has had the effect of disabling A LOT of disc based games.</p>
<p>This particular little Nazi is called KB3086255.</p>
<p>I had the same problem trying to run Civ IV.</p>
<p>As long as you're on OS 8.1 you can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into your 'View Updates' menu.</p>
<p>Scroll down to around the 8/9/10 of September.</p>
<p>Look for the update called KB3086255.</p>
<p>Right click and uninstall.</p>
<p>Let your computer re-start and try starting your game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry about hurting your computer as it is an update for Windows 10....they put it on your computer in the belief that you will eventually upgrade. If you ever do upgrade then you will not be able to fix this.....word round the camp fire is that MS
 have done this on purpose to force people to buy new software of games they already own......SURELY NOT!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bare in mind that if you have 'automatic update' enabled then this little f**ker will try to re-install at some point so you may want to disable 'automatic update' or though it's probably less hassle to just delete it whenever it reappears.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you out but just in case, try looking on the thread called 'You must login with administrator privileges'........there is a procedure on about page 4 or 5 (I think) that allows you to block all such updates via your 'cmd.exe prompt' in
 'Start menu'.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

 so that the web connection is over that provider's mobile data network,&nbsp; but the connection is still IP to IP.&nbsp; Will that work ?

            Hi Neal
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Skype to Skype communication needs just an internet pipeline. It can be wired, wifi, mobile, satellite, anything.
<br />
<br />Hence, in your case, you need not worry as long as your have internet.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I understand you want to have a Skype to Skype video / audio call correct?
<br />Then, as long as you have an internet connection, it should work.
<br />I have used this myself in several countries in Europe and never had any issue :).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

    <title>How to get around &#34;Access Denied&#34; when running a tracert&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielbradshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get around &#34;Access Denied&#34; when running a tracert&#63;</h2>
                    I'm currently having some network problems with my Blizzard World of Warcraft account and they have asked me to send them a tracert, the problem is though that I keep getting "Access Denied" when I try to run it.<br />
<br />
I've been instructed to:<br />
<br />
To run a Trace Route to our log-in server:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
- Click Start and then Run<br />
- Type cmd and press Enter<br />
<br />
[ If you're using Windows Vista: Click Start and in the search field, type cmd and press Enter. Right-click on cmd.exe and left-click on Run as Administrator ]<br />
<br />
- In the command window, type:<br />
<br />
tracert eu.logon.battle.net &gt; C: \tracert.txt<br />
<br />
All of which I've done correctly (Including right clicking to run as admin) but I always get access denied when I press enter. I'm not sure why when I'm running as administrator and my account is the administrator account anyway. Blizzard don't block tracerts
 because they actively ask for them to look into problems, so its something on my end.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why I would be getting 'Access Denied' everytime and a way to get around it? I've been told I may be missing some admin rights but my account is the admin account and the only user account on my computer.<br />
<br />
Any help is welcomed :) I really need to get that tracert.<br />
<br />

            Under Windows 7 you are not allowed to write files in the root directory of drive C:. You must select a different folder, e.g.<br />
<br />
tracert eu.logon.battle.net &gt; "%UserProfile%\desktop\tracert.txt"<br />

            Hi  ohio7244 
<br />
<br />Method 1:  Check if the Installer Service is running. To do so, follow these steps.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />a.        Press Windows key + R then type “Services.msc” (without quotes) and press Enter.
<br />
<br />b.       Double-click Windows Installer.
<br />
<br />c.        Set the Startup type of Windows Installer to Manual.
<br />
<br />d.       Click Start to start the service. Note down the error message if any. Click OK.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 2: Reregister the Windows Installer. Follow these steps for the same.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />a.           Press Windows key + R
<br />
<br />b.           Type “msiexec /unregister” (without quotes) in the Open box, and then click OK.
<br />
<br />c.          Press Windows key + R then Type “msiexec /regserver” (without quotes) in the Open box, and then click OK. Restart your computer.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Check to see if the problem persists.

<h2>            windows update error 800705b4 - registry missing or corrupt</h2>
                    <p>This is Windows 7 64 bit SP1. After a disk crash I reinstalled the system a few days ago. It's now unable to install important security updates. The update history shows a few successful updates up to March 19, then a long list of failed ones. Details of
 the first failed update are below. </p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-800705b4 tells me to run a diagnostic utility, which reports that some registry content is missing or corrupt. I am including screenshots. The text content of the troubleshooting window is
 also replicated further below. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to continue at this point. Perhaps it would help to know: Which registry keys are missing and corrupt, to what application do they belong, and how can I fix the registry? Where do I get such information?

<h2>            Trouble shooting Zebra LP 2844 label printer</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; My label printer is in working order as far as I know.&nbsp; However, the red light keeps coming on and I cannot print a shipping label.&nbsp; This started when Microsoft "security" did not like the&nbsp;programs in Java calling them a security violation.&nbsp; I
 deleted the new form of Java and installed the older form, the printer worked for a few days and now has red light again all the time.&nbsp; I have run all the tests to reboot the label printer 100 times&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought it was a Java problem, not I am not sure it is
 not Microsoft.&nbsp; Please help, I need my printer.&nbsp; I can print a label on my other plain paper printer just fine.&nbsp; The Java "circle does come up" on ebay and it does let me select my Zeba&nbsp; LP2844 label printer, sometimes it works most times it does not.&nbsp; I have
 called ebay, to no avail.&nbsp; Thanks, Susan

    <title>windows Time service does not exist &#40;error1060&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petrus1904  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows Time service does not exist &#40;error1060&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For the last month, I have been struggling with the time of my PC. at first, the time did not update regurarly with the internet service. after some searching, I created a batch program that if ran in administrator, calibrated the time by re-establishing
 the connection with windows.time. In order to prevent the pc's clock from wandering off, every 30 minutes, the service was restarted and thus reconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Batch code:</p>
:loop<br />
net stop w32time<br />
w32tm /unregister<br />
w32tm /register<br />
net start w32time<br />
w32tm /resync<br />
timeout /t 1800<br />
goto loop
<p>
</p><p>Every time I started the PC, I had to start the batch script, as the time did not keep running if the pc was turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the batch script gave multiple errors: </p>
<p>1. w32tm /register: The following error occurred: The specified service has been marked for deletion. (0x80070430)</p>
<p>2. w32tm /resync: The following error occurred: The specified service does not exist as an installed service. (0x80070424)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened the services program, searched for Windows Time and found the following:</p>
<p>Name: Windows Time</p>
<p>Description: [Empty] (should not be empty)</p>
<p>Status: Running</p>
<p>Startup Type: [Empty] (shouldnt be empty)</p>
<p>Log On As: Local System</p>
<p>If I right clicked the services and pressed Properties, it gives the this message: Windows was unable to open service Windows Time for reading on Local Computer. Error 1060: the specified service does not exist as an installed service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after searching online for a solution, I tried the command line sfc / scannow, gave no result (Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I checked if the service exists in the Registry Editor, and found it in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time, with 5 subfolders of which 3 contain more folders (and of course registry values, but I do not know if these are
 correct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To wrap it up, System specs:</p>
<p>CPU: i7-6700 (non K)</p>
<p>Motherboard: MSI H170 Gaming M3</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB DDR4 at 2133MHz</p>
<p>Windows runs from an 500GB SSD</p>
<p>PSU: Corsair 860i</p>
<p>GPU: GTX1070</p>
<p>Wifi: TPlink T9E (PCI wifi card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope anyone knows how to resolve this problem, and if more information is needed, feel free to ask.
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Hello Petrus1904,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about this concern, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this your first time to encounter this concern?</li><li>Did you make any changes to your computer's configuration prior to the issue?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps have your tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>In the meant time, let's run System File Checker scan and DISM command at the same time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a Windows utility that allow users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Follow these steps for instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type this <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If SFC did not find any violation, it's still a agood idea to run DISM Restorehealth. For instructions, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<strong> Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Type this <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /Restorehealth </strong>and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Hello Antoneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time i noticed this issue, I went to services.msc, and changed the startup type (was set to manual, altered it to automatic). I also switched time server a couple times (between time.windows and time.google). with the batch program I got it working
 for awhile, although I had to manually toggle the setting "Set time automatically" in the Date &amp; Time dialog if the time difference was to big. the first time i encountered this issue was yesterday, at this moment, the clock in the PC is not working anymore
 (stuck at 22:01, while it is currently 13:28)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Results from your suggestions:</p>
<p><strong>&gt;sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p><em>Beginning system scan. This process will take some time.</em></p>
<p><em>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</em></p>

<p>But it the next line shows that it found the file in System32\DriverStore\FileRepository&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I see that it runs into multiple errors at 2 moments, both 6 Errors after each other with the same messages:</p>
<p><em>Error &nbsp; DISM Package Manager: PID=3856 TID=2968 Failed finalizing changes. - CDISMPackageManager::Internal_Finalize(hr:0x800f081f)</em><br />

<p>The other one looks the same, but with PID = 15844 and TID = 12460. messages refer to what the command prompt printed too.</p>
<p>so it looks like I need somekind of source, how does this work?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Impact of adding more memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldb55066  say:</h3>
<h2>            Impact of adding more memory</h2>
                    
<p>Iwork on a 3 year old laptop running Vista Home Premium 32 bit.&nbsp; This PC has 1 GB installed memory and I am considering adding more.&nbsp; I can add another 1 or 2 GB and was wondering how much the performance might improve.&nbsp; The hard drive is less than half
 full.&nbsp; The machine is tested clean and running Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp; It has been checked with Prevx, Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware and also has SpywareBlaster installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disk defragmentor is run at least once per month.&nbsp; The computer is mainly
 used for storing and accessing email.&nbsp; Bootup times for this PC are fairly long there is constant disk activity for several minutes after the desktop is loaded.&nbsp; I have set Windows Mail to load up after startup and it take over 2.5 minutes for this to happen
 depending on startup configuration. The only other things loading are any of the MS (except Windows Defender, already turned off, but the start entry persists) and Intel stuff and the touch pad driver.&nbsp; The PC also sometimes gets sluggish and programs do not
 always load quickly.</p>
<p>How much of a performance boost will I get from adding more memory and will it speed up the boot time?&nbsp; Will the 2 GB module give an appreciable improvement over the 1 GB one?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It will certainly improve performance if you increase the RAM.</p>
<p>MS recommends 1GB as the minimum, but that was VERY mimimum!</p>
<p>2GBs of RAM&nbsp;or more and it should run quite well</p>
<p>You might also like to try this before you do that, as you only presently have 1GB of RAM, which is what Readyboost is good for:</p>

<p><span><span>Using Windows ReadyBoost to Increase Performance in Vista and Windows 7</span></span></p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Also, to improve performance, follow the steps below;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
More RAM can certainly help, increasing to 2 GIG would be good and to 4 GIG even better. How<br />
much speed increase you might see has a lot to do with the rest of the system specs and what<br />
type programs you run and their respective file sizes and types. A reasonable guess would be<br />
15 -30% and maybe more.<br />
<br />
=============================================================</p>
<p>Here are some methods to increase performance of the system.<br />
<br />
Be careful as a lot of these programs and services actually need to run and often removing a few<br />
does little to speed the machine while making the&nbsp;machine less friendly to use.<br />
<br />

</span></a><br />
To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />
<br />
How to Check and Change the Startup Programs in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a><br />
<br />
A quick check to see which are loading is Method 2 there - using MSCONFIG then post a list of those here.<br />
<br />
Method 1 using Windows Defender will tell you more specific information about each program.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is a little more complex though you might have a few services running you can do without.<br />
Be careful as disabling a service can impact the ability of other services to run and cause issues<br />
down the road.<br />
<br />
Also some programs add services which might not really need to be starting automatically. You can<br />
often put these type services on Manual to reduce their impact on performance.<br />
<br />
To see these compare those in Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top Right Click on it<br />
RUN AS ADMIN to those in the default of Vista as listed here by BlackViper. Ignore and that are on<br />
Disabled (which do not run)&nbsp;or Manual (which run only on demand)&nbsp;- for any Automatic or Automatic<br />
Delated Start you can post those in here if you need help deciding if you need to run them. A few of<br />
those could be set to Stop and Manual so the calling program can run them as needed.<br />
<br />
BlackViper also makes some tweaks to the default windows services however I would not do those<br />
unless you really understand the total significance of changing a default service. So use it as a tool<br />
to compare.<br />

Another thing that help performance is updated drivers - Vista loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up.<br />
This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so<br />
install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Readyboost can help, more RAM and ReadyBoost is even better and RAM is fairly cheap these days.<br />
<br />
The max readyboost drive supported in Vista is 4 GB - if you get a drive larger than 4 gig you can use the<br />
remainder for storage.<br />
<br />
You need a very fast drive and pay little attention to manufacturers claims they are ReadyBoost Ready as<br />
even some slow drives claim that.<br />
<br />
ReadyBoost does it make a difference<br />

Refer to this thread for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

<p>How about boot speed, will the extra ram increase that?</p>

<p>How much RAM you need for good performance depends on what apps you<br />
run. However for almost everyone running Vista who does more than just<br />
play solitaire, 1GB is insufficient for good performance. I can't tell<br />
you exactly how much your performance would improve by going to 2GB,<br />
but I would expect the improvement to be substantial.</p>
<p>The question should you go to more than 2GB is harder. You get good<br />
performance if the amount of RAM you have keeps you from using the<br />
page file significantly, and that depends on what apps you run. Most<br />
people running a typical range of business applications under Vista<br />
find that somewhere around 2GB works well, others need more. Some<br />
people, particularly those doing things like editing large<br />
photographic images, can see a performance boost by adding even more.</p>
<p>If you are currently using the page file significantly, more memory<br />
will decrease or eliminate that usage, and improve your performance.<br />
If you are not using the page file significantly, more memory will do<br />
next to nothing for you. Go to<br />
<a href="http://billsway.com/notes%5Fpublic/winxp%5Ftweaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billsway.com/notes%5Fpublic/winxp%5Ftweaks/</a> and download<br />
WinXP-2K_Pagefile.zip and monitor your page file usage. That should<br />
give you a good idea of how much more memory can help.</p>

<p>Boot speed can be improved a little with more RAM depending on what is loading however most<br />
often it is the general running performance that added RAM improves.<br />
<br />
Add more RAM and get a <strong>really fast</strong> 4 Gig or more USB drive (4 Gig max for ReadyBoost though<br />
extra can be used as storage) to replace the 2 Gig now in use.</p>

<p>This PC is already using a 2 GB Ready boost module, sorry for not including that info.&nbsp; I have already done the clean boot test and have the computer configured as best possible in my opinion.&nbsp; It is my understanding that info still needs to be written to
 the hard drive even if the Ready boost module is in use.&nbsp; The light on the module is flashing a lot.</p>
<p>How about boot speed, will the extra ram increase that?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><br />
Readyboost was designed for machines that had a small amount of RAM.</p>
<p>The more RAM you have, the less and lees Readyboost will improve anything at all..</p>

<p>I ran WinXP-2K_Pagefile.vbs several times and got Current Pagefile Usage always over 200 and Session Peak usage as high as 480 MB.&nbsp; This is even with the 2 GB Cruzer as ReadyBoost.&nbsp; Do you think that a 1 GB memory upgrade would significantly help this system?&nbsp;
 Should the ReadyBoost still be used?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes you should see an increase in performance by adding 1 Gig to the 1 Gig you already have. Of<br />
course adding 3 Gig to a total of 4 Gig would max the memory out.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the ram keep using the ReadyBoost as it will not slow the system and will help when<br />
many programs are open at once or when accessing large files. For Vista the maximum ReadyBoost<br />
is 4 Gig so I would recommend the max. The system I am on now is 2 gig with a 4 gig ReadyBoost.<br />
<br />
Be sure the USB drive is a fast one. The speed can be checked using the methods posted in my<br />
reply above.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>No longer receiving SMS messages&#47;text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No longer receiving SMS messages&#47;text</h2>
                    <p>Contacted Skype because I was no longer receiving SMS messages/text.&nbsp; 7 days ago all SMS messages stopped from everyone even from Skype they tried to send a code to my mobile phone never came and had no idea why it didn't come or were to begin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pay 55 a year for a phone number and 7 days ago all messages stopped.&nbsp; Everyone is using two factor authentication banks, credit cards, even amazon witch is a good thing for security. But the text codes are no longer coming so I can not verify the code
 as it never came even from Skype, Amazon no one so when I called to find out about my order they would not talk to me as I never go the validation code sent through Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wasted so much time with people that had no idea what to do, one lady wanted me to delete my account, one wanted me to recover my account.</p>
<p>My account is not lost, my account does not need recovering as I can log in with zero issues.&nbsp; I am not getting my SMS/text message they dont seem to get it, understand it, don't care about it or the fact it started 7 days. I would fire a whole lot of them
 for not asking questions, for not opening a ticket so the tech people can find out why I am no longer getting my SMS text messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not recharging my Skype account any more until some actually cares about customer service.</p>
<p>Very very upset, one lady tried to tell me how to send a message as if I am some new person been using Skype since Skype was born.</p>
<p>You got any solutions would absolutely love to hear its more then Skype customer service has provided me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any and all help as Skype is doing nothing to find out why SMS/text messages are coming through</p>
<p>Please email me here or *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as I am so disappointed I may never log in to Skype&nbsp; again once my credit is out.</p>
<p>If I could get a refund on my phone number I would because I was promised a service and I am not getting that service!</p>

<p>Sorry to report you are incorrect.&nbsp; But thanks for trying to help more then I received from Skype.</p>
<p><br />
7 days ago it all stopped not getting nothing.&nbsp; Not getting any codes what so ever.&nbsp; They would send me code text message to my us based number 817 to verify my identity before that I have been getting the text message codes for quite some time.&nbsp; The problem
 started 7 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What ever they did its now back up and running and I got my code from Microsoft to verify my account.&nbsp; I also am back getting my Amazon codes to verify my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is half the people are just not honest and like wasting time.&nbsp; I could always log into my account without problem.&nbsp; I can always log into my Skype account the problem was the SMS/text message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without that code they would not help in anyway&nbsp; 2 factor authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just happy its working again probably some update, not happy no one seems to know what is going on or why something is happening as today was a complete waste of time and energy with people that had no clue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very very disappointing customer service today with Skype.&nbsp; Would like to stay with Skype but thinking of transferring to whats up or snap chat hoping to have someone who knows the product they work for thus if a problem exist they can actually help</p>
<p><br />
Thanks again<br />

<p>Skype US Numbers have never officially supported incoming SMS texts until recently. Even so, only incoming texts from actual phone numbers is supported. Due to this, this could not be used as a form of multi-factor authentication. Only a mobile number would
 work. If the authentication comes from a Microsoft/Skype short code, there is always a possibility such short codes might be received. However, I am unaware of a method to send a reply, even for a test, as the Skype client has no capability to dial short codes
 from the Skype dialer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any services provided greater than what is officially offered is not guaranteed, as it could stop functioning at any time. I know of one user claiming to get transcribed incoming Skype SMS texts to his email. That was certainly abnormal and if true, likely
 due to a local provider misconfiguration. If your Skype Number supported incoming SMS texts from short codes or from phone numbers for a long time, consider yourself lucky and&nbsp; in the minority as the Skype Number I have had for over a decade only recently
 started receiving incoming texts from actual phone numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your issue was simply having issues receiving SMS verification codes from a Microsoft/Skype source for multi-factor authentication or some other purpose, it is best to text 'Help' (if possible) to the last known number used to send the verification. That
 might resolve the issue. Beyond that, there may be some outage or some other account failure. In those instances, temporarily disabling multi-factor authentication or disabling then re-enabling it, might resolve it. If you have access to your account, changing
 your password, may also resolve any odd issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>dont know about Instagram but my problem has been resolved not sure what they did, how they did it not sure if they would tell you
</p>
<p>
</p><p>everyone is going to the 2 factor identification they send you a code and you repeat it back to them or they will not even bother with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to see more business use the rolling codes with google authentication or Microsoft authentication from the google play store.&nbsp; I think its better personally</p>

            <p>Hi Derrick, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some home devices can cause interference between your PC and networks that might be in range. For example, microwave ovens and some cordless phones use particular frequencies (including 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) that are also used by some network hardware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two things you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If any devices like these are near your PC, turn them off temporarily or move them farther away.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change the router or access point settings to use a different wireless channel, or set the channel to be selected automatically if it's set to a fixed channel number. Sometimes, one wireless channel works better than others. Check the info that came with
 your access point or router for instructions about setting the wireless signal channel</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Run the <strong>Network adapter troubleshooter</strong> and see if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: Press
<strong><span>Windows key </span></strong><br />
<strong>b:</strong> Type<strong> troubleshooting</strong>, hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>c </strong>: Now click <strong>Network and Internet .</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>d:</strong> Then click <strong>Network Adapter.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information helps. </span></p>

            Its got nothing to do with interference its something in the Win 10 upgrade for WIN Defender - my connection has been stable since I upgraded in Oct 15. Since the update and security upgrade on Thursday 3 Dec its dropping out all the time and needs to
 be reset. Sort it out instead of blaming other devices &nbsp;- its a WIN 10 problem &nbsp;

                    <p>Alternatively, how do you escape the 'create new account' page without creating an account? There's no damn back button, and the email is attached to an account (my dad wasn't sure if he had a Microsoft account). So I'd happily sort his login, or create
 a local account, except I can't escape the damn create account page.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Press and hold the power button on the casing of that PC for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down, then start that PC again, that should give you the chance to go back and put the proper details into the OOBE (Out Of Box Experience)

<h2>            Help .  Installation Stopped .  This is a major problem for people</h2>
                    
<p>Help . &nbsp; Disc based games that I used to could install, are now getting the &nbsp;Installation Stopped &nbsp;. &nbsp; Is this a March dashboard, or my preview dashboard? &nbsp;This last dashboard made my games crash, &nbsp;games not install, and my USB drive stops working randomly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm afraid to even copy a game from internal to external. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This &nbsp; case of &nbsp; &nbsp;Installation Stopped is too much, and I'm about at wits end. &nbsp;Help</p>

<p>@NinetyPHEONIX in order to get rid of that error you need to powercycle your Xbox or put it in powersaving mode
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../power-cycle-console</a></p>
<p>@Twigleaf Twigs</p>
<p>This is most likely happening because the Xbox tries to install a game and update and or DLC at the same time. To prevent try disabling your network when installing a game untill it's complete.</p>
<p>As for your USB drive to stop working </p>
<p>Go to settings -&gt; Power &amp; startup -&gt; uncheck when Xbox is off, turn off storage</p>
<p>Or you can change to energy-saving</p>

<p>FearedNightmare. &nbsp;With all due respect, &nbsp;the " installation issue " is a far more complicated issue than a hard reset power cycle will fix, and is in no way related to it updating at the same time. &nbsp;There was just a discussion about misinformation on how
 to fix this issue was being presented. &nbsp; &nbsp;Its helpful yes, however, its not a fix. &nbsp;This is a serious issue installing anything digital or disk, and it has absolutely nothing to do with installing an update at the same time. &nbsp;Totally unrelated. &nbsp; This is a
 situation that a Full Factory Reset doesn't even fix properly. &nbsp; &nbsp;As for the USB, that is minor, and is a known problem being worked on related to the power modes, so I'm not as concerned with that. &nbsp;However, the fact my XBOX is a doorstop right now is a serious
 issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I suspect some of us have just purchased soooo much content, that a bug is limiting some of us from installing X amount of items that have DRM attached to them. &nbsp;The console doesn't know what to do and gives a " Installation Stopped " error . &nbsp;BTW, this
 is a clean HDD too. nothing on it.</p>

<p>From my own experience I can say game installations mess up when there is a game update or DLC trying to install at the same time&gt;<br />
<br />
And the powercycle came up as a fix for the errorcode the other person was getting.</p>

<p>FearedNightmare, &nbsp; Yes, I have tried that. It is not related to the problem. &nbsp; It's actually being discussed in detail in another area quite thorough.</p>
<p>Feared. &nbsp;Like I said, I am not trying to be mean, but you are really starting to be patronizing on this. &nbsp;I am trying to be nice, and appreciate the help. &nbsp;If a customer has told you they have already performed a procedure, I don't know why you keep pushing
 it. &nbsp; I even went a step further, and I told you I did a Full Factory Reset. &nbsp;That alone should have answered your own question.</p>

<p>Hello guys. I'm with the same problem... &nbsp;I've searched online for the problem and didn't find a solution. My problem is exactly the same as Twigleaf Twigs... I found some people with the same problem and no answer in this closed thread:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4270/p/1940988/5202204.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../5202204.aspx</a>. I hope the next update fix this bug, as it makes impossible for me to do anything, basically. I have a over 70 games on this Xbox, digital games, demos, dlcs, physical games... on internal and external storage (2TB). I
 made some tests and nothing seems to solve this problem. Does anyone have any solution to my problem?? It's frustrating to have bought lots of things and not beeing able to play any of them. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey Twigleaf Twigs, if you got a solution to this issue please
 send me a message! I will quote you from the other thread here: </p>
<p>...."I have repeated that description in other threads. &nbsp;The dashboard has either a limit of installations, or there is a Stack Overflow bug .</p>
<p>What he suggests does work, the only caveat being, not all things you uninstall seem to work. &nbsp;Like free apps, etc. &nbsp;But, for me, the installation count actually corrupts the entire dashboard. &nbsp;For example, my TrueAchievement App loses its integration with
 the Achievement app, and no amount of re-installing it will fix it. &nbsp;( The TA App replaces the Search for help on Internet option, with Search for help via the TrueAchievement app ). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Having too many things installed, and sitting on the USB drive, can corrupt your DRM/installation file on your console. &nbsp; There is an area there, where all the DRM liscenses are permanently stored until you delete them with a Factory Reset. &nbsp;Hence the Installation
 problem resurfacing so often with me, when I reconnect my USB drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some counting, and I had about 80 things " Ready To Install ", and that is not counting disk games that wont show up in that list until you put the CD in. &nbsp; As for a grand total, there was about 500+ total items downloaded that was game+DLC+apps .</p>
<p>I tend to think its a combination of both a Stack Overflow and a bug/limit on the number of installations. &nbsp;One effects the other, the way the XBOX One stores liscenses on the console. &nbsp;Maybe that memory allocated for the DRM is not large enough? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If support is ignoring it now, as suggested by madbruiser , the problem is just going to get worse as people buy more games. &nbsp;I say that, because there has been a lot of people calling support on this, ( I called earlier this month) and its as if they treat
 it as a non issue. &nbsp;They won't escalate a problem either. "</p>
<p>Im not in the preview program. (didnt applied the april update because its not online yet for people not in the program, i really hope this gets a fix on the major update).</p>
<p>This is very important , Microsoft, please help your loyal costumers.</p>

            Microsoft has chosen not to release an ISO for Windows 8.1., unless you have purchased it. In order to install Windows 8.1 you must be running Windows 8.0 and download Windows 8.1 from the Windows 8.0 Store. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance
 post and we will be glad to assist you.
