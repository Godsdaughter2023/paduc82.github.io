<h2>            Using Mail on Windows 10 to manage my Gmail account, how do I align the drafts folder to access drafts initiated on another device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use a laptop, a phone and work pc to access my Gmail account. On my laptop I'm using Mail but I can't access draft emails (to edit before sending) in the default drafts folder. This seems impossible to align, or am I missing something? Surely this is a
 basic requirement of an email application?</p>

<h2>            Why Does My Windows 10 PC shows 850gb  for Systems and Reserved Files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I formatted my Windows 8 PC due to Malware, then Updated it to windows 10, since then I have been seeing only 52gb as my Drive C:\ size. My total disk size is 1TB, and my system shows that I am currently using 850gb for systems and reserved files. How can
 I get more disk space from the systems and reserved disk space? I have done system reset and cleared everything in my PC but no result was achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

            Hi Ikechukwu,<br />
<br />
If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store, you have a digital license for your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a digital license for without
 entering a product key. Since you already tried to use system reset and cleared everything in your computer, we suggest that you try to perform a clean install using the latest Windows 10 ISO file. You can download the latest Windows 10 ISO file from this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, and install it on a USB drive or a blank DVD. To perform a clean install of Windows 10, you can follow the steps in this

<h3> vespasian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bios Incompatibilty with Windows 10 - 64bit Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to upgrade a desktop from 7 to 10. The PC passed the compatibilty check and for minths I have had the "download 10" prompt from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I tried from the prompt I tried using media creation I tried via an ISO USB created with Rufus. I tried keeping my docs and progs I tried a complete install, having backed up.</p>
<p>Always always in the end I received an installation failure notice with no error code.</p>
<p>Finally spoke to MS support very helpful but the first "supporter" advice to boot direct from ISO USB didn't. work Set Up started then prompted me to try from ISO update within 7.</p>
<p>I spoke again to MS Support who fairly quickly checked my BIOS with me and said that the BIOS dated 2009 was incompatible. BIOS must be 2012 or later.</p>
<p>My motherboard is American Megatrends the BIOS is ASUSTEK p5ql/EPU. I have checked the AMI and ASUS sites and so far cannot find any sign of an update ever to this BIOS.</p>
<p>I have following questions:</p>
<p>1) Is it really true that there is a BIOS incompatibility with 10. (I have updated an older 32 bit to 10 with no BIOS problem at all)</p>
<p>2) Why does the compatibilty check not look at BIOS</p>
<p>3) Is there any way round this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help and advice please</p>
<p />

            <p>The only thing I can think of that Windows 10 requires from the bios is NX Bit or Non Execute setting. You can search for info but here is one link

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2</a>&nbsp;ignore the fact it refers to Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find that setting in your bios make sure it is enabled.</p>

            <p>To install Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not
 enabled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer does support these extensions, you could still try using ISO media. In some instances, you might have to switch from your current architecture,&nbsp; 64 to 32 bit since these requirements mostly affect installation of 64 bit Windows 10:</p>

            <p>Interesting my bios are also 2009 same as yours and I upgraded with no problems</p>
<p>I actually went a long route </p>
<p>Started with </p>
<p>Win-7 64 bit home premium original Acer oem free upgrade activation key. 2009 bios.</p>
<p>Upgraded with a free Win-8 Pro key I had worked perfectly as Inplace or on top of the 7.</p>
<p>Loaded all updates for 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded win-8.1 from M$ store asap</p>
<p>Installed all of 8.1's updates and had GWX icon on taskbar</p>
<p>Only message was I could not use Secure boot = Big deal Fast startup was disabled well before the process and I didn't have a system reserved partition anyway those are useless ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used GWX icon and used Upgrade Now.</p>
<p>Boom win-10 pro installed.</p>
<p>Again disabled Fast startup in Power options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 2009 bios is good = M$ Tech Bad :p</p>
<p>This was on a Acer AX3810 :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your thoughts. I have just returned from the Easter Weekend hence slight delay. I have checked my BIOS on an Intel American Megatrend motherboard 64 bit. The Execute Disable Bit setting is by default enabled&nbsp; as is Intel Virtualisation Technology.
 Thus I haven't touched them.&nbsp; It is late here in Germany now and I will look again tomorrow but I am now uncertain as to what I should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Because XD is already enabled</strong> is there another possible problem preventing installation of 10?</p>
<p>If so is there any diagnostic tool available that could identify the block? <strong>
or</strong></p>
<p>Should I disable XD (or both) and try and install 10 from the ISO and will the installation process&nbsp; try to enable XD (or both) ?
<strong>and</strong></p>
<p>Do I need to downgrade from 64 to 32 before I try this ? <strong>but</strong></p>
<p>Will this weaken the overall capability of this PC. ? Is a 64 7 better than a 32 10?</p>
<p><strong>Therefore</strong> does it make more sense to leave this PC on 7? </p>

            <p>I'd just use Optimize defaults and save an exit.</p>
<p>Besides using gwx icon on the taskbar not much else can be said it's the safest way to get win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would however stress to create a system image before anything gets upgraded.</p>
<p>Best place for a system image is not on the disk with the operating system put it on an exterior hard drive and do not forget to create the recovery cd either when prompted too.</p>

<p><span>Can you reboot into your system?&nbsp; If the system is frozen then use the power button to shut it down and then reboot.&nbsp;
 If it asks, select Normal Mode.&nbsp; If you can boot normally, then everything is probably fine and you encountered a momentary glitch which you shouldn't worry about unless it begins to occur frequently (by that I mean less than every other day or two).&nbsp; If you
 can't boot into normal mode, then read on.</span></p>
<p><span>Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (or you can also use Safe Mode). The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System
 Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore with no problems.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;svchost.exe or ntdll.dll (Start / Control Panel / Administrative
 Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:

<span>&nbsp;</span>Look in the&nbsp;System section.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may already know, the msg.exe command is a Command Prompt command that's used to send a message to one or more users on the network. This may be required by the application you are trying to install that's why it keeps on popping-up. May we verify
 if you were able to install the application successfully? If not, may we know the error message or code that you are receiving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            To further isolate the command prompt pop-up, we recommend performing the methods below:<br />
<br />
The methods are listed in order, so start with the first one, see if that fixes the problem, and then continue to the next one if it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Test the issue in safe mode</a></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform a clean boot</a></strong><br />

<p>Hi. Try downloading free version of malwarebytes and run a scan with it. Another person I helped on this forum had same problem and I had him download malwarebytes which solved his problem. You may have picked up a hitchhiker on the internet. Hope it solves
 your problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My speakers haven't been working for 2 weeks and it's starting to drive me insane. They are plugged in, they are on, the volume is up. Window's sound says they are working, however when I test them they will not work. I've tried everything and I'm really

<p><span>Hi alyrox1010,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check for the speakers on a different computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the connections are fine then, check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Run&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/no_sound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 automated troubleshooter</a> and check if it helps. Open the website and click “Run now”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Try uninstalling and reinstalling sound card
 from device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start and type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotes), and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, Video and Game Controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the sound card and select Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer and Windows should now detect the sound card and install the sound drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Update the computer with the latest sound drivers.
 Log on to the computer\sound card manufacturer website to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

Here is how to turn off sleep mode for vista: click start. Go to Control Panel\System and Maintenance\Power Options and 'change plan settings' for your current plan. Under 'put the computer to sleep' choose 'never'.<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

<br />@echo off
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />

            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver:

<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager

======================================<br />
Believe it or not...I still think the problem is temporary files.<br />
Did you open the Temporary Internet Files folder and it's<br />
sub-folders to see if the photos are in there?<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Run...and type or copy/paste the following:<br />

<p>==============================================<br />
At this point...my only other suggestion would be to do a search for .jpg <br />
and see if&nbsp;you can&nbsp;identify the location of the unwanted photos.</p>
<p>Wondering, do you use Outlook Express or MS Outlook for your e-mail?</p>

=================================<br />
I must be missing something. <br />
<br />
Are you printing from Windows Picture And <br />
Fax Viewer? Windows Live Photo Gallery?<br />
A photo editing program?<br />
<br />
Please describe&nbsp;all the steps you take when <br />
printing a photo and explain where _exactly_&nbsp;<br />
you're&nbsp;seeing the previously printed thumbnails.

    <title>Update 1709 bootloop &#40;from 1703&#41;, restore fails infinite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annoyed_chris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update 1709 bootloop &#40;from 1703&#41;, restore fails infinite restarts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since Microsoft is not able to provide proper support via Twitter, I was now forced to register here, just like the update was forced and not "optional"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First statement: I do not support, like nor understand why Microsoft is NOT WILLING to stop this insanity to force updates onto the users!<br />
All major updates produced a huge amount of errors and bootloops for users, which had previously NO problems with their systems.<br />
It would be a major deal, if Microsoft would stop this policy of forcing the big updates, instead of opting them (all Android an iOS opt the user for system updates)!</p>
<p>I had NO option to select "NO"... I was kindly forced to "restart my device".</p>
<p>And yes I am totally annoyed and angry that after 2 years of consecutive problems with the forced major updates, Microsoft is not willing to stop this (sorry) BS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now my problem in detail (System Specs at the end!):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was expecting the update 1709 for some time now and I expected a smooth transition from 1703 to 1709.</p>
<p>The Update was delivered on Thursday and after the installation download and initialization progressed, I did restart, as requested, at the end of the process.<br />
Next I was waiting for the 1709 update to finish, suddenly it stopped and restarted and reverted.</p>
<p>There was no (specific) error message, it just started to revert and "restoring your previous version of windows". Now it does that 45 seconds long and then restarts my PC again. This repeats till now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did follow this procedure like 6h and then turned my PC fully off.</p>
<p>Next I used a Notebook of a friend and started to use the media creation tool, creating a bootable USB drive to get a hold of the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I followed the procedures to get to the troubleshooting part (because automatic repair suggest I should revert/rollback, while Rollback tells me to reset, while I have NO RESET OPTION... also a loop of stupidity):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continue (to Rollback) -&gt; always sends me back to the bootloop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshoot:</p>
<p>System Restore -&gt; does not find a restorepoint! (Despite the service was enabled)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair -&gt; diagnosis "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC" and sends me back to "advanced options"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Command Prompt -&gt; used all usual commands like bootrec, sfc, chkdsk etc. no specific errors or any annomalies, except "bootrec /fixboot" responds me "Access denied"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to a previous version -&gt; "Windows Rollback" (which is my currnt Windows 10 as it seems...) ... just produces another error message without any error code(!) and just tells me to RESET my PC... which is not offered as an option in any ot the troubleshoot/advanced
 options at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bootloop also started to cause a problem with graphics.</p>
<p>Asap the circle dots disppear, the display goes black/blank.</p>
<p>After several of these black/blank restarts I switched from Displayport to HDMI, same result.</p>
<p>Than switched from my GTX970 to the integrated iGPU of my Intel CPU.</p>
<p>Using the HDMI port I now have a stable image with just telling me&nbsp;"restoring your previous version of windows".</p>
<p>So now I removed my GTX970 in favour of reading what is going on.</p>
<p>I brought the 970 to a friend and we tested it, it works. No issues with Desktop and Games.</p>
<p>I don't believe my PSU just got damaged by this restarting fest.</p>
<p>That as a sidenote...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So now I am dumbstruck in what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not do a full clean installation! I have a lot of data ad settings,&nbsp; I would need to move from the drive and it is more than a hazzle to do so, esp. now with app/program specific settings than lost.</p>
<p>I already wasted too much of my precious time to write this and wait for another reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would gladly accept help via Skype (English or German pls).</p>

            Hello Chris,<br />
<br />
A software update provides fixes for features as well as software enhancements and compatibility. These updates also include added security for your software. Although there is no option not to install the update, we can defer it and have it installed on a
 later time.<br />
<br />
Corrupted system files may cause these errors while installing updates. Since repairing it using the media creation tool was not successful, we suggest that you perform a custom installation. Here is an article by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> that provides steps on how to do a custom installation for Windows 10:
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44?auth=1">How to: Perform a Custom Installation of Windows</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you will need further assistance.

<p>Thank you for the suggestion, John.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of doing this already, but I am not sure about the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Means, I have no up-to-date Bookmarks and settings from FF/Chrome &amp; other programs. My last update/backup was month ago, since
<br />
Blame it on me or not, but the problem is still that the user has NO way to opt any updates.<br />
It would be nice if this topic would be stronger focused here in the forums and actually being worked on by the devs!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So btt.: I don't know, when I do the custom installation, if my files are being accessable like before, for example Chrome or Firefox?</p>
<p>Do I need to reinstall them or can I access them just as if I had a proper update with just a restart? Anything beside that is poointless, because I need the live-data from these browsers and other programs/apps and it's not recoverable, when I can not access
 the actual OS (even in safe-mode).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I tried to use SFC now as described in the other article (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026030/how-to-use-windows-recovery-environment-winre-to-troubleshoot-common-s)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>SFC /scannow /offbootdir=C:\ /offwindir=C:\windows</strong></p>
<p>Error message: "windows resource protection could not start the repair service"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is another UNSPECIFIC error message. It is really difficult to me, because there is no feedback I can use to circle the problem at all!</p>
<p>Is there no way to just repair the startup files, so I can access a form of windows that i can use to actively get access to the running OS?</p>

<p>Well so far I found an entry in the logs that there is a problem with the windows old wim file... I don't know what is the issue and there is no proper documentation at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say is, this is just stupid! Thanks for no solutions at all, despite doing a clean installation, are you kidding me? Is this the resolution of a failed upgrade process? That the user is forced to do a new clean installation of the system? This
 is really ridiculous MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole update process makes no sense. Why do live updates, which screw up the user configuration and there is no way to recover anyting? Why has the User no saying in the process and can OPT/Deny the update until you can guarantee it to be stable and
 especially the installation process not causing any troubles for the user... you know OOBE... as your bloated marketing is trying to convinve everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you use your brains and do some proper process routine?</p>
<p>There are certain things users have installed. As far as i read there are some major troublemakers, that is either a videocards &amp; their drivers for no reason (nvidia, amd or integrated GPU)... Fix this, this is a constant problem for 2 years now! TWO YEARS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other big issue you blame on Users is, why they DARE use other software solutions for Antivirus and Firewall. Well because yours are not consideres "good". For whatever reason, this is out of my hands everyone says they have the best solution, nobody
 can confirm. So whatever it is why does it stop the installation process and why does this is not being tangled properly and being cooperated with the respective parties so it is not a problem of the user anymore? Go fix this already!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue I feel really left alone as a User, is with my data now lost. Thank you again for NO help and overall crap-engineering your installation-process/OS to be rendered useless. There is no way you can recover anything when the system decides it
 does not want to read a certain file, which it could simply SKIP or COPY from the freaking recovery drive! Are you kidding me... I have a USB Drive inserted and it is recognized and the system does prefer doing a restart instead of checking if there is another
 location where a non-corrupted file might be... This is so sad. I am a "common" user and i always wonder why you have so much troubles understanding what is the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The User is in most cases left in the dark and reboots happen without giving any feedback to the user... this should be stopped! Especially if the user is in a booloop trap nad is not able to get into te system at all, like in my case!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I am freaking angry, this whole update concept is the worst stuff you MS guys ever "invented". My whole weekend is done for with troubleshooting, reading about problems not even slightly related, no errormessages given as feedback to circle the problems
 and the worst is that I am definitively now stuck with a fresh installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the support John, but MS should really do their homework first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does MS even take the feedback from all the insiders and the general public serious?</p>
<p>People have massive problems with the updates/upgrades and the readable feedback&nbsp; everywhere is "it's your own fault using this and that software or hardware, how dare you do that User...." wtf..? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>My whole&nbsp; weekend is gone without having any result on this useless update/upgrade process going wrong from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't MS ask why files go "corrupt" from the beginning and the initial update process MUST validate ALL critical files for a rollback and authenticate these files to be not corrupted and on standby if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a laughing stock that you blame most of the errors on corrupt files, other AntiVir/Firewall solutions and other stuff which can be considered in testing and other ways.</p>
<p>Like having the processes not being system critical anymore...<br />
</p>
<p>I am done with this BS. This is useless. Here is no help at all available and the solutions in a whole all indicate in the same direction, of me being responsible to take care of stuff alone again. Also that it leads to one solution, which is do a clean
 instalation. Why the hell do you offer the updates than, when you have to clean install every 2nd big update? This is ridiculous and far beyond common sense. The so called helpdesk on twitter is a laughing stock too. You want OOBE? That's absolutely never
 gonna be happening with MS like that! You strife for this for like 20 years and Android and iOS laugh about you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for wasting my time.</p>

<p>FOUR FREAKING DAYS I wait for an answer but there is none coming.<br />
<br />
Lucky this is my custom PC not a Surface. I would have smashed it by now and send back in tiny pieces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you fella are a MS employee or not, you freaking lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really the worst here getting answers on a weekly base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for help, the only reply was freaking do a clean installation... I say why does not freaking MS stop the sht policy of FORCED UPDATES and goes back to secure Windows 7 days, where the user had A CHOICE to update or deny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not the User was also able to select if only notified that there are updates or download or download and isntall them... wow. Customer service...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thank you for wasting my time, John and MS for waiting for a scheduled call, which never came.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same goes for the time i spent here reading worthless advice about problems wich could be avoided, if the engineers would think and not only get paid for surfing and drinking coffee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean whats the logic:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I search for updates and there is no option to DENY the download, ther is NO option to deny the installation, at the end you are only asked to restart now or later... what a bad joke?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean the updates ask mostly for deactivating 3rd party stuff like Firewalls or Antivirus (from Avast, kaspersky etc.) and you cna do so only doing what... yes a restart... now uh was there not a restart request from the system, unstoppable update service?
 Hm might cause colission, but who cares, just the user files burning up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear CEO sack all your current engineers and get fresh ones with some brain!</p>

<p><strong>I recently installed 3 external disks as internal disks, removing the casing etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I made one of these disks "Active" in the disk management program. &nbsp;It is not the boot drive. &nbsp;Anytime i access this drive explorer freezes and it forces a reboot and wouldnt find the operating system. &nbsp;I then ran the diskpart program from dos and
 marked the disk inactive but this led to complete failure. I have just reinstalled XP and the disk is still marked active and crashes the pc when accessed even though the computer boots fine. Ive ran the disk check on it and that makes it crash too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do i make the disk inactive ?</strong></p>

            I mistakenly made an external hard drive 'active' after formatting it for first time use. I had to go into the BIOS every single boot to change and save boot sequence for it to boot with the external drive connected and could not figure out why.&nbsp;
<br />
With these instructions I 'de-activated' the drive and all is well. <br />
My issue is fixed and I learned something new. Good times.<br />
Thanks a million

            hello Niall Harpur : <br />
follow these directions :<br />
<br />
1. Windows +R <br />
2. Type "cmd" <br />
3. At the prompt type "diskpart" <br />
4. then after the "&gt;" symbol type " list disk" <br />
<br />
DISKPART&gt; list disk <br />
<br />
Disk ### Status Size Free Dyn Gpt <br />
-------- ---------- ------- ------- --- --- <br />
Disk 0 Online 28 GB 1536 KB <br />
Disk 1 Online 233 GB 993 KB <br />
<br />
<br />
5.Now select the disk which you want to make INACTIVE (For instance if i want to make my Disk 1 as active i.e where the OS is installed and REQUIRED to boot, i need to select the drive which i want to make INACTIVE. In my example DISK 0)
<br />
<br />
DISKPART&gt; SELECT DISK 0 <br />
Disk 0 is now the selected disk. <br />
<br />
6. Type "list partition" <br />
<br />
DISKPART&gt; list partition <br />
<br />
Partition ### Type Size Offset <br />
------------- ---------------- ------- ------- <br />
Partition 1 Primary 28 GB 1024 KB <br />
<br />
7. Since there is a single partition on DISK 0, select it by issuing the command "select partition 1"
<br />
<br />
DISKPART&gt; select partition 1 <br />
<br />
Partition 1 is now the selected partition. <br />
<br />
8.Type "inactive" - this will make disk 0 partition 1 as inactive <br />
<br />
============================= <br />
Explanation : This error crops up because you have been in Computer Management &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management and selected more than 1 drive as ACTIVE together with the one which was already active- the one where your OS was .
<br />
<br />
Point to remember : THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE ACTIVE DRIVE SO YOU CANT SET MORE THAN ONE DRIVE AS ACTIVE

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have any third party codec’s installed on your computer? If so then try uninstalling them, restart the computer and check if you have the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span><em><span><strong><span>Uninstall or change a program<br />
</span></strong></span></em></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Explorer may not have the codec’s defined to create thumbnail created in the registry. You might have also noticed that some of same file extension may have thumbnail and some
 do not.</span></p>
<p><span>This occurs because of any recent codec’s pack or video conversion software installed on the computer which changed the registry settings for shellEx for particular video file
 extension and you add the video file to video folders.</span></p>
<p><span>To recreate thumbnails for all picture video document files that you have on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Open C:\Users\user-account\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
</span></p>
<p><span>Rename all the .DB files to .old and reboot the computer and open all the video folder and wait for few minutes so that explorer can regenerate the thumbnails.</span></p>
<p><span>AppData is a hidden folder. Here’s how to display hidden files and folders.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Folder Options by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Personalization, and then clicking Folder Options.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the View tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under Advanced settings, click Show hidden files, folders, and drives, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><em><span>Show hidden files</span></em></span><br />

<p><span>Let us know if this helps<br />

            Try opening Windows Media Center, go to the folder you want and let it rebuild icons. Then they often show up in Explorer again. Just another win bug.

            I struggled with this all morning loading various codecs, tweaking registry, etc. etc.&nbsp; with no success.&nbsp; What I finally discovered was that one recommendation I read, suggested loading K-Lite Codec Pack, which I did.&nbsp; This does in fact work or did the
 second time for me when I paid attention to the various installation prompts.&nbsp; There are one or two screens that specifically discuss thumbnail generation and the default did not have AVI among others selected.&nbsp; On my second install, I changed it to make all
 default to WMP.&nbsp;Once this was done, all my thumbnails returned. &nbsp;Hope this save somebody from the time I wasted today...

Well thanks for this - still spent quite a while doing the same tweaking and fiddling around&nbsp;as you&nbsp;before found this thread and is a bit of shame that it takes&nbsp;the installation of an unneeded codec pack to fix what should be a relatively simply issue, but
 nothing else I tried worked. The only things did differently was to retain Zoom Player as default player and give ffdshow priority over Core - thanks again for this solution.

<p>I have tried to upgrade my Surface Pro (128 G0 to 8.1 from the Windows store.&nbsp; Every time I try it, it makes all the way to the final stages and then I get the blue screen stating the upgrade can't be completed and to search the web for IRQL_NOT_EQUAL_OR_LESS.&nbsp;
 It then rolls back to Windows 8 and the error code it gives when it apologizes for not being able to upgrade as 0xc1900101 0x4000D.&nbsp; I have uninstalled a couple of programs including FATPOT, Cisco Anyconnect.&nbsp; I am running bitlocker so I tried unencrypting
 the drive still no luck.&nbsp; A work make has the same Surface with similar programs installed and upgraded with no issues.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Nair,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I suppose, this might not be the appropriate column, or question thread to post my query, however i have the following 2 issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. the worst, i had been using MS windows xp in my office computer, and had to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro. i had started whats called Clean install, (x64), i faced 2 problems, 1. at "installing devices 60%" my system was hang, completely halted, i had to
 manually restart it "cold boot", 2nd after the installing devices, i received a blue screen message, saying "clock watchdog timeout". i restarted again and it was installed without any further errors, anyhow, after the install, i was facing sudden system halts,
 hang, it would hang in the middle of my work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>while upgrading to windows 8.1 from store, i also faced the same problem, and error message mentioned hereabove.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Solutions tried.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>i installed x86 instead of x64, which reduced the frequency of hang but still, it hangs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>i contacted MS UAE, they reffered to Dell, (my machine is Dell optiplex 990), Dell came and they determined that there is a fault with my harddrive and/or processor, therefore they replaced both things, i installed windows 8 again (X64) (2nd problem starts
 here without any solution applied.), but still the same, though the frequency of hang has reduced but still i cannot trust my pc if its going to hang or not, (e.g, i am writing this message in MS word, and continuously saving it maybe i have to restart)</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. now that i have reinstalled windows8 pro, i received a message to activate windows, i tried my serial key provided with the DVD, it said, this searial key is only for "upgrade" not Clean install, how come?, i already had "Clean Installed" (formated
 the Partition in which Windows XP was installed previously)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please recommend some solution, or how i can overcome these both issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind Regards,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Afaq Haider</div>

            FYI - I ended up successfully getting the Windows 8.1 update installed on my notebook.&nbsp; The one thing I did differently during the successful install verses the unsuccessful attempts is I did the install from a wired internet connection instead of trying
 to do it using my wifi.&nbsp; I hope this might be helpful to anyone else that may be having the same issue.&nbsp;

<p>Yea, that's why they email you like 3 times before they charge your card. Because they want you to forget about it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to end the process from the task manager.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Press <strong>CTRL+ALT+DELETE</strong>, and then click <strong>Task Manager</strong>.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Applications </strong>tab.<br />
c.&nbsp;Click the program that you want to exit, and then click <strong>End Task<br />
</strong>d.&nbsp; Close the <strong>Task&nbsp;manager </strong>window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Once you close the properties window, you may follow the steps mentioned below to Take or Assign Ownership of files and folders.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Step 1:</strong> Taking Ownership of Files and Folders</em></p>
<p>If you are an administrator, an authorized user, or a backup operator, you can take ownership of a file or folder by completing the following steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;In Windows Explorer, open the file or folder’s Properties dialog box by right-clicking the file or folder and then clicking Properties.
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;On the <strong>Security </strong>tab, click <strong>Advanced </strong>to display the Advanced Security Settings dialog box.
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;On the <strong>Owner </strong>tab, click <strong>Edit</strong>. This opens the Advanced Security Settings dialog box for editing.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;In the <strong>Change Owner To </strong>list, select the <strong>new owner</strong>. If you’re taking ownership of a folder, you can take ownership of all subfolders and files within the folder by selecting the
<strong>Replace Owner On Subcontainers And Objects </strong>option. </p>
<p>e.&nbsp;Click <strong>OK </strong>twice when you have finished. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Step 2:</strong> Assigning Ownership</em></p>
<p>If you are an administrator or the current owner of a file, you can assign ownership of a file or a folder to another user or group by completing these steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;In Windows Explorer, open the file or folder’s Properties dialog box by right-clicking the file or folder and then clicking Properties.
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;On the <strong>Security </strong>tab, click <strong>Advanced </strong>to display the Advanced Security Settings dialog box.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;On the <strong>Owner </strong>tab, click <strong>Edit</strong>. This opens the Advanced Security Settings dialog box for editing.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Click <strong>Other Users Or Groups</strong> to display the Select User, Computer, Service Account, Or Group dialog box.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;Type the name of a user or a group, and then click <strong>Check Names</strong>. If multiple names match the value you entered, you’ll see a list of names and can choose the one you want to use. Otherwise, the name will be filled in for you, and you can
 click <strong>OK </strong>to close the Select User, Computer, Service Account, Or Group dialog box.
</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;In the <strong>Change Owner To</strong> list, select the <strong>new owner</strong>. If you’re assigning ownership of a folder, you can assign ownership of all subfolders and files within the folder by selecting the
<strong>Replace Owner On Subcontainers And Objects </strong>option. </p>
<p>g.&nbsp;Click OK twice when you have finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Dear Skype team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having the same issue for over 2 weeks now when i switched over to the iPhone X.</p>
<p>WiFi works fine but when I try to make calls thru cellular data, the call isn't very clear. Uninstalled and re-installed the app several times but issues still remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i was using my previous phone (iPhone 6), everything was working fine with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it something to do with compatibility for the iPhone X? will the new update fix all these problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Vineeth</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Error Code&#58;0xc0000043</h2>
                    Does anyone have information about win error 0xc0000043?&nbsp; It started after a reg cleaner program ran and effects random programs from running. Can't restore to earlier date. HG

            Reg cleaners can be a trouble. I have actually quit using them because of reasons like this one.
<div><br />
<div>Are you trying to restore and you get the code: Oxc0000043?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If so, have you tried restoring going through Safe Mode? You can try to disable System Restore and then re-enable it. But this may remove your restore points.&nbsp;</div>

            Yes. I have tried the Safe Mode route to no avail.&nbsp; I'm trying to restore because I started getting the error code after running&nbsp;Smartregfixer.&nbsp; I get the error when trying to open many different programs including the Smartregfixer.&nbsp; I can't restore because
 a restore point was never created.&nbsp; I'm running Win 8 pro and was trying to fix slow loading abd page can not be displayed problems. HG&nbsp;

            That's a bit of a pain. I can relate to your frustrations. Used to use a regcleaner to help with slow login times until I ran into situations like yours.
<div><br />
<div>Are you able to re-install some of the applications?</div>
<div>I ask as we may be able to get Windows working ok but some applications' registry items are probably missing. Which you may need to re-install those applications.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For Windows 8 I've found this to be somewhat helpful: <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/http-wwwbleepingcomputercom-tutorials-automatically-repair-windows-8-with-automatic-repair-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>You are correct.&nbsp; Automatic restore failed. So, I tried the Refresh option.&nbsp; Now I'm back to square one with Metro.&nbsp; I am now looking for the list of files/programs that didn't survive the refresh.&nbsp; Also searching for Classic Start program, control panel,
 and all the boy's in the band.&nbsp; Long nights ahead. </p>

    <title>Yet Another Flaw with Skype Version 8.xxxxx - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Yet Another Flaw with Skype Version 8.xxxxx</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What an unbelievable mess version 8.xxxxx is. Having posted comments here yesterday I have now found yet another flaw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the Skype icon pinned on my task bar in Windows 10. When a message comes in it plays a sound but the icon no longer shows that a message has been received as it used to in earlier versions. Again this was a very useful
 function in that if one left ones laptop/computer for a few minutes and returned one could readily see that there was a message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume Microsoft look at the comments in this community, if not they should and should comment accordingly on the numerous complaints by advising users what the hell they intend doing about this utter shambles. It's a disgrace!!!</p>

            Thanks Juan for the suggestion but quite honestly having downloaded version 8.xxxx I would sooner live with the shambles for now as I would only have to face the shambles again sometime before 1 September bearing in mind that I very much doubt whether
 many of the problems we are all facing will be fixed by then. Also it will be interesting to see whether indeed fixes do materialise before 1 September. If not I shall scrap Skype. Thanks again anyway for your&nbsp; suggestion.

    <title>&#34;Preparing Automatic Repair&#34; Screen Boot Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jardthebard  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Preparing Automatic Repair&#34; Screen Boot Problem</h2>
                    <p>So, i recently downloaded windows 10 and upgraded to it with a boot disc on my desktop. My computer was functioning as normal</p>
<p>until i restarted it, and this problem happened. Whenever i boot up my computer, it goes to a screen with the windows logo and the words, "Preparing Automatic Repair". There is no circular loading icon amd the screen never changes. I looked around the web
 for this problem, and i couldn't find a solution. This is not the same problem as the preparing automatic repair restart loop. I tried to run the system recovery by pressing F11, but it goes to the same " Preparing Automatic repair" screen. I also tried to
 boot from my windows 10 installation cd, but it brings me to a screen with the same problem but lacks the "Preparing automatic repair" under the windows logo. Any sort of solution for this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jard,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform
<strong><span>startup repair</span></strong> using a Windows 10 installation disk by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong><span> is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows
 from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem, and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer’s hard disk, and on the Windows Installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are on Windows 10, I suggest you to repair your computer by creating a Windows 10 Bootable media (i.e. USB or DVD) using
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Media Creation Tool</strong></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. &nbsp;</span>Once you're ready with Bootable Media, follow the below mentioned steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert&nbsp;the&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and&nbsp;then start the computer.</span></li><li><span>Press a key when the&nbsp;message
<strong><span>Press&nbsp;any key to boot</span></strong>&nbsp;from CD or DVD appears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your PC does not detect the media automatically </span>
<ol>
<li><span>During the&nbsp;restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system (BIOS)&nbsp;setup
 utility. Most PCs use the F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key to begin the&nbsp;BIOS Setup.</span></li><li><span>Look for a tab&nbsp;in the&nbsp;BIOS Setup Utility that is labeled
<strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Order</span></strong>,
<strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Options</span></strong>,&nbsp;or
<strong><span>Boot</span></strong>.&nbsp;Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the
<strong><span>Boot Order</span></strong>, then&nbsp;press
<strong><span>Enter.</span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Locate the CD,&nbsp;DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive (this might be called Removable Device) in&nbsp;the Boot list.&nbsp;Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to move the&nbsp;drive
 up so that it appears first in the Boot list.&nbsp;Press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.&nbsp;The boot order sequence is&nbsp;now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive.</span></li><li><span>Press
<strong>F10 </strong>to save your&nbsp;changes and&nbsp;to exit the BIOS Setup Utility. Select
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong> in the confirmation window. The&nbsp;PC will
<strong><span>restart</span></strong>.&nbsp;Allow the PC to restart&nbsp;normally. The scan will take a few minutes&nbsp;and remove any malware that&nbsp;may be infecting your computer.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Select a&nbsp;language, a&nbsp;time, a currency, a keyboard or another input method, and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click
<strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the&nbsp;operating&nbsp;system that you want to repair and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the
<strong><span>Choose an option</span></strong>&nbsp;screen, select
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong>&nbsp;from the window&nbsp;and click on
<strong><span>Startup&nbsp;repair </span></strong><strong><span>option</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write back to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

    <title>Saints Row 4 Freezing Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a slayer fan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saints Row 4 Freezing Problem</h2>
                    
<p>It has happened a dozen times in the last few days, my sons X360,(original model)&nbsp;and mine, (slim), have been freezing at random times&nbsp;when we play Saints Row 4. After the freeze, we are forced to shut down.&nbsp;Other games work just fine.&nbsp;I reached out to some
 friends and they have encountered same issue. Anybody else running into this problem? Installed SR4 to hard drive and got the same end result. Local GameStop rep has had other complaints about issue and his opinion says its related to lack of RAM. Any feedback
 would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
