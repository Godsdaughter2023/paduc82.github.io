<p>Are you trying to access some other hardware such as a VCR from within XP Mode?&nbsp; Is the USB attached in the actual Virtual Machine in the via the USB drop down settings across the top of the VM?&nbsp; Are you running this application in the actual VM or is it
 running in XP Mode (Application only) in Windows 7?&nbsp; Does it work from within the VM with the appropriate USB attached via the settings?</p>
<p>Will the Vista drivers for ION VCR2PC&nbsp;install in Windows 7 or does Windows 7 object to them?</p>

    <title>Shadow Copy snapshot file contents silently corrupted on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don zoomik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shadow Copy snapshot file contents silently corrupted on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Historic overview:</p>
<p>One user had problems with Folder Redirection sync resulting in data loss (details are irrelevant)&nbsp;and we had to recover missing data from PC's VSS snapshot of CSC cache (regular VSS snapshot by System Restore).</p>
<p>In short steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elevate to SYSTEM with PsExec (CSC folder is heavily protected by ACL so we have to use SYSTEM to access it)<br />
psexec -i -s -d CMD</li><li>Get relevant shadow copy with<br />
vssadmin list shadows</li><li>Mount shadow copy with<br />
mklink /d C:\ShadowMount \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\</li><li>Recover data with<br />
robocopy C:\ShadowMount\Windows\CSC\...\data D:\Backup /E</li></ol>
<p>No errors were seen and a few test files&nbsp;were&nbsp;consistent. About a month goes by and user reported that most of the data was corrupted. We determined that data had been corrupted already during recovery from Shadow Copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been able to reproduce this on 3 Windows 8.1 systems so far (not tested on 7 yet).</p>
<p>We also tried to&nbsp;over Network provider just in case, but we still see corruption</p>
<ol>
<li>net use&nbsp;vss$=\\?\Globalroot...</li><li>popd \\localhost\vss$</li><li>Access data</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>Snapshot age seems to be largely irrelevant (corruption in both snapshots taken a month ago and yesterday).</p>
<p>Parts of the file or whole files&nbsp;are filled with NULLs. It seems that NULLs occur at cluster borders (4kB clusters).</p>
<p>It does not matter if file exists on live volume or has been deleted/moved since snapshot.</p>
<p>File is OK on live volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example one text log file (for easy content analysis), size ~244kB analyzed in Hex Editor</p>
<ol>
<li>Beginning of file has 12kB of data (last data char is position 2FFF)</li><li>After that, only 00 characters (NULL)</li><li>Data continues at position 3B000 until end of file</li></ol>
<p>ChkDsk /scan shows no errors. The system has been patched up-to-date with WU patches. No LDR hotfixes deployed to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Systems are running regular HDD (so TRIM hasn't cleared up clusters).<br />
Background defragment is enabled.</p>
<p>No VSS errors in Event Log.</p>
<p>The files were very unlikely to be in use (old documents, images, beforementioned old log file) during snapshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're aware that Previous Versions has been dropped in Windows 8, but underlying technology still exists and should continue to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are considering that this might be a bug in VSS. Shadow copy is not consistent and parts of it are either dropped, overwritten or... something.</p>
<p>Might it be a bug or am I missing something? Should we get a MS support case?<br />
We didn't find any relevant KB articles for Windows 8.1&nbsp;but found one similar case:

            <p>I am the original poster of the superuser post in the OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience was the same.&nbsp; Attempted to recover from many shadow copies (from the previous day to months earlier) and I couldn't find a single file that was completely in tact.&nbsp; Some were all null, others were largely the original but had small portions
 of nulls, others were complete until the last block of the file which was null.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I didn't try due to time but crossed my mind was if it would be possible to restore originals by stitching the files together from different shadow copies.&nbsp; I was thinking on a low level maybe each shadow copy is incremental but it seems unlikely
 since most of the files we were trying to recover were PDF and images files that had never changed but they were filled with varying null in the different shadow copies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone will know something about this and can shed some light on it.</p>

            <p>One could learn this the hard way. Given the fact the System restore and File protection (Volume shadow copy for restoring previous versions of files) is announced as safety switch in case something happens on your PC, and it has been the most "popular resolution"
 for all ransomware infected and affected users, it is really not fair that this issue has not been either pointed out, announced, or resolved. Instead, giving the users insurance that they are safe for such cases, only to find out the hard way that they've
 actually not been protected and that they lost it all, is really wrong and actions should be taken for this!<br />
<br />
<br />
We've just been running extended tests on our company, with me being the alfa IT specialist, and found out that almost none of the shadow copies on 6 different types and sizes of SSD and 14 HDD, on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, together tested 63 machines/systems,
 (yes, that's what we've done to make as tight conclusions and resolutions as possible) were restored without issues. Most of the systems were clean installed, while few of them older installations therefore having some older restore points as well. Timeframe
 3 weeks, giving us enough VSS to try to recover some files as per @drew010 suggestion, we've had some luck, but found it difficult to make it an automatic routine, as it's almost impossible to determine what part of the file has changed since or not, and since
 non-changed files are not being shadowed therefore the shadow copy usually contains only one copy of file, it being the one with null data in it.<br />
<br />
We've made these tests after dozen of our clients reported that our ransomware recovery resolutions were not successful (victims not having backups elsewere and having VSS on were restored using that one, but files were never checked).<br />
<br />
We've also found out that there is probably something about spacing as well. I'll try to describe one example:<br />
<br />
HDD: 240GB;<br />
Host OS: Windows 7 Home Premium<br />
Partitions: 2, C:\ 190GB, D:\ 30GB,</p>
<p>Shadow copy enabled: C:\ only</p>
<p>Space used on C:\ &nbsp;: 160GB, &nbsp;70GB user files</p>
<p>Dedicated maximum space for VSS: 9,5GB</p>
<p>Space in used on the day of restoration, reported by the VSS settings form: 4,2GB</p>
<p>Files affected: all user files on hard drive, ransomware infected test host OS</p>
<p>Previous versions of files available on pretty much all folders<br />
Trying to restore several folders with 200+ MB size: all "successful", all included corrupted/empty .txt, .jpg, .rar files (rar archives being reported with "corrupted header" error, containing only parts of archive, able to extract those...)<br />
Trying to restore folder with 12GB .avi encrypted files: recovery collapsed during process, 2 files being falsely recovered, one being corrupted, and other being partially recovered.<br />
<br />
Available previous versions of files: 3 points, (as per 3 restore points stored in host OS at the time).<br />
<br />
Main question: Why and how did the OS try to restore files that were bigger than his whole used VSS copy at the time?<br />
Why did the VSS only used half of available space (aka it did not run out of space for this to occur), when it should use all he has available, if even more files were changed?<br />
Why it is reported that shadow copy of the files are available, if they are not really there, as they can't be due to space limit?<br />
<br />
Why even though it didn't have enough space for even one single shadow copy, it yet suggested to go as far as 3 versions back with it?<br />
<br />
<br />
This sound like a seriously unstable situation and feature bug. And being completely M$ oriented company as well as their representative, it's giving me serious concerns as per what we're distributing, as this is the second serious thing we've discovered that
 affected lots of our clients.<br />
<br />
First being the software RAID (mirror) function inside the disk manager itself, where the mirrored disk gets synced - but in a way that it's completely whole mirrored/overwritten again from the source, after every system crash (aka not proper shutdown), giving
 the actual point of mirroring exactly the opposite of what it's been made for, and also giving headaches with worn out hard drives due to constant writing that shouldn't been made (I'm totally aware that system crashes shouldn't be happening either, but then
 again, that's not the answer to the main issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really looking forward into someone explaining the VSS issue and space allocation!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi<br />
I created a MS Support Case back in summer. My support incident <span>
115060812822144 was closed as confirmed bug and my contact said that there would be a hotfix (but no ETA).
</span>There haven't been any updates since July...<br />
<br />
I suggest you also create an official support case to increase visibility, you'll get your money back if the issue is confirmed to be a product fault.</p>

<p>I discovered the same on Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make a Bunch of files (images are very good) with cheksums</p>
<p>2. create snapshot</p>
<p>3. mount snapshot</p>
<p>4. discover corrupted files and bite your desk</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://imgur.com/EJdnVRp</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is from a snapshot created several seconds ago. Its the same with Windows 10 Pro 1511 , although it works with Server 2016 TP4 which should have the same codebase.</p>

            <p>thanks. I hope this gets fixed. I had several TeslaCrypt - Incidents the last couple of months and without vss this is a nightmare. Besides, the "Windows System Restore" is completly useless with this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created the exact same folder, created the snapshot, deleted it and set the whole system back to the Recovery Point. Bam&nbsp;http://imgur.com/uvoZ5nb . Not "a few" corruptions, ALL is gone. I have to try this with more Files but it does that in a Hyper-V-VM
 too (on a Samsung 840 Pro SSD) and this is called ENTERPRISE?</p>

            <p>While we wait for Microsoft to fix this, i have found a workaround. Unfortunately it wont repair previous shadow copies, but those&nbsp; created with this&nbsp; seems to work.<br />
Here how to do it<br />
You should download the vshadow command line&nbsp; utility from microsoft site or here "http://edgylogic.com/blog/vshadow-exe-versions/" (I use the server 2008 R2 version)
</p>
<p>and copy in a working directory or in the system32 directory<br />
then create a Task in task scheduler to automate the shadow creation (need administrative rights).<br />
You can see the option (quite a few) in the terminial windows with vshadow /? or the microsoft site (i use "vshadow -p -scsf c:")<br />
Sorry for the bad english</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I changed my region to Poland (not my country, but the closest thing) in the link mentioned here but when I play Street Fight 4 Arcade Edition GFWL says "Country/Region: United States". The game's multiplayer is divided into 3 regions (NA, Europe, Asia)
 so it sucks to be paired with NA players when I'm in Europe :(</p>
<p>How can I change that?</p>

<p><i><span>If GFWL works the same way as XBL then once you create an account you can not change the region unless you LIVE in one of the nine newly added regions. If you already used the Account Migration Tool to
 do so then you were warned when you went through the process exactly what would happen. There are numerous warning prompts that pop up through just about every step of the process.

For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

This message appears to indicate a major hardware "failure" in your printer.&nbsp; A printhead is a part of a printer which "sends" the ink onto the paper.&nbsp; Either the printhead is faulty or the printhead was not properly "re-condition" if it can easy be replaced

<p>there is no yellow question mark (which indicates a missing driver) in the device manager. everything looks normal.&nbsp;<br />
I also viewed hidden drivers, there is no hidden driver. I have no idea what to do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Did you do an upgrade type&nbsp;or a clean installation of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Windows 10 Home, Pro, etc. and which architecture (32bit or 64bit)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know and also&nbsp;the result of the Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,</p>

I troubleshooted and the results say "WiFi is not turned on", i tried turning it on by pressing the WiFi key which is F12 and also tried turning it on from the WiFi properties and then rebooted, nothing changed. I am using Ethernet cable right now which is
 working fine.<br />
</p>
<p>I installed&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 Pro 64 bits</strong> with the clean installation option and formatted the drive which was containing Windows 8.1.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are waiting for Gerry to&nbsp;reply back you can check some settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to All Settings&gt;Network &amp; Internet&gt;Airplane mode, on this page make sure that Airplane mode is switched to off and that Wireless devices is switched to on. Are both switches active or is one or both of them greyed out (inactive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having problems you can then select (on the left pane) Status then on the bottom of the page click on Network reset and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard</p>

<p><strong>Good morning,&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>My husbands computer recently hit the skids. He was on a trip for work and took his personal laptop with him. When he tried to access the wifi in his hotel room, there were no internet connection icons in the system
 tray and the connect to folder in the start menu was gone. I was able to resolve that issue and now all the icons are there and connect to folder is back. Now, I&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;get&nbsp;the&nbsp;computer to connect.&nbsp;stated&nbsp;it has limited or no connectivity. I run all kinds
 of things include resetting the winsock and ipconfig and so on and so forth.. I need help. I did run: cmd: ipconfig /all, and here is what I have:</span></strong></p>

<p>You didn't tell us how you did get them back (by Restore or Recovery system to factory setting or what?).</p>
<p>From the<strong> Ipconfig /all</strong> it seems your machine not getting the IP address from the Router/Modem. Try to go through the Network Adapter and see if the machine configured to get an<strong>Automatic IP</strong> and also the<strong> DNS</strong>
 assigned Automatically to the Machine.</p>
<p>Did you check with the Hotel if their <strong>WIFI</strong> is working and also other<strong>Clients</strong> using the Wireless connection successfully?</p>
<p>Also ask them if they supply a password for the&nbsp; <strong>WIFI</strong> , just in case they are in an urban area and don't want somebody other than their clients to access the Internet.</p>
<p>Did you tried to <strong>flush</strong> the<strong> DNS</strong> and renew the<strong>IP</strong> by doing these steps:</p>
<p>Run command:</p>
<p><strong>ipconfig /flushdns&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click [</strong><strong>OK]</strong></p>
<p><strong>ipconfig /release&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click [OK]</strong></p>
<p><strong>ipconfig /renew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click [OK]</strong></p>
<p><strong>netsh winsock reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click [OK] </strong></p>
<p>Reboot your machine.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the <strong>Windows Zero Configuration</strong> service is enabled in the service control panel:</p>
<p>Run command and type:</p>
<p><strong>services.msc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click [OK]</strong></p>
<p>Locate the <strong>Windows Zero Configuration</strong> and make sure it is Starting Automatic, also disable the Wireless&nbsp; client utility Management tool for the Wireless Manufacturer it may interfere with WZC.</p>
<p><strong>You receive a "Limited or no connectivity" message on a computer that is connected to the Internet by a DSL modem or by a cable modem after you install Windows XP Service Pack 2</strong><br />

<h2>            Windows is not genuine and cannot upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    I was downloading the Windows 10 update beck in July and when it reached 15%, my computer over heated and crashed, now when i start my computer it says my windows is not Genuine and i need to purchase it again, i do not wish to spend another 100 dollars
 on something i already own. upon crashing, my computer resorted back to windows 7, and displays these messages, i have tried contacting Microsoft about the issue and the guy just left the chat with no explanation. this wouldnt be a problem if it also kept
 me from launching items such as steam, Sims 4, skype, minecraft and many other programs, the only things that currently work are Origin, but i cannot launch games, Spotify, and all internet browsers i have downloaded. my background has also been changed to
 black, and in the corner it says Windows 7, Build 7601, and this copy of windows is not genuine

<h2>            Windows 10 - Boot Configuration Data is missing or contains Error code&#58; 0xc000014c</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am looking for advice or help.</p>
<p><span>Automatic update of Windows 10 was started before turning off the laptop and later after turning on my laptop was displayed blue screen with the message:<br />
<br />
Boot Configuration Data is missing or contains errors<br />
File: \ Boot \ BCD<br />
Error code: 0xc000014c<br />
<br />
I want to say for completion that it is possible the update did not finish (I am not sure) because of a power outage, turn off the laptop and internet connection dropping. I would like to say also that I do not have installation disk currently (upgrade to Windows
 10 was made by the net) but I was able to download and create a DVD disc or USB with ISO file Windows 10 on another laptop with older Windows.<br />
Please advice me or tell me detailed procedure how to fix boot data without losing personal data on the hard disk.<br />
Thank you in advance for any reply.<br />

    <title>still cannot see specifically psp thumbnails in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beannie9  say:</h3>
<h2>            still cannot see specifically psp thumbnails in windows 10</h2>
                    Since installing paintshop pro 8 i cannot see my pspimage thumbnails like i used to. I have tried all the ways for fixing them to view pspimage thumbnails in windows 10. I have opened file explorer, options, view made sure in the files and folders option
 that always show icons, never thumbnails is unticked. I have ticked, applied and then unticked and applied to see if this works but is still doesn't work. I have tried looking into psp handler but when i tried to download my virus scanner said it had a virus
 in it. I know magic humbs works but i do not want to pay $30 for an external viewer when I know that I should be able to see them for free. Can anyone help? or does anyone know a way to get Microsoft to do an update to fix this problem?

<h2>            Someone uses disk during gameplay, who&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Our gameplay is ruined because some process</p>
<p>starts using the disk during the gameplay. Disk goes like 100%.</p>
<p>Gameplay freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to find what process it is?</p>
<p>The task manager shows only "service host" something ("palvelun</p>
<p>isannointi" in finnish language); not helpful at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Process Explorer earlier to a similar problem, but</p>
<p>because its use involves manual tracing work, it cannot be done</p>
<p>in hurry and when disk goes 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone code the Process Explorer and add a recorded?</p>
<p>Then I could trace the problem later first by checking when the</p>
<p>disk-use went at top, then check what processes raised/popped</p>
<p>active, then check who owned that process. I could let the</p>
<p>Process Explorer to record a week or so to find all offending</p>
<p>disk users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We observed the gameplay freezes immediately after we</p>
<p>purchased this Acer XC600. Very sad. Engineers should not</p>
<p>be that rude and disturb the users. Some kind of ethical code</p>
<p>would be needed when these systems are designed.</p>
<p>Very rude, very annoying.</p>

            <p>I installed WPT and used WPRUI to record data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I wished I could record the handle and process information to disk, but surprisingly 10 GB of disk space was filled pretty soon. I forgot to check off the boxes mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would find it better to record a day or two continuously, and then examine myself all high disk activity peaks. Disk activity goes high numerous times a day and I would like to check them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to examine the recorded files? I don't want ask your help all of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a note: the game is a network game -- the gameplay cannot be paused when we play in a team. A system in which user may control when the service and background processes are allowed to do something on disk would be preferred. If the too hard disk activity
 is traced to a virus scanner or to a file indexer, Windows could help and allow me to freeze those programs over the time we play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the file indexer: when I disabled file indexer off for disk D:, the disabler surprisingly went through all the files and turned them off one-by-one. Terrible. I expected the file indexer would have placed a single tag to root of D: (like norobots of
 WWW). I wanted that indexer won't go through all my files, but now it still has to go through all files for checking if the files can be indexed. Massive disk activity remains.</p>

            <p>This has been made too difficult. What exe files performs the file indexing and defender; I just want delete (rename) them so that disk does not start going wildly during the game play. I also think that I should have disk space to where nobody else have
 access: no indexers, no virus checkers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is so important that the disk goes at maximum? Unix has "nice" system but I don't know if it lessens the disk. Now, at worst, the disk goes wild twice per hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not only user who has this problem because I did hear about this problem weeks before I did buy Windows 8 computer. We had this problem earlier but now that we play Guild Wars 2, an online game, the problem hits really bad. Today the rendering freezed
 for 10 seconds, which is now record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Process Explorer can display for me? How PE could be improved to reveal this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With task manager, I can see that a service host (?) is the top user of the disk. I would then like to know what program is using that service host. Can this be figured out with PE or task manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Process Explorer is able to reveal the offending program, has its source code available? Or perhaps someone could add scripting possibility to it. Note that when the disk goes really wild, it is next to impossible to quit the game. The WPR or PE should
 be running and automatically starting recording when the disk goes wild.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What program I would use to analyze the WPR recordings? Is it already installed with the performance toolkit?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Anahuj,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform a full computer virus scan using Windows Defender Offline as it can help remove hard to find malicious and potentially unwanted programs using definitions that recognize threats. Definitions are files that provide an encyclopedia
 of potential software threats. Armed with definition files, Windows Defender Offline can detect malicious and potentially unwanted software, and then notify you of the risks.</p>
<p>

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>There could be a loss of data while performing a scan using Windows Defender Offline to eliminate virus if any.</p>

            <p>How to analyze WPR recordings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why virus check? How viruses relates to this problem of unwanted service processes going up when I don't want them to go up? I would like to tell Windows 8 to raise services only when I am sleeping.</p>
<p>I can list malicious programs: Java update scheduler, Windows file indexer, virus scanners, Steam updater, Origin updater, Firefox updater, etc. All of them does their work when I don't want them to do; and there is very little control over their behaviour.
 Windows 8 should take care that no program or service feels itself as that important that they ruin my game experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The offending process is Windows 8 host service ("palvelun isännöinti: paikallinen palvelu").</p>
<p>How to find out what processes uses that process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: In Linux, as non-talented user, I would continuously record the process table (with program "top" or modification of it) and then later examine what processes jumped active at the time of massive disk use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Python installed and can code that kind of simple program if possible. Anyone reading who knows this kind of use of Python in Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would prefer if someone at Microsoft examines the exact problem: who is using disk so much that games starts freezing. This problem is not limited to me. And also this problem existed as soon as we installed first game to a brand new computer
 which yet did not have Internet connection. Thus I don't believe to virus infection, or the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of buying official Windows 8+, instead of preinstalled Acer, for official Microsoft support, if any. It would be nice if Microsoft technician could log in to my computer - sort of - and check how it runs, but perhaps this kind of service is
 not yet available.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for the reply and update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows 8 Task Manager makes it much easier to find what services are running under a particular SVCHOST.exe for instance.
<span>&nbsp;</span>You can also use the “Ctrl+Shift+Esc” keyboard combination to automatically open the Task Manager from any screen in Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Scroll down until you see the Windows Processes category and look for the Service Host entries.</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Next to each Service Host row process will be a little arrow. Click on this arrow to expand that particular Service Host entry to see what services are running under it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under the expanded Service Host, you will now see the list of services that is running under it. This allows you to easily determine what services a particular SVCHOST
 process is managing in Windows 8.</span></p>

            <p>I have came up to conclusion that this will never be solved by finding what program uses the disk at 99%. Easy way to solve this is to limit the disk use to 90% or lower. The 99% just jams the computer; 3D graphics may freeze for several seconds; certainly
 the frame rate drops to 2 fps or lower; network may disconnect (rarely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The limiter should be at low level so that all programs using the disk will be affacted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio engines uses this kind of limiting because it is important to get the audio to/from disk without dropouts. Don't remember how people have limited the use in GNU/Linux, but in audio engine, easiest way is to tie all disk use to the audio stream rate
 and interrupts.</p>

            <p>Hi. By looking the task manager, I have figured out most offensive disk users. Like told, the problems started as soon as we purchased new Acer/Windows 8 and affected Tomb Raider game and now Guild Wars 2 game by giving massive freezes; frame rate drops
 to 0.2 (at worst) and is unusable for 5-20 minutes. Lost many good moments, frustation has been topped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Offensive programs:</p>
<p>-windows modules installer</p>
<p>-windows modules installer (name in finnish language)</p>
<p>-windows installer</p>
<p>-windows search</p>
<p>-.net framework optimization service</p>
<p>-antimalware service executable</p>
<p>-service host: disk repair&nbsp; (name in finnish language)</p>
<p>-local security authority process</p>
<p>-defender? (cannot verify now because i stopped it before taking time to look at offenders)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All are by Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said, I heard of these problems before purchase of computer because co-worker had noticed game freezes. Like people here, I too thought about virus something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to disable all these? How to time them in desired times? How to do them via manual launch?</p>
<p>Where are their exe files? In case I want remove the programs for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I extensively use the task mamager to kill processes, but not all can be killed. I have ruined the process launch lists because in search of the true offenders I stopped all other services; like any virus check and defender. Tried to turn defender on, don't
 know if it is broken or not; it could not update the database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been real hell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is to limit all disk use, at system level, to 90%. E.g., audio engine could be used to tell how much data can be transferred to/from disks. Audio card provides steady rate.</p>

<h2>            No Achievement, Extreme Frustration&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I love Halo. I think it's the single greatest franchise in history, period. Well, to me that is. I know others like other games more, but Halo to me makes me remember gaming as a whole. It's the epitome of what a videogame should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But ****, I can't stand this Achievement crap. I expected this of Gears of War 1 (Took me over 11,000 kills to get Seriously..., should've only taken 10,000) but for Halo? This wouldn't happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nope, guess not. I have gotten this Achievement twice before but chalked it up to quitting players and not being on the required maps. No big deal, doesn't effect me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got a single flag capture on Highlands (Defiant map pack) while my teammates drove me. I was the original driver but no one wanted to jump out so I did. Got flag, got the score.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I grab the flag in yet another run where I'm the passenger and my other guys wait for me. They get slaughtered and I literally ran the flag the entire way to my base. All the freaking way. I got the second Capture all by myself and was pretty pumped
 to win the game for my team (It was 2-2) and simultaneously get the achievement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nope, no achievement pop. Nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not one to care about achievements, but goddamnit it is pretty stupid when I actually do get the required criteria for an achievement and it doesn't pop up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm extremely disappointed right now... Just so stupid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time for bed, as the 7 beers in my tummy are starting to make me sleepy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, check my last game for the required achievement specs. Was playing on Highlands, no one quit, etc. Give me my freaking achievement Bungie!</p>

<p>Just an FYI, you can get all 3 of the Defiant map pack achievements in custom games. All you need to do is use Bungies official gametype which you can find on B.Net (If you use the preset one in customs it won't work) and all you do is sign in a guest and
 you can get them in 5 minutes or so. </p>

<p>Sick of playing with retards and kids, and people without microphones. It's always lovely to play with people in private chat, so when you have something important to tell them regarding game play, they can't hear you. I know I can play in Arena, but that's
 like the only place I can find people who have a similar skill set. Oh and team killing, I love that, especially when you get the power weapon and they &nbsp;get so jealous, they betray you, lol. I'm taking this game too seriously. I betray team mates now, just
 for being stupid....</p>

 sometimes I have to wonder since I've sent tons myself because of people who quit games, and yet I'm still running into quitters nearly every day that I play.</span></p>

<p>It's been a while since I played, but I would think on average, all the people who are 'being stupid' would tend to crowd around the lower ranks. &nbsp;Therefore if you play the game right and don't team kill, you should be able to work your way up the ranks
 and leave all the stupid people behind?</p>

<p>You guys are right, obviously, team killing on my part is wrong. I'm a Field Marshall, and I still experience many people doing dumb stuff. &nbsp;Had multiple bad games today....</p>
<p>One game, we played in Asylum. Small map, CTF, 4v4. My team mate grabbed the flag and I was watching his back with the sword. He killed me with the flag because he said I was going to betray him and score. There was no betrayals up to that point, but I just
 lost it and started betraying him the whole game. His 2 friends started to betray me as well. There was so much betrayal back and forth. I got lucky and banned one of them, and stopped betraying.</p>
<p>The next 2 bad games I had were invasion games. I constantly betrayed the person who was my respawn team mate in two separate games. The first, constantly waited around for power vehicles and did nothing else to help us defend. When the enemy picked up the
 core and were a few steps away from the final destination, I died and found this teammate standing around looking at us dying from far away, so I betrayed him again and got booted. And he was a reclaimer. The other invasion game in which I constantly betrayed
 my spawn mate, was because he was AFK. But not so much that he couldn't boot me. That was my last game before getting banned for 'quitting' and posting on this forum.</p>
<p>I hate myself for constantly playing this game in which I constantly get dumb team mates, who either stand around, don't help, or don't listen to advice.</p>
<p>But again, you guys are right, I should play with friends - add more friends.</p>

            If you still have an Xbox 360, then goto settings - account - download history. All your games and dlc you have purchased or got for free will be there for you to download. If you want the prices as well, then your only option is https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders
 but that only shows the last 2 years of purchases.

<h2>            Microphone not working on Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4 with Windows Pro 10. The Realtek "High Definition Audio" Array Microphone stopped working in middle November 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked and installed all current updates, ran "SoftwareRepairTool.KBArticle" Application, and "Diagnosis Tool" with no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The microphone will intermittently operate after running "microphone set-up" with Skype, and Cortana, then fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed an external microphone via the "Logitech WebCam" with microphone, and that worked intermittently, but ultimately failed to function through this external device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to fix this problem will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Matthew, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're having issues using both internal and external microphones, then this could be software related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some solutions you can try to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Try adjusting your mic settings.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>control panel</strong>, and in the search results, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Hardware and Sound &gt; Sound.</strong></li><li>
<p>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recording</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab, select the mic you want, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>. Be sure to select a mic that's enabled and connected to your Surface.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Levels</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab. You'll see two sliders:</p>
<p><strong>Microphone:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Controls the mic’s volume</p>
<p><strong>Microphone Boost:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Controls the strength of the mic's input signal</p>
</li><li><span>Adjust the sliders until your mic is recording at the levels you want. The levels you'll use will vary depending on the amount of background noise and on whether you're using the mic that’s built into your Surface or an external mic. A good starting
 point is to set<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Microphone</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to 50 and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Microphone Boost</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to +24.0 dB.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the automated troubleshooters.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Download the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/E/7/FE74974A-9029-41A0-9EB2-9CCE3FC20B99/AudioRecordingDiagnostic.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sound recording troubleshooter</a>, and in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>File

 Download</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>dialog box, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Open</strong>, and follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reset your device. </strong></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access SMB shares on Macbook &#40;Leopard&#41;.</h2>
                    Unbelievable. Windows 7 comes out and not a single person tried to access data on their Macbook before realizing that it is practically impossible. I cannot access the Local Security Policy editor in this version of Windows 7 (Student Edition) and I can't
 find a way to just get to my files on my Mac.<br />
<br />
Fix this, or if it's fixed, then make it easy to use. Period.

<p>Hello frank <br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>Actually, Windows 7 does a much better job of sharing with Mac than Vista did. No registry changes are necessary. On a network it is almost as easy as networking from the Mac side.</p>
<p>On Mac, make sure you have File sharing ticked in System Preferences--&gt;Sharing. Click the Options button and select "Share files and folders using SMB". Add shared directories as desired.</p>
<p>You must create matching user accounts/passwords on both the Mac and Windows 7. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist
 and match on all machines. Do not neglect to create passwords, even if only simple ones. If you wish a machine to boot directly to the Desktop in Win7 (into one particular user's account).</p>
<p>Please try this convenience</p>
<p>Start--&gt;Search box--&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]</p>
<p>Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC</p>
<p>Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>
<p>You can find the automatic logon options for Mac in System Preferences--&gt;Accounts.</p>
<p>On Win7, Please try these<br />
1. Go to Control Panel<br />
2. All control Panel Items<br />
3. Network and sharing center<br />
4. Click on "Change advanced sharing settings"<br />
You need not be using Home group.<br />
5. Turn ON network discovery<br />
6. Turn ON file and printer sharing<br />
7. Turn ON sharing in the Public folder sharing section<br />
8. Turn ON password protected sharing<br />
9. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted.
<br />
10.With Windows Firewall, setting File and Printer Sharing ON will take care of this for those machines and if you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp;
<br />
11. With third-party firewalls, please configure the LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party security program's Help or user forums for how to properly
 configure its firewall. <br />
12. Do not run more than one firewall. <br />
13. Do not turn off Firewalls; configure them correctly.</p>
<p>The Mac Firewall settings are in System Preferences&gt;Security. Click the lock to make changes and click the Advanced button to make sure SMB Sharing is allowed. If you set it up in the Sharing module, it will be.</p>
<p>On Win7, create shares as desired. I usually just share the Public folder, users' desktops, and any additional data hard drives in the system.</p>
<p>Hope it helps<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

            <p>Ok, finally got Cortana to work in UK mode..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to set all regional settings to US (Language \ keyboard\ locale \ speech), then I signed in to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>(This took me through changing my original password to a new PIN feature) Logged off, then logged in, and Cortana was enabled, but obviously in US mode.</p>
<p>Then I changed everything back to UK settings. I forgot to change the speech setting back to UK, so then I received the msg "Cortana is disabled by company policy". After checking and finally changing the speech to UK, I got Cortana working fine......</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems setting Cortana up first in US mode then changing it back to UK mode (assuming you have downloaded the UK language packs first) gets it working. Well it did for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps !</p>
