    <title>Unable to change my Windows LIVE ID &#40;WLID&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to change my Windows LIVE ID &#40;WLID&#41; </h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>For the past 7 months I have been unable to change my current WLID, I have contacted the support department when I first encountered this issue and I was told that a fix would be applied in early to late June. Though out June I waited and still was unable
 to change my WLID, so I called in again then I was told that the fix should be applied sometime in the summer. I waited and still no fix was applied that would allow me to change my WLID.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the steps I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging into the account.live.com &gt; change Windows Live ID &gt; "Your Windows live ID can not be changed at this time"
</li><li>I have tried changing my WLID via the Xbox 360. When trying to do so I recieved the following error code: "80154023 - Can't retrieve information from Xbox. Please try again later". This code I recieved every time I tried to change the WLID on the Xbox 360.
</li><li>I waited for the fix to be applied, I tried to change my WLID today and it seems no fix has been yet applied.
</li></ul>

<p>I was wondering if there is anything that the Xbox support team can do that I am/was unable to do. I have a custom domain name that was issued though the windows live domains area, I am not sure if this is what caused the issue, but I would not think so.</p>

<p>I was told by another rep that I should just cut my losses and make a new gamertag with the desired WLID I want the current to be changed to. However, my question is this:</p>

<p>Will Xbox pay for the remaining months I have on live and pay for my current MS Points, maybe even let me use a hack to get all my statuses and points back on my new account without banning me?
<em>Yeah, I did not think so.</em></p>

<p>I do not want to make a new gamertag or account for many reasons, however, making a new account is just simply not an option. I am just wondering if something can be done to assist me in changing my current WLID.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tyler. (elusiveDEVIANT)</p>

<p>Hey there Elusive! I'm sorry to hear that you haven't found a resolution on this yet. I'd like to clarify a couple things though. First, have you tried changing your WLID to multiple new email addresses, or are you trying the same one over and over? What
 domain is this new email address, and have you been to live.com to set it up as a WLID first if it is not a hotmail or live address? One last thing, is all your account information filled in correctly (name, address, etc)? Let me know what you find out, thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, Mister Gwyther. I have posted about this problem here:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/5967/40902.aspx#40902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../40902.aspx</a></p>
<p>I have created different WLIDs (@hotmail.com, @hotmail.es, @live.com, and with a @gmail.com passport account). And I have checked the same region, and exactly the same name, postal addres, mobile phone ...</p>
<p>But I have the same error: 80154023 when I try to change the WLID.</p>
<p>When I call at SAT, nobody knows the solution. </p>
<p>Thank you again</p>
<p>And Regards</p>

<p>Not sure if this is of any help but I too have had this issue (80154023) for well over a year. I'd pretty much given up on it. Anyway I tried again yesterday and couldn't believe it when I succesfully transferred my tag to a different WLID!</p>
<p>Nothing has changed with my account so I'm assuming the problem has been resolved. So relieved!</p>

<p>I have called 5 times (its true). And nobody in xbox assistant service, has been able to fix this problem.
</p>
<p>In fact, some people in Xbox service doesn't understand the difference to change the email associated at WLID, and change the WLID associated at my gamertag!</p>
<p>They have gave me 1000 microsoft points for this problem. XDD. It's true, i swear.</p>
<p>But I continous with the same problem. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>I have looking for this problem in google. And in any web appears doesn't appear the solution.</p>

<h2>            Elite Controller</h2>
                    <p>After putting in some research into the Elite Controller, I&nbsp;found that it was plagued by issues since day one. Are the issues like the bumpers breaking, stick drift, bad d-pads, etc... still plaguing it. I've been trying to find out if any of these issues have been solved yet I&nbsp;can't find anything recent. I've been on the fence about buying it and the 90-day warranty isn't helping.</p>

            <p>I actually just had an online chat session with Microsoft support about this. I purchased my elite after burning through 2 regular controllers in maybe 2 years. For me personally, the d-pad is solid and I haven't experienced any stick drift. However, after 8 months the right bumper has already broken. There are absolutely no options to have it repaired or replaced if it is outside of the 90 day warranty.</p><p>My opinion is that a console controller at this price should be flawless, or at least last more than a year. I would say you are better off spending the money on multiple regular controllers that will inevitably need to be replaced, or put the money towards a&nbsp;PS4 pro&nbsp;instead (which is what I intend to do.)</p>

            <p>I have the elite now 11 months and everything works well except the rubber grips that are peeling off at all 4 sections. I was told I had no recourse outside 90 day warranty. The glue has come lose from the grip, all four sections. Not the quality I expected from a $150 pro level accessory. Very disappointed by microsofts support. They won't acknowledge the defect or go beyond the 90 day warranty.</p>

            <p>sadly like all things people only report the negatives and not the good things. I have had mine for a year now and its still in the same condition as when I first bought it. Except for the last few weeks I used it nearly every day for at least&nbsp;2 hours. A friend has had one for six months and it still works ok. </p><p>In my opinion it is a very good controller. Like everything some are better made than others I'm sure if you researched anything you would find mostly negative responses on forums. When I decided to look into getting one I read reviews from sites I trusted, watched youtube videos of people trying them out and avoided forums like I would the plague.</p><p>If you decide to get one I hope you enjoy it.</p>

            <p>I've had several Elite controller break for different reasons - a shoulder button or direction on the D-pad stopping working, a trigger getting stuck in, the trigger stop mechanism becoming faulty and causing a trigger to catch, the rubber grip on the back peeling off.</p><p><br /></p><p>The problem I have is that now that I'm used to using the paddles to play games, I really, really don't want to go back to using a regular controller. Thankfully, apart from one, all of the ones that I've had break have been under warranty (we get 12 months as standard in the UK) so they've been replaced for free, but I really wish MS would bring out a new version that addresses the issues and maybe adds a new feature or two (adding a couple of customisable buttons like the Chatpad has would be great).</p>

<h2>            Missed Conversations in Outlook Not Appearing</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a few users that are experiencing an issue where they are not getting the missed conversation notification in their Outlook Inbox. This message should appear as a new e-mail in their inbox when the user does not open the IM via Lync for a duration
 of time.&nbsp; We are running Office 365 (Outlook 2013 / Skype for Business 2015).&nbsp; As an admin I cannot replicate the problem as it is working for me.&nbsp; I read a few other forums and I checked some of the settings but everything looks ok on my end.&nbsp; Below is a
 list of the troubleshooting that I have completed:</p>
<p>Removed and re-added Outlook Profile</p>
<p>Checked Lync Configuration Information (EWS Information Status OK, MAPI Information Status Ok)</p>
<p>Restarted Skype for Business</p>
<p>Ran a Office 365 Offline Repair</p>
<p>Uninstalled Office 365 / Reboot&nbsp;/ Reinstall Office 365</p>
<p>If anyone has any other ideas, please let me know.&nbsp; This is not a widespread issue just a small amount of people are experiencing&nbsp;this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brandon</p>

<p>hi brandon,</p>
<p>based on your description, i understand that some users cannot view their missed conversation in their outlook client.<br />
1. do all the missed skype for business conversations not show up in the problematic usersâ outlook client?<br />
2. update the skype for business and outlook client to the latest version and check if the issue exists.<br />
3. do these problematic missed conversations show in their skype for business client? to search the conversation in skype for business client, please start the skype for business &gt; click the conversation button on the menu &gt; search the missed conversation.</p>

<h2>            Active Directory Domain Services unavailable using Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    Using Vista Home Premium and just installed a new printer. When I set the new printer as the default, everything works fine. But when I use my old printer as the default , but want to print to the new computer, I get the message "The Active Directory Domain
 Services is currently unavailable". I see this same question for Windows 7, but not for Vista. Do I follow the same directions for Vista?

<h3> iamamazing1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Crashing Game</h2>
                    
<p>I've been trying to play a disc game on my Xbox One, and everytime I try to play it goes to the opening frame then crashes back to the home screen. All of my other games, downloaded and non, work. The game is not scratched, ringed or anything of that sort,
 it is completely clean. Does anyone know how I can fix this?</p>

<p>I am getting this with every game. Horizon 2 is at 22% install even though I installed fully on Monday. Alien Isolation says the disc is not in and the same with destiny. It did this before but can't remember how it got fixed? I get the early updates so
 it's probably that but don't know how to roll back. Think the update was the 7th?</p>

<p>I can only play Madden and Titanfall. The rest of my digital library does this same thing. If I try to start the game, it makes the splash screen go full screen for a second, then crashes out back to the dashboard. COD:G (which used to play), Chariot, Max
 (which used to play) and Super Time Force are all unusable. Tried the power off, unplug, wait 30 seconds trick, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>Seriously... This is and has been an issue, yet MS doesn't care to look at it or fix it. I, for the life of me, cannot understand why. Stop putting games on sale and letting us buy them if you have no plans to make your console actually work.
</p>
<p>This isn't a case, either, of some kid treating a console badly. I'm a 40 year old IT Tech that works for a global 10 company.

<p>Same issue with me with Shadow of Mordor. Most other games are fine (Madden, FIFA get regular play right now), but can't get Shadow of Mordor to launch, keeps crashing back to Home.</p>
<p>I've tried various combinations of uninstalling, reinstalling, with various power cycles in between, including unplugging power from the console for a couple of minutes. It has been suggested to me to leave it unplugged for 5 minutes or longer, that is next
 on my list. Hoping to be able to try someone else's disc on Monday to see if the disc itself is the issue.</p>

<p>@GRCurmudgeon: It's not the disc itself...Got exactly the same prob with NBA 2K15, just like @AllusiveApe. "Luckily" the games store gave me a new game, but still the same prob occurs..Splash Screen, then crashes...I tried every possible trick I found online,
 but nothing's worked so far.</p>

<p>I did try a second disc today, same issue, so definitely not the disc. Also tried resetting my Xbox to factory defaults to start completely over, installed Shadows of Mordor first, same issue.</p>
<p>I'm used to games sometimes crashing due to bugs, or having network/online issues since that's a complicated area, or the drive failing to read discs, or something else consistent. With a console I'm not used to having one game crash on launch, refusing
 to run at all, while other games run fine. That happens on the PC with its different hardware and OS/software configurations, but not on a console.</p>
<p>Very frustrating at this point, and not sure what I can do to get my game running.</p>

<p>I dunno, GR... I'm beginning to think that it just won't be fixed. Obviously, MS knows there is a problem. In other threads, various people have mentioned the VERY same issues. In fact, many of them say the same digital games that work for me (Titanfall,
 Madden 15) work for them and ALL other digital downloaded games crash back to the home screen. For now all of my disc based games seem to be working, so thank goodness for that. I've just sworn off buying anything digitally in hopes that eventually MS will
 decide to fix this pervasive issue</p>
<p>It just seems incredulous to me that something that is affecting an obviously high amount of users is being given NO attention at all from Microsoft. I can't tell you how many users I've seen on other gaming sites I frequent asking about this same issue.</p>

<h2>            My Dell screen opens but my OS won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>I tried booting in safe mode&nbsp; to maybe do a system restore, but after I choose my OS the black screen fills only halfway up with file allocations, the last one listed is a driver, then everything just stops and sits, I tried safe&nbsp;mode command prompt to manuelly
 enter a restore point, same result.&nbsp;I do not have any windows CD's not even a boot disk, I know the OS is Windows XP home edition [I know it's old] I don't know what service pack was last installed.&nbsp;I have my desktop to download and burn one though. Oh yea
 my laptop is the one acting up. I even hit the option of "last known functioning blah" same result, so take me from there, can someone point me to where I can d/l a boot disk, maybe try that route, or help me in any way. Oh yea I even went to the symtom tree
 from the dell F12 screen and all the tests passed. Even the one that is named after my specific problem "OS is not loading" and that test ran for a smidge over 2 hours and like I said passed, I don't get it, but I do know I need to get in at least one more
 time and email myself some files or at least burn them, They are signifigant in very extreme inexplicable ways.</p>

<br />
NO diskette, move it to the bottom.<br />
<br />
You want the cd/dvd rom on top and the Hard drive listed next, then the order doesn't matter.
<br />
<br />
With the removal usb devices listed before,when items are attached, like a printer with a memory card inside, iPod, etc..., the computer tries to boot from these. Is all usb devices are removed except the keyboard and mouse, the computer should boot normally.
<br />
<br />
Making these changes in the BIOS allow you to keep the printer and iPod attached.<br />

<h3> inaminit  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t install windows 7 32 bit on raid 1</h2>
                    I recently installed a second Seagate Barracuda 1TB hard drive to my system in order to set up a RAID 1 array. Had minimal trouble getting the drives set up, but once it was done I started to re-install my copy of Windows 7 32 bit. I installed the RAID
 drivers from MSI's website, partitioned the drive and formatted it. But when I selected NEXT after the install program formatted the drives, the program refused to go any further reporting that it could not create a partition on the indicated drive. But the
 partition was already there, I formatted it. Can anyone explain what's going on here? Oh yea, it also says it needs drivers for the CD/DVD drive, but it seems to access the drive just fine. The hard drives are on SATA channel 0 and 1. The CD/DVD is on SATA
 channel 6.<br />

            <p>You would need to consult the msi manual for any specific msi steps. It might depend on whether you are configering raid via the onboard sata chip or via ACHI.</p>
<p>You dont usually format/partition the drives prior to installing win7, you do that as part of the installation process, partitioning or formating useing a third party tool can have unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Nore would you usually need to install third party raid drivers, unless your msi doesnt support win7, if you need to you would install them early in the win7 installation process.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldnt recommend onboard raid, I've seen it cause to many issues, if you want to use raid buy a dedicated hardware controler card, a decent one will cost significantly more than your msi board</p>

            The RAID drives were all set up through the MSI BIOS and RAID set up utilities. No problem there. I then popped in my Windows 7 install DVD and re-booted the computer. The install program ran, and I selected the Repair option and installed the RAID drivers
 from a thumb drive. I then clicked the install button, selected Advanced Install, and from there, inside the Windows set up program, partitioned and formatted the RAID drives.When I clicked next is when the install program told me it could not partition the
 drives, even though it had already done so. That's where the Windows 7 installation stopped.<br />

<h3> 38racing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using word perfect &#34;there was a problem sending the command  to the program&#34;</h2>
                    i have installed wp8 in windows 7 and it runs in xp mode. My problem is that<br />
<br />
I click on a .wpd file I get an error window message saying "there was a <br />
<br />
problem sending the command&nbsp; to the program". WP then opens with blank <br />
<br />
document. I can use file open to get the file. I have wp in my sendto folder <br />
<br />
so if I right click on the .wpd file and do sendto wp it opens fine. When I <br />
<br />
have the problem open&nbsp; and when I have to confirm the opening of wp I click <br />
<br />
details and I see a program switch /ddeex and no file name. If I do the <br />
<br />
details in the sendto I see the file name but it runs out of space so I don't <br />
<br />
know if the /ddeex is there too.

            Hi there!<br /><br />When you cancel your Skype Number, your subscription will remain active until its expiry date. After it expires, Skype will reserve your Skype Number for you on your account for 90 days. This means no one else but you can purchase this particular number during this period. <br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12164/how-do-i-cancel-my-skype-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12164/how-do...</a>

            Hi  javed
<br />
<br />If its less than 90 days since you renewed the number, yes, you should be able to reactivate it.
<br />
<br />To reactivate your Skype Number:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to your account.
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/go/myaccount/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/go/myaccount/</a>
<br />    In the Manage features section, click Skype Number.
<br />    Click Reactivate Settings next to the number youâd like to reactivate, then follow the instructions.

<h2>            Windows Media Player</h2>
                    So I've run into a problem with windows media player and altering song info. Usually I would go to "find album info", and edit all the info through that. But recently, when I pull up album info, there is no edit option. So, I can't change the album artist,
 contributing artist, etc. The only thing they give you is a list of albums found from the internet which could apply, which is not always accurate. Does anybody know how to get back the editing part?

<h2>            Xbox One not powering up&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having a problem with my Xbox one its been working fine since launch. Just before New Years Eve I went to power the console on and it wont power up.</p>
<p>The power units light seems to turn on for a few seconds orange then fades out, I tried to plug the power unit in but not have it plugged into the back off the Xbox One when I do this the light stays on orange. But if its plugged into the back of the console
 it goes off after a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>Is this likely to be a problem with the Power supply or the console?</p>
<p>Im guessing the power supply but just with the light staying on when its plugged into the mains but then the cable not into the back of the Xbox one I was unsure.</p>
<p>Any information would be most appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Skype problems on 2 different desktop PC&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype without problems for a long time (before Microsoft took over).&nbsp; I have Skype installed on 2 different PC's and about 3 weeks ago both stopped working. I installed the latest Skype versions and now I am left with the problems as described
 below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1 : &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Skype version 7.40.0.103 running under Windows10 x64 ver1607/build 14393.1715 on an HP Notebook<br />
No outgoing calls to contacts (skype to skype) work. Symptom is the connecting call sound is OK but there is no dial tone sound and
</p>
<p>the contact response message is "not answering". Echo/Sound test service works 100%. Incoming calls are 100% OK<br />
Action: deleted Skype with powerful uninstaller (IObit) and reinstalled skype. Didn't solved<br />
Disabling firewall didn't help. Previous versions of Skype worked 100%<br />
<br />
Problem 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Skype version 7.36.0.150 running under Windows XP SP3 on an Acer Desktop.<br />
No Incoming calls from contacts (skype to skype) work. Caller gets a no response message. Outgoing calls work 100%</p>
<p>Echo/Sound test service works 100%. Same as with problem1, deleting skype and reinstalling didn't solve the problem.<br />
Also disabling the firewall didn't solve anything. Previous versions of skype worked 100%<br />
<br />
Any ideas ? Many thanks<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Mitch, <br />

<br />
Yes, there is a problem with the update server. AFAIK, most of the comcast users are affected by this.
<br />
<br />
Try changing the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and check. </p>
<p><a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/how-to-change-dns-server-on-windows-7-8-windows-10-and-macos-1669869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/how-to-change-dns-server-on-windows-7-8-windows-10-and-macos-1669869</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, wait for a day or two and Microsoft should fix this. <br />

            Hi Scott, there is no indication that there is any major problem with the update server currently or lately . . 
<br />
<br />135 out of millions would not indicate a problem . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running? 
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu) 
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates 
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?       
        </p>

<p>Hi mitchkenn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick Update: I've moved your question from Virus and Malware forum to Windows 10's Windows Update forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your question, there were some connectivity issues with Windows Update servers per articles linked by Smeed. I hope the issue was temporary and is resolved by now.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you for the reply.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to boot your computer to Clean boot and then check if it helps.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Clean boot: </strong>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.

<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.<br />

<p>I searched and found solutions suggested did not work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After realized that my PC has an HDMI and a DVI ports. &nbsp;Switching my monitor to the different port did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guessing that Windows might sent video output to a different display, I tried Windows+P to change the screen projection, and used up/down arrow keys to select a different display option, and hit Enter. &nbsp;I did this without seeing anything on the screen until
 the right projection option was selected. &nbsp;Ka-ching! I had video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used the Display Settings (right click only the desktop) to change display mode. &nbsp;I saw that my only Monitor shown as display 1 and 2. &nbsp;I had to use the Identify option to finally had my monitor identified as Display 2. &nbsp;I then selected "show only

<p>
</p><p>I am using Dell Desktop. Upgrade Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to other report, my screen went blank after start up. Can see that the Monitor light is active, but no display. Window+P could activate a red panel of Project select on the right column of screen, however, none of the selection PC screen only, Dupe,
 Extend or Second screen only work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no way to revert my upgrade.</p>
<p>

            <p>All of those updates (including the original release of KB2753842) were released on 11 December. This leaves me wondering why they weren't installed&nbsp;before 26 December, the same day you started this thread and the same day (apparently) that you first attempted
 to install .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Note: Since you hadn't installed KB2753842 before it was rereleased on 20 December, the version you did install is the rereleased version (i.e., essentially KB2753842-V2).
<em>Yes, it's very confusing!</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also puzzled by some inconsistencies in the&nbsp;answers you've given me. First you told me that .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile (KB982670)
<em>had been</em> offered to your computer before 26 December (I assume):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Has .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile (KB982670) ever been offered to your computer via Windows Update, Fred?<br />
A: Yes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you told me that you'd never hidden it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Had you ever hidden KB982670?<br />
A: I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But&nbsp;then&nbsp;you told me that you'd never attempted to install .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile (KB982670) before:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Had you ever tried to install KB982670 via Windows Update and/or Automatic Updates before your recent attempts "to play Borderlands 2?"<br />
A: I don't think so.&nbsp; I always install important updates in Windows Update.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Windows Update had offered KB982670 before, you didn't hide it and you always install Important updates offered by Windows Update, why isn't .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile already installed? Why are you attempting to install it (again)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you've already tried running the System Update readiness tool, your next step would be seeing if a Repair Install (AKA In-Place Upgrade; AKA Startup Repair) of Win7, followed by a reboot, resolves the problem. See this tutorial =&gt;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then if still no joy, I'm afraid your only recourse would be a clean install of Win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
