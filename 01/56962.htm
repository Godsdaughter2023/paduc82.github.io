    <title>enable biometrics&#47; fingerprint log in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielmcbain  say:</h3>
<h2>            enable biometrics&#47; fingerprint log in</h2>
                    I just bought my HP Envy and it has a built in finger print scanner. Windows won't let me enable the use of finger print to sign into my windows account to sign into the laptop. I have registered my finger prints through HP simple play and it is registered
 in the system account settings, but says that the fingerprint login is disabled. How do I enable it? The OS is Windows 8.1

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be an issue with the HP Simple pass software as the driver and the fingerprint device works when the simple pass software is removed. Refer to the link and verify if you have installed the latest version of fingerprint driver:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4158&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=5404801#N3086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4158&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=5404801#N3086</a></p>
<p>

            Hi Deana.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What makes you think files were mistakenly saved there?  It would have to have had a drive letter assigned to do this, so you should be able to access the drive in Explorer if it has a drive letter to look.
<br />
<br />If you are receiving an error message that D is full there is an issue where Version 1803 adds a drive letter to the Recovery partition that should be hidden because it's only used for bootable repair tools that in previous edition of Windows were on C drive.   Then it reports that it is full.  
<br />
<br />Since the partition is to meant to be hidden it can't have drive letter removed in Disk Mgmt like other partitions.   So you can wait for Windows Update to deliver a fix for this as promised, or take these steps now to remove it:  
<br />
<br /> 1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove. For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “D”, note the volume number for Drive D.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter.
<br />
<br />select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4. In the example above, if the volume number for drive G is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove. In this example, you would type: remove letter=G
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers.
<br />
<br />Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver. The latest driver I can find is for Windows 7 so I would try using that version.

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Make another account with your same password - set it to ADMIN Level - REBOOT (do not just logoff) and<br />
logon to that account - can you download using it? (make two ADMIN accounts - one in case you have to<br />
migrate to it and another to test and fix).<br />
<br />
While in the new account use it to LOWER your regular account APPLY / OK as needed&nbsp;- and then raise it back<br />
to ADMIN - repeat&nbsp;a few times - lower - raise - go back in lower - raise - repeat. This helps to clear corruption.
<br />
Make sure you leave the account as Admin.<br />
<br />
Try your downloads in the new account.<br />
<br />
If needed later this is the process to fix a corrupted account or migrate to a new one.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to internet with computer set with static IP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to internet with computer set with static IP</h2>
                    <p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a computer that for some odd reason will not connect to the internet if I set a static. &nbsp;I need it to have a static IP because it's on a 3 computer network which shares info on another computer that houses a database so being on DHCP is not an option.
 &nbsp;I'm running Windows 10 Pro (build 10586 545, if that means anything). &nbsp;What I found to be even more confusing is that if I set the IP as the same number that DHCP issued, I still cannot connect to the internet and would not even be able to ping the other
 computers on the network. &nbsp;I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>ipconfig /release</p>
<p>ipconfig&nbsp;/renew</p>
<p>
</p><p>and tried manually entering the static ip, subnet mast, gateway, and dns info using netsh. &nbsp;Nothing has worked. &nbsp;Don't know what else to try. &nbsp;Anyone got any ideas? &nbsp;Help!</p>
<p />

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but I think I figured it out, although it's extremely weird. &nbsp;I noticed that even though I can set the static IP when I type<strong> ipconfig /all</strong> it would show a weird 169.254...address. &nbsp; I am able to set the static IP using
 netsh command but when I type<strong> ipconfig/all</strong> I would see a Preferred IP (IP address issued by DHCP) and a Duplicated IP (which was the one I set). &nbsp;I set out to disable the Autoconfiguation and sure enough after I disabled that I was able to
 go online. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I used the above link to disable the Autoconfiguration, but I had to do so in the local administrator account. &nbsp;I tried typing the commands using an account with Administrator permissions and it didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's even more perplexing now is that now I can set static IP, my start button doesn't work anymore. &nbsp;Don't know how that's even related but I can only right click on the start icon on the bottom left. &nbsp;Weird. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do you get Windows Media Center to utilize clear QAM digital cable&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium. On my computer I have a PLUSTV HD PCI 115 card. The card comes with two tuners - one analog, one digital. &nbsp;Using Arcsoft Totalmedia 3.5 software - I can watch both analog and digital shows being transmitted though
 the cable. NOTE: No setup box, etc - my Time Warner cable is connected directly to my TV card.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER, when I try to a TV SETUP in Windows Media Center - WMC recognizes that my TV card has both an analog and digital tuner - but, after setting up the analog correctly, it tries to set up the digital tuner for&nbsp;Terrestrial&nbsp;signals, instead&nbsp;of
 using the cable's clear QAM digital signals.</strong></p>
<p>How can I get WMC to&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;the clear QAM digital cable signal?</p>

<li><span>"In reading your comments above - what you are saying is&nbsp; - Windows Media Center in Windows 7 cannot handle Clear QAM - Correct?"</span></li></ul>
<p><span>No, that’s not what I meant. Windows 7 handles Clear QAM quite well. I have a Pinnacle tuner in a desktop and an AverMedia Express card in my laptop and both setup flawlessly. When
 I attached the coax, they first found the 75 or so analog channels, then searched for Clear QAM stuff and found another 25 or so digital stations and merged the guide.</span></p>
<p><span>What I was saying is that just because a card works with their included TV app, doesn't necessarily mean it will work within the MC interface. The same was true with XP MCE, there
 were many generic, low-priced analog tuner cards that worked fine with their included app, but would not work at all within the MC interface. That was because MC was designed (for performance reasons) to demand an onboard H/W encoder to convert the analog
 signal. The cheaper cards used a S/W encoding, those cards would not even be recognized&nbsp;on the MC side.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not saying your card won't work, but I can't find any definitive word on it, nothing on their specs at the web indicated it works with 7, they also don't list&nbsp;Windows 7 drivers.
 Yet there seem to be some user reviews implying they got Clear QAM working on Windows 7 -- but that could just be people how mean it works in some other app running in Windows 7, not in the Media Center interface itself.</span></p>

<div>I own a Microsoft Trackball Explorer mouse which I think is the greatest mouse ever created. I believe that the decision to discontinue it was shortsighted when it remains so popular that people are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a used one or
 as much as $500 for a new one as seen on eBay and Amazon. Will Microsoft consider bringing an updated model that would include wireless capability? If they do, put me down for 5 of them to start! (Heck, I'd even buy a few reasonable priced wired versions)

            <p>I also own a Trackball Explorer 1.0.<br />
<br />
If I had any inkling that Microsoft was going to quit making these things, I'd have bought as many as I could to have a supply of fresh trackballs and potential spare parts.<br />
<br />
Everyone I know who has&nbsp;owned one has said the same thing: it was the best, most comfortable trackball they have ever used.<br />
<br />
As it stands, I'm sending mine to a reputable shop for refurb and looking to purchase another used one to get that refurb'd as well.<br />
<br />
I think many people would gleefully buy a modernized version of the Trackball Explorer. I wish Microsoft would start making these again or even&nbsp;sell the design to another company, like CH Products, CST Microspeed, or ITAC Systems.<br />
<br />
I would buy a baker's dozen, just so that I never go without one again.</p>

            <p>Yes for sure the greatest mouse ever produced.</p>
<p>I've one for 15 years I think and bought 2 others a few years ago before it is too expensive and I'm using 2 on two different computers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pray every day for the revival of the trackball </p>
<p>I'll buy ten : 5 wireless and 5 wired </p>
<p>but.... I think they're are not interested with our money lol</p>

</p><blockquote>Bring back a "wireless" version of the Microsoft Trackball Explorer!!!
<div>I own a Microsoft Trackball Explorer mouse which I think is the greatest mouse ever created. I believe that the decision to discontinue it was shortsighted when it remains so popular that people are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a used one or
 as much as $500 for a new one as seen on eBay and Amazon. Will Microsoft consider bringing an updated model that would include wireless capability? If they do, put me down for 5 of them to start! (Heck, I'd even buy a few reasonable priced wired versions)
</blockquote>
<p>Never going to happen. And for one simple reason, MS would lose their accessory revenue and have no market for "new" and "improved" mice...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about it, a mouse that can lasts for over 16 years thru regular use (I bought the three I own in 1999 on sale at CompUSA for $50 each) and all still going strong. A mouse that requires almost no cleaning
</p>
<p>and maintenance - the only part which seems to wear are: </p>
<p>- the steel ball bearings under ball (and they can be replaced with cheap ruby bearings that last forever)</p>
<p>- button spring - replaceable with new springs from most any hobby store</p>
<p>
The only way to get "new" ones are probably from a knock-off company that 3d scans and prints out the form in a 3d printer and uses an off-the-shelf mouse innards. MS could make a fortune, but some enterprising individual with a 3d printer will beat them to
 it.</p>

<h2>            After  successful system restore - automatic repair starts and will not boot error 0xc000021a</h2>
                    <p>I had &nbsp;problems with my computer - Windows 8 updated to 8.1 by auto update where all aps inc Maps where not functional so I carried out a System Restore.</p>
<p>This was successful and when the computer tried to restart it went into an Automatic Repair sequence and I got Error 0xc000021a and it recycles without restarting. The repair disc I have is for Windows 8-64bit &nbsp;that was loaded from the disc - can this disc
 be used?</p>

            <p>Hi Shivam,</p>
<p>I have followed your suggestions I can get through to step 4, but when I select Automatic Repair it cycles through the diagnosis and then reports that it cannot repair PC (error 0xc000021a) with options of shutting down or advanced. If I try advanced, troubleshooting
 and automatic repair it just recycles.</p>
<p>You recommend backing up files and folders - the only way I can think to do this is to remove the hard drive and copy to my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also recommended that I tried using command prompt to disable auto restart. unfortunately my knowledge of MSDOS is minimal and I cannot open the x:/source directory</p>
<p>Regards Simon</p>

    <title>Duplicate program files,possibly from old installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msherman2201  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate program files,possibly from old installation</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo Yoga 2 came with Windows 8.1 and soon after was upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have two program file directories, one is called Program files, the other is call Program files (x86). The folders in each directory are mainly unique but there are some
 folders where the properties, size, last modification date and sizes of individual files are the same.&nbsp; Both program directories have a folder called Common Files, both with the same creation date and timestamp and the same date and timestamp under last modified,
 but under the (x86) folder the Common Files has more files listed and about twice the disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since disk space is tight on&nbsp; my SSD, I would like to eliminate any duplicates, but to start with I'm not sure why there are two program file directories to start with and what really I'm looking at?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions about what might be going on and/or how to unravel it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            This normal and its part of 64 bit Windows 10. Do not in anyway modify either folders. The x86 folder keeps your 32 bit programs, while the non x86 Program Files folder keeps your 64 bit programs.

            There is nothing wrong with my autocad installation or version.&nbsp; I had this problem months ago, found out how to fix it, by checking or unchecking the "enable program specific settings" and it fixed the problem.&nbsp; Last week I changed themes on my laptop
 which obviously changed this setting as well, because I am now having the same issues in autocad that I did months ago.&nbsp; I just need to know where I can find this check box again.&nbsp; Maybe it's not called "enable program specific settings", but something else.&nbsp;
 What I need to do, is disable the windows settings for my mouse and allow it to use the autocad settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot do anything with any of the files&#47;folders.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, something is wrong with my computer and I need help to find a solution for fixing these problems.</p>
<p>Here is the problem. Every file or folder I try to delete, move or rename...nothing happens. Like if I try to delete something weather I click the delete button or mark the file/folder and then click on the delete option with ''rightmousebutton'', nothing
 happens at all like it have never ever happened. Same goes with the moving. When I move the file anywhere, lets say something I downloaded and I try to move it to my desktop, it just doesn't go there its still at the ''downloads'' and wont go anywhere. I find
 both of these deleting/moving files problems really weird because there are no errors or anything while I am trying to delete/move files its like the buttons would not work at all and its driving me crazy since a lot of files that I dont need anymore will
 just take a lot of space. Also while moving file or folder from one desktops place to another, it will move but when PC is restarted it will appear at the same place it was before.</p>
<p>Same problem happens when I try to rename the files. Once I rename the file it will come back to its old name and everything will act like nothing happened at all, no errors, no signs, nothing.</p>
<p>I would be thankful if you could help me or advice something. Thanks.</p>
<p />

            No, this computer is all mine and it did not behave like this always. This started maybe some months ago and before I noticed this problem there was a couple of weird behaviors which never happened before. Like sometimes out of nowhere blue screen would
 pop up or disk check will start really often when I turn on the PC. And all of this started some months ago&nbsp;and now&nbsp;I noticed that I cant do anything with any of the files.

<h2>            Windows 10 out of memory issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new HP all in one with 8gb of ram.&nbsp; I've been running windows 10 for a few weeks now and almost every day get a pop up telling me I'm low on memory and to close down apps.&nbsp; Why is this happening/&nbsp; Is it related to Microsoft using our PCs to
 push out Windows 10 upgrades to the world?</p>

<p>

            Same here I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 Home.&nbsp; I get this message every time I unlock my PC.&nbsp; There is no open application.&nbsp; I have a HP EV710 desktop with 12 GB RAM, 4GB VRAM, 2 TB HD with over 1 TB left on it.&nbsp; No way it should run out
 of memory.&nbsp; There are services running but I never had this problem on 8.1 before the upgrade.&nbsp; Just have the basic updaters running (adobe, java, Microsoft, HP etc.).&nbsp; Also have Steam but like I said it's never been a problem on 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;After closing the dialog,
 I checked resource monitor and it says I have about 8 GB of unused memory.&nbsp; @#$%$.&nbsp; It IS&nbsp;REALLY ANNOYING.

            <p>Tried that. No problems found. (even tried it as administrator)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I have 8Gb RAM, and at no time is it ever all used, I changed the Page File from System to Manual and increased the min and max sizes (max size is now 3Gb). So far this appears to have worked although I don't know why!</p>

<p>I too have suffered from this memory error. My pc ran windows 7 pro 64bit with no problems before updating(down grading) to windows 10. Since then I have received the "warning! low memory error. Close some applications to resolve this" problem. My pc is
 certainly able to run windows 10 with out any problems. It has 4gb of ram, a 2gb(on board) graphic card, Norton internet security etc. This error occurs when trying there is 2 programs open at the same time e.g. on the internet using IE 11 and accessing windows
 explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have now returned to windows 7 pro WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL! All is running as it should.</p>
<p>This error seems to be to do with the incorrect allocation of ram via the Page Swap File and is therefore a windows 10 bug, error, problem NOT a pc hardware specific problem!</p>
<p>I have to say that I feel MS has released a half finished OS into the wild and that is deplorable! Windows 10 users are all beta testers! Return to your previous OS until MS can put out a half decently finished OS.</p>

            I never had this issue with Windows 8.1 and have it at least daily with Windows 10.&nbsp; Even if I use less applications then I did at a time with windows 8 this still happens.&nbsp; Also if I let my pc just sit overnight when I get on in the morning Microsoft
 has closed apps since it ran out of memory when it was just sitting there. Microsoft definitely has an issue with there memory management in windows 10 and needs to get it fixed ASAP

            This is a problem with me as well.&nbsp; The question is... is Microsoft gonna fix this problem or not.&nbsp; The whole clean boot response earlier in this topic just shows that the Microsoft engineers don't know what heck is going on.&nbsp; If your gonna be a technician
 learn the product and give us consumers some better customer service.&nbsp; This IS a windows 10 issue.&nbsp; FIX IT.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to run Windows Memory Diagnostics utility<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Windows 8.1 includes built-in features to help you identify and diagnose problems with memory. Refer to the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + R</strong>&nbsp;on the Keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;<strong>mdsched.exe</strong>&nbsp;in the Search box, and then press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose whether to restart the computer and run the tool immediately or schedule the tool to run at the next restart.</span></li><li><span>Windows Memory Diagnostics runs automatically after the computer restarts and performs a</span><span>&nbsp;standard memory test automatically. If you want to perform fewer or more tests, press F1, use the Up and Down arrow keys to set the Test Mix as Basic,
 Standard, or Extended, and then press F10 to apply the desired settings and resume testing.</span></li><li><span>When testing is completed, the computer restarts automatically. You’ll see the test results when you log on.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>Not sure why you would think this would help, especially as everyone has pointed out that there were NO problems under previous operating system (be that Win 7, Win 8 or Win 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, tried it - no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously reported that changing the Swap File (Page File) seemed to have stopped the problem I subsequently had the Out of Memory message reappear, so this is NOT a fix.</p>

            Hello,<br /><br />From my personal experience, Windows Defender is sufficient for your Windows 10. You do not need any other antivirus as in my opinion they sometimes breaks Windows features and user finds it tedious to revert the changes made by them.<br /><br />I am using Windows Defender since I first time installed Windows 10 and it have never dissapointed me, till date. Just make sure, you keep its virus and spyware definitions up-to-date.<br /><br />Regards.

<h2>            My computer opens apps not actual website</h2>
                    <p>Well, hope I can describe the problem correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a bank's website I opened my own account. Half of the features was not showing. I called customer service and they said that this web site is being opened as app on my computer (laptop, windows 10). To open it I just type their name&nbsp; in URL. On a list
 of my computer's apps I don't see anything that would relate to that website. I tried to open it in 3 different browsers - Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Mozilla, with the same result.&nbsp; Can someone please explain me the situation? Tank you in advance!</p>

            Thank u for reaching out to me! &nbsp;I use windows 10 version 1703 os build 15063.540. &nbsp; Dont remember making any changes prior. I am having a lot of issues with my computer lately. For example, hard disk C: is filling up to the rim when I work on computer
 and I need to restart it every 3 days in order to 'free' space on my hard drive. I tried a few suggestions online but none of them worked to eliminate issue completely.&nbsp;

<p>In my case, I'm a Bucs fan and Paka was the name of my cat (usually use Paka in some form everywhere online). I'd say pick something that means something to you or something funny. I like ones that have a little thought put into them or make me chuckle.
 My least favorites are ones that have generic, overused terms; especially ones that are bragging about skills.</p>

<p>I play shooter games (r6, flashpoint, GR etc) and my last named was taken so I threw in Lieutenant, but then when I rank up in games I'm like Sargent Lieutenant... oh well. The worst part is though people with gamertags like B1gm@cM3alD3al heckle me for
 it if I play online. That is not, as far as I know, a real player but you know the type.</p>

<p>I looked for adjectives and verbs&nbsp;that describe me and searched synonyms to find words until I found a fitting word to change a letter and add a bit of style and custom touch along with a more name-like appearance. I’m always on
 the computer performing keystrokes, but I changed the ‘k’ in keystroke to a ‘q’ so it becomes a bit more disassociated from the word keystroke and more like a name.</p>

    <title>BootCamp Windows 7 Pro sfc &#47;scannow unrepaired files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyntrifical  say:</h3>
<h2>            BootCamp Windows 7 Pro sfc &#47;scannow unrepaired files</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro 15 inch (model "MacBookPro6,2") which has the following components:</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 M 620 "Arrandale" @ 2.67GHz</p>
<p>8GB DDR3 RAM (2 x 4GB)</p>
<p>Nvidia GeForce GT 330M (512MB Video Memory)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running MacOS 10.12 (Sierra) on the OS X partition, and Windows 7 Professional x64.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Now most people use BootCamp to install Windows on an Apple computer, however, due to issues with the SATA connections on the Logic Board (motherboard) and faulty Superdrives (CD-ROM drive) I was unable to utilize BootCamp for my installation. I tried using
 a USB connected CD-ROM drive, with a Windows Installation ISO burned to disc, which worked throughout the section of partitioning through BootCamp the drive size, as well as BootCamp formatting the created partition as MS-DOS (FAT32), I downloaded the necessary
 BootCamp drivers for Windows through BC, however, upon automatically restarting and trying to boot from the new partition to begin installation, it would boot to a black screen which said "No bootable device detected". And no matter what I did, nothing ever
 worked. Installation through USB sticks, etc. simply because it has something to do with this MacBook being a UEFI boot system, and that USB installs wouldn't work with Windows, etc. etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's where the install got tricky. I used a method found online (after weeks of searching) where you download the following software:</p>
<p>VMware Fusion 8.5, Paragon VMDK Mounter, and WinClone 6.0.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically step 1 begin by starting up Fusion, and beginning a Virtual Machine installation, and you set your desired disk size (mine was 300GB), and when you reach the first reboot of the install, during which you suspend the VM and close Fusion. Then
 you go to MacOS Disk Utility app, and create your desired size partition, formatting it as MS-DOS(FAT32) however, you must make the size of this larger than your desired partition (mine had to be 325GB) due to the VM process adding more space (VMDK file was
 322GB), then you go find the VMDK file, mount it to the Desktop with Paragon VMDK Mounter, then open WinClone and select the VMDK file, next click on the empty BootCamp partition, and click "Restore to Volume", which then clones the contents of the VMDK to
 the real partition. Supposedly this method allows the needed install files to be put into the created partition (WinClone makes it bootable and NTFS) and then upon restarting and selecting the new "Windows" startup disk, Windows installation continued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I performed this, Windows 7 worked like a charm, and I lost it all due to trying to make my system a triple boot by installing Linux (Ubuntu) next to MacOS and windows, and somehow I fried the entire disk, requiring me to re-install MacOS,
 and Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, sorry for writing a book, just trying to give all the details which may be relevant to this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this new installation, Windows Update was screwy off the bat, so I had to use the Update Readiness Repair Tool for Win7 from Microsoft Support, which then fixed Windows Update, however, I performed a sfc /scannow command line script, which stated "SFC
 found corrupt files and was able to fix some, but some were unable to fix" (paraphrasing here) and I've posted the CBS.log file below detailing that scan. It appears the unfixable files were demo sounds and photos that come preinstalled with Windows which
 are totally irrelevant to the operation of the computer, but am I missing anything here? Just want to make sure it's good to go, so far everything is up to par and working like before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>CBS.log-&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>POQ 59 ends.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend to run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM), it's a command-line tool that is used to mount and service Windows images before deployment and repair Windows image. It's essential to use especially when System File Checker was
 not able to repair the corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open an elevated <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em>.</p>
<p>2. Run the command below and press <em><strong>Enter</strong></em>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs, we suggest posting your question in the <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Forums</a></strong>, where we have support professionals who are well equipped

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, however, from my understanding Windows 7 doesn't have the "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" Command Line tool installed, but instead you have to download the "System Update Readiness Tool" which is the equivalent of DISM.
 The link to the Microsoft article that I read is here -&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click Here">Fix Windows Update
 errors by using the DISM or System Update Readiness tool</a></p>
<p>I already downloaded and ran the tool above which did repair somethings such as fixing some Windows updates that kept failing, however, SFC /SCANNOW continues to come back with the same message over and over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For some reason the alleged "experts" engaged by Microsoft don't seem to know that their suggestion of running DISM will not work in Windows 7 and if they were to actually follow their own advice they would see something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/135cb094-a423-4490-862a-89bd41bb0cde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/135cb094-a423-4490-862a-89bd41bb0cde" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But they keep suggesting it?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should tell us that the Microsoft engaged 'experts" so not follow their own advice or try their own suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation I have is that as many times as the alleged "experts" engaged by Microsoft like to suggest the System File Checker (sfc&nbsp; /scannow) if SFC reports a problem they have never demonstrated the ability to resolve the reported problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know anything about getting Windows to run with BootCamp but I know if I had some SFC errors and could not resolve them I would not look in this community for help solving the problem - I would look in another community where there are plenty of
 SFC issues that are actually being resolved successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is what I usually have to say about SFC issues (which may not apply to a BootCamp implementation):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As many times as sfc /scannow is suggested in this community I have never see a Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" ever actually resolve any errors reported by the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They tell you to run it and report the results but if there are problems that are not fixed, I can't recall them ever actually figuring out what the problem is and fixing anything.&nbsp; I'm sure if there is an example of that actually happening (without a Repair
 Install or complete reinstall) somebody will provide some links to examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what has happened to your system the fix could be very easy or you might need some help so I would downloading SFCFix.exe to your desktop from this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.sysnative.com/niemiro/apps/SFCFix.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysnative.com/niemiro/apps/SFCFix.exe</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing, learning and practice purposes it is easy to create corruption issues that cannot be fixed by sfc&nbsp; /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I manually created a problem that sfc /scannow reported but could not fix (SFC is not as smart as some folks think) then ran SFCFix.exe to see what it had to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the SFCFix.exe process will fix the problem all by itself as you can see in this simple example where I created a corruption that sfc /scannow could not fix but SFCFix.exe was able to fix an "unimportant" corruption in one pass:</p>
<p><br />
SFCFix.exe fixed one corruption all by itself:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e71c5fc8-0b3c-4b16-abe2-2146e6094c30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e71c5fc8-0b3c-4b16-abe2-2146e6094c30" /></a></p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>That was pretty easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If SFCFix.exe can't fix the problem you may be promoted to insert your genuine Windows 7 SP1 installation CD/DVD and SFCFix will try to get the missing file(s) from there but if you don't have that or SFCFix can't find what it needs a results and log file
 called SFCFix.txt will be created on your desktop:</p>

<p>For some reason the alleged "experts" engaged by Microsoft don't seem to know that their suggestion of running DISM will not work in Windows 7 and if they were to actually follow their own advice they would see something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a299b865-b953-4012-b359-ed18bf749a74" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a299b865-b953-4012-b359-ed18bf749a74" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But they keep suggesting it?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should tell us that the Microsoft engaged 'experts" so not follow their own advice or try their own suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation I have is that as many times as the alleged "experts" engaged by Microsoft like to suggest the System File Checker (sfc&nbsp; /scannow) if SFC reports a problem they have never demonstrated the ability to resolve the reported problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know anything about getting Windows to run with BootCamp but I know if I had some SFC errors and could not resolve them I would not look in this community for help solving the problem - I would look in another community where there are plenty of
 SFC issues that are actually being resolved successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is what I usually have to say about SFC issues (which may not apply to a BootCamp implementation):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As many times as sfc /scannow is suggested in this community I have never see a Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" ever actually resolve any errors reported by the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They tell you to run it and report the results but if there are problems that are not fixed, I can't recall them ever actually figuring out what the problem is and fixing anything.&nbsp; I'm sure if there is an example of that actually happening (without a Repair
 Install or complete reinstall) somebody will provide some links to examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what has happened to your system the fix could be very easy or you might need some help so I would downloading SFCFix.exe to your desktop from this link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For testing, learning and practice purposes it is easy to create corruption issues that cannot be fixed by sfc&nbsp; /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I manually created a problem that sfc /scannow reported but could not fix (SFC is not as smart as some folks think) then ran SFCFix.exe to see what it had to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the SFCFix.exe process will fix the problem all by itself as you can see in this simple example where I created a corruption that sfc /scannow could not fix but SFCFix.exe was able to fix an "unimportant" corruption in one pass:</p>
<p><br />
SFCFix.exe fixed one corruption all by itself:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98840f71-7688-46fb-9433-080a6269cef0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98840f71-7688-46fb-9433-080a6269cef0" /></a></p>
<p><br />
When I ran sfc /scannow again the problem I created was fixed&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>running sfc /scannow again reported no issues.</p>

<p>@ElderIn, thanks for the response! Much more helpful as you said than the Microsoft moderators scripted responses. I will certainly try this method next. Will keep this thread updated!</p>
