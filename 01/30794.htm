                    <p>My brother has been sending emails via @nifty.com to my @Hotmail.com, 5 emails per a week almost without any problem.</p>
<p>Only when he sends an email using a group of people, which contains 2 Hotmail users, he receives error messages only for the Hotmail users. The error message is shown below. He successfully resends the email to the Hotmail users after about several minutes
 later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain me where is the problem located?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The nifty receives&nbsp;his message at&nbsp; Thu, 23 Oct 2014 09:31:57 and sent error message at Thursday, October 23, 2014 9:32. This means the nifty should retry it a few minutes after.</p>

    <title>Selecting audio device &#47; playback device per application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Selecting audio device &#47; playback device per application</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to change the playback device of certain applications for use with virtual audio cable. However none of them support changing the playback device inside the application.</p>
<p>I was able to do something like this with a bug in vista, where the audio kept going through the device it was started in untill it was restarted or minimized even if you changed the device after it was opened.</p>
<p>Now that i use windows 7 x64 I can no longer do this because the bug is not there anymore. I also tried IndieVolume, it looks like its exactly what I need, but it does not work for x64 or just windows 7 in general or something.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help in advanced, and sorry if this has already been resolved and im just spamming.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, this is not possible. There might be some third-party tools that provide this functionality and to do this you have to invoke them.
 You may use your favorites search engine to find any of these software’s that provide this functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Also post your question in Microsoft Connect forums, if you would like to have this feature in Windows 7.<br />

<ol>
<li><span><strong>Calibrate display color </strong>clicked on same thru cortana.</span></li><li><span>Clicked <strong>Next </strong>on <strong>Display Color&nbsp;Calibration</strong> window. No Sliders or adjustment options</span></li><li><span>Clicked <strong>Next</strong> on <strong>Set basic color&nbsp;settings&nbsp;</strong>window. No sliders or adjustment options</span></li><li>There was no screen for <strong>How to&nbsp;adjust gamma so I</strong><span>&nbsp;clicked&nbsp;<strong>Nex</strong>t button to continue.</span></li><li><strong><span>When the above fourth step screen was not available&nbsp; to Adjust gamma</span></strong><span>&nbsp;window prompts. I Pressed
<strong>Next </strong>button.</span></li><li><span>Then&nbsp;I saw&nbsp;the <strong>Find the brightness&nbsp;and contrast controls display</strong>. BUT NO SLIDERS or Adjustment options SO I Tapped on
<strong>Skip brightness and&nbsp;&nbsp;contrast adjustment still to see what happens</strong>.</span></li><li><span>I got the&nbsp;window called&nbsp;<strong>How to adjust color balance</strong>. without any sliders.</span></li><li><span>In the window “How to adjust color balance”,&nbsp; I hit the <strong>Next</strong> button to go further window.</span></li><li><span>Here, I&nbsp;noticed another window <strong>Adjust&nbsp;color balance</strong>. In this window,&nbsp;I had&nbsp;no option or sliders to adjust the primary colors&nbsp;in fact there&nbsp;the strips had no&nbsp;<strong>red</strong>,
<strong>blue or</strong>&nbsp;<strong>green</strong> colors except black and grey strips&nbsp;so I&nbsp;pressed the
<strong>Next</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>Finally, I clicked the&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong> button.</span></li></ol>

<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 3552 running Windows 10 and I am trying to adjust the contrast and came upon this post. &nbsp;As much as I appreciate the copy-paste from the Windows site, this isn't working. &nbsp;Here is what is going on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I can slide the gamma control as much as I want, the dots don't disappear</p>
<p>- Under the contrast and brightness section, there is no control (a slider like in the gamma section) to adjust the contrast, all I can do is click next. &nbsp;The Dell has a brightness control on the keyboard (F11 &amp; F12) but this doesn't work for contrast and
 I&nbsp;am assuming that since I am calibrating it so that I can use those buttons later, I should have some other Windows based&nbsp;control to use here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything else you can suggest?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This computer is just a day-old so I haven't done anything except that it automatically setups itself. So when it was ready, I went to IE and download these two search engine applications but that was the message I was receiving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I was trying to access the last thing you suggested me as "Clean Boot" but for more than 10 minutes, there is only a blank page. I tried to refresh it again and again but it shows the same result... a blank page.</p>

<p>Hello Sher Amo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the kind assistance however that option didn't work for me.</p>
<p>Here are the things I have observed while performing that exercise of creating another account and add as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. That link doesn't open in my computer. I have to copy the link and open it through my mobile phone so that I can follow the steps.</p>
<p>2. Creating and adding another account and making it as an Administration was successful.</p>
<p>3. After restarting PC and log-in to the new account, I performed downloading chrome or Mozilla firefox but I received the same result... "ChromeSetup_exe couldn't be downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know why this new Windows is very very complicated. While back in the PH where counterfeit Windows products are prominent, I have no problem using cloned Windows 10 downloading and installing known programs but of course that's a bad practice.
 Now that I opted for something morally upright and it doesn't work. This is so frustrating, not user-friendly thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is taking my time already.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            how to remove windows and install linux &#63;</h2>
                    I couldn't use my Windows 7 system anymore because spyware / adware kept interrupting me, and I couldn't remove it without paying $100 to upgrade antivirus and spyware, so I decided to install Linux instead. How do I remove my Windows system and install
 Debian Linux ? <br />

            <p>Download DBAN (<a href="http://www.dban.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dban.org/</a>)&nbsp;and burn it to a blank CD/DVD using ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a>)&nbsp;(on XP/Vista) no additional Software needed
 for Windows 7 or alternatively make a bootable USB using Universal USB Installer (<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insert this device and enter the BIOs setup (F2 at the Dell Bios Screen, different key for non-Dells), in the BIOs setup disable any card readers otherwise DBAN won't quite work. Boot from this device (Hold F12 for a Dell another key for a non-Dell&nbsp;at the
 BIOs screen and select boot from CD/DVD or from USB respectively). Follow the onscreen instructions to completely eradicate any data on your hard drive. Do this before installing Windows. Once this is complete reboot as prompted and then power down. When powering
 up hold F2 to enter the BIOs setup and then enable the card reader. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will have wiped your hard drives properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next install UBUNTU or similar do this by downloading their latest&nbsp;.iso and making a bootable USB or DVD and booting from it (F12&nbsp;at the Dell BIOs screen or similar for a non-Dell)&nbsp;- follow the onscreen instructions and see how you like it.

    <title>Sound Issues on Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pmccormick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Issues on Windows XP</h2>
                    Okay, so first off I have read a ton of other posts about sound troubles with XP that are
<i><b>similar</b></i> to my problem. My problem is that, first, the default tan speaker icon for Volume Control on the taskbar is missing. The second problem is that in Sounds and Audio devices my speakers don't show up, and the default device is
<i>Modem #1 Line Playback. </i>What's very strange is that I actually do get sound but only in certain programs (absolutely NO Windows noises and in a few games, but I do get sound in Google Chrome and a few other games). At first I was using a Rocketfish soundcard,
 but the problem is exactly the same despite which card I use (onboard or Rocketfish).<i>&nbsp;</i>I have the latest Realtek HD Audio Driver for my system and NVIDIA installed HD Drivers too (No there is no conflict, I tried disabling them separately). Because I'm
 kind of tired of typing all of this over again I'm posting 4 links at the bottom for you to view at your&nbsp;convenience, I'd suggest looking at the GeeksToGo link (absolutely must look there, that has EVERYTHING I posted about this) and the Nexus Forums link
 (only if you want, not much, if anything, is different from GeeksToGo but I may have posted something useful there and not at GeeksToGo) because they (I think) contain everything posted about my problem while the other two are kind of behind (I stopped posting,
 though I believe the Best Buy one says what my speakers are).&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have posted in four other places, two I&nbsp;received&nbsp;absolutely no help, one they just stopped helping (they actually didn't help until I sent a complaint about my post being up for like 7 days without anyone even giving a suggestion), and the other recommended
 things I already tried and things I wanted to avoid (such as reinstalling Windows and losing everything I have, or paying to take it to Best Buy).</div>

            Okay, I found out last night (sorry forgot to share this information) that my sndvol32.exe was compressed (I had recently been cleaning up my computer and used some of the System Tools) to sndvol32.ex_ but even after expanding it I can't set the Volume
 Control to the taskbar because of my second problem. Despite the fact it says that the Modem is selected as an audio device it says No Audio Device. My speakers don't show up in the list of devices so no, I can't select them. I did say that the volume control
 was my<b> first </b>problem, but its&nbsp;definitely not the one I'm worried most about.&nbsp;<br />
<div>Since apparently my whole post wasn't read I'll clarify everything again (Sorry if that sounds rude, but I didn't write that whole damn thing for no reason). My main problem is that sound isn't really working as it should. It works in some programs but
 not every program. &nbsp;For example, the Windows noises will <i>not </i>play. When I try to "preview" one of the sounds from Sounds and Audio Devices it says my
<i>sound card may be in use. </i>However I do get sound in Metro 2033 for example. Also, some things, such as Borderlands, have sounds during some parts but not all parts. In that example (Borderlands) cutscenes have sounds while the menu and game do not. And
<i>PLEASE </i>read the posts I made at other sites asking for help. I know there are things I forgot to mention here!</div>

            <p>Hi PMcCormick,</p>
<p>first off the no sound icon and no speaker/headphone icons available in the device manager are for the same reason. Your system is not aware of any sound drivers (or at least the incorrect ones) installed. Sounds like you updated your sound card...are both
 sound cards still installed? Or is the first sound card on-board?</p>
<p>If so, you need to go into your BIOS and disable the old sound card.</p>
<p>That will allow your system to look for (and after you re-install the correct drivers) find, and use the correct sound drivers.
</p>
<p>Also per your mention that you would hate to have to re-install Windows and lose all your files...if you don't have your system backed up and continue to set restore points at least every other week, you WILL be very sorry at some point of your computer
 experience!!!!</p>
<p>Anyhow, I would try that before doing a system restore, or complete reinstall.</p>
<p>Happy computing,</p>
<p>Eddie b</p>

            Hey Eddie,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for responding. I read that it might have been that somewhere else a while back. I uninstalled everything from my soundcard, pulled it out, and set audio the Onboard in BIOs. I didn't have any change. I'm actually planning on upgrading sometime
 in the near future, the fact that this is a 7 year old computer doesn't really help assure me that this is a fixable problem.</div>
<div>And I do back up anything important and set restore points, I don't know why I simply said reinstall Windows, I meant having to completely wipe the computer and starting over. Although I don't have too much right now so if I can find my CDs and the code
 for them I'll do that probably. (I actually found CDs for Windows XP SP2 but its home edition and this one has Professional I believe so they other CD is for my old laptop most likely)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway thanks again for an answer :P</div>
<div>I was kind of worried everyone had given up. Its like nothing I've ever had happen or heard of before.&nbsp;</div>

            Well here's what I just posted on another site:
<div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Okay I'm going to clarify what's happening now that somethings have been narrowed down.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>So my problem is that Windows is telling me I have no audio device. Earlier it had been using my dad's modem drivers to somehow emulate sound (I believe it said "Motorola Modem (Emulated)" under the audio device, and it was the only one there.
</i><b>[I did not choose to use this, but being the only option the computer automatically used it. I do know modems are not the same as sound cards, but for whatever reason my computer was using it like one, and it did produce some sounds out of my speakers,
 even with my speakers in the onboard card or the Rocketfish card.]</b><i>&nbsp;I uninstalled the Motorola drivers. Now, neither my on-board nor my Rocketfish sound card are listed as an audio device (even after uninstalling the Motorola)
</i><b>[This sounds like they were there before, but they were not. The cards never showed up, the only option was the Motorola Modem]&nbsp;</b><i>. I currently am using my Rocketfish. The computer detected and installed it. I used the CD to update its drivers.
 Under BIOS I have turned off on-board audio. I uninstalled the drivers for the on-board audio. In services, Windows Audio is set to automatic start up and is already running just fine.</i></div>
<div><i>Following samadchaz's advice I uninstalled the Microsoft UAA Bus Driver. </i>
<b>[for your information this was conflicting with Realtek]&nbsp;</b><i>After that I get the little internal beeps with some errors that I didn't get it with before (It happened if I pushed too many keys, but now it does it for some of the error windows). I also
 looked into the DirectX Diagnostic Tool samadchaz suggested. Everthing appeared to be fine.
</i><b>[not true anymore, check the link below to see a screenshot of the window and what it says]</b></div>
<div><i>I just uninstalled the Nvidia HD Audio drivers, still nothing.</i></div>
<div><i>I've tried different speakers and even headphones.&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>Basically right now the problem is my sound card shows up in hardware in the sounds and audio devices window and in the device manager, but it isn't appearing in the list for Audio Devices in the Sounds and Audio Devices window.
</i><b>[as I stated, I've tried a lot of the common solutions. Changing BIOS settings, updating drivers, checking the Microsoft Audio service, etc.]</b></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>

<h2>            Cannot pin to items in task bar</h2>
                    I have lost the ability to pin to some of&nbsp;the&nbsp;items already existing on my task bar. I had been able to, but after starting the machine the other day, I lost the things that were pinned to windows explorer and it will not let me re-pin anything. I have
 excel on the task bar and it still allows me to pin to that. I have not removed arrows from my shortcuts, I have not made any software or hardware changes.

<p>Ronnie, Thank you, that fixed the explorer problem. I also need to add jump lists to another file on my task bar that stopped worjking. It is Solid Edge, which is a 3d CAD program I use here at work. Does one of those files pertain to that? And how can I
 tell which of these files goes to which file on my task bar.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated,</p>
<p>Erik</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi Erik</p>
<p>Glad that worked for the Explorer problem.</p>
<p>From the previous list you posted, I identified 4 of the 6 files.</p>
<p><span><span><span>cdf30b95c55fd785.automaticDestinations-ms = Excel</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1b4dd67f29cb1962.automaticDestinations-ms = Windows Explorer</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7e4dca80246863e3.automaticDestinations-ms = Media Player (Frequent,&nbsp;and Pinned)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>74d7f43c1561fc1e.automaticDestinations-ms<span>&nbsp;</span>= Media Player (Tasks)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>89b0d939f117f75c.automaticDestinations-ms =??</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4522c4f167ed96b7.automaticDestinations-ms =??</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
These last 2 I have not seen before, so one of these&nbsp;should be the file that&nbsp;contains the data for the Solid Edge program. Determining which file is a 2 step process.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong><br />
Step 1. Identify</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open windows explorer to the automaticDestinations folder.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
b. Open an instance of Notepad, Drag one of these unknown files and drop it in the open Notepad window. This will show the contents of that file.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
c. Most of the text in the file will be raw code and not readable. Scan the file carefully and you&nbsp;should see paths to files that have been opened with the program that the file is associated with. Once you have determined the program, close the Notepad window.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong><br />
Step 2 Confirm</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. To confirm that this is the correct file for that program,&nbsp;drag that file out of the AutomaticDestinations
 folder to another folder, temporarily. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
b. After the file is moved, right click the pinned taskbar icon for that program and you should see that the JumpList has completely disappeared, except for the default items at the bottom of the right click menu (program name and unpin option).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
c. Go back to the folder where you moved the file and delete it.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
You should now be able to rebuild the JumpList for that pinned program using the previous steps.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />
Let us know if this works for you. Please post back and let us know which programs those 2 unknown files are associated with so that we can add that info to our database.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><br />

<h2>            Trying to use TV App while Xbox One is connected to HD PVR 2 Gaming Edition</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an issue with attepting to watch live TV on my Xbox One while it's connected to my HD PVR 2 Gaming Edition. I've attempted to contact Hauppage Support, but that did not solve anything. If it helps my setup is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox One Console </li><li>Kinect </li><li>DirecTV Cable Box </li><li>HD PVR 2 Gaming Edition </li><li>If it makes any difference I do use the HDMI cord that came with my Xbox to make a connection between the console and my capture card
</li></ul>
<p>Now, I have search several places and forums on the internet and the only problem I could find is that it maybe HDCP. I considered this a strong possibility because I remember on the Xbox360 I could not watch Netflix if my HD PVR was plugged in or I would
 get a direct connection error. I do remember sometime last year when I was using someone else's Xbox One the TV App did indeed work while my PVR was plugged in, so I'm assuming this issue was created by some update Microsoft released. Now there are two reasons
 that I doubt the HDCP theory, the first reason is if that was the case how could the Xbox One use built-in HDMI-Passthrough without running into any issues, because regardless of recording settings, it is still a passthrough that could be used for copyright.
 The second reason is, just a few minutes ago, I attempted to run and record footage through Netflix, Blu-Ray App, and Media Player App, and they all open and worked perfectly, and the recording worked. But if I try to open the TV app while it's plugged in,
 I get a black screen and eventually it says it has lost connection from my cable box. Maybe Xbox changed the HDCP settings to only affect the TV App but in all honesty I doubt that. The only reason I want this possible is because I do a lot of recording, live
 streams, and video edits and the footage I get from my PVR. It becomes a hassle to have the switch the HDMI cords around everytime I want to do one or the other. The whole point of the console having a built-in HDMI-Passthrough is to make things run more smoothly,
 and become easier, but for people like me, it's made it worse. It's better for us to just keep it connected to a completely seperate HDMI port. That's all I've got right now, if anyone has any ideas or advice for this issue, please share.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue; I know I'm necro'ing but why ask the same question twice. &nbsp;The one difference between his setup and mine is that I don't have a Kinect and my Xbox is first hooked up to an HDMI selector (along with my 360 and Wii u) then hooked
 up to my PVR. I've noticed that since I've purchased the PVR I haven't been able to play Blu-rays and most DVD's through my Xbox, now that I've found out that I can't use my cable box through the Xbox I'm in the same dilemma. &nbsp;I'm used to not even using the
 TV pass through because I don't have a Kinect but if the HDCP problem (which I'm assuming it is) could be alleviated then my whole setup would work but for now it doesn't. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How to apply nvidia color profile in windows 8 &#63;</h2>
                    So i use a nvidia driver custom color profile, problem is after i restart Windows 8, the nvidia colors reset to default, and don't work anymore in 3D fullscreen games. How i could make windows to always use nvidia colors ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: So the problem is how i make windows 8 to accept custom nvidia driver color settings, everytime i restart windows 8 ? Because as i told the colors reset after a reboot/restart.<br />

Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />

If you want to reduce the number of unnecessary files on your hard disk&nbsp;to free up disk space and help your computer run faster, use Disk Cleanup. It removes temporary files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that
 you no longer need.<br />
<br />
There is more information on how to start Disk Clean and how it work, please visit this link for a short demo and instructions:<br />

<h2>            Error &#58; &#34;Unable to reach Windows Activation Servers&#34; after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Windows 10 activation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I upgraded to windows 10 recently. I was then having some issues and did a "remove everything" reset on my pc. It worked just fine, except when I go to "activation" it says "unable to reach windows activation servers". I moved recently and will not have
 an opportunity to get internet until next month. How do I activate if I cannot access the Internet? What happens if I don't activate by July 29? I will be using this laptop offline for artwork/photoshop and other programs that do not require Internet. Will
 this be an issue if I do not activate? Please help!</p>

<p>Hi Twinkle.,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>1.</strong> I would recommend you to run iTunes as administrator.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Perform the following steps on all the iTune related shortcuts.<br />
1. Right click on Itunes icon, then click Properties.<br />
2. Browse to the Compatibility tab and under the Privilege level place a check mark on "Run this program as an administrator".<br />
The above procedure have resolved both the issues, popup and Live Messenger.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.</strong> The thread below shows that both the issues are resolved by running this program as administrator.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>3.</strong> For additional help you can also consider visiting Apple iTunes support for Windows.<br />

<br />
<strong>4.</strong> I would also recommend you to download and install the latest version of iTunes on&nbsp; your computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            How to sharing between Win7 &#38; new Win10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i have 3 PC on my home network. 1 week ago i upgraded one of them from Win10 Pro (old version) to Win10 Pro (1803).</p>
<p>PC1 - Win7 Pro</p>
<p>PC2 - Win10 Pro (old)</p>
<p>PC3 - Win10 Pro 1803</p>
<p>Before i did upgrade, these 3 PCs were connected with Home Group and sharing was working. Now i can share every file from PC1 and PC2, but i cannot make connection between PC1-PC3 and PC2-PC3.</p>
<p>In the network explorer i see 3 PCs from every other PC, but i can't open PC3. PC1 and PC2 have Home Group, 1803 have not and i don't know how to connect to my network.</p>
<p>On every PC I added EVERYONE and NETWORK users in the Adv. sharing, with full access. I have Disabled Firewall to Private network and switch Win10 1803 to private. All PCs have equal workgroup name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i missing? </p>

            Hi reg.reg, version 1803 removed the Homegroup functionality from Windows 10, without any warning . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have a problem seeing each PC on your WiFI network, check this article out on how to resolve that: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/network-computers-not-visible-windows-10-version-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/network-computers-not-...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you get a Network Credentials popup, you should be able to turn off that requirement . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel 
<br />
<br />Go to Network and Sharing Center 
<br />
<br />Select Change advanced sharing settings in the left pane 
<br />
<br />Expand the network you want to disable password protected sharing on by clicking the down arrow on the right of the profile
<br />
<br />Select 'Turn off password protected sharing' and then click Save changes.
