<h2>             The daily Jigjaw Jammer puzzles are not been loading</h2>
                    

<p>For the past few days the daily Jigjaw Jammer puzzles have not been loading. They start the load, but the bar stops about a quarter away from the start&nbsp;and they won't finish loading. I can still load Jigjaw Jammer puzzles from earlier days, prior to the 6th of April, and all other daily puzzles load. Please fix it so that I can complete all the daily puzzles. Thank you.</p>

 </p><p>I did the reset, however in the process I lost all 111 collections, 15 months (all of 2018 and 2017)&nbsp;of achievements in the daily challenges and over 340k in gold bars. To top things off, now the Daily challenges don't load at all. I want a refund for the last two years of paying for the Premium 2x $9.99, since I have lost everything I had done in that time. Too bad I can't get back&nbsp;those hours wasted playing this game.<br /></p>

<h2>            Not able to sign in into Microsoft Account and Cortana in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows Account Windows 10 Issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yesterday evening, I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. &nbsp;The issue I am having is that I am unable to sign into my Microsoft Account from the settings/accounts. &nbsp;When I do, I am met with "Something went wrong" or when trying to get Cortana connected
 "I can't connect at the moment. &nbsp;Make sure you are connected to the internet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have flushed the dns, msreset, restarted computer, made sure the language setting is correct, I have researched this issue and what has helped other people has not helped me. &nbsp;I am trying to not reset the system, or go back to Windows 7 (as I don't know
 if I will be able to get back onto Windows 10 without having to pay). &nbsp;There is nothing wrong with my internet connection, I am using it on the very computer that I am having the issues with signing into be able to use the Microsoft Account (I want to use
 the features, weather, Cortana, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Crystal,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused to you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to know if you are logged in into your user profile using Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will be able to access Cortana, Windows Store, Calendar and other features only if you are logged in into your user account with Microsoft account credentials.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Login into your user profile using Microsoft account credentials and check if you are able to login into Cortana and other Windows features.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persist run the </span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/microsoftaccounts.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Microsoft account troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>
 and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persist, I suggest you to
</span>scan on your PC to determine the presence of corrupted files or folders on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            What to do when my PC Crashed with BOD and is asking for previous version of Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <span>First of all thank you all for all the help.</span>
                    <span>First of all thank you all for all the help.</span>
<div>I already posted this question in reply to my previous thread but I am not sure if anybody saw that since is a reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
And now the sad news.</div>
<div>
I am currently typing this from my wife's laptop because my PC completely crashed.</div>
<div>
After being able to finally load those SPs and all my drivers and other software it seemed like it was working.</div>
<div>
I was still trying to avoid automatic update because everything seemed ok.</div>
<div>
Every time I got more software installed to my pc I did set up new restore point.</div>
<div>
Actually twice because the third time i typed Restore3 and pressed ENTER to create new restore point I got Blue Screen of Death right away which I'we heard about before.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
So I tried re-installing the Windows again but for the first time I'm not even able to do that.</div>
<div>
It said: Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt &nbsp; \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Then it said to press r at the first screen to attempt to fix it which I did.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
With my original XP cd in, it took me to Windows set up where I was facing another (new) problem.</div>
<div>
It said: Setup cannot find a previous version of windows installed on your computer.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
It asked me to insert my original cd with NT, 95 or 98 on it.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Ok - I upgraded many years ago from 98 and I still have that 98 Startup 3 1/2 flopy but after technology moving so fast and upgrades to my desktop Flopy drive seemed as waist of space.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
What are my options to fix this?</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Could my HD be fried?</div>
<div>
Couldit be Virus or some hackers project?</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I have 2HDs one C: 40giga.old Western digital which I had my Windows on and second D: 120 giga which was more for backup and storage.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
After having all those problems I always formated C: and re-installed Windows but never really messed with my D: drive.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Could there be something on D: that even after having fresh Windows would keep jumping on C:?</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Also why is it asking me to insert 98 now and not newer before when I &nbsp;formated C: and re-installed windows.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Once again thank you for all your help.</div>

    <title>Blue Screen after recent update&#58; system thread exception not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luis albertogonz&#225;lez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen after recent update&#58; system thread exception not handled</h2>
                    <p>My computer is producing a blue screen after a recent update and I cannot find a way to fix it. It was after the latest update on March 1, 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what I see, two upgrades have been offered, KB3140743 and KB3139907. I cannot tell if both were offered the same date, nor if both were installed at the same time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after a download in the background as usual, and when I selected "Update and Restart" on March 2nd, this problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried many things but nothing worked. I restored the system to February 28, 2016. Then 2 days later it happened again, today. I just downloaded the Show or Hide Updates tool from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930 - And hide these 2 updates.
 Now am writing here to see how can I get this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before restoring the system, I tried safe mode, automatic repair, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the description of the error screen I am getting:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-system-thread-exception-not-handled/f93e8287-c260-4f16-9291-eeb1560bb8db</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the post above, I created a recovery media but then found the Hide tool and temporarily hide the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worth mentioning that there were also a Skype update recently. I just rejected the update that was already installed when, after the system restore, it was offered again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it needs to be fixed or I would be missing some important updates both in W10 and Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also following this post: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d
</p>
<p>I collected the dmp file, the system file and system info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help in coming back to the good update experience that has been W10 so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Luis</p>
<p>

            <p>Appreciate your help because this doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as instructed, and the error blue screen came back, with the same error description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that, when I tried to restore the system to a previous point, the one that used to work had disappeared. Tried the two restore points offered but none of them worked. Always back to the blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to boot from the USB I had created a couple days ago, but it generate a blue screen again (I selected boot from USB from the Windows Advanced Options menu, not from the system setup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I followed the steps recommended in this thread: </p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-system-thread-exception-not-handled/f93e8287-c260-4f16-9291-eeb1560bb8db</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the only difference that I boot from the HD, not the USB drive. I selected 5 to boot in Safe Mode with networking. Apparently that rolled back the system to the previous point to where it was working, because after that the system started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I launched the Device manager and checked that there were only one Display Adapter, Intel HD Graphics 4600. I rolled back the driver (or at least that;s what I tried -right-click on the driver - Properties - Driver tab - Roll Back Driver - Yes). There
 were no confirmation messsage, but now the driver version shows 10.18.15.4256 from 7/17/2015, which seems to be a previous version of this driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a restoring point so I am sure I can roll the system back if it fails again.</p>
<p>
So now the PC is working but I'm afraid that a- the display adapter may be obsolete, or would be updated automatically and then generate the same error again; and b, since I hide the most recent 2 Windows updates, that also caused problems with my system.<br />
</p><p>Hope you can help me getting past this issue</p>
<p>

            I had the same problem. The blue screen loop started at 4 AM on march 1st after KB3140743 was installed. I was able to restart from a restore point in mid February. I tried many different changes, graphics drivers etc, and created restore points along
 the way. The only one that left my computer bootable after update KB3140743&nbsp;was installed was removing my Kaspersky anti virus. (Kaspersky Internet Security) for windows 10. After the update was installed, I tried reinstalling KIS and the blue screen came
 back. Waiting for someone to post a resolution that includes me keeping my antivirus software that is paid up for a year.

<p>Posting this in case it helps other users:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Restored Windows to a previous status (from Advance Options when the system restarts and fails to auto-repair)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I created a W10 bootable USB drive: </p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 </p>
<p>(Scroll on instructions and tool of how to create one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;Excluded the video card driver from updating - First found the Display driver in the Device Manager (In Control Panel or Settings). Then followed this URL to exclude its update:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Re-started&nbsp;the system from the USB: Followed the instructions here until I get it -</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-system-thread-exception-not-handled/f93e8287-c260-4f16-9291-eeb1560bb8db</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Since I just found one display adapter, I re-started and chosen Repair your Computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That fixed the issue and now I can boot from the HD. However, the update of the Graphic adapter driver is hidden, and I don't know how to update it -assuming it is good to have the latest drivers, especially in a computer less than 1 year old.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>You can set the Windows Explorer shortcut that you use to open with the focus on the C: drive and expanded.</p>
<p>Right click the Windows Explore shortcut and select Properties / Shortcut Tab.</p>
<p>In the Target line, enter the following path.</p>
<p>%windir%\explorer.exe e, c:</p>

<h3> umair mujahid  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I go to System Properties, the Product Key mentioned is totally different from the COA Sticker&#33; Is it normal&#63;</h2>
                    <p><i>About Genuine Windows 7 on Sony VAIO!</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hello everyone. I have recently purchased Sony VAIO VPCEG35EG/B, on which Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit is pre installed. Now, when I look at the back of the Laptop, there is a Certificate of Authenticity Sticker. On this Sticker the product key is given which
 does not contain any numerical figures. It's just alphabets, or some numbers, I don't remember now.</p>
<p>Now the point is: when I start my Laptop, it shows "preparing your computer for first use" message after "starting windows" screen and usuall windows logo. When I go to System Properties, the Product Key mentioned is totally different from the COA Sticker!
 It contains numbers, and between numbers, the letters OEM, something like this: 5685-OEM-6589-5555...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it normal? What is OEM? Why there is a difference between product key on the Sticker and product key shown on the System Properties window?</p>
<p>I am very anxious. Please someone explain it!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad English.</p>

<br />
<br />
The System Properties window does not show your product key - it shows your Product ID. They are two different things, and this is normal.<br />
<br />
Your product key is on the case of your laptop, it's a 25 character alphanumeric code.<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Click Start <br />
2. Right click on Computer<br />
3. Click Properties<br />
4. Your PID will be shown at the bottom of the window.<br />

<p>What is OEM? <br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer, when Windows comes preinstalled on a computer it is OEM.
<br />
OEM Product IDs contain “OEM” in them.<br />
<br />
Difference Between a Full/﻿Upgrade/Retail License and an OEM/System Builder License.
<br />
1) Are bound to the first computer installed on and can't be moved to a different computer.
<br />
2) Can not do an in place upgrade from older versions of Windows, only a clean/fresh install is possible.
<br />
3) Offer no free support from Microsoft. <br />

            <p>The sticker on the back of your computer should contain both the product key and the product kid.
</p>
<p>The Product ID on the sticker is quite different from what you see in the Windows 7 System Properties.
</p>
<p>The Product ID and Product Key is are two different things:</p>
<p>The prouduct key is a sequence of letters and numbers. </p>
<p>The product ID which is the following: 5685-OEM-6589-5555</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pairs your license which your computer. </p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system

<h2>            Dungeon Siege not saving on Windows Vista</h2>
                    Dungeon Siege loaded and plays fine, I saved and quit after about two hours of play.&nbsp; When I went back in to play it said it had no saved games.&nbsp; This also happened with the game Spore.&nbsp; They play fine, but why won't the games save?

            Try to right-click on game shortcut and select "Run as administrator". Try to save the game. Exit the game and run it again. Try to load your saves. If everything works OK now, then it's clear that it's problem with permissions to game saves folder.

<h3> edacheeky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad not working at all</h2>
                    <p>The touchpad of my laptop is not working at all. I've tried heaps of the solutions on the internet and none have worked.</p>
<p>Under mouse properties (additional mouse options) there is no Elan or Synaptics luxpad tab and under the hardware tab there is nothing:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53d65c41-5e3a-45eb-af06-978c1baa9d5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53d65c41-5e3a-45eb-af06-978c1baa9d5f" /></a></p>
<p>I've tried downloading both drivers and restarted my computer many times and nothing has changed. I've attempted all of the solutions I've found on the internet and none of them have worked.</p>
<p>Also, in the device manager and under the mice and other pointing devices, the only drivers shown are Hid-compliant mouse (see image below), whereas, the solutions on the internet that I've seen say that there should be an elan driver there. Anyway, I've
 tried updating driver software listed there and it said that it was already updated.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87888e02-8ae0-435c-82af-6fb2b2da272d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87888e02-8ae0-435c-82af-6fb2b2da272d" /></a></p>
<p>I've tried the troubleshooter and it said I needed to restart my computer and I did, but it didn't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop model is Spectre x2 a002tu, windows 10.</p>
<p>I didn't drop my laptop or change any settings. The touchpad was working perfectly fine yesterday, its just today that it hasn't been responding at all.</p>
<p>How can I solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<p>I've done all of the things above and nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed it that the HID-compliant mouse does not appear in the device manager anymore although I've reinstalled it.

<p>However, in my post I mentioned that there is no ELAN tab in my additional mouse options, and it remains that way: (The ELAN tab should be after the 'Hardware' tab but there is nothing there)</p>

<p>When I went to download the ELAN driver, nothing changed. It downloaded successfully&nbsp;but did not appear in the additional mouse options.</p>
<p>Are there any other things I can try out before I go to my laptop fixed?</p>

<p>Hi
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact error message you are getting when you play Internet Spades?
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Was it working earlier?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>Note: System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been
 overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder.
 You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<b>sfc /scannow</b>, the <b>sfc /scanonce</b>, or the <b>sfc /scanboot</b> commands to repair its contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: Disable and enable Games in Windows Features and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <b>Start</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>Turn Windows features on or off</b> and open it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Family safety- keyboard issues</h2>
                    I have set up Family safety but my child is very frustrated with the keyboard response. I checked it myself and each key must be held down for a very long time!&nbsp; I have no idea how to fix this quirk.&nbsp; please advise.

    <title>Windows hangs when using HostedNetwork with Atheros WiFi cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agizis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows hangs when using HostedNetwork with Atheros WiFi cards</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using Windows 7 HostedNetwork and everything works great if I have a non-Atheros WiFi card.</p>
<p>With Atheros, while it sometimes works, more often it does one of the following:</p>
<p>1) Causes the network notification tray program to stop responding for as long as 2 minutes.</p>
<p>2) Once run, Windows cannot shutdown, and shows the "Shutting Down" screen forever.</p>
<p>3) Other programs that use the network (Pidgin and Skype in particular) will hang, and cannot even be killed by an Administrator.</p>
<p>This is easily reproduceable, and has been seen on multiple machines.</p>
<p>I've tried contacting Atheros many times for the last 6 months, but have gotten no helpful response. &nbsp;This is a required feature for a driver to receive the Windows 7 certification, so I was hoping that perhaps someone at Microsoft might be able to help
 in some way.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was using the latest 8.0 version of the driver from Windows update, and have tried every older version. &nbsp;Thank you, I was unaware of the 9.1 on that station-drivers.com web site, but sadly it appears to behave the same.</p>
<p>This is probably excessive, but here's a test program (c#). &nbsp;If you run it on a computer with an atheros card, things will start going terribly wrong after a couple iterations. &nbsp;The notification tray icon will stop responding after about a minute, after
 two minutes, it will report that HostedNetwork failed to start or stop, and then you will be unable to shut down your computer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint on hosted networks is that I have to restart it frequently, because the client lose their internet connection.</p>

<p>Yes, I've had it running on an Intel 5100 AGN card here for 20 minutes with no issues at all, and I've tried it with a couple other brands in the past as well.</p>
<p>As far as reliability goes, we ended out needing to rewrite ICS with our own NAT/DHCP/DNS server in Connectify to get things reliable.</p>

<p>Ah, so connectify doesn't use the built-in ics. I thought is was nothing more than using the built in capabilities. I guess this kind of stuff will resolve itself with ipv6.</p>

Is there any further documentation about ics not being reliable?

<p>That sounds great. &nbsp;I'm going to just assume that it works, and will crash my computer if I run it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's to hoping that it doesn't take long for Atheros to "close the loop" and get out code that passes the tests.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>win 10 upgrade on a laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mervynnunley  say:</h3>
<h2>            win 10 upgrade on a laptop</h2>
                    A friend who has a hp Compaq 6910p laptop asked me to upgrade from win 7 to win 10.I used the upgrade window and found the laptop was ok for the upgrade and started the upgrade.Everything seemed ok until it reached the getting updates and checking for
 updates.After many hours( bearing in mind that the screen said this will take a few minutes)it came up with the accept/decline window I accepted and the what to keep window followed again by the getting updates window.It has been stuck on this for at least
 3 hrs.The disc access light is flashing now and then so I assume things are still moving on but who knows.The installation supposed to take about 90 mins.Because it is a laptop with wireless connection I expected it would take longer but this is stupid.Is
 it not possible to complete the installation and then collect updates.Just as well it is a laptop so I can run it on battery now ang again

<h2>            Change shortcut to open Windows Media Center</h2>
                    I am frequently bothered by Windows Media Center that unexpectedly opens up when I mistype a shortcut (Windows Key + Alt + Enter, I believe. ). I'd like to delete this shortcut or change it to another combination of keys that I would never use, to prevent
 the program from unexpectedly opening. How can I do it if possible? Thanks in advance.

    <title>Driver for Apple Magic Trackpad with Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Driver for Apple Magic Trackpad with Win7</h2>
                    I have an Apple Magic Trackpad and connected it my Dell Latitude Laptop running Win7 64-bit OS. Only the basic function of moving the mouse on the screen works and none of the better features work.. Is there another driver that I need to install for those
 additional features to work?

            <p>You would have to ask the article writer to be sure what they meant - but my impression is that there are people who may want to utilize this hardware device on a plain PC - nothing to do with Apple in any way other than, say, this device.&nbsp; For example,
 they have a Dell Precision Workstation running Windows 7 Ultimate Edition x64 and they have purchased the "<a href="http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apple Magic Trackpad</a>" and desire to connect it to their
 Dell Precision Workstation running Windows 7 Ultimate Edition x64 when there is not a single Apple computer in-sight.</p>
<p>Now - you could also infer that instead of worrying over all the bootcamp specific stuff, you just utilize your Windows 7 installation with the steps given (ignoring the fact this is a BootCamp thing on your Macintosh) and get the device installed in Windows
 7 - treating Windows 7 like the other operating system it truly is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, in the end, it is like any other hardware device.&nbsp; If the hardware manufacturer supports the devices use on a given operating system and provides the proper drivers and software to do so - you are golden (you can do it.)&nbsp; If the hardware manufacturer
 does not support the devices on a given operating system and thus does not provide the proper drivers and software to do so - you are out of luck (likely cannot do it - unless some enterprising individual/company makes it happen for you.)</p>
<p>As for Bootcamp, it's a different word for&nbsp;multi-booting even if also virtualize and run your Windows 7 inside OS X as well as actually booting to your Windows 7 partition.&nbsp; What this means is that for all intents and purposes - when you boot to Windows
 7 on your Apple computer, treat it like you would a non-Apple PC with Windows 7 installed - because that *is* what it is.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

    <title>Control Panel&#47;Desktop Gadgets Error Return - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric_bernstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Control Panel&#47;Desktop Gadgets Error Return</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the resolution to my problem might be an easy one, but then again, one never knows.&nbsp; This computer is running Microsoft Windows 7 Professional on a Home Network with only one additional computer running the same OS.&nbsp; The computers, printers etc.
 are connected to the Router and plugged into the Router is a Motorola Cable Modem allowing to connect to the world and to access Comcast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically when I had a registry "something" I used to run Poledit, however, Poledit does not appear to be on the system and I forgot the name of any other Registry Editing Tool.&nbsp; The problem is when I open Control Panel and Double Click on Desktop Gadgets,
 the following dialog appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop Gadgets</p>
<p>Desktop gadgets are managed by your system administrator. </p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then the option to also click on "Why can't I change these settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before asking you folks this question, I did attempt to research the problem and I found the following article.&nbsp; The URL is quite long so I used TinyURL.com to compress the URL:</p>
<p><strong>http://tinyurl.com/mg2g42c</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions, however, the Gadget entry already had the box checked so I unchecked the box, rebooted when prompted, entered to verify the box had no check mark and then the .msc was no longer an icon within Control Panel.&nbsp; I then placed the
 check mark back into the Gadget box and the same error appears. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to enable the Gadgets?&nbsp; I used to have them and I used them.&nbsp; The account permissions are set to Administrator, but I don't get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance is appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eric</p>

<h3> u know  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Blue Screen BSOD for 0x00000133 igdkmd64.sys and ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 but both my ThinkPads were running extremely slowly so I did a clean install on both today and both the ThinkPad Helix and ThinkPad Yoga 2 are getting constant BSOD's. Both are giving error 0x00000133 and both
 are either caused by igdkmd64.sys or ntoskrnl.exe. I have tried installing the latest Intel HD graphics drivers from the Lenovo Support site and the Intel Support site but to no avail as the problems still continue. Does anyone have a solution for this yet?

    <title>Call of Duty World at War prestige achievements unintentionally gained - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> intoxicated rob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call of Duty World at War prestige achievements unintentionally gained from Nazie Zombie game&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so I would first like to point out that the game I am questioning myself and other people about is call of duty world at war. Once I was on the game I choose to play Nazi Zombies. People often get into modified lobbies without them knowing; which this
 is exactly what happened to me, which resulted in the host or the person who’s hosting the modified content giving everybody the highest rank in the game which unlocked two achievements. I do not want these achievements unlocked. They were unlocked without
 my knowledge and therefore I should not be penalized such as receiving a Gamerscore reset, or an achievement reset from Xbox. As soon as I got into the game the host automatically unlocked the two achievements for everybody in the lobby therefore I had little
 to no time at all to exit the lobby so I would not get the two achievements. First off I was not aware that the host was cheating or using software to alter the game which violates the terms of use. It is not my fault what so ever that these achievements have
 been unlocked on my account. If anyone disagrees then they’re basically saying that I cannot play the game without the chance of getting my account’s gamerscore reset. I should be able to play a game without people modifying or altering the game in which satisfies
 them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two achievements are “It’s all about prestige” followed by “Go get some sun.” I highly doubt that this can be done, but if it is possible, is there anyways these achievements could be removed from my account? I certainly do not want achievements
 on my account that clearly shows they have been unlocked through other means violating the terms of use [unintentionally of course].&nbsp; I hope somebody with the right mind may be of some helping state to me. Please and thank you.</p>

<p>Hello there bud!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, I suggest you <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/file-player-complaint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
File a Complaint</a> against the user(s) and also <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/mute-block-avoid-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mute, Block and Avoid</a> them! The enforcement team will take it from there. In terms of the game being 'modified' there is no "ban-hammer" from the producers / developers of that game as they only monitor their game until the next one comes owned by them
 (Such as Black Ops + Black Ops 2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am afraid you may be stuck with the achievements and level unlocked, however you will not be penalized as it wasn't you tampering with the system. However, if for example, you go in to a modded lobby on Black Ops 2 and it is blatantly clear that you are
 participating you could then be penalized on the individual game - but if you also tamper with the system, further punishment could occur. (However, that is just an example to clear up any confusion)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've installed QB 2010 on Windows 7 with no issues for clients and I'm afraid I can't guess why you are having such difficulties without being able to see your machine. However, here is something to try:</p>
<p>Do this from a user account which is an administrator. Normally you would be installing this from your daily user account (which is a Standard user, of course) but in this case log into your extra administrator account (see the end of this post for recommended
 user account setup). Create a folder on the desktop and call it something like "QB installer". Now put the CD in the drive but do not run it. Go to My Computer&gt;CD/DVD drive where you will see that it has the QB CD in it. Right-click on it and choose "Open".
 Now copy everything you see (the contents of the QB CD) to the folder you made. Now you can remove the QB CD. Go into the folder you made and find setup.exe. You may need to enable the ability to view file extensions (Control Panel&gt;Folder Options&gt;View tab).
 Double-click setup.exe and hopefully QB will install properly. After QB is installed you can delete the folder you made. Log back into your regular Standard account and start QB.</p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and<span style="font-weight: bold">Win7</span> )</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />

You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>
