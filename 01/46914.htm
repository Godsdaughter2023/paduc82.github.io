    <title>Microsoft Edge &#43; IE 11 Hebrew issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neta amit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge &#43; IE 11 Hebrew issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Browse to (as an example)&nbsp;http://www.netcar.co.il/guide/guidef.asp?model=1054&amp; from Firefox, Chrome, IE11 and Edge. Firefox and Chrome display proper Hebrew, where as Edge and IE11 display Hebrew letters but left-to-right letters within a word and left-to-right
 words within a sentence.</p>
<p>Playing with Encoding and with RTL/LTR document did not change this behavior.</p>
<p>I realize that many sites in Hebrew are displayed properly, but some aren't, which might be a server-side issue. Still,&nbsp;Firefox and Chrome can handle the situation but Edge and IE 11 cannot.</p>
<p>Is there a fix?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Jetpack Joyride requires Directx 10 card to work after the update..The sad part is it is no where mentioned in the requirements part in windows store for most applications.<br />
<br />
To prove this we have a workaround.. Go to Device manager and right click on your graphics card and select disable. The game will start working in Software accelerated mode...

<h3> da fonz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 0x80070005 - access denied message occurs when I use a DVD - RW disk I personally formatted in order to re-use it for my file back-ups.  Please read my details before answering my question.</h2>
                    <p>Error code 0x80070005 - access denied message occurs&nbsp;when I use a DVD - RW disk I personally formatted in order to&nbsp;re-use it for my file back-ups.&nbsp; The disc was used for a prior back-up 6 months ago so I believed I could empty it and use it again for a new
 back-up to save from having to use a brand new disk every other second or third back-up.&nbsp; Thats how many times I can use a fresh, blank disk before being prompted to insert a new blank one and have to re-label it with a new back-up date.</p>
<p>This is on Windows Vista and I do&nbsp;have a DVD-RW drive. My back-up schedule is once/month though&nbsp;it was on a weekly schedule. I seemed to be having to use a lot of blank disks for the weekly so I changed to monthly. &nbsp;I formatted some of the older&nbsp;back-up
 disks to erase&nbsp;them&nbsp;and save from having to use brand new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I use one of these re-formatted&nbsp;discs I get an error&nbsp;code message in red that gives this number: 0x80070005&nbsp;and says "access denied".</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Why is this happening?</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; I'm using&nbsp;RW discs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequaint&nbsp;back-ups should merely add&nbsp;new files a disk used on a prior back-up right?&nbsp; I know that one back-up doesn't fill a disk because when I was on the weekly schedule<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;the same disk could be&nbsp;used two or three
 times before being prompted for a brand new disk.&nbsp; Two or three times after that I'd be prompted to insert a new disc and so on and so on.&nbsp; I began making a collection of back-ups so I believed I could erase some of those older back-ups and re-use them for
 new back-ups and save discs.&nbsp; Thats why their called re-writeable right?</p>
<p>But instead I'm getting that error message.</p>

            Those links didn't help because nothing is mentioned in them about the error code I'm getting.&nbsp; the other thing is that the reason I'm not using an external hard drive is because I have a DVD-RW drive and when its time to insert the prior saved back-up
 files disk its already in the drive ready to go so I'm not sitting around all day while back-up is going on.&nbsp; My original questions therefore remain unanswered.

 to that other drive and tried doing a backup.&nbsp; Same error message and code number.&nbsp; I'm getting ready to try to do a Startup Repair.&nbsp; The only thing else I can think of doing is copying and saving my personal files to a Flash Drive (9GB).&nbsp; Than reinstall&nbsp;Windows
 Vista.&nbsp; I'm afraid of doing that because all the&nbsp;updates may be lost that were done&nbsp;Microsoft automatically sent me in the past.&nbsp; I'm thinking since Microsoft no longer supports Vista 2SP I may not get all those updates automatically.</p>
<p><strong><u>Is my thinking correct on that?</u></strong></p>

<p>Other than that I'm gonna check my email for any other help&nbsp;if not - will try the&nbsp;Startup Repair even though it sounds like it has nothing to do with a backup problem.</p>

            <p>I get error message no matter what I have done or thru suggestions whether or not&nbsp;I am using a brand new disc or a reformatted/erased DVD/RW.</p>
<p>I am using the anti virus program called Comodo and uninstalled it.&nbsp; Than I tried another back up and what happened next is the blow-by-blow occurrences:</p>
<p>After uninstalling Comodo antivirus program I went to file back up.&nbsp; I was instructed to install a blank disk which was never used (from store).&nbsp; The screen went to formatting disk option which I said okay to.</p>
<p>After the formatting finished, back up began by itself and it proceeded by creating a "shadow copy".&nbsp;&nbsp;Than my screen said "scanning files to back up".&nbsp;&nbsp;Than, "backing up files/copying to D:\</p>
<p>was seen.</p>
<p>(At this point I'm getting more progress for a back up than ever).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of a sudden&nbsp;I get an error message that the back up did not complete successfully - Access denied 0x80070005.&nbsp; At the same time a Microsoft Security Essentials pop-up screen is there as well which says that it has detected 1 potential threat and has
 suspended it.&nbsp; There is a box for me to click on to remove this threat&nbsp;that says "clean computer" which I do.&nbsp; Another box appears immediately saying the threat was removed.</p>
<p>An&nbsp;error message box is the only thing left which says&nbsp;access denied error code 0x80070005</p>
<p>which is the same one from before.</p>
<p>I closed everything. and went to the tool bar where it said "last back up failed", I clicked on the icon for "details" and clicked on "try again".</p>
<p>The file back up began running a shadow copy, then started scanning files to back up files.&nbsp; Soon after, an error occurred that said, "the following info might help you resolve the error 0x80070005</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another box appeared (same as before) - Microsoft Security Essentials - Click clean computer to remove this threat.&nbsp; I click on "clean computer" as before</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Security Esentials successfully cleaned my computer" message appears (which is the same as before).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Is the version of Windows 10 made available July 29th 2015 recommended for everyday use?
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Windows 10 RTM final release (which&nbsp;will be available starting July 29th 2015)&nbsp;is a complete copy of the software that is designated as ready and fit for use in production environments. To reach RTM, a particular build has to go through a series
 of thorough regression test and optimizations to reach a level of quality satisfactory for production.&nbsp;Unlike pre-release builds of Windows 10&nbsp;the Windows 10 RTM build does not expire.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings).</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. The option to only import the last 5 minutes of the video in Movie Maker is currently not available. However, you may try the workaround below&nbsp;on how you can have the last&nbsp;5 minutes of your video in Movie Maker by using the
 trim option. To do this, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Import the entire video in Movie Maker.</p>
<p>2. On the Movie Maker program window, press these keys on your keyboard ALT + V + T. This will enable the trim option.</p>
<p>3. On your storyboard, move the white slider to the right until hit the last 5 minutes of the project.</p>
<p>4. Click the <strong>Save trim</strong> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on how to use the Trim functionality in Movie Maker, please refer to this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker-trim-video-how-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>solution article.</strong></a></p>

            <p>As Leonard mentioned, there isn't an option to capture just a part of your HDV footage. I'm not sure if it is a technical limitation of HDV and the way it is encoded, but it has been this way since Movie Maker started allowing capture of HDV footage.&nbsp; This
 is in contrast to DV-AVI footage, where Movie Maker <em>does</em> let you capture just a portion of the video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only workarounds I can suggest are:</p>
<p>1) Same as Leonard (capture the whole tape, then trim to the section you need).</p>
<p>2) Look for other HDV capture utilities (perhaps something that came with your HV40) to get just a segment of the tape. Then edit in Movie Maker as usual.</p>
<p>3) Use a component video or HDMI capture device to play back a portion of the tape and re-encode just that section. For example, Hauppauge has a couple of HD PVR devices that are generally used for capturing HD gameplay footage from a console, but could
 also work for capturing HD footage from your Canon. That's actually how I captured from our Canon HV20 when the Firewire port stopped working.</p>

            <p>The actual solution to your problem is this - While the camera is in HDV/DV playback mode with a tape that has been recorded in HDV, the camera is misidentified by windows and will not give you the option to manually control the camera from the desktop.
 Therefore, before connecting the camera, go into settings while in playback mode (on the camera) and select DV LOCKED mode from the menu. You will then be presented with full control over the camcorder via the desktop. However, this is not a solution, just
 a work-around...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Canon HV40</strong></p>
<p>I too am having the same issues with Windows 10 not recognising the Canon HV40 camcorder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera has two playback modes: HDV/DV and DV LOCKED modes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I believe is this: Whilst connected to the IEEE1394 Firewire port...</p>
<p>
</p><p>SD LOCKED mode, computer uses "<strong>msdv.inf</strong>" file and is listed in device manager as an "imaging device".</p>
<p>HDV/DV mode, computer uses "<strong>mstape.inf</strong>" file and is listed as a "sound, video and games controller".<br />
<br />
msdv.inf specifically lists the camcorder by name but has no configuration for the camera while in HDV mode, this code is missing. Therefore, mstape is used instead. which incorrectly places the device in sound video and games controllers, thus making it inaccessible
 for programs such as Windows Movie Maker. And because of this miss-identification, no other video editing software recognises the camera in HDV mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to copy and paste specific references to the Canon Camcorder from msdv.inf to mstape.inf without success, as apparently these are system protected files, even when using notepad in "open as admin" role. So, I am at a loss. If Microsoft
 could provide an updated msdv.inf file which will identify the camcorder whilst it is set to HDV playback mode, that would completely fix the problem. There is no hardware problem or firmware problem with the camera or firewire configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to a response and download link for the amended msdv.inf file with great anticipation.</p>
<p>

            <p>I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Microsoft to provide selectable capture of HDV footage. They didn't figure out how to do it back when Windows Movie Maker 6.0 was created (for Windows Vista) and it hasn't changed since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most consumers have moved on to memory-based camcorders so it is unlikely Microsoft will put any effort into getting HDV camcorders to work differently than they do now. Furthermore, Movie Maker is stuck at version 2012 which tells you the level of support
 you can expect on this product. I'd say that Movie Maker has reached (exceeded) its end-of-life. Continue using it as-is, but don't expect anything new to appear. If a Microsoft representative has different information, I'd love to hear it. But this is my
 assumption with the public information that is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so now you can exhale. :)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. I have only had the displeasure of Windows 10 for just over a week and deliberately installed Movie Maker 6 as I'd already heard about the problems with newer versions and the lack of user controls such as crossfading in the later
 versions. However, I did create a full system ISO of my previous os (which incidentally was Vista and the camcorder was recognised fine in any mode with that os) so if there is no real solution to this, and I mean quickly, it looks like I'll be wiping this
 OS from my system and reverting back to the ISO backup of Vista. It's unfortunate that I got tired of having to go into resources to shut down wuaueng.dll every time I booted up because it was endlessly searching for new updates and not shutting itself off.
 That was the only reason I updated to Win10. I'll just have to disable automatic updates in Vista and put up with the annoying warnings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll give it a day or so for a fix - Otherwise Bye bye windows 10.</p>

    <title>MOV to Motion jpeg - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smokey 7  say:</h3>
<h2>            MOV to Motion jpeg</h2>
                    Hi All, I have been looking for a Free Software program to convert MOV files to Motion jpeg files. My problem is that in November of 2015 I bought a new TV (Emerson 50'') and it has a usb port that is used to watch videos or look at pictures, I have tried
 copying some picture to usb and play them in the tv and it works fine but when I tried some family videos that were taken with 2 different cameras they will not play because it says the file formats are not supported. So I need to convert them to (Motion jpeg
 320x240 30fps.) &lt;-- This is what the TV had at the bottom of the screen telling me what they needed to be. Everything I find on the matter seems to be dealing with converting to be played on various type players on a computer. I know this really isn't a computer
 problem but I do have to use my computer to do the converting. I have Windows 10 Home on a Dell PC Desktop. Any help on a free converter would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi Smokey, the program you are looking for is called VLC media player. It plays back most popular video file and has a convert feature. I've done some research on your TV, I'm guessing that it's this one?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://emersonaudiovideo.com/product/product.php?id=600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://emersonaudiovideo.com/product/product.php?id=600</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, it only supports play back at a resolution of 320x240 pixels using the m-jpeg video codec. It doesn't say anything about what audio codecs are supported so I assume that none are. You'll end up with a low quality video with no audio that will look
 really back on your full definition TV. You are much better off buying a media player and using that for play back of the MOV files directly.</p>
<p>

<p>I am using the Mail app at present to send mail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two programs that would use Outlook (Familytree Maker and QuickBooks) and I cannot send anything because I don't have the BDE64 file on my laptop. &nbsp; Years ago, I did have a Borland product, but have deleted that.&nbsp; This BDE problem has not been 'fixed',
 so I can't use Outlook on these two programs and they don't recognize Mail.</p>

<h2>            Keep getting random &#34;PROCESS HAS LOCKED PAGES&#34; BSOD crashes constantly after last week&#39;s windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, my windows 10 pc keeps getting random crashes with the reason being shown as "PROCESS HAS LOCKED PAGES" after my computer had a windows update on tuesday. Sometimes my PC would randomly in 10 minutes, sometimes it would reset after 3 hours,
 or even 6. It's not really consistent, therefore I'm unable to really tell what I can do or if it gets fixed from any solution as there is no real way to force it to show the error. I've updated my graphics card driver and rolled back the update on my pc but
 nothing seems to do the trick. Is there any advice I could get on how to go about solving this problem? I would truly appreciate any and all help! Thank you.</p>

<h2>            How to &#34;disconnect&#34; a bluetoth device&#63;</h2>
                    Am I right, that on W8 it isn't possible to "disconnect"&nbsp; a bluetooth device?<br />
<br />
I can add or remove my headset from the devices, but I cennot "disconnect/connect" it like it is possible with all other devices, i.e. the phone. Do I realy have to pair my headset with the W8 device everytime? I won't beleave that such a stack like bluetoth
 isn't implemented properly.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions how to "disconnect"?<br />

            <p>Ok, this article opened me another way, how I can disconnect my Headset. I've done this via the sound Settings currently, which worked for the Headset only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But your articke is "Windows 7 related". Since this instruction uses the control center I do not know, if this also works for a WinRT device like a Surface. I'm using a&nbsp;Laptop currently. And at least, I need to connect or disconnect my Headset very often,
 since I use it on the Laptop as well as on the phone, this not very convinient.</p>

            As @<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d9038cbd-e813-474f-a80b-e90718d4c938">Wernfried</a>&nbsp; points out, this article is for Windows 7. On Windows 8/RT, if you go to PC Settings and look at devices, it appears
 that the only way to "disconnect" a Bluetooth device is to <b>remove </b>it&nbsp;altogether. There doesn't seem to be a concept is "disconnect" and "reconnect" as there is on previous versions or most other mobile devices. So if you want to&nbsp;disconnect&nbsp;from your&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;headset,
 it appears you have to completely remove the device, and when you want to reconnect, you have to go through the entire pairing process again. Unless I'm missing something, which I hope I am, this seems to be a fairly big hole in the Bluetooth functionality
 of Windows 8/RT.&nbsp;

            <p>I concur and this is very frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It results in two problems. </p>
<p>- No one else can use the bluetooth speakers if my laptop is on in the room</p>
<p>- My laptop speakers/headphones don't work if I'm in the room since the sound is going via bluetooth to a speaker system that is off or otherwise occupied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both would be solved if I could disconnet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second can be remedied slightly by going to the "Sound" settings and setting my laptop speakers as the default device, but that does not seem to persist. Next time I turn on my laptop, the bluetooth is the default again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very frustrating, especially since Windows 7 has a&nbsp;solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find that and tested it. However, if I disconnect and then&nbsp;turn off my laptop and then turn it on again, it reconnects automatically and becomes the default device. I can do this several times in a row and inevitably it reconnects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What that means is I am often unintentionally tying up the bluetooth receiver connected to the home stereo so my wife or teens can't use it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Windows 7 it stays disconnected, in Windows 8 it does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it remain disconnected for you? Perhaps it is something particular to my machine (a 3 month old HP ultrabook).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I can't answer this directly since I don't yet have a tablet. However you can get to the same place from the start screen by typing "sounds". By default, "sound recorder" shows up but if you select "settings" on the right then you will see the option for "sound".
 Clicking on that will take you to the desktop where you can disconnect or reconnect a Bluetooth device related to sound.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know of a pure Windows 8 way of doing this. The "Devices" under PC settings does not have this option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my laptop, a right click is achieved on the touch pad with a two-finger tap. Perhaps that works on a tablet too?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One S video&#47;graphic problems </h2>
                    
<p><span>&nbsp;bought a shiny new Xbox one s and switched over from my Xbox one last week and I have had some issues. All my games and apps where stored on an external hard drive which I unplugged from Xbox one and then plugged into Xbox one s. That seemed to work
 fine with all my games and apps showing up but when I had to update the system I got an error 0x80004005 on my Xbox one s. Then I noticed that graphics such as friends gamer tags, achievement graphics didn't show up at all. Same problem in movie store with
 movie photos not showing up. I then opened up Amazon video and got an DF0301 error. I then tried bbc iplayer , all4", now tv and none of these apps worked. The only video app that worked is Netflix which works fine in 4 k and you tube. When going into Amazon
 video and iplayer the show graphics didn't show up. Spoke via Twitter with Xbox support and did power recycling, hard reset and this didn't make no difference. I also sent them my detailed network stats which they said looked good. Anyone got any ideas as
 it's pretty frustrating . I did plus in my old Xbox one and it worked perfectly as before with apps, graphics etc working fine.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu Text too dark to read - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpodolski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu Text too dark to read</h2>
                    How can the color of the text in the windows 10 Start Menu be set so that it won't change? The color on the main list starts out white against a dark background, which is OK, but it keeps changing to dark colors that cannot easily be seen. This usually
 happens when I select all apps and begin scrolling down through the list, but it sometimes happens when I first select Start. I've tried changing background and accent colors, and also letting windows automatically choose colors, but it keeps doing this regardless
 of how I set it.

 is white and stays that way regardless of how many times I scroll up/down or open/close the menu. Previously both the text and tile color would&nbsp;get darker&nbsp;depending on what position I was on the list/menu when scrolling. I tried&nbsp;rebooting, choosing different
 accent colors and toggling the&nbsp;transparency of the start menu and task bar. I also updated the graphics drivers as prompted by the&nbsp;Toshiba Support&nbsp;App after upgrading to Windows 10, but it did not fix the problem. Not sure this applies to your situation, but
 it fixed my issues.&nbsp;

<h2>            Sound keeps muting on its own</h2>
                    The sound keeps muting on my Windows 10 (running on 2 month old HP Spectre), and the only way I can get it to return is by restarting. But then it soon happens again -- even though the mute light never comes on on the keypad and the sound shows as being
 turned all the way up. How can I correct this?&nbsp;

<h2>            Foxit Advanced PDF Editor Opens Blank PDF</h2>
                    <p>I ran into a situation where when a PDF was emailed to someone it had to be downloaded to the computer, opened with Adobe Reader and saved as a PDF before Foxit could open the file properly. Originally if you just open the file straight from the email or
 download it then open it with Foxit it will open a page that's entirely blank except for the company header at the top of the page. Anyone have any information on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 8.1 by the way.</p>
<p>Foxit is up-to-date.</p>

            The fact that Foxit seems to be the only reader with this issue indicates that it's probably an issue with Foxit and not the OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; You might want to try asking your question in the

    <title>Gauntlet fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prophetz2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gauntlet fail</h2>
                    
<p>Bought Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows a month ago.&nbsp; No mention of it needing a Hard Drive specifically - until having paid for it of course.&nbsp; Needless to say it didn't work on the Xbox 4gb as it has a "Memory Unit" and not a "hard drive".</p>
<p>Never the less - now spent more money, and have a genuine 250gb Hard drive for my slim Xbox.&nbsp; The gauntlet game I previously downloaded still doesn't work.&nbsp; Being on the Memory Unit, I deleted it and re-downloaded the game the the HD.&nbsp; Same message - "unable
 to load" with a link to www.xbox.com/support.</p>
<p>So..... down the microsoft points, about 4gb in downloads on my internet, good money for a hard drive and still nogo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you consider the deceitful way in which gauntlet is sold, with no mention of simple requirements for the game, and then for it still to fail when those unmentioned requirements are met - I have to ask:&nbsp; Is anyone playing this game?&nbsp; Is anyone having
 this issue?&nbsp; Is there a solution for this issue?</p>
<p>Nothing on Google and Gauntlet doesn't appear to have a forum category either in Arcade games. Help ?</p>

<p>Bought locally for an overpriced $149.00 as this is what one pays for 2 TB hard drives these days. &nbsp;The price one pays for genuine stuff lol. &nbsp;Knock offs on EBAY I'm seeing retail for a third of the price. &nbsp; I deliberately steered clear of the cheapies for
 this reason.</p>
<p>I am seeing now that the only issue could be the lack of a second partition on the new HD to facilitate backward compatibility - although ALL of these instances involve cheap knock offs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Am playing Crimson Alliance now - great game - downloaded and worked straight up.</p>

<p>Is there another HDD you could borrow from a friend to try out? If not, can you get a replacement from the retailer? Does this game play on the new HDD?

<p>Unfortunately I don't have a friend with a HD I could exchange to test. &nbsp;The retailer isn't replacing anything that isn't faulty, as they would probably test it and find no hardware issues. Keeping in mind of the 3 games I have now purchased and downloaded
 - the only one not working is Gauntlet. &nbsp;Crimson Alliance and D&amp;D-Daggerdale both work fine locally and on LIVE.</p>
<p>The 3 instances of No Refunds I noticed when purchasing Gauntlet Seven Sorrows did throw up all kind of red flags for me. &nbsp;Clearly I should have gone with my gut feeling and left the faulty product alone. &nbsp;And really - trying to pass Crimson Alliance off
 as free is laughable - it's a Trial any way you flip it. &nbsp;I would have thought MS was past this kind of marketing technique and if they are going to target "old school" gamers with the old arcaders then at least give the age and intelligence of the target
 audience some credit.</p>

<p>All other pages are OK and it is not a Microsoft account that is giving me a problem just the my.yahoo.com page.&nbsp; Oddly this seems to occur on one of the 3 systems I have upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; One is a HP Pro book, another HP Pavilion, &nbsp;and the other
 a Dell Venue tablet. </p>

 only occurs on one of my three Windows 10 systems and seems to display properly in&nbsp;Firefox,&nbsp;Chrome or IE11 on my main system.&nbsp;

 does not show support for Edge.&nbsp; It seems to me that Yahoo is failing to keep up with what is currently going on.&nbsp;

            That is exactly my problem as well. &nbsp;Instead of opening a small window for the login, it opens a new page. &nbsp;When I put in my login info, it says the page wants to close. &nbsp;Whether I say ok or not, it goes back to the generic my yahoo home page. &nbsp;Crazy.
 &nbsp;Doesn't happen on my wife's computer and I don't see any difference in the settings. &nbsp;Can't believe we are the only two with this issue.

<p>I'm having the same exact symptoms as you.&nbsp; My friend just upgraded to Windows 10 and her Edge browser displays my.yahoo.com just fine.&nbsp; I'm thinking of deleting the Edge app using Powershell and then re-installing it again.&nbsp; Just have to build up the courage!!!</p>

            If you do please let us know if it works.&nbsp; I still believe that it is a Yahoo problem and of course they have no support at all.&nbsp;
<br />
They don't even list Edge as one of the browsers they support.

            I can't help but think there must be a setting someplace that is preventing the small login window to open up. &nbsp;Instead, a new page opens. &nbsp;I just purchased a new HP Laptop with Windows 10, and my.yahoo.com works perfectly with Edge.

            It makes me sad because I originally bought this laptop for someone else and they had to suffer through this miserable networking experience. I didn't believe that their device was faulty. Now it is back in my possession and I wouldn't have kept this for
 a second knowing how bad it is. There is no fix under the sun for this except using only wireless b settings.

<p>Hi <strong>James</strong>,<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing when adding an account is probably due to software conflicts or corrupted system files. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes recently prior to the issue? <br />
</li><li>Were you getting any error messages when trying to set up your email? If yes, kindly send us a screenshot.
</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we recommend that you run the troubleshooter for <strong>Windows</strong> apps to assist us in finding any errors that may be causing the issue. Please visit this

<p>Same problem here!&nbsp; More info as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Windows 10 mail received error about Microsoft Outlook Mail (outlook.live.com) account "Your account settings are out-of-date".</li><li>Let mail fix the problem 3 times and was not able to fix the problem.</li><li>In&nbsp; mail, deleted the account as I only use it for addresses.</li><li>Now get blank/empty box when adding account in calendar, mail (tried first), and people.</li><li>All contacts are missing in mail and people.&nbsp; All events are missing in calendar.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts to add accounts as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calendar - Settings -&gt; Manage accounts -&gt; Add account</li><li>Mail - Settings -&gt; Manage accounts -&gt; Add account</li><li>People - Add account</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to add, that I have now used Windows 10 for about 2 1/2 years and it has so many unfixed bugs in it that I absolutely cannot recommend it to anyone as it is too unstable of an operating system.&nbsp; That is after working in IT/IS for over 28 years
 and using Windows 98, 2000, NT, XP, 7 and 10 and various versions of Unix and Linux.&nbsp; No wonder most corporate IT departments are staying with Windows 7.&nbsp; The word is getting out on how bad Windows 10 is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is&nbsp; digging its own grave by putting out
 an operating system with so many bugs.</p>

            Hi Steven,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason why you’re not able to see your events in calendar and contacts in mail and people is because you haven’t added your account yet due to some software conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, check for the latest <strong>Windows Update</strong> available for your device. We just released a new update last March 5, 2018
<strong>(KB4090913 OS Build 16299.251)</strong> that might fix your concern. Just type
<strong>Check for Updates</strong> in your Cortana search bar then confirm. You can also run our
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Application Troubleshooter</a></strong> to check if there’s some issue from your app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. We’ll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

<p>Hi Aldwin,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the problem affected 3 apps, I cross-posted for each app.&nbsp; I ran a System Restore on a manual restore point that I created shortly before the problem started and then I added the Microsoft Outlook Mail (outlook.live.com) account to the Windows 10
 mail app.&nbsp; I then checked Calendar, Mail, and People and they all look OK now.&nbsp; I will monitor this for the next week or two.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running build 16299.248.&nbsp; I have not installed the latest update from March 5, 2018 (KB4090913 OS Build 16299.251) and I will do that when Microsoft pushes it next Tuesday.&nbsp; A Google search indicates that users have been reporting this same problem
 since 2015 so it has been around for a while and Microsoft has not fixed it yet.&nbsp; &nbsp; I kind of doubt that it will be fixed on the next update.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am somewhat reluctant to run the automated troubleshooter for Windows 10 applications, because the last time that I ran a troubleshooter to diagnose and repair a driver problem, the troubleshooter failed, and instead, my PC had a BSOD and went into "Windows
 10 Automatic Repair couldn’t repair your PC” infinite loop death spiral.&nbsp; I then had to reinstall Windows 10 from a Dell recovery image because System Reset also failed.&nbsp; I then ran Windows Update for 3 days.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that incident, I absolutely cannot recommend Windows 10 to anyone as it has so many unfixed bugs and is too unstable of an operating system.&nbsp; That is after working in IT/IS for over 28 years and using Windows 98, 2000, NT, XP, 7 and 10 and various
 versions of Unix and Linux.&nbsp; For Microsoft to continuously improve its products, I recommend to first fix bugs and then second add features.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>I'm having this or a very similar problem in Windows 10 1803. Mail and Calendar worked fine in 1709, but in 1803 I can't set up an account. It *seems* to set up (box says "success" after entering MS account info which apparently links to outlook.com) but
 it doesn't stick. Every time I reopen Mail or Calendar it asks me to set up an account. The same thing happens with every other email account I have - Yahoo, AT&amp;T, Google - the attempt says "success!" but it never actually happens. So I continue using Thunderbird
 which works with everything *except* my MS Account. Since T-Bird can't sync to outlook.com via my MS Account or my Outlook.com alias, that's hosed, but I did expect that at least I could do it with Windows Mail and Calendar. Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a laptop where this happened, I rolled back to 1709 and it all worked fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No errors related to Mail and Calendar are reported. The account setup appears to be successful, but it isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something *is* going on here. The incorrect behavior is consistent on 2 different computers (1 laptop with i5, 4GB RAM; 1 desktop with Core2 Extreme, 8GB RAM; plenty of disk space for both and no update errors reported). The incorrect behavior vanished (unfortunately,
 along with some printer drivers) when I reverted the laptop to 1709. About ready to do that to the deskop too, then block further updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? Perhaps a way to actually reinstall Mail and Calendar (ps: "reset" doesn't work either, and it *does* throw errors related to lack of access to some directories).</p>

<p>MikeBrady29,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a System Restore.&nbsp; You did a rollback.&nbsp; These both went back to a previous system state.&nbsp; Obviously, there is something broken in Mail and Calendar on Windows 10 as the same problem has been reported on these forums and elsewhere since the fall of
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to fix the bugs in existing Windows 10 and Windows 10 applications before added new bells and whistles and their new bugs.&nbsp; Obviously, it appears that Microsoft is not doing this.&nbsp; More and more customers are getting mad at Microsoft and
 in the long run, this will hurt Microsoft. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After over 30 years with Microsoft my next computer will either be an Apple or Linux box.</p>

<h2>            Cortana won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;I'm running Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows8) on a Lenovo G700 laptop. Like a lot of other people, I'm having trouble with Cortana: specifically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't get Cortana to turn on;</li><li>I keep getting a "Cortana needs to use your location" message but cicking "Allow" does nothing; and</li><li>The microphone icon doesn't appear.</li></ul>
<p>What puzzles me as much as anything is that everything used to work (as well as it can, considering that I have a speech impediment which precludes my using the microphone) but no longer does.</p>
<p>I've done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>checked for pending updates--ther are none;</li><li>Run DISM--no problems there;</li><li>Run sfc /scannow--no problems appeared; and</li><li>Tried creating a new account--same problem, so it's probably not a profile issue.</li></ul>
<p>I've checked several previous submissions (that's where the thing I've already deone came from), but now I'm stuck. Does anyone have any suggestions on other things I could try? (I'd like to get this solved pretty soon, so that I can go back to work on my
 flakey Auto-Hide.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with Cortana. I appreciate the troubleshooting you tried on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>What is the antivirus program on the computer?</p>
<p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>Did you install the audio driver from the manufacturer website?</p>
<p>Did you make any changes to your computer's&nbsp;sound settings prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Cortana doesn't recognize your Microphone, the issue could be because of incompatible sound drivers. I suggest you to download all the updates and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To turn on location settings for Cortana, I suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Start Button and type Location in the search.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open Location Privacy Settings.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under the option "choose apps that can use your location" check if Cortana is turned on.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If not turn on and check if it helps.</span></p>
</li></ol>

            Addendum: I can't turn the overall location setting on (which is probably why my apps have their location use turned off. When I tried going through the "Settings" app, the overall ocation was turned off; After several futile tries, I found that the switch
 had disappeared from the app page. Clicking on the "Quick Action" button in the notification center sidebar didn't work, either. What ca I do about this?<br />

            quark1, I went to Services and found as you predicted, my geolocation service was turned off; however, right-clicking on it returns no result (i.e., nothing happens--no menu). When I click the checkbox to start the service and click "Apply," the checkbox
 clears and does not stay engaged. Evidently, something in my system is blocking the geolocation service, so where do I go from here?<br />

            <p>quark1, I did the right thing this time--the other time, I was going through the Control Panel and used what I found there. Here is what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>The geolocation service was unchecked and disabled.</li><li>I tried several times to enable it (with a right click), but no "Enable" option appeared, and I started getting messages saying "The system could not find the file specified."</li><li>I tried several times to fill the check box, but it didn't stay checked.</li><li>I came back here to reply, but I found that Cortana and the geolocation service were working--I have no idea how I started them.</li></ul>
<p>It appears that the problem has been mysteriously solved. Many, many thanks for your help.</p>
