<h2>            Access Privileges</h2>
                    Whenever I try to open a file on a USB flash drive attached to my Dell Inspiron, I get the message "[Program - Word, Excel, etc.] cannot open the document: user does not have access privileges". This only applies to flash drives - currently, it's a Sandisk
 Ultra USB 3.0, but all similar drives have the same problem. I have several hard drives which I attach via USB and have no problem.&nbsp; I've tried to determine where I can grant myself access privileges but nothing seems to work. Any thoughts?

            <p>Hello CherylStinnett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you need to install framework 2.0 which is required for installing Lexmark printer X4650 on your Windows 8 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 does not include .NET 3.5 (include .NET 2.0 and 3.0) by default. But if the user is upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8, .NET Framework 3.5 is fully enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer the article mentioned below to check if framework is enabled or not on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2785188" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to enable .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8 in Offline Mode</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do let us know if you have any more concern related to Windows. We will be more than happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            svchost.exe high memory use</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is able to assist I will be fantastic. Im running windows 7. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My svchost.exe almost uses all my memory and every hour I will need to open task manager just to close it. &nbsp;If I dont close it my laptop freezes and I need to shut it down with the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did research about this issue most people say it can be a virus but I did numerous virus scan and I dont pick up anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have an idea on how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards&nbsp;<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This type of issue can be tackled two alternative ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Investigate the processes using Process Explorer to determine which application is causing svchost.exe to run.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Download Process Explorer (freeware from Microsoft) and further information:<br />
</span></span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896653</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open Process Explorer and click View on the menu bar. From the drop down menu click Select Columns and then the Process Image tab. Check the boxes before Description, Image
 Path, Image Type, and Command Line. I suggest you also click on two other options on the View dropdown menu, namely Show Processes from All Users and
</span><strong><span>Show Fractional CPU</span></strong><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Place the cursor on the svchost process generating the CPU activity, right click, select Properties and the Service. You can
<strong>Stop</strong> and <strong>Restart</strong> any service from that window by placing the cursor on the service and clicking the appropriate button. You can see what impact it has on CPU usage. Before stopping any service read the summary describing the
 service so that you have a better understanding of the implications of stopping the service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Place the cursor on the svchost process showing the high CPU activity, right click and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab and you will see a list of services that use the process. The image below shows the services for command line C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalService. The
<strong>command line</strong> is displayed as a column in the main Process Explorer window if it has been selected as a View option but if you click the Image tab for the selected process it is also detailed there.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The second more practical way can be to check for malware. Before doing this
</span></span><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like
 any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/confirm/</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please make certain you
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the report on what it found as a shared file to your OneDrive and a post a link here.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and run ADWCleaner and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Before running ADW Cleaner close all open programmes. When ADW Cleaner is run four options are offered. Click
<strong>Scan.</strong> You can review the results by clicking <strong>Log File</strong> or each or any of the Results tabs. To remove all items, click
<strong>Clean</strong> and reboot the computer. On restarting an ADW Cleaner window opens. Select Log File, and click File, Save As to create a report of what has been removed.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Recovery Disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsp1988  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Recovery Disk</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP-Stream Mini that I use as my Home Enternainment System. I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday, but since the Stream Mini only has a 32gb ssd, I was forced to put a USB drive in prior to the upgrade. I am now unable to create a recovery disk while
 leaving the "Back up system files to the recovery drive" check mark active. My question is, is there already a Windows 10 backup file located on the USB drive I put in to allow the upgrade to complete? Or is there a reason I cannot leave the "Back up system
 files to the recovery drive" checked?&nbsp;I would just like to make sure I have a back up before I erase the previous versions of Windows to create more space. I used a clean install and have no personal files on the system right now. I just want to make sure
 I can restore my OS if I end up deciding to upgrade the ssd to a larger one in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>No, usually you need not have back up your data because all your data will be existing in the hard drive. Its optional, you can upgrade to windows 10 without backing up your data or you can back up your data, incase If you can't find a file on
 your computer or you accidently modified or deleted a file, you can restore it from a backup (if you're using Windows backup) or you can try to restore it from a previous version. Previous versions are copies of files and folders that Windows automatically
 saves as part of a restore point. Previous versions are sometimes referred to as shadow copies.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, however, that is not quite what I asked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already upgraded to Windows 10 and am currently enjoying it. My question was, is the operating system already backed up on the USB I had to put in for the upgrade? Or do I need to make a new OS recovery disk in case I want to upgrade my SSD later down
 the road? I just want to make sure that if I put in a new, formatted SSD, that I will be able to install Windows 10 without having to pay the upgrade since it is still the same device I just upgraded.</p>

            When I updated a Stream 7 with an added micro SD card the added D drive had 5.5gb of backup files and the recovery partition was gone from the C drive.&nbsp; Look at your USB and see if about 5GB of backup files are there.

            <p>I have been trying to create a Recovery USB Drive on freshly upgraded Windows 10 today on an HP Stream 7, but I _don't_ get an unchecked "Backup system files to recovery drive" checkbox. &nbsp;It is checked/checkable.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have an added uSD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I click the [Next] button it says Please Wait...., and then reports an error. &nbsp;It never gets to the selecting a USB drive step.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"""We can't create the recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">A problem occurred while creating the recovery drive &nbsp; &nbsp; [Finish]"""</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it. &nbsp;I've tried multiple times. &nbsp;So I am also unable to create a recovery USB drive for Windows 10 on my HP Stream 7 (signature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the Windows 10 upgrade installer might have eaten my Recovery partition as well? &nbsp;In disk management, it shows three partitions: &nbsp; &nbsp;[260 MB - EFI Recovery partition][~29 GB - Windows (C:)][449 MB - Recovery partition]</p>
<p>I remember the recovery partition on the eMMC drive being larger. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I also would like to be able to create and USB a recovery USB for my Stream 7 for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem that you describe.&nbsp; I have an ASUS laptop that I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now I can't create a rescue disk despite the fact that I was able to create one under Windows 8.1 with no problem.&nbsp; Ain't Microsoft
 wonderful?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, if I understand correctly, you downloaded the entire upgrade software to the PC that you're having trouble with, and then ran it.&nbsp; At that time you had the option to do a rescue disk without reinstalling Windows 10.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; I don't
 want to launch the software and then discover that I don't have any way to abort the operation without screwing up the existing system - not that I've ever&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;anything that dumb before!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Getting Japanese characters to display</h2>
                    In Windows 10, I was able to switch between the English and Japanese simply by clicking on the ENG icon in my various Office products (Word, PowerPoint, etc.)&nbsp; Now, however, the icon is gone and the ability to get Japanese characters to display has vanished.&nbsp;
 My computer says I have the Japanese IME language pack, but I can't get it to work.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this problem in Windows 10?&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; However, I had done all the things you mentioned in your reply to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a couple of days ago when I turned on my computer, miraculously the little icon in the right-hand corner showed that both English and Japanese were
 and still are available to us.&nbsp; I have absolutely no idea why this feature is now working properly again after not having worked for a few weeks.&nbsp; I can only guess that gremlins are to blame.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, I am glad it is working now, though I am,
 so far, not a big fan of Windows 10.&nbsp; It seems to run more slowly than Windows 8.1 did, and is sometimes frustratingly glitchy.</p>

            Hi Limirick,<br />
<br />
The error code <strong>0x80070005</strong> is most likely caused by the firewall or anti-virus on the Windows Vista. I suggest that you disable the security programs in Windows Vista as a test and then proceed with the installation.<br />
<br />
If you are running third party security software, make sure that it is designed specifically for Windows Vista and above.&nbsp; Anti-malware written for earlier versions of Windows can cause all kinds of unpredictable problems on Windows.<br />
<br />
Also make sure disconnected all external devices except mouse and the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Let us know for any further assistance.<br />

    <title>CPU not at 100&#37; in FSX - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ayeyup  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU not at 100&#37; in FSX</h2>
                    
<p>Running Flight Simulator X on Windows 7 I'm achieving 6-7fps regardless of the graphics settings. This appears to be due to the CPU not being fully utilised. The in-game fps cap is set to 40.</p>
<p>I've spent quite a while looking for an answer to this problem, most of which point to the fact that FSX is very CPU intensive and not to expect great performance. I don't belive that the issue I'm having is related to this. I have installed both service
 packs for FSX and have latest drivers for my graphics card. When running FSX alongside the Windows Task Manager I have noticed that whilst both cores of my processor are being used, they are not even nearly maxed out. The first core is running at around 40-50%
 and the second at around 20% or less. This easily accounts for the poor frame rate, but I have not found a way to make the CPUs work harder. When loading FSX the CPUs do, initially, run at full load however as soon as the load is completed they go back to
 &lt;50%.</p>
<p>The cpu is an Intel E8400 and I have an ATI 4800 series graphics card. Not a hugely up-to-date system but one on which I can run most games at close to the maximum settings. Furthermore, I have had quite reasonable frame rates in the past (20-40 or so) and
 have not changed the hardware since then. This is the first time I've tried to run FSX for quite a while. Possibly since upgrading to Windows 7 - perhaps this is the cause? I have completely reinstalled FSX and the service packs with no result.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

1. Which version of Flight Simulator X are you using?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After checking for the version you may check for the compatibility of the game with Windows 7 operating system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To do that you need to follow the link provided below.<br />

<span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />
You may run ‘Dxdiag’ to check what is the total memory allotted for the Video RAM.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>To run ‘Dxdiag’</span></strong></span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />
a. Click on Start.<br />
b. In the Start Search Bar type Dxdiag, then hit Enter.<br />
c. Click on the Display tab and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>You may also check in BIOS if the Video RAM is shared with the Physical RAM.</span></strong></span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></strong></span><br />
<span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can<br />
Cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot<br />
guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now you may open the task manager and set the priority of the process to high and check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>To do that:</span></strong></span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />
a. Right click on task bar.<br />
b. Select Start Task Manager.<br />
c. Select process tab.<br />
d. Under process tab search for the flight simulator x.<br />
e. Right click on FSX and select priority and set it to high and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<strong><span>Warning</span></strong><span><br />
Changing priorities might destabilize the system. Increasing the priority of a process might prevent other processes, including system services, from running. Decreasing the priority of a process might prevent it from running, not merely force it to run less
 frequently. In addition, lowering priority does not necessarily reduce the amount of processor time a thread receives; this happens only if it is no longer the highest-priority thread.</span><br />

<p>Hi, thanks for your swift reply.</p>
<p>I am running the original FSX (not acceleration) with both the service packs installed. I have checked the link you provided and it is not specific about version numbers of FSX but does say that FSX is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have run dxdiag and it says that the Approx. Total Memory for the display device is 3569MB. I do not have an on board graphics card and there is no mention anywhere in the BIOS of memory sharing, however 3569MB is a lot more than what is on the graphics
 card (I think its 512MB). I have 8GB of system RAM.</p>
<p>Regarding your other suggestion, I have already tried changing the priority of the process in task manager with no effect.</p>

<p>Interesting. I built the computer myself 2-3 years ago and put Vista on it. When Windows 7 came out I bought the upgrade version as the view seemed to be that Windows 7 handled gaming far better than Vista. Like I said, the idea that Windows 7 is causing
 the problem is merely a suggestion as it occurred to me that I hadn't played the game for a while and it might not have been since I'd upgraded the OS. Again, I can run any other games no problem at all.</p>
<p>Like you've said, the game will use what CPU it needs, and takes it all on loading. However most games will take all they can from the CPU when running, especially such a CPU intensive one as FSX. There are a lot of threads on the issue but they all relate
 to tweaking the game to require fewer cycles from the CPU. The problem I'm having is that the CPU isn't taking the resources it should have available to it when it does need it. I'm tempted to point to a bottleneck at the GPU but this seems unlikely, especially
 given the previous performance of this game on the same hardware.</p>

<p>Agreed, and FSX is a system intensive game. Yet as I've said plenty of other games run at max settings and 1920x1200 resolution so I'm not really tempted to point the finger at the hardware.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that Windows 7 uses the CPU less effectively, I was just pointing out that when a program is struggling for performance and the CPU is only running at 20%, a bottleneck elsewhere is a possibility that arises. The opinion I've seen elsewhere
 is that the CPU will tend to be the limiting factor on most machines when running FSX as it requires a lot more from the CPU that it does the GPU. The issue is that I can't get the game to take what CPU resources are available to it.</p>
<p>The Windows 7 aspect to this problem may be a complete red herring.</p>

<h2>            What will happen when MS account closed</h2>
                    <p>I have a Skype account and a Microsoft account, which are created separately (ca 2010 and 2014 respectively) then later linked.</p>
<p>I requested to close Microsoft one in the last month.</p>
<p>I still be able to login Skype account page with the old password created in 2010 but when I try to change password, the page redirects to Microsoft login:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>https: //secure .skype .com /account/personal/change-password</span></p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>https: //account .live .com /password/change ?…</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>https: //login .live .com /login.srf?…</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it shows me confirmation (*1) to reopen MS account, which I don't want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know what will happen to my Skype account when MS one closed</p>
<p>and what can I do to avoid close Skype one.<br />
Just the link will disconnect?</p>
<p>I changed the primary email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*1 my Skype name is displayed above the heading `Reopen account?`.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am&nbsp; not sure&nbsp;if this is the right place but, l am trying to install HP Support Assistant on my HP G70-212EM Notebook PC, (Windows Vista), without much success. It goes through all the installation process, right until the end, when it says that it has
 been installed correctly. During the installation, 2 error messages come up. The first one states:</p>
<p><strong>Windows Script Host</strong></p>
<p>Script: C:\swsetup\SP50843\HPHASInstall.jse</p>
<p>Line: 425</p>
<p>Char: 2</p>
<p>Error: Invalid procedure call or argument</p>
<p>Code: 800A0005</p>
<p>Source: Microsoft JScript runtime error</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second error message, which is towards the end of the installation, states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HPHASUtil has stopped working</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HP icon is on my desktop, and when l click on it, it opens but l when i try to use "Get Assistance", it does not load. A flashing orange "Loading" appears, but it does not do so. I am hoping that someone can help me with this, as l have several issues
 which need resolving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got a message today that said "your account has been suspended due to a problem with your payment option. please use a different payment option or update you current info." So I added my Paypal account and then tried to connect but all it did was add the
 Game Marketplace, Video, etc. and I still can't play online or see any of my friends. This is happening to 1 other account and it is frustrating me a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Enterprise - Windows Update won&#39;t work&#59; can&#39;t install&#47;uninstall any programs</h2>
                    I have a long history of issues with this PC, beginning with an overstuffed 80GB primary drive. I offloaded all picture &amp; music files to other drives but still had trouble getting the PC to run well. Windows Update was unable to run, and iTunes could not
 update, presumably because of space issues. In my attempts to clear space, I deleted the folder containing Microsoft Help files and ran a duplicate file cleaner to get more space opened. I finally decided to buy a new 500GB drive and image everything over
 to it. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I still have the same problems. Despite trying the many fixes to get Windows Update to restart, including:<br />
<br />
...<br />
Four commands in order (in an administrative level command prompt - elevated command prompt...)<br />
<ul>
<li><b><i>net stop wuauserv<br />
</i></b><i>(stops the Windows Update service.)</i><b><i><br />
</i></b></li><li><b><i>cd %systemroot%<br />
</i></b><i>(changes into the C:\Windows directory for most people.)</i><b><i><br />
</i></b></li><li><b><i>ren SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
</i></b><i>(renames the "SoftwareDistribution" folder to "SoftwareDistribution.old".)</i></li><li><b><i>net start wuauserv<br />
</i></b><i>(starts the Windows Update service.)</i></li></ul>
<p>...<br />
</p>
<p>and running MATS wizard (I found that had a couple of corrupt files, replaced them with good files from another Win7 PC) ...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm still stuck. <br />
</p>
<br />
Any attempt to uninstall or repair or install software (iTunes, Adobe Reader) results in an error message stating "another process is already running; please allow that process to complete" or some such.<br />
<br />
Many thanks if I can get this thing running again! My iPhones really need to back up and update! :)<br />

            OK ... in continuing to follow good advice in these forums, I downloaded and installed an anti-malware program. It's running now, so I'll try the free anti-spyware program next. THEN follow the software distribution advice as I've done previously, with
 my Norton off. Hopefully that will help.<br />
<br />
But here's what I know now: I can't download Adobe Reader (but Flash WILL update successfully), and iTunes won't update or install. Neither will Windows Update. Will provide new info as I find things out.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;I would back up anything you want to keep and reinstall Windows.&nbsp; When you start running into problems like this, you can spend a whole lot of unproductive time trying to figure out what the problem is and what to do to fix it.&nbsp; It's a pain to have to reinstall,
 but in situations like yours it would appear the be the significantly better choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

                    Before a recent update (auto) whenever I close an app (that I started from the Start&nbsp;screen)&nbsp;my screen would revert to Start screen. Now after the update&nbsp;it reverts to the desktop screen. Is there a setting I could change so that whenever I close an app

</p><p>I have recently bought a Linx 12x64 tablet and have had a major issue with the touchpad. It will lag, stutter, select things it shouldn't and other annoying things. The tablet runs windows 10 and is up to date. Is there anything that will fix this problem?</p>

 you (here is the link for my reply to previous <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/how-to-fix-100-disk-usage-in-windows-10/7c5c979b-0ed0-4855-b9b8-05b9499533e2">

            Hi Diane
<br />
<br />That game will not play on the 64bit version of Windows, it may, just may play on the 32bit version of Windows 10, but I honestly doubt it will ever work under Windows 10!
<br />
<br />If it is going to play on Windows 10 you would need to clean install the 32bit vrsion of Windows 10 and choose to run that game and its installer in Compatibility Mode

            I doubt that this would work on Windows 10 but you can try to install this in compatibility mode.
<br />
<br />Right click on the setup file &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility tab &gt; Check the box - Run this program in compatibility mode &gt; Select the right operating system &gt; OK and install

            Hi,
<br />unfortunately in such cases the solution is to use previous Windows versions in virtual machines such as DOSBox. The bad news are such usage requires separate Windows license.

<p>You would have to be lucky, but if the game is and early DirectX (d3d) based rather than DOS you may be able to find a</p>
<p>new installer on a fan site (EDIT: I see the game is DOS based. ) </p>
<p>Vintage DirectX games often used 16bit installers, which are not compatible with 64bit Windows, but the game itself will often</p>
<p>run on 64bit Windows once installed.</p>
<p>- There is also good likelihood of having to use other fixes, particularly for colour problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>DOS BOX</em> is not actually a Virtual Machine as such, but an DOS 'emulator',&nbsp; but it does have a steep learning curve.
</p>
<p>The package below has a user interface that helps some, but when available on line from sites such as</p>
<p><em>Good Old Games</em>, <em>The Humble Store</em>, or<em> Steam</em> old DOS based games install with DOX BOX, and any other fixes that are required</p>
<p>to get them running on modern Windows versions, automatically...&nbsp; Too easy!</p>

<h2>            Windows Mail from Vista to Windows 10</h2>
                    I use Windows Mail in my Vista OS. &nbsp;It is a very simple program (app) and I would like to continue using it when I change over to my new Windows 10 computer. &nbsp;I am NOT talking about Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I am talking about the email program that was included
 with Vista. &nbsp;I want to keep it in Windows 10. &nbsp;Is that possible, or am I going to have to accept Outlook as my email program in Windows 10? &nbsp;I do not want to use Outlook because it has far more bells and whistles than I need for simple email purposes. &nbsp;Thanks.

<h3> liberty mom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 to in-place Windows 10 in-place upgrade failed.</h2>
                    <p>As of March 10 My Toshiba Satellite P75-A laptop has been next to useless due to the Windows 10 upgrade. Immediately after the "upgrade" the only access to anything was to hit ctrl+shift+esc, reaching the task manager. The task bar &amp; notification area are
 unresponsive. Internet Explorer opens but is unresponsive, windows does not updated, am unable to set defaults since it also becomes unresponsive when activated. Attempting to use the Power shell command prompt causes it to close stating a program causes it
 to close. I've been unable to make an system image backup. I get that dreaded "We couldn't complete the updates. Undoing changes loop."&nbsp; I am able to run cmd. Edge or Cortana have never been on board. Running sfc \scannow, DISM /online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth,
 DISM /Online /Clean-Image /ScanHealth, &amp; DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth all showed no violation or store corruptions &amp; completed successfully UNTIL on June 7th I installed &amp; ran Malwarebytes. Since then sfc /scannow now&nbsp; verifies to 96% then states
 Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation. DISM..... restorehealth comes back with "The source files could not be found. Use the "Source" option to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature....."
 Another unwanted bonus after running Malwarebytes, restore no longer works! I've tried chkdsk C: /f /r /x didn't seem to fix anything. Reset my computer returned that it couldn't be completed. Start up repair states "Start up repair could not repair your computer".
 Until this mess I've have had no knowledge of any type or form of computer malfunction or troubleshooting so this is the beginning of my knowledge &amp; experience with troubleshooting &amp; its lingo. I am now totally exhausted after more than 2 months of wasted
 effort on my part. P.S. My desktop has never looked like Windows 10. More like 8.1 but without the swiping &amp; pointing to access different apps &amp; programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll be the next in line to beg for help help help. </p>

            <p>I replied to this using my phone but I don't see that reply posted so I'll edit that reply &amp; re-post it here: Last night I downloaded the media creation tool &amp; went thru the hoops of downloading windows 10 to a USB. Guess what? After waiting over 4 hours
 I received this: "There was a problem running this tool. We're not sure what happened, but we're unable to run this tool on your PC. If you continue experiencing problems, reference the error code when contacting customer support. Error code: 0x80070002-0xA0019".
 So I tried it again with the same length of time &amp; same error. I may have tried downloading the wrong thing. I am now in the process of using the tool &amp; downloading the ISO. As before, it is extremely slooooooow. It is at 18% in 1.5 hours. The error I received
 earlier did provide me with more information than other codes. It said I could contact Microsoft support. Not so sure how to do that either. I am at the stage of needing someone to take remote access of this thing since everything I do results in errors.</p>
<p>When the download completes or ends I will get back with the results.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for your assistance. It is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>I am totally sick &amp; tired of this thing. My computer was perfectly fine before this dang "upgrade". I wish I had left well enough alone &amp; not put my trust in an "upgrade". Ha. if this is an upgrade I'd be afraid to know what a downgrade is.</p>
