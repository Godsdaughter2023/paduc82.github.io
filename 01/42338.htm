<h2>            Trying to fix my gmail account, says account settings are out of date</h2>
                    So all the sudden my school email account on my laptop wasn't getting any new emails that I would get on my phone. It says my account settings are out of date, so I did what it said would fix my account. It still says its out of date even after doing what
 was supposed to fix my account. I've tried doing it multiple times, and have searched but haven't gotten any help fixing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Check your Gmail settings if the Allow Less Secure App option is disabled. Google made an some changes on their security standards so if an app or device doesn't meet their standards, Google will block anyone who tried to sign in from that app or device.

<p>Hello Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried everything but the uninstall, for some reason it doesn't even let me uninstall the app. It gives the option but isn't highlighted so I can actually click on it and uninstall. Also, yes, I am using the mail app. It still does not work, and I
 keep getting notifications that it is out of date but still can't do anything about it. All of my other emails on the app work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on fix my account, it takes me to my login for my school email, I login. Then it says windows wants to access my account, I click allow, then it says its fixing my account, but then I get another notification saying my account is out of date
 and it still doesn't work. Its not the password being wrong or the security certificate. Hopefully there are other things I can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h3> mecandes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana causing Outlook error message&#58; &#8220;Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request...&#8221;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to the latest version of Windows 10 that added support for Cortana in Canada, and after getting Cortana all set up nicely, I have begun having the following error message pop up annoyingly about every 10 or 15 minutes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching for this error, I found the following possible solution -- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/813745 -- This didn't work, however, because Microsoft Outlook is not configured with any account on my machine at all, so I don't even have a registry
 entry for Outlook to delete (and I can't open Outlook to run the "repair" option either unless I set up an account). The default and only mail client on my system is the Windows 10 Mail app. (I use Hotmail/Gmail, not locally installed e-mail software.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm thinking this is related to something Cortana is trying to check or monitor. If there is no fix available, can anyone tell me which aspects of Cortana's permissions settings cause her to attempt to check Outlook so that I can turn those off and
 hopefully stop this constant error from popping up?</p>

            Thanks, but as I said, the Microsoft Mail and Calendar app is the default e-mail client here, so this doesn't solve the problem.

            <p>Hey there Soukas,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>That's an interesting one, we've not seen many reports of that issue happening at all. Since this is&nbsp;an original model Xbox One (although Master Chief Edition), try unplugging the console from the power source and cleaning the power button with a soft try cloth to remove any fingerprints or debris. If that doesn't help, make sure your console is plugged directly into a wall outlet and not a surge protector/power strip. The Xbox One console has a built in surge protector, so if it's connected to another one, it's very possible that there could be a power issue going on. Aside from that, it's also possible the console is downloading updates in the background. Do you have the console set to Instant On mode or Energy Saving mode?</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>I can&#39;t change power settings, even though I&#39;m logged on as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cowboyninjad  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t change power settings, even though I&#39;m logged on as administrator.</h2>
                    I've recently been having issues with my power settings. I don't think I've changed them since I got the computer more than a year ago, but last week the computer began going to sleep if I left it alone for too long and required a password to start up
 again. In the past, only the screen turned off.<br />
<br />
I changed the setting so it wouldn't go to sleep, and it was fine until today when it started to go to sleep again, this time not requiring a password. But when I tried to adjust my power settings, Vista locked me out and the help message says only an administrator
 can change the power settings.<br />
<br />
I am the administrator, I have the only account on the computer and the only network I'm on is my home wireless network. So how do I convince the computer that I am the administrator and that it should let me change the power settings?

            Hi CowboyNinjaD,<br />
<br />
What exactly is the error message when you try to change the power plan settings?
<br />
<br />
You can try executing this command in the command prompt to restore the power plan settings to default.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Start; then click on All Programs.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Accessories. Right click on Command Prompt and run as administrator.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Execute the following command.<br />
<br />
<strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes</strong> <br />
<br />
If this did not help you, then I would suggest you to enable the hidden administrator account in Windows Vista and check if you’re able to change the power plan settings.<br />
<strong><br />
HOW TO: Enable the build-in Administrator account in Windows Vista</strong> <br />

    <title>An admin suddenly showed up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barb morris  say:</h3>
<h2>            An admin suddenly showed up</h2>
                    <p>So, since my husband passed away 2 years ago, I have had to learn how this computer works. He was the designated admin on our W-7. But I somehow found a way to delete his password, and I thought I changed the admin controls to me. Only recently have I started
 getting the pop ups saying I couldn't do something because I needed admin permission. Which was quite confusing. Then I started noticing when I checked the properties of different files, my name didn't even show up as a user sometimes. Then this nasty looking
 little man shape showed up and claimed to be the admin. Fortunately I am the only one with a pw to sign into the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need help killing off this guy once and for all. I have tried changing the admin back to me. Sometimes it looked like it worked, but not. And I can't even get into it's profile to try and change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this question has been asked before, but the answers are usually for W-8 or 7. &nbsp;And most often they start with clicking the right side of the screen and typing in a command. W-10 does not have that option. So please. Does anyone know how to get rid
 of this thing from W-10? &nbsp;This is just one of the problems I am trying to fix with only answers for a different OS .</p>
<p>Thank you to anyone who can help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Windows has a security feature which enables each user account to be designated as either Administrator or Standard (formerly 'Limited') User.&nbsp; Standard User accounts are not allowed to install software without providing credentials (user name and password)
 for an Administrator account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard accounts&nbsp;are intended for children or anyone else who you don't want to mess-up the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, right click the Start button and the select (left click) Control Panel.&nbsp; In Control Panel find User Accounts.&nbsp; In User Accounts you should see your user account and it should say (by the icon) whether you are an Administrator of a Standard
 user.&nbsp; If it says Standard then report back because you need to do something about this.&nbsp; If it says Administrator then your account does indeed have Administrator privileges.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Alan</p>
 under my name and email address. I have tried many times&nbsp;to change my status to admin, but it acts weird (my bad luck ensures that!) each time I have tried.&nbsp; To change it, there are two choices to check with one being yes change the status. Sometimes it is
 definitely working. Outlined and bolder color. I hit that, and thought it worked, but of course if didn't&nbsp; The rest of the time that choice is grayed out so you can't, When I go into his profile, it doesn't &nbsp;even give the choice to change His status.&nbsp; Oh!
 BTW.....When I do log on to the PC, it has both our pictures, but it says User by mine, and Admin by his icon.&nbsp; At some point during all this, I did see Admin listed by&nbsp;my name, but that didn't happen for long.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Barb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the advice from Cass help?&nbsp; My guess is that you are not an Administrator but you presumably know the password for your late husband's account (and have to keep submitting it whenever you need to make a change).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would log on as your husband&nbsp; at the logon window, go to Control Panel - User Accounts, find your account and change yourself from a Standard User to an Administrator.&nbsp; After that you can restart the computer, log-in as normal to your own
 account and that should be that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you can get some of the way there and require more detailed instructions.&nbsp; As you can see, there are people here keen to help you.</p>

            <p>I had written this reply, but it was stupidly deleted. So, I'll try to reproduce it here.&nbsp; First I am going to copy and paste parts of my original question which should answer some of your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>My husband&nbsp;was the designated admin on our W-7. But I somehow found a way to delete his password, and I thought I changed the admin controls to me. And that is when I also removed my husband's account.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only recently have I started getting the
 pop ups saying I couldn't do something because I needed admin permission. Which was quite confusing. Then I started noticing when I checked the properties of different files, my name didn't even show up as a user sometimes. Then this nasty looking little man&nbsp;icon
 showed up and claimed to be the admin. Fortunately I am the only one with a pw to sign into the computer.&nbsp;
</em></strong><em><strong>&nbsp;I have tried changing the admin back to me. Sometimes it looked like it worked, but not. And I can't even get into it's profile to try and change it.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now I will tell you what I used as a fix, I hope.&nbsp; First I set up my husband with a new Outlook account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I went to Settings/Accounts and in Family and other users, I set him up as a User only.&nbsp; I also gave the icon admin a password. Don't know
 if that was a good idea or not.&nbsp; Then I went back to my account and changed it to Admin.&nbsp; I hope again!
</p>
<p>As for Cortana, she is useless to me. When I typed- &nbsp;Open 'Get Started', she gave me a choice to look for it in "my stuff" which didn't help, or the web which always takes me to Bing. I really don't like Bing. Usually anything I ask her to find or take me
 to, she takes me to Bing. </p>
<p>Anyway, this is my fix for now. Please, wish me luck that it worked!</p>
<p>Thank you both for your help. Now I just have to completely get rid of that other guy. LOL</p>

            <p>I'm glad things seem to be working for you now, although I don't quite understand all that you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a third User Account named named "Admin"?&nbsp; Or is it named "Administrator"?&nbsp; By long-standing tradition Windows has a hidden user account called "Administrator" but this is turned-off by default so you never usually see it or know it is there.&nbsp;
 But it could have been turned-on on your computer.</p>

            <p>Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just assume people understand what I am thinking when I try to write it down.</p>
<p>Now I know I'm not crazy. Yes, the hidden Administrator is what showed up one morning when I started the computer. &nbsp;Before then, there was only one account on this PC. Remember I had removed my husband's Administrator status and removed him completely from
 the account. &nbsp;So, I guess that made me the Administrator by default? &nbsp;Until this hidden user account just showed up.</p>
<p>I haven't tested my fix yet, but I so hope it works. &nbsp;If you know how to turn the hidden account back off, that would be awesome!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>First test your fix.&nbsp; Your computer needs at least one account with Administrator permissions.&nbsp; Then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the Start button (bottom left) and (left) click Command Prompt (Admin).&nbsp; Say yes to the pop-up that says "Do you want this app to make changes to your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should then get a plain window with (usually) a black background.</p>
<p>In that windows type:</p>
<p><strong>net user </strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>administrator</strong></span><strong> /active:no</strong>
</p>
<p>then press the Enter key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should do the trick and the Administrator account should be gone next time you restart the computer.</p>

            <p>Okay. Most everything I have opened that required administrator approval, I have been able to open.&nbsp; It looks like my idea that I needed a third user so I could change myself to an admin may have been in the right direction.&nbsp; Except when I check the properties
 of something, my name is only listed with my email name, and Home.&nbsp; Never as administrator.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was not able to vanquish the built in admin guy.&nbsp; He is still on the screen when I start the computer.&nbsp; I actually searched it on a couple of web browsers, and found one answer that was pretty much what you told me. Maybe it won't go away because I
 gave it a password. From what I read, those don't have a password.&nbsp; So, I'm still stuck with him, and I really would like to get rid of him so there is no question I am the Leader of my clan in this PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that's where I stand for now.</p>

    <title>When I print from Windows Photo Viewer, all my network printers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manxman55  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I print from Windows Photo Viewer, all my network printers disappear.  Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This problem only happens when I print a picture in Windows Photo Viewer.&nbsp; On trying to print the picture,&nbsp;all my network (not local USB) printers are deleted and the print spooler service is stopped.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restarting the Print Spooler service alone does not bring back the printers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found, after each of the many times this has happened, that the only way to get the printers back is to use system recovery in the Control Panel to revert the computer settings to an earlier date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit, on an Acer Veriton M464 Quad-Core PC which has 4GB of RAM installed and, other than this issue, works flawlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is a serious pain in my rump.&nbsp; Why is your program&nbsp;doing this?</p>

<h3> kudz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Internet Connection Issue</h2>
                    
<div>I'm having internet connection issues on Windows 7 ultimate x64<br />
Every so often i lose internet (but not local network) connection on my PC<br />
I have confirmed it's not my broadband as my Laptop, PS3 &amp; Xbox360 are still connecting to the internet when this happens<br />
The network icon in the taskbar gets a nice yellow triangle<br />
My Motherboard is an Asus Striker Extreme nForce 680i and i have the latest Nvidia drivers installed for the LAN. I have also changed the LAN cable<br />
The only way i get my internet connection back is by disabling/enabling the LAN in control panel.<br />
<br />
judging by my google search results i'm not the only one having this issue with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Anyone else here havin the same issue or&nbsp;have a fix that works?<br />
<br />
C'mon microsoft where's the fix for this<br />
<br />
Thanks</div>

<p><span><span><span>Hi Kudz,<br />
I would suggest you to run network troubleshooter <span>&nbsp;</span>from the following link and see if that help.<br />
</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</span></a><strong><br />
<br />
</strong></span><span><span><span>As you were losing the internet connection frequently, I would suggest you to reset the TCP\IP Stack from the following link and see if that help.<br />
</span></span><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></span></span></a><br />
</strong></span><span><span><br />
<span>Disable the IP Helper service:</span></span></span><span><br />
<span>1. Hold the Windows key and type R, enter "services.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
2. Scroll down to the IP Helper service, right click on it and select Properties<br />
3. In the dropdown box that says "Automatic" or "Manual", set it to Disabled and then click on "Apply"<br />
4. Then click on "Stop" to stop the service from running in the current session<br />
5. Click OK to exit the dialog<br />

<span>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you
 follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to
 view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br />
</span></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</span></span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 How to back up and restore the registry in Windows<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows7 cannot obtain an IP address from certain routers or from certain non-Microsoft DHCP servers<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To resolve this issue, disable the DHCP BROADCAST flag in Windows7. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.<br />
2. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
3. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
4. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{GUID}<br />
5. In this registry path, click the (GUID) subkey that corresponds to the network adapter that is connected to the network.<br />
6. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.<br />
7. In the New Value #1 box, type DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then press ENTER.<br />
8. Right-click DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then click Modify.<br />
9. In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.<br />
10. Close Registry Editor.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By setting this registry key to 1, Windows7 will first try to obtain an IP address by using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets. If that fails, it will try to obtain an IP address without using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets.<br />
</span></span><span><strong><br />
</strong></span><span><span><span><span>If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to try the steps from the following links.<br />

            Hi Vijay,<br />
<br />
thank you very much for your detailed reply.<br />
<br />
i have tried all the available steps and still the issue persists.<br />
<br />
i ran the network troubleshooter and the answer i got from it was:<br />
<em>"your broadband modem is experiencing connectivity</em> issues"<br />
<br />
i find this hard to believe as my Playstation 3 / Xbox 360 &amp; Laptop are all still able to connect to the internet?<br />
i have even go so far as to do an msconfig / disable all yet the issue remains unresolved<br />
<br />
<strong>i have found another tread relating to the same issue: </strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/0014801b-7e82-4bb6-a8e7-e8867eb3fcee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/0014801b-7e82-4bb6-a8e7-e8867eb3fcee</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;yet
 nothing seems to be getting done by Microsoft to repair this issue</strong><br />
<br />
can you please update as to what the issue is and when there will be an update released to fix it?
<br />
Thanks<br />
John<br />

            update..<br />
<br />
i'v been browsing the nvidia forums and seem to have found a fix that works :) (well for me anyways)<br />
<br />
on my nForce board i had the latest nVidia driver installed (Win 7 x64 v15.51)<br />
<br />
i uninstalled that driver completely and installed the Vista x64 v15.25 driver.<br />
<br />
i done this on&nbsp;Tuesday and my connection hasn't dropped since :):)<br />
<br />
hopefully this problem is solved for me now and this fix works for others too

 and claimiNg that my LFGroup post is spam or false giveaways; Even though it simply says 7 words: 'Let's become trillionaires and rank 8000'. I'm not sayiNg that's the only reason, but it's a strong enough reason to make them 'butt hurt'. GTA OnliNe has 4
 different currencies/rewards: Money, RP (level/rank), JP (Job PoiNts), and the newly implemented AP (Arena PoiNts) which is part of the Arena Wars upd8. If everyone's primary focus is leveliNg up and earniNg money, then what is wrong with me postiNg that?
 Then I follow up with my confirmed LFGroup post members by firstly sendiNg them a game iNvite, then 3 Xbox Club iNvites (Because I own several Xbox Clubs), then I message them:&nbsp;</span><span>'I'm
 unitiNg 30 players iN a freemode session. If my MC/CEO is full host your own or joiN another. If you want a consistent, reliable, active, friendly, and helpful host/deliverer, add me as a favorite' or somethiNg similar to that. Then I even go the extra mile
 by sendiNg them my shared content which I store iN a direct message to one of my secondary accounts, to make thiNgs quicker and easier for me. With all of that said, what is wrong with my post and communic8ions? NothiNg. They're just envious and target me,
 the Xbox Enforcement team permanently suspended my gamertag #iN8k iN October 2018 and I was level 1,083 out of 8,000 levels. I got banned for 9 years of trash talk; But with all of this said I have plenty of reason to believe that they are targetiNg me and
 attemptiNg to implement another permanent account suspension on #iNN8k or ... worse... a console suspension... I want this addressed and iNvestig8ed because this is entirely unfair.</span></div>

<p><span>(Also take note: We're allowed to send 1,000 messages daily with 500 characters per message.)</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>
<span style="color: rgba(28, 30, 33, 1)">(Also keep iN miNd: They banned me on June 4, 2019, 7:22:23 PM for 2 weeks, I thought I got banned for harassment or bullyiNg...
 June 18 comes and the suspension was supposed to be lifted at 11PM, I got iN the shower at 8PM, got out around 8:40PM, I turned on my console, the suspension was lifted; So I began hostiNg my post, and messagiNg people the above mentioned paragraph, iN the
 middle of messagiNg people they banned me for ANOTHER 2 weeks, but they banned me at 9:30... Literally 1 hour after my other suspension was lifted... So with that said idk if they're banniNg me for my LFGroup post, or my messages, but there is nothiNg wrong
 with either one, even iN the 2 case reviews I filed I asked for clarific8ion and they didn't give it, they always simply send a robotic response with a generaliZed description which is unspecific.)</span></div>

<h2>            Light blue message screen.</h2>
                    I installed updates on my computer lastnight and then turned it on today and installed an update for my Avast Premium Anti-virus. And now everytime i turn on my laptop a blue message screen comes on and says "your pc ran into a problem and needs restart.
 We are just collecting some error info, and then we will restart your computer for you." After it gets to 100% it goes to restart and then comes back to this screen over and over. I dont know what to do.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes, Canon camcorder XL2 is compatible with&nbsp;Windows 7 .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>This can also be due to some third party software conflict. You may put the system in clean boot state and then connect the device (Canon xl2) to see if the issue reoccurs. Follow the steps given in link mentioned below to do a clean boot.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or Windows 7?<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><br />
<strong>Note: <br />
</strong>Refer step 7 from the above mentioned link which implies “start computer as usual” after the troubleshooting is performed.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may try to<strong> </strong>update drivers from device manager. Try these steps to do the same.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click </span><b><span>Start</span></b><span>, type
</span><b><span>Device Manager</span></b><span> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Locate </span><b><span>the device
</span></b><span>and expand the same.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select the </span><span>XL2</span><span>, right-click and select
</span><b><span>Properties.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under <b>Driver </b>tab click on<b> Update driver.</b></span></p>

    <title>Video clips ridiculously short now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neuraljam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video clips ridiculously short now</h2>
                    <p>I've just 'upgraded' to the new Skype, and the maximum video clip size seems to have changed from 3 minutes to 30 seconds! I use these all the time to send messages, but now there's hardly any time to say anything, is there a way to change this or roll back
 the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            I know! Many users have reported having difficulties with the new version. Maybe this could be solved soon. In the meantime, they install the classic version as a workaround.

            But the installer you linked to installs the new version, not the 'classic' version. I have the old version on my work computer, and it says that that version is going to stop working soon. Any other ideas?

<p>I&nbsp; still have Classic installed, and it is behaving the same way.&nbsp; Do I have to Uninstall the new version too?&nbsp; I did that once already, back in May, but lately Skype was warning that Classic would disappear shortly and I had to switch over, so I did.&nbsp; This
 morning's news says Microsoft will keep Classic alive longer due to customer complaints, while it tries to fix the new version or add back Classic features.&nbsp; So, need I uninstall the new one for Classic to work the way it used to?&nbsp; Do I have to uninstall them
 both, and then reinstall Classic?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Installation Problem - DVD-ROM Driver</h2>
                    I'm trying to install 64-bit Windows 7 on my i7 desktop.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the initial installation step (copying files), at the second step (expanding Windows files) at around 93-98% of the process I get an error message stating "<i>Windows cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all
 files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code 0x80070017</i>".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I am using a brand new Windows 7 Professional 64-bit installation disk. Upon retrying the installation I am prompted to install a missing driver for my DVD-ROM:
<i>"A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing. If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD or USB flash drive, please insert it now</i>". After inserting my DVD-ROM driver CD in the drive, a dialogue saying "No device drivers were found" pops up. How can
 I solve this problem and install Windows 7?</div>

            Thanks for your quick reply.
<div><br />
<div>I tried both of your suggestions, without any luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After reading some more posts regarding this error, it ocurred to me to disconnect my recently mounted secondary disk drive that I bought specifically for this installation (to use as Slave).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Neither my DVD drive nor my secondary HDD had jumpers. I specifically looked online on my HDD manufacturer's web site for Slave jumper configuration, but found none. After simply mounting the drive "as-is", it worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So in summary, my problem was that there must have been a conflict between the secondary HDD and the DVD drive. After unplugging the HDD from the mainboard, the installation continued without a problem. Hope this helps somebody else as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And thanks again for your help.</div>

            <p>So your locked out of the admin pages of your router? If so and you forgot your admin password you may simply need to
<strong><em>reset the router back to its factory defaults</em></strong> and reconfigure both the router and any wireless encryption scheme from scratch. Read your users manual or check the manufacturers support site for help with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can log on the router admin pages and you don't know your wireless encryption key/password/passphrase...</p>
<p>Check the security pages and see if the key is displayed on plain text.&nbsp;If&nbsp;the key is not displayed in plain text you could create a new encryption key making sure all of your wireless clients are updated with the new key...</p>
<p>...or...</p>
<p>If you have another Windows 7 computer connected wirelessly to your home network you can go into the wireless profile and display the key in plain text. Check the
<strong>Show characters</strong> check-box.</p>

<p>Lastly if you have a Windows 7, Vista or XP computer connected wirelessly you can save off the wireless profile on a flash drive using Windows Connect Now [WCN]. The wireless key is in plain text in the<em>\Smrtntky\Wsetting.txt</em> file on the flash drive.</p>
