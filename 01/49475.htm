                    I know I can download Personalize Classic from other sites. However, I don't know if these sites can be trusted. Can I download the Personalize Classic context from Microsoft. Or do you have a trusted website that you can recommend.&nbsp; Thank you.

    <title>windows video screensaver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rellik_66  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows video screensaver</h2>
                    Hi, I have an activated version of windows 7 professional 64-bit. I recently downloaded the windows video screensaver. Whenever I try to install it, the installation halts and I'm told to go to a website that will check weather I have a genuine version
 of windows. I follow the instructions and it says windows has been validated, however when I try to install the screen saver it just keeps halting and taking me to the same website.

            Well, the screensaver I was talking about was originally available with windows vista. The above link goes to a thread that explains why that screensaver was not included in windows 7. There is also a link to a workaround, not sure if that works or not.
 I tried it but it didn't work for me. Just a warning to anyone who does try that workaround. It involves editing the windows 7 registry, if this is done incorrectly it can seriously damage your operating system. Personally I gave up on getting a video screensaver,
 if you really want a video screensaver just set a video or video play list to repeat using windows media player and play it in full screen mode.

                    I connected a Plantronic C320-M to a Samsung Galaxy S8&nbsp; with the adapter that comes with the phone (USB-A to USB-C) and the phone recognises and identifies it and can play music and other sounds through the headset, but Skype puts out the sound through
 tha main speaker and I can'r find any way to change this.

<p>Yes, the headset is normally used with Skype for Business on a laptop, and I've also tested it with an ordinary Skype on a desktop.</p>
<p>The version on the Android is 8.3.0.52046 skylib-ngcalling_android-armv7_gnustl-release_releases/CL2017-R15.2017-15.01.27</p>
<p>With Skype for Business on a Huawei Honor 9 it works alright with the USBA-USBC connector.</p>

<p>Uninstalled Skype. As it is a preinstalled app, it was immediately replaced and upgraded automatically. When I connected the headset the signal was heard in The headset, but when I tried the Skype test call,the output was in the phone's speaker. When disconnecting,
 that beep came in the headset. Mystifying...</p>

    <title>Account Link betwen GFWL and Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account Link betwen GFWL and Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
First, just to tell you, I have no idea of what happened today at all.<br />
<br />
I just purchased and downloaded a game via <strong>Steam</strong> associated with Games for Windows Live. It is
<strong>Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition</strong>.</p>

<p>Once the download was finished, I startet the game and GFWL pop up, so I decided it to link the game to this account:
<strong>SarkenHS</strong>, the one I'm using now to write this post.</p>

<p>I'm ABSOLUTLY CERTAIN that I used the CORRECT e-mail and password to link the game to this account, yet, I don't know why, it linked it to a very very old e-mail I don't even use anymore and of course, I have no idea what kind of informations I used then
 (I was a child... and childrens always use stupids informations)</p>
<p>I don't know if I can write this old e-mail (I wouldn't personnaly care since I didn't use it for ages and there's nothing personnal inside) in public so I'll wait to give it. I can still give the gamertag of this really olf account (I just this old email
 to create a 2nd player for my xbox): <strong>sarkyiii</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>An another reason of why I'm sure and certain I couldn't possibly use the wrong e-mail: I can't even remember the password of the old mail... How could I even log in with then?</p>

<p>I don't know if I'm clear... in summary, I wanted to link <em><strong>Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition</strong></em> to
<strong>SarkenHS</strong>, but it linked it to <strong>sarkyiii</strong>.</p>
<p>I tried to download SarkenHS' profile again, but as I suspected, it say there isn't any SF4 key-cd linked to it. I tried to use the same key but of course, it say it's already in use ^^'.</p>

<p>I really hope there is a way to solve this problem, because I can't do anything with the account now (for instance, to add friends, I need the autorisation of my parents... Even is sarkyiii is "adult" now... and of course, since I don't remember the password,
 I can't add friends...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sorry if I didn't chose the correct forum, I'm not used to english and lesser to xbox live support since this is my first time here ^^'. Sorry if I'm seems a little frustrated too, it's a really weird problem and I can't do anything to solve it with "automatic
 support" =/.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Sarken.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ps: I know too that Games for Windows Live will soon shut down and that games affiliated with it will gave another way of accounts, I suppose but I don't really want to wait until the beginning of 2014 to play online with friends... I hope you'll understand,
 thanks again.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind at all having my saved game of sarkyiii to be deleted, I didn't really play a lot since I just bought it xD.</p>

    <title>Memory full after upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium from Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Memory full after upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium from Vista</h2>
                    I have a 64-bit computer which is less than a year old.<br />
<br />
I had broadband connection problems so I did various system restore points in the hope of going back to a time when there were no problems when connecting to the Internet.<br />
<br />
In the end I got fed up having to do this and decided to install Windows 7 Home Premium which was done and now there are no connection problems.<br />
<br />
However, to my horror, the hard drive (C) is saying there is less than 1GB memory left on my computer and that I should free up some space!<br />
<br />
<strong>Question 1: How could this be possible on an upgrade/fresh&nbsp;install of Windows 7 and on a computer where there are very few programs installed?<br />
</strong><br />
I've looked at what's installed and there's nothing showing more than just Windows 7 being installed with its associated programs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Question 2: Has the space been used up because I've somehow installed Windows 7 but not deleted&nbsp;Vista?<br />
<br />
Question 3: Or is the space being used up by data as a result of doing the various system restores?<br />
</strong><br />
Maybe its something else? <br />
<br />
<strong>Question 4: Has anyone got any idea how I can free up the space please?<br />
</strong><br />
Many thanks<br />
Geoff Cook

<p>Hey Geoff Cook,</p>
<p>How exactly was the installation done?</p>
<p>Considering your concern, it very much sounds like you’ve performed an upgrade installation.
<br />
Still I’d like to confirm whether the installation was done after booting to the desktop (Upgrade installation) or from the Windows 7 installation Media ( Custom Installation).</p>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong> If you’ve chosen the second type of installation, it could very much be possible that the space has been taken up by Windows.old folder that contains the files from your previous system as correctly suggested by J W Stuart.<br />
If you have any personal documents in there, you may recover the documents after which you can proceed to delete the windows.old folder by following the steps from Answer 3.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>How to restore your personal files after you perform a custom installation of Windows Vista or of Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932912</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Answer 2:</strong>&nbsp; Unless you’ve installed Windows 7 in a different partition it is not possible to install both the operating systems in a single partition. As I can see from your post, the issue is specific to C drive.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> Run disk cleanup. This will help in clearing all the junk files. This utility can also be used to delete windows.old folder.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Type disk cleanup in the start search orb to run disk cleanup.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on disk cleanup from the programs list in the search result.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select C drive.<br />
The Disk Cleanup utility will scan the driver for not used and unnecessary files.<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is completed check the "Previous Windows installations" to remove windows.old folder.<br />
You can opt to place a checkmark on others such as “Downloaded Program Files”, “Temporary Internet Files” if desired.<br />
5.&nbsp;When the wizard requests your confirm to delete the Windows.old folder and its content files, select Delete.<br />
6.&nbsp;The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. In this tab, you can choose to remove “Programs and Features” and “System Restore and Shadow Copies”. You can delete all the restore points and regain your disk
 space. You can also uninstall all the unused programs from here.</p>
<p>Refer this article for additional assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> To be sure that there is no infection or no trace of virus residing on your computer and eating up the disk space, run a virus scan from:<br />

<p>If you do not have antivirus/antispyware software on your machine, you may download Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>

<p>The Windows.old folder has two purposes:<br />
1) Can be used to un-install Windows 7 and return your PC to the previous version of Windows.<br />
2) Contains all your personal data files, documents, pictures. Etc.</p>
<p>If you do not need either of these two options the Windows.old folder can be deleted.</p>
<p>Note: Change Windows Explorer option to see the Windows.old folder: <br />
Click Start and in the 'Search' box enter:&nbsp; "hidden"&nbsp; (without the quotes) <br />
Click the "Show hidden files and folders" option at the top of the list.<br />
In the 'Folder Options' Window:<br />
Click of the 'View' if it is not already selected.<br />
In the 'Advanced settings'&nbsp; list locate 'Hidden files and folders'.<br />
Now click on 'Show hidden files and folders'<br />
Next uncheck the following:&nbsp; <br />
'Hide empty drives in the Computer folder' <br />
'Hide extentions for know file types'<br />
'Hide protected operating system file'</p>
<p>Click the 'Apply' button and the 'OK' button.</p>

            <p>Hello, I'll try again.</p>
<p>Sorry for the mistakes . I'm from Belgium and i will try as good as I can to explain the problem.</p>
<p>I have class by skype with a lady in America, so there are 8 to 12 people in class. Skype always drops off when people are joining class. That does not happen when I skype with one person. Then skypes works very well. This problem started after the update
 in November 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So </p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Skype Version : 8.34.0.81</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution for my problem? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Joseph, </p>
<p>the problem is not solved.</p>
<p>I had class and skype still falled out. Could that be because of the number of persons&nbsp; ( but the others don't have that problem ) or is the free place on my computer not big enough? But i didn't had this probme before the new skype in November. That's the
 strangest thing. On my old tablet, no problem.,</p>
<p>It's a mysterie, isn't it?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Skype reverse charge calling &#35; not working</h2>
                    I am trying to find out how to make a collect call on Skype.&nbsp; According to an online support item, Skype has a reverse charge calling feature via 1-844-759-7363.&nbsp; However, when I called that number, the call would hang up after one ring.&nbsp; Is the number
 obsolete?&nbsp; Is there another number or way to place a free collect call via Skype?

    <title>Screen Flicker&#47;Flash At Boot Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roystreet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Flicker&#47;Flash At Boot Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've recently received my new Surface Pro 3 from Microsoft.&nbsp; One of the first things I did was download all of the required updates from Microsoft.&nbsp; Now that I've done that, when I first turn on my Surface, the screen flashes white for a second or so,
 then shows the word "Surface" as usual. Then as the word "Surface" goes away, the screen flashes white for a second.&nbsp; Then Windows comes up.&nbsp; Windows appears to work just fine, with one thing I'm not sure about.&nbsp; I have 2 users on the machine.&nbsp; Each user has
 a different background at the logon prompt.&nbsp; For a quick second it shows the background picture of the other user &amp; then it shows the right image for the user name that regularly logs in.&nbsp; I understand it may do that if the last time I logged in was using
 the other account.&nbsp; I rarely use that account &amp; it's starting to do it regularly.&nbsp; Not 100% of the time, but getting close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my first &amp; main question is about the screen flashing/flicker.&nbsp; It did not do this before the Windows updates were installed.&nbsp; This happens immediately at boot, so I don't see how this is necessarily a Windows issue (I could be wrong) but I do know one
 of the updates was a firmware one &amp; that could be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; <br />

<p>I have the same issue it was not happening when I first got the device and it was definitely after a a Windows update was done. This definitely doesn't cause any performance issue but it is sort of annoying. Wonder if it's a known issue to the Windows team,
 Surface team and Microsoft itself.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So I have this problem that I think was caused by a firmware update recently. I just purchased my surface pro 3 i7&nbsp;a couple days ago and everything was working fine to start with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing some updates and upgrading to Win 10, I noticed that the screen will flash white very briefly before displaying the "surface" text on boot. I also noticed that when running windows 10, it will do the same thing when waking up from sleep
 mode before displaying the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, when running windows 8.1, it will still flash white on boot, but not when waking up from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not seem to be a very widespread issue apparently since there are not too many threads on this. From what I've read though, its a problem with the Intel HD 5000 driver update that occurred in the firmware update back in May.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the display driver. And I've done a hard rest on the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this, or is Microsoft at least working on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I just went and installed the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest system drivers</a>&nbsp;from Microsoft, and now the white flash is happening when waking from sleep in windows 8.1 too. I had also done this immediately after upgrading to windows 10, which brings me to the conclusion that this bug is unaffected by what version
 of windows is being used.</p>

    <title>Screen Resolution messed up after windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tek77777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Resolution messed up after windows update</h2>
                    I have windows 7 and a couple of weeks ago I installed the Windows updates and it messed up my screen resolution. Now I only have two options for screen resolution: 1024X768 (which kind of works but everything is stretched and normal browser screens don't
 quite fit) and 800X600 (which is awful). This happened before (when I installed windows updates) and I did a system restore and everything returned to normal. I again tried to do a system restore this time but it did not fix. Through various Google options
 it was suggested that I check with the manufacture (Dell) to see if there are any Display Driver updates, but there are none. I also managed to find the display drive on my computer which is Intel(R) HD Graphics and it was a Code 52 (Windows cannot verify
 the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source).
<br />
<br />
I guess my main question is should I uninstall the driver and then reinstall it? (I'm afraid to just experiment with it because I don't want to mess my computer up further) And if I do uninstall it, how do I find it again to install it again or does my computer
 find it automatically? I am not the most computer literate person out there so if you have some solutions to try out please give clear steps!<br />
<br />
Also additionally - I am&nbsp; not sure if these problems are related or not, but my computer also will not go into sleep/hibernate modes. I only have the option to restart it or shut it down. Any suggestions for this issue?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The cause of “<strong>Code 52: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device”</strong> is the installed driver is unsigned or corrupted.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>

<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update stuck on &#35;3 of 13 - restarting doesn&#39;t help&#59; endless loop</h2>
                    Hi. My computer (Windows 7) is installing updates and is stuck (stalled) on # 3 of 13. It ran over 7 hours overnight so even someone with as small a brain as I have can tell something's wrong. I have read other boards but have not been able to find a solution,
 even though it seems like a ton of other people have similar problems, it seems like nobody has the exact same problem.<br />
<br />
So I will re-start the computer, and, upon loading, it will immediately go back to "Installing Update #3 of 13". I have tried to F8 to start the computer in safe mode, but I can't do it.<br />
<br />
So basically I am stuck in an endless loop which is Update #3 of #13. Could someone please point me to a board that has the solution this exact problem? Or if someone could please help me solve it I would sincerely appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!!<br />
<br />

            yea, from what i've read on other boards it seems like the only answer is to boot the computer from the windows disk. since windows was pre-installed on my machine, i don't have a boot disc (or it might be somewhere and i can't find it). it then says go
 to step 2, which as shawnna pointed out, the computer won't boot to safe mode, it immediately goes to the "installing #3 of 13".<br />
<br />
any other suggestions????<br />
<br />
thanks for all those responding. this is a seriously annoying problem. as soon as it's solved and back in the windows updates will be turned off.<br />

<p>I submitted a support request directly with Microsoft and have been told that they would respond within 24 hours... If I hear anything, i'll be happy to share. A bit upset over the entire situation. I work for a software company and if our software is the
 cause of a system stop we tend to it immediately, not make the customer wait 24 hours.

<h2>            Reputation System Issues</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Everyone,</p><p><br /></p><p>I will try to make this brief.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, since December of 2016, my account has been in the "Avoid Me" reputation status. &nbsp;I understand this is due to "bad behavior" as the enforcement team deems it. &nbsp;I admit, whilst playing Forza, there were times I'd be frustrated in League play and shunt someone into a barrier(or similar scenario) and inevitably end up reported for "Unsporting". &nbsp;Now, where the confusion comes in, is that my account never entered the "Needs Work" area of the reputation system. &nbsp;I&nbsp;went directly from "Good Player" to "Avoid&nbsp;Me" with a handful of reports on my account. &nbsp;The plot graph on the enforcement webpage(enforcement.xbox.com/home/reputation) even shows the sudden drop as well, with no plot points in neither the Yellow nor Orange "Needs Work" category. &nbsp;I was also under the impression that a notification would be sent via some form of communication about said "bad behavior"

<h2>            Unable to enable Insight sticky notes option on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: No insights in sticky notes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>I've installed the Anniversary update on my Surface Pro 3. For some reason I can't manage to enable Insights in sticky Notes. I wasn't prompted if i wanted them when i first started the app either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it another limitation for non-US users? My locale is Canada and I've enabled Cortana in English Canadian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>You can clone the installation to the SSD, provided the SSD is large enough to hold the installation to be cloned.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.ssdfreaks.com/content/664/how-to-clone-hdd-to-ssd-with-windows-7s-own-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ssdfreaks.com/content/664/how-to-clone-hdd-to-ssd-with-windows-7s-own-software</a>
 or (much easier) use a trial copy of Acronis True Image Home 2012.</p>
<p>Note that immediately after cloning you must shut down and disconnect the original installation. The disk can be reconnected once the SSD has booted successfully.</p>

    <title>Color calibration seems to be overridden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pikapika677  say:</h3>
<h2>            Color calibration seems to be overridden</h2>
                    I'm having this issue that's really bugging me with the color calibration and Intel's graphic settings. The color on my screen doesn't seem correct, so I used Window's Color Calibration to fix it. Everything looks lovely until I reboot my laptop. When
 that happens, the color goes back to what it was before, and I have to Reload Current Calibrations every time I start up my system. I've looked around online for some solutions, but nothing solved my problem.<br />
<br />
Things I've tried:<br />
• Uninstalling and reinstalling the graphics drivers (twice, and everything is up-to-date from what I know)
<div>• Running <b>msconfig</b>&nbsp;and disabling <b>hkcmd.exe, igfxtray.exe</b>, and <b>
igfxpers.exe</b>&nbsp;from Startup</div>
<div>• Installing Autoruns to disable the <b>Persistence Module</b>&nbsp;that Intel installed on my system</div>
<div>• Opened Advanced Color Management, checked Use My Settings For This Device and Use Windows Display Calibration<br />
<br />
No matter what I try, it seems that Intel just loves to take over Windows' color. My system specs:&nbsp;<a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=YhfMtP2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=YhfMtP2f</a><br />

    <title>How do you completely uninstall a program&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amer-a  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you completely uninstall a program&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded a game (subway surf) and before i could install it, my antivirus, Norton, decided to remove the uninstaller. When i opened the game i saw it's crappy graphics and decided to uninstall it. I tried in the control panel but, as you would expect,
 i got an error message that said i couldn't do it. I deleted all files in Program Files (x86) related to it. i also deleted all it's shortcuts and now it is invisible. However, I know that installing a program makes changes to the registry. Now, I am Relatively
 good with computers but not an expert, and I have never even <i>seen </i>what the registry looks like and I know that the simplest mistake when making changes to it can cause serious damage. I was wondering if whatever the program did to my registry affects
 the system and if i should do anything about it. And if i should, how?<br />
