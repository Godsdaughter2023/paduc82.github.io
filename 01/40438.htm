<h2>            quarantine after deletion</h2>
                    <p><br />
Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your account deleted, is there a quarantine period for the email address that is attached and also the user name, if so how long is this period? Can you please tell me the quarantine for both username and email if they are different, and is the information&nbsp;
 you provided 100% correct.&nbsp; As I would like to open another Skype account with the same email as it's my main one and I'm prepared to wait for the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly.</p>

            So after the 60 days I can then use the same email that was previously associated with the closed account? Is that correct? There is no quarantine period after the 60 days?

<p>are you using an intercooler that you put on top of the 360 slim? it makes the internal fan alter its settings and thereby voids the warranty. that might explain why the fan is going so much faster...</p>

<p>By clicking box , it opens to " End Task " or " Wait till Response " choices.</p>
<p>After awhile it finally works. Seems EXPLORER.EXE is the glitch after an update. Pc works 100% perfect. Only occurs sometimes after the update&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thxs</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia, a volunteer here.
<br />How long have you left the blank screen? I have had the same &amp; waiting 20 minutes at least usually allows the update to fully complete.
<br />If the hard drive light is still lit then I wouldn’t turn the pc off in case of corruption.

            Its happened a few times before. Don't really know when it occurs because updates download during the night and this does NOT happen after every update. Eventually clicking the dialogue box dropdown to " WAIT FOR TASK " , it does then reboot to the desktop
 again.&nbsp;&nbsp; SO MANY DIFFERENT ANSWERS ...<br />

            Yes for me too it doesn’t happen every update just major ones like feature updates.
<br />Next time it happens wait for 20 minutes &amp; if you feel you can’t wait any longer then choose the wait for task.

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to almost every computer I have installed lately. What is Microsoft doing to resolve the "productivity nullifying" updates that have wreaked havoc on the business users of Windows 10? Windows updates have always been hit and miss. But lately,
 they are terrible. they need better QC. I literally have been set back several days these past two weeks due to updates that have made computers either unbootable or unusable. If they (The updates) are not tested properly... keep them behind the gate.&nbsp; &nbsp;I
 am experiencing the black screen as well, and the users are not happy. Thanks Microsoft...... From all of us on the front line. By the way, that was sarcasm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Zach,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had your problem for the longest time. No matter what I did, I was unable to change anything due to the constant restarts immediately after login. It was also on a Dell Inspirion. It seems to be down to the GPU drivers. Thankfully, there is a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was after one of the Blue Screen restarts when I was brought to the login, I pressed the power button in the lower right-hand corner of the login screen and then pressed shut down, not restart. After I left the PC off for about&nbsp;thirty seconds,
 I turned it back on and logged in. I had to do this several times because sometimes it did not work. However, restarting never worked for me, and I couldn't boot into safe mode, so this was the only option for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a black screen that lasted for about two minutes, eventually the Windows desktop came up.&nbsp;Now immediately, right click on the Windows taskbar and open Task Manager. You have a very limited time before another Blue Screen, so quickly kill any AMD services
 because their GPU drivers seem to be causing the issue. There are two AMD services that you have to kill, and one Catalyst Control Center to kill also. Be careful though because these might pop back up again or only one of the three might show up first before
 the rest do. Essentially, keep a constant eye on Task Manager. I had to try this several times because I was to slow, so I recommend to keep trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have those services killed, open Device Manager and manually update your AMD GPU to the latest driver by right clicking the item in Device Manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I changed the GPU driver, I haven't had another Blue Screen. This worked for me after lots of frustration, so I would give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that it works for you because I know the frustration you're experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

            <p>I had the same problem. I did an online search and found a bunch of potential solutions. The one that worked for me is as follows-</p>
<ol>
<li>I booted up windows 10 in the safe mode- held windows sign+R during login</li><li>Went to utilities and uninstalled AMD Driver m265</li><li>Then restarted in regular mode and updated to AMD Driver m270</li></ol>
<p>I have had no problems since then. Wish Microsoft and Dell (Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series 2015) prevent this problem in the first place.</p>

            <p>Hey Jack,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help!! it worked what you said.<br />
</p>
<p>FOR ANYONE ELSE LOOKING FOR HELP:<br />
<br />
the exact problem was CATALYST CONTROL CENTER by AMD (in my case, Dell Inspiron 7548).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, just let windows start and as soon as you see taskbar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right click it and go to Task Manager (and More Details, if not already full view)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then go to Startup Tab and Disable "Catalyst Control Center" and ShutDown (just to make sure settings are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saved before it restarts again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it restarts, simply go to Program and Features and remove AMD Catalyst Control Center.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps others.</p>

<p>Hi fcaranti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to uninstall the old driver and replace it with the correct one for Windows 10, search for Device Manager in the Windows search bar/Cortana.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once there, you should expand graphics adapters, and right click on your GPU. Click update driver, and then click search the web for a driver. Windows will automatically find the correct driver for you on Windows 10. Be patient, as this may take a while.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows should successfully update you to the correct driver where you should be able to restart into the regular Windows desktop without Safe Mode. You shouldn't experience any more Blue Screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It looks like you have issue with recognizing all removal storage devices. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to this question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>I suggest you to run Hardware Troubleshooter and then check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button, then <b>Device Manager</b> in the search box.‌</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Look for the device under
<b>USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller</b>, <b>right click</b> on it and select
<b>Uninstall</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</p>
<p>You may also refer the following article for more information on error codes:</p>

            <p>Imran, thanks a lot for your reply. The bad news is that your suggestions did not work, but here is the detail:</p>
<p>0. Latest change made to the computer was installing a batch of windows updates on 11/17, I did not note any problem since, until a couple of days ago when I needed to use a USB key and found out it did not work.</p>
<p>Method 1: the troubleshooter diagnoses that the Memory Stick does not work and instructs to uninstall it and reboot. Upon rebooting, Windows first shows "Driver being installed" and a little later an error message "Driver could not be installed".</p>
<p>Method 2: I uninstalled the two "Host PCI to USB controllers", rebooted, Windows shows several&nbsp;"Driver being installed" boxes, then a couple of warnings "Driver could not be installed", then ends with&nbsp;a big 6-liner box:</p>
<p>*************************************************</p>
<p>Generic USB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready</p>
<p>Volume ()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed</p>
<p>Generic&nbsp;USB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready</p>
<p>Ricoh Memory Stick Disk Device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed</p>
<p>USB Root Concentrator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ricoh SD/MMC Disk Device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed</p>
<p>**************************************************</p>
<p>And I get the same syndrome as before on the Device Manager, i.e. yellow triangles on anything under disk unit. Back to square 1!</p>
<p>Funny thing (so to speak...) is that when I run NirSoft USB Deview, it sees an USB key when I plug it in (with its S/N !) - but Windows does not see it when I open Computer.</p>
<p>I'm getting crazy... Do you have an idea on what to do next?</p>
<p>Thanks a million!</p>

            <p>Hi Jacques,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reverting back and providing more information on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot into
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced Boot Options</a></b> and disable driver signing checking.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the
 F8 key before Windows starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabling driver signature enforcement has helped a lot of users in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also delete the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry.
</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur
 if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back
 up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Note:</b> If UAC (User Account Control) pops up, please accept it.
</p>
<p>2. Right click “Computer” (the root node) in the left pane, click “Export” under the “File” menu, choose “All” under “Export range”, and select “Desktop” in the
 “Save” in box and type backup in “File Name”. Click “Save”.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Note:</b> The backup file is on the Desktop and named backup.reg. We can simply restore the registry by double-clicking
 the backup.reg file.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>3. Click “Start”, type “regedit” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter again.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>4. Locate the “UpperFilters” value under the following key in the registry:
</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>5. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.</p>
<p>6. Locate the “LowerFilters” value under the same key in the registry:
</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</p>
<p>7. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.</p>

            <p>Hi Imran,</p>
<p>Thank you very much, this seems to be a tough nut to break: </p>
<p>1. Disabling driver signature enforcement does not help, the situation is the same after booting with this option as with standard booting.</p>
<p>2. Looking at the registry, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000} contains only a UpperFilters value (no LowerFilters) with an empty data:</p>
<p>UpperFilters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_MULTI_SZ</p>
<p>I deleted the value but that did not change the situation. I restored it to be on the safe (?)&nbsp;side, tell me if I should delete it permanently.</p>
<p>I feel ashamed of bothering you with this, but do you have any other suggestion I could run?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques</p>
<p>PS I have a sort of Hail Mary Pass idea: Device Management&nbsp;lists 8 devices under the USB&nbsp;bus controller category (2 root USB&nbsp; hub,&nbsp;2 USB host controllers, 2 generic USB Hub,&nbsp;1 composite USB peripheral, 1 Qualcomm Gobi USB controller (that's my wireless WAN
 modem)). Should I uninstall all of them and hope that Windows 7 reinstalls them properly?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Good question to ask Toshiba Support and their forums.&nbsp;Though you should have downloaded<br />
the new driver first (if possible).<br />
<br />
You will need to download it on another computer then copy it to CD, DVD, or USB drives.<br />

<h3> bahrep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchscreen Keyboard does not support shift&#43;arrow keys selection Windows 10 Fall Creators</h2>
                    <p>Updated Surface Pro 3 device to Windows 10 Pro 1709 16299.19 and did a full reset/wipe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Touchscreen keyboard is now unuseable because Shift+Arrow keys do not work as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per the documentation:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Shift with any arrow key</td>
<td>
Select more than one item in a window or on the desktop, or select text in a document</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In my case the caret just shifts to the arrow direction. But selection does not work and makes the tablet unuseable without external keyboard. Accessibility On-Screen Keyboard (osk.exe) does not have this problem, BTW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to me that this problem should affect other devices (just do a quick web search). Here is a recent report with similar symptom&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/36492" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/36492</a><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade causing mousepad and&#47;or pointer to glitch</h2>
                    <p>I just&nbsp;received my new Asus 2 in 1 laptop today, and was happily surprised when I was able to update to Windows 10 right away. After doing so, however, my&nbsp;pointer is completely gone. It was working perfectly fine before the update.&nbsp;I am able to use my touchscreen
 to navigate, but I would be screwed otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enabling Elan through my mouse settings. This caused my pointer to reappear for a short time, but I still could not click anything. It disappeared again after the following attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running a scan for corrupt files. It claimed that some files could not be fixed and my mouse vanished again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any other fixes be offered? I don't believe I am alone in this problem, and calling support results in an hour and a half wait time. I do have a wireless mouse that I have yet to try using, but it won't change the fact that something isn't working.</p>

            <p>Is their ASUS touchpad software in "Programs &amp; Features"? I would go to ASUS Support and download latest touchpad driver for your pc. On my ASUS laptop it is called ASUS Gesture. Uninstall your current touchpad software and install the one from ASUS support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in device manager right click and check for updates online for "mice &amp; other pointing devices-elan input device".</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 scaling issues after April Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem with Windows 10 April Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I launch a fullscreen game with a different resolution than the native screen resolution, windows gets all messy and scaling problems appear here and there. The text in File Explorer sometimes become blurry and smaller, and some icons in the taskbar
 tray become blurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started after updating to April Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be causing it?</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>I'm afraid rolling back to the previous version of Windows 10 is not possible because I am past the 30 days since I installed the update, plus rolling back will be very frustrating to me.</p>

    <title>Why does Windows 7 spin up idle drives&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> droden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 7 spin up idle drives&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have my D drive (which contains no applications) set to idle after 10 minutes. This works correctly. When i do things on the C drive, for instance start-&gt;run-&gt;calc.exe which is located on the C drive Windows feels the need to spin up the D: drive. This
 is really aggravating as the whole UI waits the 10 seconds for the drive to spin up. Is there a way to prevent windows from doing this? Again, no programs are referencing or running off the D: drive and it sits idle until I run something on the C: drive.</p>

<p>I found this question from searching google as I have the exact same problem as original poster.<br />
</p>
<p>Your rant about raid has no relevance to his issue. What DRoden has done with his setup is very logical.</p>
<p>1. Raid 0 of his ssd's makes perfect sense as some capacities are more than twice the price as an ssd with half that capacity. I have read a lot about how much better scaling raid 0 with&nbsp;ssd's are than hdd's, almost 100% scaling and the power consumption
 is low, unlike with hdds which also have to spin up and sync together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Raid&nbsp;1 hdd's for a backup location is sensible, as the extra power consumption is minable as they will&nbsp;only be&nbsp;required to spin up on request of the backup software&nbsp;- what if your back up drive fails? You would loose all versions of your backups and loose
 a lot of data in some cases where the backup location is not fault tolerant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DRoden good on you, I would have the same setup as you if I had 2 ssd's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I myself am&nbsp;going to&nbsp;use backup of my storage drives, originally in raid 1, as I only wanted fault tolerance, but now want to save power consumption. The main reason I broke my raid 1 was because randomly all 4 of my storage drives spin up when they shouldn't,
 sometimes haulting my general tasking until they have all spun up. I also only want 1 drive spinning for when i'm opening something (only reading, not writing) on that drive.</p>
<p>They&nbsp;were actually 2x1.5TB software mirror, 2x2TB software mirror. I had this problem with my SSD boot drive in AHCI mode, and now again in RAID mode, in bios (it's not "RAID'ed" with another drive).</p>
<p>I still have the problem after breaking mirrors, all 4 spin up, even the 2 empty ones as there were problems with my backup software, which is not currently installed as I have just done a dresh install of Windows 7 64-bit Pro. This shouldn't happen, not
 by default. Microsoft are wasting electricity on my computer, and stopping me in my train of though, as my multitasking is no longer fluid (I am waiting, maybe 10 seconds? To do a simple operation on an ssd, because my hdd's as spining up?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW I have hard drives to turn off 1 minute idle, this is why it's so prominant to me. Maybe most people leave it at the default 20 minutes, which is appauling for people who have multiple Hard Disk Drives.</p>

            Hi INFE
<br />
<br />Your best option is to try to run the reset operation again ans see if that completes correctly this time around, if not, your Recovery Image is corrupt and your best option is to re-install Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />1
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />2
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi ImNotFuckingElf 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since you have already reset your PC, you can try reset again using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer if you can't do this on your existing computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a> 
<br />
<br />If reset doesn't work - You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            It seems to indicate that you’re not connected to the internet either via wifi or Ethernet, is this the case?
<br />What happens if you choose next to connect to wifi?

    <title>Current XBOX Service Outage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sql medic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Current XBOX Service Outage</h2>
                    <p>We currently have 2 xbox consoles and two Gold Memberships for many years now.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>All of our xbox games are not accessible as they were purchased online and there is currently a service outage related to that.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br /></p><p>The web site lists this as a limited service outage and states ...</p>

<p>"We believe we have identified the issue causing some members to have problems finding previously-purchased content or purchasing new content. Thanks for your patience as the team works to resolve the issue." 2/1/2018</p>

<p><br /></p><p>I can see my content, I cannot launch any of it. I have restarted, reinstalled games and still it is an issue.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>The last update from you folks about this service outage was 2 days ago?!?&nbsp;</p>

<p><br /></p><p>I get that things may break from time to time but the way that this outage is being managed is unacceptable.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>As a former MS employee this is very disappointing, we used to be able to keep customers up to date and provide some form of feedback and ETR when issues arose. Even when the entire data center went down in B11, (SAP, FEEDSTORE etc), it did not take two days to recover from it.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Maybe you need different architects there designing these systems so they are at least fault tolerant.</p>

<p>This total lack of communication and mangement of this issue just shows how little you care for the opinions and needs of your customers, (me), these days.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Might be time to start looking at a Playstation or get a Steam Console, maybe they will value me as a paying customer?</p>

<p>BTW, I have Steam on my PC and when their service or the internet is down; I still have access to the content that I have purchased from them. Seems like that should have been a pretty common sense use case and design item for you folks.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Lastly, providing feedback to MS used to be fairly simple and was valued by the organization. Having to wait 45 minutes for a chat window instead of just being able to add these comments to a form isn't doing anything to improve my mood about this whole experience.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying to fix this issue for the last few days with no success. So my disk usage in task manager is always at 100% even if all the services are using about 2mb/s (combined) - this makes no sense to me at all, how can it be at 100% if nothing is
 happening? My laptop is running stupidly slow at the moment due to all this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of fixes I have tried - </p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling Superfetch, BITS &amp; Windows Search</li><li>Turning off windows notifications</li><li>Changing my virtual RAM (pagefile)<br />
</li><li>Disabled Cotana </li><li>Defrag</li><li>Tried uninstalling Bitdefender to see if anything changed (it didnt)</li><li>Checked HDD health using HDSentinal - Everything was fine<br />
</li><li>Done a full scan using Bitdefender (took 6 hours) - Nothing was found<br />
</li><li>Done a scan using IOBit Malware Fighter - Nothing was found </li></ul>
<p>Laptop Specs - Acer V3-571G-73638G1, Quad Core i7, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be great!</p>

            Hi Robyn.<br />
<br />
 that the driver cannot load, or that something is preventing the driver from loading.&nbsp; The drive has the yellow triangle symbol beside it in device manager.&nbsp; I have un-installed the driver, and attempted to re-install several times, which fails.&nbsp; Rolling back
 the driver also fails.&nbsp; I've also tried to reinstall the driver from the HP "Software Pack."&nbsp; No luck there, either.<br />
<br />
The computer is an HP Pavilion dv6000, running 32 bit Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; All patches, service packs, and upgrades are in place, and I did everything you mentioned in your post above.&nbsp; I have also ran hardware diagnostics (SiSoft Sandra) to make sure that
 everything is ok.&nbsp; All hardware reports as functional, and the computer is working perfectly in all other respects.<br />
<br />
I also took my old bootable XP installation DVD, and booted from the DVD to see if it was actually the hardware.&nbsp; The disk booted just fine and attempted to install XP without any difficulty, so I know that the drive itself is working properly.&nbsp; It seems that
</span></span><span><span>Vista can actually see the drive, but cannot use it, and will not allow me to update the drivers, either from HP or from Microsoft.&nbsp; Attempting to update the driver from Device Manager
 gives me the notice that the most up to date driver is already installed.&nbsp; Looking at properties for the drive shows an error 39, and "Check For A Solution" puts the machine into a very long search online.&nbsp; I gave up after 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            I have an HP G60-243CL purchased from Costco. My DVD drive is a Slimtype DVD A DS8A2L-A ATA device. Device properties, in Device Manager, is reporting "This device cannot start. (Code 10)." The computer seems to be unable to communicate with the device
 while operating Windows Vista, as it can neither read nor burn any disk; However, a hardware malfunction is unlikely as the drive is able to read and communicate with computer if a boot CD is used to start computer.
<div><br />
<div>I have checked for updated drivers, and my drivers are the most up to date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have manually uninstalled drivers and rebooted, at which juncture the drives are reinstalled with no difference in condition.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have, as mentioned, booted from a CD which resulted in proof of hardware functionality.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have run the Microsoft Fix It, automatic error detection and problem resolution device, several times. It does find the error, uninstalls the drivers, reinstalls them and finds that the problem still exists.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have attempted to teach myself the intricacies of editing the system registry, however I am uncomfortable continuing on this path, as my proficiency in this area is lacking, and I don't want to complicate matters if that step is unnecessary.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help would be&nbsp;appreciated, and&nbsp;successful&nbsp;advice invaluable. Thank you for taking the time,</div>

<p>Wellberrics, as vezes ocorre devido a velocidade da conexão, normalmente jogando com "gringos" tem mais chance por possuem uma conexão bem melhor, mas se está ocorrendo em todo jogo, veja se quando joga não ta usando a conexão simultânea com um pc por exemplo,
 se o pc estiver baixando algo pode interferir e deixar lento a conexão do xbox o causando essas quedas, mas não só baixando, mas até mesmo se no pc alguém estiver vendo videos e coisas assim.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 hard freezing, requires hard shut down and reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> druscylla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 hard freezing, requires hard shut down and reboot</h2>
                    <p>So this is a common issue with Windows 10 after the anniversary update and it honestly has me ready to totally ditch Windows. I have tried about every single tiny thing I possibly can/have seen worked for others/was suggested by Microsoft and NOTHING works.
 I'm severely frustrated and totally furious because the freezing is interrupting my work, my leisure time and I've had it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can be doing anything and it will hard freeze. Sometimes after a couple hours, sometimes after 6 hours...but it will freeze. I play games competitively for money and use my computer for other work as well and if it freezes up in the middle of either of
 these activities, it compromises my livelihood. I've replaced my PSU. I've updated my drivers. I've had people see my error logs which show absolutely nothing that is contributing to this freeze. I've replaced cables. I've disabled all the sleep, hibernate,
 fast start-up, etc. I've tried disabling any extraneous audio drivers. I've scanned Windows for corrupt files. I've tried seeking updates that are supposed to fix this (KB31769....) it won't install claiming I already have it. I'm planning on replacing my
 hard drive - even though this one is fine - and I'm really thinking hard if I want to even use Windows as it's obviously a very unstable OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm losing my mind because the only thing I can do is boot up, do work or stream for 45 min, shut down, restart, repeat. This is no way to work. I want this fixed.

            <p>I have indeed tried this to no avail. Repair finds nothing wrong. Trying to use repair only gets it stuck in an infinite loop that will last time I tried this resulted in repeated disk read errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oftentimes, I have to reboot the thing and that takes a long time with my disk usage at 100% and Windows systems at the top of the list. This is the most unstable thing. I am currently using my computer for about an hour, restarting and then resuming work.
 Meaning I'm not working at all because who wants to constantly have interruptions? I am wishing I had a Mac at this point.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have a Microsoft guy on remote yesterday. He updated drivers from Windows (which I then had to fix by actually downloading them from the direct sources) and disabled start-up programs to make it boot faster. I have been rebooting it hourly anyway because
 I'm paranoid by this point. After he restarted my computer, he gave me a reconnect link to continue working with me but it only connected me to someone else who didn't seem to know or care about anything. Overall, I am extremely displeased with Windows as
 a whole.</p>

<p><span>Hi Annette,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I checked it again and found that it is a normal behavior, and currently it</span>’s not feasible to change the setting in our current channel (latest for now: 1709 8528.2147).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could go <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 feedback</a> to vote or post your comments. Related team is actively monitoring this forum. Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a best effort, we also can switch channel to Deferred Channel to get the feature back. Here is an article including the steps to switch it:

            Please define "won't work". Do you mean that the key isn't accepted when you do a clean install or that it is accepted but then you can't activate it?

    <title>How can I retrieve the current media playlist index in a Windows Media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unifab  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I retrieve the current media playlist index in a Windows Media Player embedded in html in Internet Explorer using jscript&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I want to retrieve what is the index in the playlist for the current media playing in WMP.</p>
<p>I know I can select the playlist item to play by using something like:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Player.currentPlaylist.Item(thisItem)</em></p>
<p>Is there a way to obtain the value of the index? let's say I let the WMP play continuously and I want to know not the name of the song that is playing, but just the index of the item that is playing inside the playlist.</p>
<p>So if I have a playlist that has: "song 1", "song 2", "song 3" &nbsp;and "song 1" is playing, I want to find a code that would return 0, because song 1 is the item with index 0 in my playlist.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Any help would be&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;appreciated.&nbsp;</span></p>
