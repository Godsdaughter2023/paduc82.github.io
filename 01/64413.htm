<h2>            Xbox One S won&#39;t connect to WiFi</h2>
                    <p>Our Xbox has been connected to my WiFi network the last year or so but now suddenly cannot connect. Everything else in my house can...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried power cycling both router / gateway (Sky Hub) and Xbox, I've cleared the MAC, I've checked my router isn't filtering MACs, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can 'see' my network but won't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? My kids won't be happy if I factory-reset and lose save games, etc., if there's another way to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Usually power cycling my console does the trick and if you are not using any third party devices that may be giving interference, the factory reset would be the best way to proceed :( But
 don't worry, all the saves from the games are stored in the cloud and if you have an external storage your games will be there when the reset finishes&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br />

<h2>            Down arrow keys and space bar issues</h2>
                    About a week or two, my down and left and right arrow keys and space bar won't work after I turn on my computer, and then maybe 2 or 3 minutes later suddenly they'll work fine. Is this a key board lag? A problem with the keyboard? I've had this laptop
 for maybe about 4 years give or take.&nbsp;

You have the right to have an attorney present now and during any future questioning.<br />
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you free of charge if you wish.”<br />
((Note: If the subject requests anything whitin the rights, IGNORE them. Reading them their rights is only for RP purposes seeing how no convictions will be made due to missing not having a local Judicial system))<br />

“You have the right to remain silent.<br />
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.<br />
You have the right to have an attorney present now and during any future questioning.<br />
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you free of charge if you wish.”<br />
((Note: If the subject requests anything whitin the rights, IGNORE them. Reading them their rights is only for RP purposes seeing how no convictions will be made due to missing not having a local Judicial system))<br />
<br />
3.You must also ask for "ID" from the suspect. If the suspect cannot provide suitable identification, then this is seen as faliure to provide ID, and is a chargeable offence.(See above for guidelines)<br />
<br />

<br />
6. Suspect is handed over to the station/prison guard and will serve their sentence or pay the fine/ticket.<br />

<br />
Force Matrix<br />
<br />
the force matrix simply means the amount of equal force used upon a suspect whom is being arrest or secured. Please follow the list of examples that are given below.<br />
<br />
Force Level 1<br />
- Suspect may be verbally assaulting you or others<br />
- Suspect starts to show aggression in his tone of speaking<br />
- Suspect may be taunting you, or using foul language<br />
<br />
Your Actions:<br />
At this point in time you are not authorized to use any physical means of force at all. You may issue verbal warnings at this point in an attempt to calm down the suspect. No hands on or support equipment required.<br />
<br />
Force Level 2<br />
- Suspect has committed a crime<br />
- Suspect is disobeying direct orders from a LEO<br />
- Suspect is starting to hint at violent actions<br />
- Suspect is starting to make aggressive movements with his body<br />
- Suspect may seem to be preparing for a physical engagement<br />
- Suspect is increasingly getting worse with his aggression in his tone against you, or others<br />
- Suspect is showing disrespect against you or another person<br />
<br />
Your Actions:<br />
At this point in time you are not authorized to use any secondary equipment. Call for assistance using a Code 2 Backup request, and move to a hands on approach of trying to escort the person from the situation or away from potential victims using voice commands
 and light gestures. ((* Jesse Ventura gently pushes the man in the other direction)).<br />
<br />
Force Level 3<br />
- Suspect has committed a crime<br />
- Suspect may be using physical contact against you or another person<br />

<br />
Your Actions:<br />
At this time you are only allowed to only use a tazer* to detain the suspect. You are to call in for code three backup from other Troopers at this time. Under no circumstances should you withdraw your firearm unless the situation reaches force level 4 for a
 serious **** or crime.<br />
<br />

- Suspect is assaulting another person with a vehicle<br />
- Suspect has placed your life or another persons life in danger<br />
- Suspect is seriously assaulting another person ((causing the person or you to be on low health))<br />
<br />
Your Actions:<br />
<br />
At this point and time we observe that the suspect is possibly threatening another human life. At this point and time you are allowed to upholster your firearm and take aim on the suspect. Under no means should you ever fire unless the force level reaches 5.
 If you warn someone to put away/drop a firearm and they do not comply, after the fifth warning you are expected to use your own judgment on how to handle the situation.<br />
<br />
Force Level 5<br />
- Suspect has done or is committing a serious felony crime<br />
-Suspect is in the act of seriously assaulting you or another person to near death<br />

- Suspect may be in a car attempting to hit you or other civilians<br />
- Suspect is fleeing in a vehicle after three warnings have been issued<br />
- Suspect has a hostage<br />
<br />
Your Actions:<br />
At this point you are allowed to open fire at the suspect and shoot to kill. You are to do your best to avoid these situations but if they occur authorized to use deadly force but if is only if necessary there will also be a criminal record system being manually
 ran by the police .once criminals have escaped from the police if wont be over untill the criminal is arrested or killed also when civilians spwan they get one free car to steal any other car after that point they take is considered a crime unless bougth from

<h2>            Resizing Pictures &#38; Printing</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center">Well. I need to do a school project which is due Thursday and the only thing I need to do is print out these really small pictures. I do not have word, because I can not afford it right now. I also tried to use google docs but it
 won't let me put a picture on there so that it out. I was wondering if there were any alternatives to use to print it out&nbsp;so if anyone could tell me that would be great. Also, if there aren't any alternatives, is there anyway I could resize a picture and just
 print it out from the photo album thing, cause I don't know how to resize images. Thanks xoxo, Taylor.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 problems with web page scrolling</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just bought this computer that came with Windows 8. The computer is a HP Envy dv6 quad edition. I primarily use Internet Explorer 8. The problem is whenever I go to browse a page, the page will not scroll down. I have tried different pages such as Facebook,
 YouTube, MSN, etc... I have tried a different browser also (Google Chrome and Firefox) and the problem still remains. Something leads me to believe that the problem is Windows 8 since I have never had this problem with any other operating system. I have looked
 up different forums to see if there is any other problems such as mine, but have had no luck finding anything. I am looking to see if it is Windows 8 or just my computer. The computer itself is fine. Everything is fine except web browsing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            Tadasha,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the reply. I have tried all of the methods listed and the problem still remains. I have found out that I have to minimize the page then open it back up in order for it to work. I do not know if that helps out or anything. My mouse model is
 a Synaptics SMBus TouchPad. I have tried a different mouse that connected via USB port. I have not had problems with the touch pad or the mouse with other applications so far. But like I said, I have to minimize the page in order to fix the problem. I do not
 mind doing this, however, I would like to see if there is anything else I can do in order to fix this problem so I do not have to keep minimizing and reopening pages.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi NathanielSobetsky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to log in to safe mode with networking and check.</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Boot the laptop in “Safe mode with networking” and then check how it works.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would like you to go through the article and log in to safe mode with networking. Here is the link for your reference.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is working fine then go to step 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Step 2: Try to install in Clean boot state:
</span></u></b></p>
<p><b><u><span>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot:</span></b><span> To help troubleshoot error messages and other
 issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<b>clean boot</b>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>f) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>a.
</span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the
<b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click
<b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the
<b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Enable half of the Startup items
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem,
 repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem,
 repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be
 resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps
 to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            This is not a problem with the mouse or touchpad.&nbsp; It is a problem with the scroll bar to the right of the screen in Windows 8.&nbsp; When you hit the down arrow on the scroll bar in both Firefox and Google Chrome nothing happens.&nbsp; It simply doesn't work.&nbsp;
 It does work, however, with IE.

            <p>I hope I am not going to be accused of being rude, but I am beginning to think that Windows is becoming too big and complicated for even Microsoft support to handle. The problem is they are breaking things that worked worked perfectly before. Some of these
 problems, like this one, are becoming so frustrating that it's rendering the OS useless at times.</p>
<p>The kind of solutions being suggested are so complicated that I don't know how they expect old people or computer illiterate people to fix by themselves unless it's just a ploy to make some people very rich by being paid to fix issues that Microsoft should
 be able to fix. I am not sure how Microsoft tested these panels that refuse to scale down. My display resolution is at it's maximum at 1920x1080, but you recommend the to set to 1920x1440 (not physically possible ... unless I throw away my new monitor and
 buy another new one. How many people are going to be able to afford that?), so it's difficult to move the window panels to get to the confirmation buttons which are usually hidden beyond the bottom of the screen. The only option I have is to cancel the window
 OR to just press the return key and pray. The unfortunate thing is that some of the other options are also hidden. Why not just reduce the size of the panels or make them wider?</p>
<p>Chrome used to suffer from these problems when it started and now it appears Windows is going the same route. Please copy only the best bits.</p>
<p>You can hide this post if you like, but please have the sense of decency to addressing these points.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, web pages don't scroll / computer crashes. Will try these fixes - but really why should I have to? Microsoft should ensure such basic functions work without a problem. Its a fairly basic requirement.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem when I visit some sites.Works perfectly with all other windows systems and IOS but won't budge on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>ive tried with a mouse and also using my finger as a pointer.</p>
<p>Laptop is new and all updates installed.Tab site asks you to download 1 programme so it runs correctly.Think it was shockwave.Havent touched any other software.Is there a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>MSN site appears to run fine but the Tab site doesn't but runs perfectly with every other software system.</p>
<p>Could shockwaves be causing this?</p>

<p>works is when it quits scrolling down the page. I go to the tools and adjust the zoom and its works for a short time and then stops again until I re adjust the zoom.</p>

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t go to sleep mode if I choose to turn off screen first</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm here on a fresh install and fully updated version of Win10. All drivers updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens that if I choose to to turn off screen (let's say, 1 minute) before going into sleep mode (let's say 2 minutes), the PC won't enter sleep mode. Can't understand why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a normal behavior... Already did the utmost efforts to fix the problem, with no luck: we are talking here about entering into OS troubleshooting, setting the power&amp;sleep in many different ways, reset to defaults, CMD lines like "powercfg -requests" to
 check if there's something going on (there's nothing), etc. Like this, the energy consumption is very high because it forces all my 3 screens to be ON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile I tackled the situation with choosing Turn Off Screen to null (never). And Sleep for 1 minute, and like that the PC goes into sleep mode. However, I don't want it to be like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts about this?</p>

<p>Hello azorybbm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to better assist you with your concern, please confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is running on build 1803, some users had observed that when Microsoft Edge is open or running in the background; it somehow prevents the screen from turning off or entering sleep mode. Also, try unplugging any USB peripheral devices and
 check if the same behavior occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try performing the steps suggested by<strong> Andre Da Costa</strong> in this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/update-win-10-to-1803-monitor-stays-on-no-sleep/10a50f90-a05b-41fd-9fab-34549a45cbbf">thread</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Melchizedek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, already did all the stated on Andre da Costa post. No luck.</p>
<p>Have tried many different approaches as well. Drivers rolling back, etc. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running 1803 build 17134.112</p>
<p>PC components are new. I'm on a X299...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I choose to turn off monitor, the screen goes blue on the main display (but not blue from crash) :) ... and doesn't enter sleep mode.</p>
<p>On "account settings" I chose to never ask for a password returning from sleeping. Could be that, but it seems it doesn't work the way around the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected 2 of the monitors and left only the main one. Doesn't work as well.</p>
<p>Quite messy problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Edge suggestion I have it uninstalled. It's not running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already tried sfc /scannow fro example ... I'm out of ideas here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me and letting me know the additional steps you've performed. Let's try to further troubleshoot the said issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Configure Windows Update Services setting</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>sevices.msc</strong></em> and press
<em><strong>Enter</strong></em>.</p>
<p>2. Locate <em><strong>Windows Update</strong></em> services, then right-click on it and select
<strong><em>Properties</em></strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on <em><strong>Stop </strong></em>to stop the services from running and change the
<strong><em>Startup type</em></strong> to <strong>Manual </strong>from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>4. Click <em><strong>OK </strong></em>to save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Disable Hybrid sleep</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Launch <em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em>, click on <em><strong>Hardware and Sound</strong></em>.</p>
<p>2. Select <em><strong>Power Options</strong></em>, click <strong><em>Change plan settings</em></strong> for the power plan that is selected.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong><em>Change advanced power settings</em></strong>, then expand
<strong><em>Sleep</em></strong>.</p>
<p>4. Expand <strong><em>Allow hybrid sleep</em></strong>, then select <em><strong>Off
</strong></em>for <em><strong>On battery</strong></em> and <em><strong>Plugged in</strong></em>.</p>
<p>5. Click <em><strong>OK </strong></em>to save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest to generate a power report, refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Type in <strong><em>CMD </em></strong>in <strong><em>Start</em></strong>, then right-click on select
<em><strong>Run as Administrator.</strong></em></p>
<p>2. Type in the command below in the Command Prompt:</p>
<p><strong><em>exe /energy</em></strong></p>
<p>3. Look at the errors section. You'd be able to view the report by navigating to this directory:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32 </p>
<p>4. Open the <strong>energy-report.html </strong>file and check the "<em>The device or driver has made a request to prevent the system from automatically entering sleep".
</em>It will show what causes your device not to enter sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me know. Let's try using a different command and check if you can generate a report from which driver/application prevents your PC from going into Sleep mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Type in <strong><em>CMD </em></strong>in <strong><em>Start</em></strong>, then right-click on select
<em><strong>Run as Administrator.</strong></em></p>
<p>2. Type in the command below in the Command Prompt:</p>
<p><em><strong>POWERCFG /energy</strong></em></p>

<p>C:\Windows\System32 </p>
<p>4. Open the <strong>energy-report.html </strong>file and check the "<em>The device or driver has made a request to prevent the system from automatically entering sleep".
</em>It will show what causes your device not to enter sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, uninstalling and reinstalling your display adapters driver may resolve the said sleep mode issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong>, then type in <em><strong>devmgmt.msc.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>2. On the Device Manager window, expand the <strong><em>Display adapter </em>
</strong>category<strong><em>.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. <strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong> your display adapters driver.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Reboot your computer </span><span><span>and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Will keep an eye out for your response.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Melchizedek,<br />
<br />
You can check report file here: <a href="http://www.brunomatos.pt/WIN10/energy-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="ENERGY REPORT">
LINK</a><br />
<br />
"High Power Profile" is in use, but settings remain the same as stated above: 1 minute to screen to go off; 2 minutes to sleep; and don't ask for sign-in credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated Win10 last night (cumulative update), and went for installing latest Nvidia graphics now. I'm pleased to announce that there was somewhat of an improvement from our last chat, since I updated the latest drivers. But not satisfying. As follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Before</strong>, the "Turn Off Screen" and "Sleep" enabled, the system wouldn't "Turn Off Screen". And wouldn't "Sleep".</p>
<p><strong>Now&nbsp;</strong>with the same settings as before and now updated, the system still won't turn off screens but the main display enters Slideshow mode, which is somewhat of an improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the report file, "wireless card" and "second Ethernet card" I don't use them although drivers are updated etc - so they are disabled in Device Manager ... And there is plenty of other information at the file, as you can check it. There are some errors
 about USB ports, but reports says it won't prevent computer to go to "Sleep".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resuming, all is about the same, with the improvement that now computer enters slideshow mode in primary display but still doesn't enter sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope report helps breaking some solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bruno</p>

</p><p>I solved out this issue. All is correct now with a new fresh install of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have no clue about what happened before, maybe because I upgraded from Windows 7. Or because the first installation was made normally without UEFI and after it I turned it into UEFI.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to activate PNRP protocol on Windows 7 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeromeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to activate PNRP protocol on Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows 7 Pro 64bits and my computer belongs to a domain. When I try to activate the service 'Peer Networking Identity Manager', I get a error message :
<br />
<br />
"Windows could not start the Peer Name Resolution Protocol service on Local Computer.<br />
<br />
Error 5: Access is denied."<br />
<br />
If I've or well understood, it's impossible to use this protocol if my computer belongs to a domain ? I'm really interested to use this protocol on a .NET application (chat).<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Jérôme<br />

<p>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your
 question in the TechNet Windows 7 Networking forum. </p>

 to&nbsp;try &amp; get device which has full built-in support for Windows Hello&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See my xen osn - reply to Jens-A's post on November 1, 2016 <br />
</p>
<p>For Windows Hello to be used - one requires any one of these types of devices&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Windows 10 (x64) Tablet w/ built-in Windows Hello features such as my Dell Inspiron 24-7459 which I use<br />
b) Windows 10 (x64) 2-In-One Tablet w/out any built-in Windows Hello facility like my Dell XPS One 2720 - so possibly you'll need to order either a HP/Lenovo PC device which includes this feature!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have any current device which supports Windows Hello then should you require it - you'll then need to get hold of any suitable Windows Hello RealSense camera such as the Creative BlasterX Senz3D – Web Camera or other PC device should you wish
 to go down this route, or just wait until you can purchase an alternative device which includes the Windows Hello feature!</p>

Designed to work with Microsoft® Windows Hello and Cortana®<br />
Windows 10 now supports signing-in using facial recognition with the Windows Hello. With the Creative BlasterX Senz3D camera and its highly accurate 3D facial recognition capability, it allows the operating system to even differentiate between the faces of
 identical twins. Windows 10 also supports Cortana, a new voice-activated personal assistant that helps users find things on their PC, manage their calendar, track packages, find files, and chat with them -- with its beamforming microphone array, Creative BlasterX
 Senz3D is the perfect companion product for crystal clear noise reduction-enabled voice pick-up.<br />

<h2>            Edge Does Not Connect To Any Web Site</h2>
                    <p>I updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10. It took me 21 hours. Plus, I had to get a new mouse/keyboard, because Microsoft stopped supporting their own, just like they did with the fingerprint reader.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I see that the new Edge browser never connects to anything online. I already cleaned the browsing history and at the moment I am running sfc /scannow. Edge not working would still be ok; I can and I do use Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, every time I click a link in MS Outlook, I get the program selection dialogue:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">How do you want to open this?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Keep using this app</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">----------------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Internet Explorer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Featured in Windows 10</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">----------------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Microsoft Edge</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">[ ] Always use this app</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did Microsoft do it on purpose? Is it another promising software title included in another Windows, for free, that has never been intended to function? This time, at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 7 and its Task Scheduler, I couldn't stop wondering how it was possible to fail to launch a program at a certain moment. "The user sets an alarm clock and asks the computer to double-click on an icon, and the computer fails".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's corruption taken to the next level. Microsoft make the governments look like a Cinderella.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>In order to assist you better, I need some more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>2. Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? Is it Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>3. What's the exact error message that you receive when accessing the webpages through the browsers?</p>
<p>4. Are you able to access Windows Store without any internet connection issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be Network Driver related. Hence, I suggest that you update the Network drivers through the Device Manager.
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>In case you do not find any Windows 10 related drivers in the manufacturer's website, you may download the Windows 8.1/Windows 7 drivers and install them in compatibility mode.

            <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are receiving error while installing Java and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to any third party software conflict. hence, as of&nbsp; now, I would request you to place the computer in clean boot state and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 with SSD, freeze&#47;slow performance after couple of minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a HP Probook 450 G0, a pretty old laptop, but I've added more ram and a SSD to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My config is:</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Operating System: Windows 10 Education 64-bit (10.0, Build 17134) (17134.rs4_release.180410-1804)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Language: English (Regional Setting: English)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System Manufacturer: Hewlett-Packard<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System Model: HP ProBook 450 G0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BIOS: 68IRF Ver. F.66 (type: UEFI)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3230M CPU @ 2.60GHz (4 CPUs), ~2.6GHz<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Memory: 8192MB RAM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Available OS Memory: 8042MB RAM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Page File: 3043MB used, 6918MB available
<p>
</p><p>I've got an integraded graphics as well as a dedicated one:</p>
<p>Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 +&nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 8600/8700M (8750M) to be precise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my SSD is a 120GB one that got a pretty good score on a SSD Benchmark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, everything works great, moving great, no lags, excelent, except, after couple of minutes of inactivity ( going for a snack for example ) my laptop turns into a laggy/freeze/low performance mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't really understand how this happend.</p>
<p>I've tried a lot of fixes from SSD freeze/Windows 10 topics, TRIM is already activated, BIOS is updated and AHCI is set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm coming after a clean install of Windows 10 Education, and it's really annoying that after minutes of inactivity I need to restart the machine in order to have it working corectly again.</p>
<p>It isn't too hot, it doesn't depend on how long I keep it turned on, even If I boot it now and leave it for few minutes it still freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What may cause this? Do you have any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />

<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Compare the install you did with the gold-standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<h3> vjrise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update stuck for Division 2</h2>
                    <p>My game update for the division 2 has been stuck at 12.2% for ages, it says updating, but there is no Internet speed shown and nothing is progressing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried hard reseting, clearing the mac address, deleting saved games and such, but nothing has worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought the game and haven't even played it yet, if I have to uninstall and reinstall it will take a week, because of slow rural Internet, and If I have to wait, I am not going to touch this game for months because I'm pissed.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Tablet PC screen orientation doesn&#39;t work anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alikat871  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet PC screen orientation doesn&#39;t work anymore</h2>
                    
<p>My HP Pavillion tx2000 used to automatically rotate the screen orientation whenever I engage the tablet function and I could press the "rotate" button to change the screen orientation. &nbsp;But for some reason, the screen does not automatically change anymore
 when I turn and close the lid and the tablet buttons are no longer responsive (none of them are, not even the dvd button or "stop", "play" etc.). &nbsp;So the only way I can change the screen orientation is to manually do it through the Mobility Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer automatically downloads and installs any updates and the device manager says all drivers are up to date and functioning properly. &nbsp;I've already tried to fix the settings through the control panel. &nbsp; Any information on how to troubleshoot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1. I suggest you to update drivers for your Display adapter and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Some users have had this help with the tablet rotation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Next, try and download the HP Quick Launch buttons software: This is for Windows Vista. You may need to contact HP to see if there is a version for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01492489&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=3665126&amp;os=4062&amp;rule=37488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01492489&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=3665126&amp;os=4062&amp;rule=37488</span></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>3. If not, try clean boot and see if anything is conflicting with the Tablet PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program
 manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></p>

</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</span></span></p>
<p><span>4. If not help, then suggest they post in the HP support Forums.</span></p>

    <title>Skype keeps randomly crashing during calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreas rsheriff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype keeps randomly crashing during calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>During calls with my daughter my Skype keeps randomly crashing without notice or error.&nbsp; This just stated happening within the past few weeks.&nbsp; I don't know if it's a Windows or nVidia driver update, or other reasons, but it's getting really annoying.&nbsp; Below
 find the WER entry and a hyperlink to the entire DxDiag.txt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I noticed that the crash happens in the DLL dxgi.dll.&nbsp; On the internet, I found that this file is responsible for the DirectX graphical interface.&nbsp; So, something happened with either Windows update, nVidia driver update, Skype update, or the dxgi.dll file
 why Skype keeps crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help anyone can render would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Why do I get a server busy message when XP starts up&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pilotjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I get a server busy message when XP starts up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I start up XP I get a little dialogue box saying Server busy even though I don't have a server. It says the action cannot be completed because the other programme is busy and gives the option to switch to the busy programme or retry and eventually
 disappears of its own accord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What gives?</p>

            <p>Hi PilotJohn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to&nbsp;Debleena's post, Can you please tell us more on your problem. Do you get "Server busy" message as soon as you login to computer or when you start any application? Also please check your startup folder located at Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Startup,
 to find what all applications are starting when your&nbsp;profile loads and try removing the one your dont want. You can post back the name of programs listed under start folder if you are not sure what to remove.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
