<h2>            Windows 10 Performing slow without using too much resources</h2>
                    Didn't&nbsp; saw or missed a question in regard to this problem (sorry if already are a similar question): After a while using the computer it starts to get slower and slower to the point of becoming unusable, but the funny thing is is that the resources are
 at a reasonable rate: CPU 10-15%, RAM 30-50%, Disk 12-20% -- using Firefox plus of couple of apps. The computer is not hot, the HDD isn't full or fragmented, I don't play games or use any "heavy"apps; I scanned for viruses and nothing, there's no disk error,
 perfmon /rel was OK. I really don't know what is happening, last month was great, now this month is not, really not.

            <p>A couple of easy things to rule out first:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; More than one firewall installed and activated.&nbsp; Check your Action Center under "View installed firewall apps."</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Conflicting security programs.&nbsp; Too many programs using real-time protection.</p>

            No firewall other than Windows Firewall; no realtime security other than Windows Defender; no problems with the network adapter.

More suggestions are welcome.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>You scanned with Windows Defender?&nbsp; Can you use something like Malwarebytes free version, as that can pick up adware/PUP that Defender misses.&nbsp; If using this, you go to Settings, and check "treat PUP as malware."&nbsp; OK, here are some other really basic and
 general ideas to consider if not done already:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Type "device manager" in search box.&nbsp; Double click on Display adapters, then right click on what appears there, NVidia or whatever,&nbsp; then "update driver software."&nbsp; Check what graphics card you have and see if the manufacturer supplies an upgraded one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; You can experiment with your visual display settings.&nbsp; In Control Panel, locate System in "small icons", click System Properties, then the Advanced System Settings on left side of window.&nbsp; In the Advanced tab, under Performance, you see grey Settings
 box, and click on it.&nbsp; Tick "adjust for best performance." You can also run the System and Maintenance Troubleshooter to rule anything out with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I've read about people complaining that certain KB updates have seriously slowed their machines down and have subsequently uninstalled KB3132372 specifically.&nbsp; That should be the last on the list for troubleshooting, though. Do you have the latest cumulative
 update KB3135173 installed?&nbsp; Another person uninstalled his Adobe flash player, claiming this solved his issue, but you never know when you might need Flash in the future.&nbsp; I also use Firefox browser, and have Cisco video codec instead of Flash.&nbsp; Works very
 well.</p>

            I did scanned with Malwarebytes (don't have the realtime security) and nothing was found, also use the AdwCleaner; Display adapter is up to date; I have tried the "adjust for best performance" --didn't solve it. Yes, I do have the KB3135173 -- no KB3132372
 listed. Don't use Flash. I am lost, completely lost... I thank for the help, though. I might have to go to a Linux distro again, a shame because the aesthetics of Win10 is just fantastic and until recently was a very good system for me.

<h2>            can&#39;t save changes in homegroup</h2>
                    Hello, I can't save changes to homegroup settings. When I try to share libraries and printers, printers is already checked, I check other options, like pictures, music, etc. I then click save changes and exit. The problem is when I go back in, it hasn't
 saved my settings - all the boxes except Printers are unchecked again. And my pc does not show in homegroup.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
From the description, the issue is with the home group settings and you are not able to see the home group on your computer. Am I correct?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to try troubleshooting the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Method 1: I would suggest you to run Home Group troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Open the Home Group troubleshooter</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-HomeGroup-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-HomeGroup-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<span>Method 2:
<span>Try disabling the security software and check if that helps in the connection. Follow the link for more information.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></span></span>
<p><b><span><br />
Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it
 to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            Stop Windows from prompting user for Certificate A3 PIN&#47;Password</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Windows operational system keeps asking the user to input PIN/Password when the Certificate is an A3 Smartcard/eToken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in my application (C# Windows Forms) I already input the PIN programmatically when the application process starts and access the Certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect its a Windows Security setting because this problem occurs just in some developers/clients machines, in others don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            System Mechanic version 18.7.0.64 deleted files after update</h2>
                    <p>On April 11, 2019, my System Mechanic updated itself to version 18.7.0.64, and it was the fastest upgrade to date. As per usual, it deleted the older version, and then reinstalled the newer version. However, in the process of doing so, it apparently never
 reinstalled the Toolkit.exe file, so that as of April 14, 2019, I keep getting the error message: "System File is missing: C:\Program Files (x86)\Phoenix360\System Mechanic\Toolkit.exe".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that a similar question was posted by David Hodge, and shows as being resolved in January, 2019, but no satisfactory details were actually provided. Instead, it was just a back and forth exchange between two coders, that were announcing their expertise
 dating back to the 1960's. I can do without arguing, and just would appreciate some useful assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already attempted to contact iolo's technical support team, but keep getting bounced around between their 2CO/Avangate Support Team and iolo's useless support webpage, that only allows the creation of a new user account. I have a back up disc for
 an older version of System Mechanic, but I am afraid to install it, since my newer version is paid up to March 10, 2020, and I don't want to mess it up somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is an Asus desktop; AMD A8-6500 APU (64 bit); Windows 10 Home; version 1803 (OS build 17134.556).

            Hello, MarkinWPG,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Uninstall System Mechanic
<br />Reboot the PC
<br />Dowonload and install the software then verify if the toolkit is still missing.
<br /><a href="https://support.iolo.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01572/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.iolo.com/knowledgebase/article/...</a>
<br />
<br />If the toolkit is still missing, contact System Customer Care.. They may have removed it from the software.

<p>Dear Smittychat:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the links that you provided are for the "premium" versions of both the software, and the technical support option that requires I have to pay for their assistance. Neither of those options are viable for me, as neither actually resolve my dilemma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a valid subscription until March 2020, I don't need to pay for another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, because I have the "regular" version of System Mechanic, I seriously doubt that my activation key would be compatible to the "premium" version that you suggest I download, after deleting my existing version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need real help, from someone with real experience, not some "independent advisor", who for all I know, has less PC experience than I have, especially since I asked for helpful advice.</p>
        </p>

<p>Okay, I eventually found a solution to my initial question. Listed below is the timeline of steps that I had to take to do it, which may have taken time, but was worthwhile in the end:</p>
<ol>
<li>On April 14/2019, I sent an email to iolo Technologies Customer Care via older email address, but got no answer.</li><li>On April 19/2019 at 4:50 pm, I tried to log into my existing account on iolo's customer care website, but could not create a trouble ticket, as it kept claiming my password was invalid.</li><li>On April 19/2019 at 5:30 pm, I had to register a "new account" twice, but apparently it was not on the correct iolo website, but rather on the 2CO website, which is their software reseller. It took 4 attempts to get the captcha just right.</li><li>On April 19/2019, received an email for the trouble ticket, and sent them back more information about the issues that I was having with my updated version</li><li>On April 20/2019, received an email from 2CO, stating that they could only assist me with online payments, and gave me the link to iolo customer care instead. Then I got 2 more emails the same day, asking "how would you rate the support you received?" I
 left a comment that it was bad, and wasn't as supportive as their website would seem to indicate. If it had said that they ONLY are a reseller in bold letters, then I could have not wasted a step.</li><li>On April 20/2019, I also received an email stating that the issue was resolved, as far as they were concerned, which was time stamped as being sent before asking how to rate their support.</li><li>On April 21/2019, I received another ticket from another 2CO representative, for the exact same issue that was "resolved" by the first one. I sent them a reply, quoting the first ticket, and stating: "sending me another response for a duplicate request,
 is redundant and wastes both your time and mine."</li><li>On April 21/2019, I created this question on Microsoft Community, hoping for better results. While I got a very quick response later the same day, it was not what I would consider as helpful.</li><li>On April 22/2019, I received an email from the second 2CO rep, that stated the issue was resolved, and then received another email requesting how I would rate their support. I basically said that it wasn't supportive, nor resolved anything.</li><li>On April 25/2019, I posted my response to the advice received from the independent advisor, as noted above.</li><li>On April 25/2019 at 4:20 am, I tried the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter in Windows to force System Mechanic to work as if it was on Windows 8, but it didn't work.</li><li>On April 25/2019 at 5:11 am, I managed to convince the Support Bot, on iolo's Customer Care website, to create a trouble ticket, and received 2 emails confirming it will be processed asap. I managed to access my account, th
 and updated my time zone and full name/email address information.</li><li>On April 25/2019 at 11:02 am, I received the email from the iolo Technical Support rep, but he/she wanted me to use Revo Unistaller Pro (free) to uninstall System Mechanic, then download the software again, and change the Activation Key back to original.
 However, the link that I was provided, didn't work, and there is absolutely no way that I will ever install malware/freeware to uninstall anything, since nothing for "free" online, is truly free of viruses.</li><li>On April 25/2019 at 2:00 pm, I uninstalled System Mechanic via the Control Panel, then had to use ASUS Secure Delete to get rid of the leftover Phoenix360 folder that lingered in C:\Program Files (x86). Then I downloaded the updated version from iolo's
 regular website, and after rebooting the PC, installed the newer version. The Activation Key was already input correctly, so that seemed to be it. Now I have version 18.7.1.85 installed.</li><li>On April 25/2019 at 3:05 pm, I sent a reply to iolo Tech Support rep, outlining the steps that I took, and my observations of how the previous update version 18.7.0.64 had caused an issue soon after being updated, was perhaps linked to having Phoenix360
 version 2.6.0.64 also automatically installed. However, I have confirmed that only System Mechanic exists on my PC, and now is working as it should, since the Toolkit.exe file is back where it belongs.</li></ol>
<p>Yes, Smittychat. was correct in suggesting that I uninstall System Mechanic, and go to iolo's website to download a new version, but as you can see, my frustration with getting less than helpful advice from others who claimed to work for iolo, had caused
 a negative impact on my willingness to accept the advice at face value. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, I apologize for inferring that your advice was not helpful, nor that you had less than "real experience", than I have. Just chalk it up to a learning moment for both of us, and breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe another System Mechanic user could benefit
 from this situation, and hopefully not have to travel the same path of frustration that I had to encounter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) On April 26, 2019 at 11:52 am, I received a reply from iolo Technical Support, that said I should remove Phoenix 360 from the PC, and from the Registry using regedit. When I did as per suggestion, Kaspersky warning popped up saying "something is wrong
 with your OS, and would require that you restart your computer"; after the restart, I got a BSOD, and when it just stuck there doing nothing for a couple of minutes, I had to do a hard reboot (hold power button for 10 seconds; wait another 10 seconds; restart
 PC).</p>
<p>(2) After PC restarted okay, when I searched the registry again, more stuff popped up and I realized that perhaps it was deleted in error, since the System Mechanic folder is located within the Phoenix 360 folder (because iolo technologies LLC, was recently
 bought by the company that makes Phoenix 360). When I attempted to use System Mechanic to fix the registry, no issues were found.</p>
<p>(3) On April 26, 2019 at 8:30 pm, after confirming the registry seemed okay, and that System Mechanic was working properly, I created a restore point and started a new backup of PC, which completed as of April 27, 2019 at 1:32 am. I created a new system
 repair disc at 1:36 am, and as of 1:58 am, my USB recovery drive was also updated.</p>
<p>(4) On May 1, 2019 at 12:12 pm, iolo closed the trouble ticket and suggested that: "should you encounter the same issue again, or need to create a new ticket, please log into your account at the iolo technologies Customer Care Portal."
</p>
<p>(5) On May 4, 2019 at 8:20 pm, an ad from System Mechanic popped up, suggesting that I could add more time to my subscription for 50% off the regular fee. Since everything seemed okay, I did so, and now its been extended to March 11, 2021, to run concurrently
 with my Kaspersky subscription.</p>
<p>(6) On May 5, 2019 at 4:42 pm, I noticed a disturbing entry on my Kaspersky, while I was performing a Vulnerability Scan. Apparently, when I initially upgraded my System Mechanic to version 18.7.0.64 on April 11, 2019, a Trojan virus sneaked onto my PC,
 and was quarantined by Kaspersky. The entry was as follows: "PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic"; Location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Phoenix360\System Mechanic\"; then another entry said: "File was restored when rolling back actions of malware to C:\$recycle.bin\s-1-5-21-4166490364-1996195063-1104594379-1002\incinerator\c4.jpg".
 I disinfected and deleted the quarantined item.</p>
<p>(7) On May 7, 2019 at 9:47 pm, I started a Full Scan by Kaspersky, which took until May 8, 2019 at 3:40 am to complete. The results claimed that nothing was found. After some online research, I also attempted a Windows Defender Advance Scan/Full Scan, to
 determine if Kaspersky missed something. While it was doing its thing, I also attempted to perform an ASUS Secure Delete for the backup that was created immediately after System Mechanic was upgraded to version 18.7.0.64 (on April 24, 2019), but since it was
 230 GB in size, I stopped the process. Also, the eta of the Defender Scan would take another 14 hours, so that was stopped.</p>
<p>(8) On May 8, 2019 at 5:25 am, I tried the System Mechanic Incinerator to delete the unwanted backup, that now claimed it was only 95 GB. However, at 6:43 am, after another BSOD, I did another hard reboot, and restarted the Incinerator, which now claimed
 the file was 230 GB. Since it was too big to handle, I decided that individual deletion would be required for the .zip folders, which takes a long time. As of 8:02 am, I shut down the PC.</p>
<p>(9) On May 8, 2019 at 2:30 pm, started the painful process of deleting the .zip folders, and the Incinerator kept shutting down whenever it attempted more than 400 MB at a time. As of 6:52 pm, I still had 206 GB to delete, and calculated that it took 6 hours
 to delete 14 GB of data. From 7:25 pm to 9:30 pm, as per YouTube videos of how to find and delete a virus using the CMD window, I found "netstat -b; -ba; and -ban" reports, then created .txt files for each one. As of 9:52 pm, I re-opened the trouble ticket
 via iolo Customer Care, and continued to delete the .zip files. As of 10:20 pm, I had 204 GB remaining to delete.</p>
<p>(10) On May 9, 2019, between 3:40 pm to 6:05 pm, I managed to delete more .zip files, and now had 186 GB remaining to delete.</p>
<p>(11) On May 9, 2019 at 9:29 am, iolo technical support email gave the following advice: "This is to ensure that our download for System Mechanic is safe, but I suggest to update your System Mechanic version to 18.7.1.103 by having your System Mechanic uninstalled
 and re-install it again through the link provided: http://sm.iolo.com/. When downloading the latest version of System Mechanic kindly check if you can get the same thing from Kaspersky. If yes! Exclude the System Mechanic from your Antivirus program and let
 me know the version of your Kaspersky if this issue still exist."</p>
<p><strong>(12)&nbsp;</strong>On May 10, 2019 at 12:15 pm, after turned on PC, within 30 seconds, another BSOD, and it restarted itself again. Confirmed that I my System Mechanic version is still 18.7.1.85, and was about to send reply to iolo technical support that
 I refuse to go through more uninstall/re-install hoops, until I can confirm the at Trojan virus is removed FIRST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whew! With my above addendum, is there anybody out there, who knows how to completely remove a Trojan virus successfully, without my having to download anymore "free" software removal tools. You can see my hesitation, based upon my experience thus far.</p>

</p><p>Yeah, I've now given up on System Mechanic. The latest update will not install for me either. I made sure there was no auto renewal on my account. Anything System Mechanic does is now done by Windows 10, or CCleaner, or is not necessary.</p>

<p>Hello JohninWPG/Toronto: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I was swindled out of two 1 year renewal fees, within 6 months of each other, for what I was led to believe would be a working non-infected application. I have since removed my credit card and auto-renewal feature from my account, and sent
 their 2CO support team a request for a full refund of the second payment within the next 4 business days (starting May 21, 2019), or else I will dispute the charges as fraudulent with my credit card company, since it was made under duress, and completely remove
 all traces of the application from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY advice that I keep getting from the System Mechanic technical support team is: download the latest version, using the same link we gave you last time, and hope that another Trojan virus doesn't download along with it. Also, for the past 2 days,
 I keep getting a pop-up message that another update is available, but I just close it, instead of installing it again. They just don't seem to care to admit that the product is infected, nor are they willing to help fix my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, after being a loyal user of System Mechanic for at least 10 years, dating back to my Windows XP desktop, I have become totally disillusioned by the whole experience, and I am coming to terms that I basically threw away $50+ over the past 6 months,
 for a product that no longer meets my expectations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know of an effective way to completely ensure that a Trojan virus is gone from a PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of May 26, 2019, I finally convinced iolo's subscription division, that I was double-charged for the same renewal, and they issued a full refund for the additional charge. However, since I only have their refund invoice and email promises to go on, I
 have not been able to confirm that it actually happened, since my credit card bill has yet to arrive via snail mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On June 20, 2019, after contending with multiple annoying pop up messages to both add more time onto my subscription, and update the software, within 24 hours of just updating, I got fed up and completely uninstalled it via the Control Panel. Then, I had
 to eradicate all traces of it in the registry, along with the various hidden files that existed throughout all of my drives. Unfortunately, the incinerator icon on the desktop refused to be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On June 21, 2019, using an old DVD-ROM for System Mechanic (version 12.7.0), I reinstalled the software, and then slowly installed each subsequent update, until the most recent version (18.7.3.176) eventually arrived onto my PC. However, for reasons that
 I cannot figure out, unlike the standard practice of deleting the older version before installing an update, the previous version (16.5.3.1) remained intact alongside the newest version. I had to manually uninstall the older version, using the Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that all of the duplicate files; registry allocations; etc., have been removed, and so far, not caused the annoying pop up messages to reappear. Perhaps I should get paid via System Mechanic for figuring out how to fix their issues, since
 the only response that I received from any of their technical support representatives, was to download the latest version from a link that they kept giving me, which was obviously infected with the Trojan virus, that started this fiasco from the beginning.</p>

<p>Just wanted to mention that Revo Uninstaller Pro is not malware. It is a comprehensive uninstaller that does a better job than any other uninstaller I've encountered. I've used it for years and would recommend it to anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding System Mechanic, I was surprised that you had problems with it. It is another program that I've been using for many years and I've had no problems with it. I run the Pro version on my Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and it works seamlessly with this version
 of Windows.</p>

<p>Wow! I completely forgot about this thread still being open... Believe what you want, but my problems with System Mechanic obviously caused a cascade failure, that eventually led to a BSOD endless repair/not repair loop, that crashed my PC on June 28, 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to take it to a repair shop, and they ended up "saving" data that was not corrupted, and reinstalling Windows 10, up to version 1903. I had a backup of version 1803 on an external HD, but during the BSOD loop fiasco, it was never recognized by Windows.
 Even though they kept the "old" windows on the HD, I didn't have the option to return to version 1803 anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From July 9, 2019 to August 3, 2019, after painstakingly spending up to 8 hours per night, I had to extract each file separately from my backup files, to restore my PC back to what it was, before the BSOD loop began. I also found further evidence, that when
 I had upgraded the System Mechanic back in May, 2019, it did indeed download a Trojan virus along with it. Thankfully, the virus no longer resides on my PC, probably as a result of Windows being reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my current subscription to System Mechanic runs out, I will not be renewing it, since all of the features that it used to have built-in, are now only available for extra fees, which is a rip off on another level. I too was a faithful System Mechanic
 follower, but not anymore. Now I'm keeping as just a matter of principle, and to get my money's worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't lose anymore sleep for a product that does diddly squat for my PC, with less than inept technical support. I have more technical skills in my pinky toenail, than they do put together, which says a lot, since I don't have the "formal" IT training
 that they claim to have. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can glean one positive thing from my experience is this, backup and archive on both external HD and USB drives, as much data as you want to save, as often as you can, to avoid having to reset your PC back to factory specifications.</p>

<p>Hiya, and thanks for responding. I absolutely commiserate with you - I have been there myself, although via different circumstances. I just read a glowing review of SM, PC Mag, I think, but like you, I don't know if and how well SM does anything on my PC.
 I sometimes smile to myself when I see the pop-ups declaring such and such a thing was done, and wonder if it really was or not. I keep SM around for its desktop Incinerator, which I find quite handy, but all the same, I might not renew when my subscription
 runs out next year - the constant nagging to keep adding time, even when I had almost two years to go, is really irritating. They not only want me to keep adding time, but they seem to want to do everything, including security. I have never liked putting all
 my eggs in one basket, so I find that a bit off-putting as well. Besides which, I think Windows handles most things adequately, and I have Kaspersky to handle security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the note on backups - I've backslid a bit since my last fiasco, so the reminder is timely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, cheers. I'm glad you've got it sorted out.</p>
<p>

<p>Oh yes, the incinerator... it stopped working after my last update of SM to version 19.0.1.31, and disappeared from being listed within the Control Panel Programs and Features. I don't think it will like being uninstalled, when the time comes, but I will
 find a way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too use Kaspersky for my security, which seems to be more reliable, and does some of the same stuff that SM does, without the ongoing pop up ads; etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, my ASUS Secure Delete does the same thing as the incinerator, and it was free with my PC.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Below is a timeline, that further shows the disappointing quality of "customer service" from the iolo Customer Care Service Desk:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On August 12, 2019, I reached out to iolo technical support team, to find out how to uninstall System Mechanic, since it disappeared from the Control Panel's Programs and Features.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On August 14, 2019, their email message suggested that I go to the Control Panel; locate it in the Programs and Features; then choose to Uninstall the program, via the "normal" method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On August 14, 2019, I replied that I was familiar with the "normal" method of uninstalling software, but that my circumstances were not "normal", and needed more useful information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On August 15, 2019, they replied with the typical "I apologize for the inconvenience" response, which is their way of covering over their lack of actually reading a trouble ticket, and automatically assuming a typical answer would suffice. They provided
 a link for "free" Revo Uninstaller Pro" and some preliminary instructions of how to uninstall System Mechanic, which were not completely correct. I had to figure out how to use it, and after multiple tries, it eventually uninstalled most of the files from
 my PC. After 2.5 hours, I had to still manually delete a couple of files, so that it is now no longer anywhere to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of August 18, 2019, t<span>he stinking System Mechanic messed up my PC so badly, that I had to reinstall Adobe Reader DC, as well as my Steam game. Then
</span>I backed up the entire PC; created restore points; updated my USB recovery drive; and created a system repair disc, prior to updating my PC from OS Build 18362.175 to 18362.295.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never again will I re-install System Mechanic, and have to live through this type of PC hell, that I am convinced was started with the Trojan virus downloaded via the update way back in April, 2019. Now I can rest easy, knowing that I will never again be
 haunted by the ghost of System Mechanic, nor the various phantom files that were created or moved around, after what was supposed to be a simple upgrade.</p>

            I don't believe that Windows Media player can play DVD at all in Windows 8 or 8.1. You we need to find another Media player such Windows Media Center, VLC Player. VLC is free but Windows Media Center is $10.00 and only available if you have Windows 8.0
 or 8.1 Pro. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

            <p>I have an HP Laptop, top of the line Zbook, it stopped playing Blue Ray Movies. I have windows 8.1 Pro and have used Windows Media Center to play regular DVD movies, works fine. However, why can't it play Blue Ray? Cyber Link is rediculous, all they want
 is upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think perhaps going to MAC is a good option, but you need to look into all aspects of it. Good Luck to all.</p>

<p>"Configuring settings" is the final phase and failures codes look like c1900101 x400xx. The most common failure here is 40017, which means we failed to boot. Since this is the first time we boot into Windows 10 with all of the drivers in place, again, drivers
 are usually the cause of the crash. These issues tend to be less transient than the 30018s, so a second try is less likely to solve the issue. Still, it never hurts to try.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista Is Awesome &#40; Windows 7 sucks&#33; &#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ive seen reviews on amazon saying that vista was awkward , slow and bad. ( review where in 2007!) the truth is that it is not. it is fast, intuitive and less buggy than windows 7/ ( vista sp2 of course!)</p>
<p>windows 7 is just a lesser experience than vista. windows 7 took away allot of features that vista had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>now its 2014 and vista has properly got another 3 years. ( i want vista for longer!) as vista had a bad start and now machines have got more powerful anough to handle vista. i recommend giving vista a try!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just got vista buisness for ma gaming rig!</p>

<h2>            Skype V 8.42.0.60 unable to hear audio with video call connection</h2>
                    Believe this problem surfaced after a recent Skype auto update. computer is running W7 and never had this problem until recently. When using the video connection, the other person can hear me fine, but I cannot hear their audio. Except under those conditions,
 I hear all sounds normally through my speakers, i.e., mp3, YouTube,, Window sounds, etc. Have tried rebooting computer, uninstalling Skype via Windows, rebooted, then reinstalled Skype, then rebooted again. None of this has worked. Did a 3 way conference video
 call and the other two could hear me as well as each other, but I could not hear them. The speakers are not on mute nor is the sound turned down too low, can hear the test audio sounds in the Skype setup audio and video just fine.&nbsp; Again, only problem is unable
 to hear audio during a video connection.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            Hi Vtailpilot
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Thanks for your suggestions. I was unable to rename the folder at first even though Skype was not running according to task manager. I used a program called Process Explorer and found 3, skype.exe files and killed them. I then thought I would d/l an older
 version and found V7.4, however when it opened it said it was no longer supported and did an auto update to V8.42. I've only had one video chat, but I was able to hear the other party fine and they could hear me, which was true all along.&nbsp; This problem only
 recently cropped up, so not sure what really caused unable to hear the other person when all other programs with audio worked fine.&nbsp;

<h2>            The Elder Scrolls V&#58; Skyrim Download code</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Xmas evening I got a xbox bundle with Forza 4 (box) and a download code for the full skyrim. I bought it in the netherlands and games are here normally in a english language. Forza is in english, but the download from skyrim is in german :S&nbsp;</p>
<p>my console is setup in english. Does anybody know how to resolve this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Frank</p>

<p>It's a regional issue thing. As far as I know there isn't a fix. It's a good game, but you would probably need to get a disc copy to fix this.</p>

<p>its not a regional issue^. xboxs have been able to translate games through different languages.you have to move to your settings and fix your language, if it doesnt change then you cant change the language, this is most likely because its a downloaded game
 and not a disc game for the language translation is only known for working with disk as they come in different languages.</p>

<p>The language settings are on english. Im sure its the download. The box doesnt mention the game is german so im affraid the download code is wrong. I Asked Xbox chat support and Bethsoft for a solution, but both keep me waiting.</p>

<p>Hey there Evesion! Can you verify that your account region is also set for the Netherlands? You can double check that by logging in to
<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and looking under Profile.<br />
<br />
The short story here is that digital games' language is based on the region the content is from and the region of the account. The console Language/Locale settings will not affect this. If you feel that you were sold the wrong product, you can always head back
 to the store to see if they can provide you some kind of replacement. Let us know what you find out, thanks!</p>

<p>you dont get an english code it depends on the game itself</p>
<p>if the game supports multiple languages and your language is supported then yes you will get whatever language you select
</p>
<p>however with skyrim and other region specific games like cod etc they dont usually have multiple language support</p>
<p>it is usually based on the offically supported languages of your region</p>

    <title>Sound is fuzzy and distorted with Realtek HD Audio in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dharma-13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound is fuzzy and distorted with Realtek HD Audio in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I bought my asus n61ja laptop 4 days ago. When playing music, sounds like it's a bit fuzzy, but when i play games, some certain sounds (like clicking sounds and some sound effects in game) gets really distorted. For example, when i played left4dead and
 left4dead2, sound of fire effects are annoyingly distorted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think my laptop speakers has the problem because the same thing happens when i plug headphones. I tried to update and downgrade the sound driver, but it didn't work. My sound driver is Realtek HD Audio version R 2.48</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please anyone help me with this.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for advice Debra but the answer includes my problem is this:</p>
<p><span>Make sure your speakers are correctly connected to your computer</span></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure they are correctly connected, in case i don't have any option to open the case of my laptop due to guarantee agreement. I tried my music cd's in other laptops, and the result was not that different, slight distortion. I think the distortion
 in music and other sound effects except these two games, occurs because of SRS Premium Sound. When I use its equalizer, sounds a little bit distorted but if I disable that, no distortion at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reinstalled the games, and there was no sound problem at all. I don't know why but maybe the problem has been soluted after an update for my realtek hd audio driver which i couldn't recognize before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your advices and help Debra and Palcouk!</p>

            These files/folders may be system controlled and you may only get rid of them by using an advanced uninstaller such as Revo uninstaller which will also scan for left over registry items and folder's.

<p>That is not a solution if there is problem then there must be an solution and i know that in last there is always three options Re-install Windows, Reset PC and as you "suggest" Restore at previous version of OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i know that the software or OS was never perfect or never will there is always something missing or some mistakes but if we/you know the mistake than we/you should try to solve......................................................................</p>

    <title>Cannot play .wma files in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> te.em  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot play .wma files in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I try to play any of my .wma files in Windows 10 using Windows Media Player I get a message which says:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*****************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The license cannot be downloaded because your Web browser is not supported.</p>
<p>To download a license, you must install Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 or later.</p>
<p>To install the latest version of Internet Explorer, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=10749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Update page</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>*****************************************************************************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a strange message because Windows Edge is supposed to be the latest Microsoft Browser is it not?&nbsp;Surely I don't have to download and install Windows Internet Explorer just to get my music files to play properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "solution" suggested by Microsoft for this problem elsewhere is to press the F5 key. I did exactly that and I was able to proceed with Windows Edge to successfully "download and install" the license file .... *BUT* ..... when&nbsp;I go to play the file I
 get the same "Migrate License Error" with the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have thought that playing .wma files from an existing music collection is&nbsp;fairly standard thing that people would want to do and I am surprised that such a major problem exists with trying to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do to resolve this issue .... any suggestions gratefully accepted.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I copy a file from a USB drive even when giving Admin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph m morgan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I copy a file from a USB drive even when giving Admin permission</h2>
                    <p>I am restoring files from an older failed computer. &nbsp;I have them now on a USB drive. &nbsp;My Windows 10 machine will not allow me to make the copy from the USB drive, even though I've granted Administrator permission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now logged in *as* the Administrator. &nbsp;Same denial of permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "takeown" - No joy. &nbsp;It tells me I can't take ownership of files on insecure drives (this is a USB drive).</p>
<p>I tried "icacls" - No Joy. &nbsp;In fact, this one is worse, because using my specific command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>icacls *.* /grant:r</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or</p>
<p>icacls * /grant:r</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system tells me: &nbsp;"invalid parameter /grant:r"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though, clearly and plainly and irrevocably in the help it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ICACLS name [/grant[:r] sid:perm[...]]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what part of "/grant:r" is invalid?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, never giving up, I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>icacls *.* /grant Administrator:r</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works on directories, but *not* files on the USB. &nbsp;It still tells me access is denied, even though "takeown" clearly and irrevocably states that "File ownership cannot be applied on insecure file systems; there is no support for ACLs."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, since there are no ACLs for the system, I should not have to grant specific permissions, and access *cannot* be denied, because there is no ACL! &nbsp;Which is it? &nbsp;Why is it? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOLUTIONS: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution #1:&nbsp; If this happens and you have an older Windows computer, it appears you can share the USB drive on the OLD NON-WINDOWS 10 (emphasis important) computer.&nbsp; It will be important that both computers are on your internet connection (at home or in
 the office).&nbsp; Then, on the Windows 10 computer, go to Windows Explorer, select Network, and locate the other computer.&nbsp; You'll have to log in to the other computer.&nbsp; Then you can copy from the USB drive attached to the other computer with no permission problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I did it this way just to see if I could copy from the USB through the share using&nbsp;Windows 10; and I did!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, if you don't happen to have another non-Windows 10 computer lying around (maybe borrow a friend's that isn't yet a Windows 10 machine),
 or a Web server (see Solution #2 below), you might just be out of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution #2:&nbsp; Here's the ultimate gotcha on why the above problem is so stupid. &nbsp;I setup a web server on another non-Windows machine and put the files there. &nbsp;I then was able to connect to that web server and download the files *with no issues and no special
 permissions needed*. &nbsp; Now, someone from the security team at Microsoft explain to me why it is less secure to copy a file from a USB I own than to be able to download a file from a web server on an arbitrary computer on the network!!! &nbsp; Also someone from
 the security group at Microsoft explain to me why I can't run the new Microsoft Edge browser from the Administrator account, but I *can* run Firefox from the same account! &nbsp;Does Microsoft OS not trust its own Edge, but is OK with FireFox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that MS operating systems have become the worst when it comes to perceived security? &nbsp; I will not upgrade another computer to Windows 10, and, in fact, will completely move off of Windows if this doesn't straighten out. &nbsp;I'm not trying to copy
 an old Windows OS file. &nbsp;It is a file from the old computer's (Windows 7) documents to the new computer's (Windows 10) documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely no non-schizophrenic reason why I should not be allowed to simply copy a file from a USB drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions I posted above should be embarrassing to the Windows 10 team.&nbsp; The hoops one must jump through to simply copy a file from a&nbsp;USB drive.&nbsp; The interesting thing is, most casual non-tech users will not have a solution or the technical skills to
 do what I did or even try the things I did.&nbsp; They'll have to take their old computer to someone who will charge them lots of money to simply copy a file from a USB that wasn't formatted from Windows-10, or not created from another Windows-10 computer?!&nbsp; I
 have no clue why Windows 10 could not copy the files.&nbsp; There *is* no sane reason why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those coming across this post, note that Windows *did not* present a solution.&nbsp; I simply have the technical skills to work around it.&nbsp; If you have no compelling reason to upgrade to Windows 10, don't.&nbsp; I heard Windows 10 will be the last Windows version.&nbsp;
 It will definitely be for me.&nbsp; I'll stay on my older machines until they die, and then I'll move to another platform.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Question about Skype 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liyern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Skype 8</h2>
                    I'm just wondering, is there at all an option to have the chat bubbles underneath eachother instead of mine beeing on the far right, and my friends on the far left? I have a big screen and it might sound silly to some but my eyes are already hurting from
 trying to read somthing. This is a PC with a big screen, not a phone. Also, is there a way to have chats on the right side of the screen while in a call, and my friend list on the left? It's extremely annoying to have to switch between them. Skype 7 had this,
 why doesn't Skype 8 have this? I thought this was an "update".

            Hi Liyern,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />What is your OS? The split view is there in Windows 10 Store version of Skype 8. If you are on Windows 10, you can install Store version from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />

            Thought so, glad Microsoft forced me into this update and didn't even make this an available option for us W7/8 users.

    <title>how many instances of Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil_s1  say:</h3>
<h2>            how many instances of Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter &#40;MVMC&#41; can run in parallel</h2>
                    I have 4 VMware ESX 4.0 hosts with 175 VM guest images. &nbsp; I need to convert them over to 4 Hyper-V hosts.&nbsp; I have vCenter 5.0.<br />
<br />
I read the user guide about the MVMC tool.<br />
<br />
How many VMware to Hyper-V conversions can I run in parallel, or is it strictly serial?<br />
<br />
Also, do I do the conversions per ESX host and it converts over as many VMs are running on that ESX host, or is it one conversion per VM which it appears to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!!<br />
