<h2>            Live Mail will not accept my password</h2>
                    <p>I have used Live Mail for several years now&nbsp;&nbsp;with no problems.&nbsp; Today when I attempt to check email it was asking for my password which it never did before.&nbsp; I entered the password and it will not take it, just keeps asking for my password even though it
 is already filled in and the save box has&nbsp; been checked.&nbsp; When I ask for details, it says the&nbsp;password is incorrect.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;went into my account and changed my&nbsp;password and it still will not accept it.&nbsp; I cannot receive mail on my pc or on my iphone.</p>
<p>Thx in advance for the help in fixing this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response. Kindly verify if you are using a Hotmail account in accessing Windows Live Mail. If yes, please try resetting your password again at
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> and try to sign in using the same Microsoft account. If you are using a non-Hotmail account, sign in to your email provider's website and reset the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Once the password is reset, please try signing back into Windows Live Mail using the new password. If you have ticked the option to "Sign me in automatically," you need to click "Forget Me" and sign in with the new password.
 You also need to reconfigure your account with the new password information. Please refer to the article below to know how to do so:</span></span></p>

            See if there are any issues with the accounts, by logging on to Outlook.com with them. Outlook.com may periodically ask you to verify your account, but Windows Live Mail don't understand such requests. I had a similar issue with my account a couple of

<p>Hi Tanveer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue likely occurs due to an outdated webcam driver. We'd like to know a few things so we can better address your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the make and model of your laptop?</li><li>Have you made any changes prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you receiving any error messages when trying to use your webcam?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest updating your webcam driver to troubleshoot this issue. To do so, please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try checking for one on
 your device manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the result.</p>

    <title>typing alt key codes in a search box - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            typing alt key codes in a search box</h2>
                    In Windows 7 (64 bit SP1), it won't allow me to type special characters in a search box to search documents in a folder. For example, I am not allowed to type &lt;alt&gt; 164 for ñ in the search box (my documents are in Spanish). I made sure num lock was on
 and tried rebooting. This was not an issue when I had Vista. Thanks.

            <p>I couldn't make the search box accept Alt-codes, either (ñ is Alt-0241 on my system, by the way). But searching for
<em>mañana </em>worked if I typed in <em>manana </em>so long as I had <em>Treat similar words with diacritics as different words</em>
<u>not</u> selected at Control Panel &gt; Indexing Options &gt; Advanced. </p>
<p>When typing in a foreign language, I find it best to use an appropriate keyboard layout. You may find it easier if you write a lot in Spanish to get used to using the United States - International keyboard layout that includes readily accessible keystrokes
 for most Western European latin characters. ñ is AltGr-n, for example. You can install different input languages and select the keyboard to use with each at Control Panel &gt; Region and Language. Then you can simply type
<em>mañana</em> into the box.</p>

            IE is my default browser on 3 different computers: 1-windows 8 and 2-windows 7. They all have the same issue no matter what album. I ran troubleshooter as outlined.&nbsp; The analysis said some settings were reset to default and I noticed that media player

<p>
</p><p>I still have never found out how to change the display name on MSN Explorer from my Email address to my user name.&nbsp; All I got was a run around to go from one help contact to another and none of them offered any solution.</p>

<h2>            Edge Freezes When Clinking On Favorites After Windows Creator Update 1703</h2>
                    <p>After the automatic Windows 10 Creator update (1703) to my desktop PC on April 16, 2017, I now can no longer access my favorites (none shown) and when clicking on that heading the Edge browser freezes. I then have to close Edge and restart it. Edge otherwise
 works fine, as long as I don't try to access favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the automatic 1703 update on April 16th, everything worked fine.</p>

            I think we should wait for any updates from Microsoft, or you can check this thread from regarding this concern: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/i-lost-all-of-my-favorites-in-edge-after-an/7878ac58-bab8-460a-94cd-fa3100a5ccad

<p>Thank you very much for the reply and link from other users with the same problem. There was another Windows update just received this past week, which I had hoped would resolve this issue- but it did not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided would do a restore from a few weeks ago. My problem is that I would then loose data between that time and now, if I did the restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point in time, I'll take your suggestion to wait for a future update from Microsoft for addressing this issue or hear back from a user with another possible solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>I brought my desktop PC to the local Microsoft store with hope that they could fix the Edge frozen when clicking on favorites issue after the 1703 Creators update. They saw the problem first hand, reinstalled Windows 10, all the updates and even had a special
 file on a flash drive that is meant to fix all know issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result was the issued still remained. They said to wait for hopefully a future update from Microsoft to resolve the 1703 update problem with Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Microsoft store, there have been numerous problem with the Creators update, but the person I was dealing with was unfamiliar with the Edge favorites frozen problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I must say that the free assistance at the Microsoft store was a great help in knowing that if they could not solve their own software related problem, there is little I can do on my own. Also, I'm sorry that I automatically had my system setup
 for updates, as Creators still is in my mind a beta product.</p>

<p>As of this date, my Edge freezing after clicking on favorites issue has not been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I also logged onto the Microsoft Edge Developers website and asked for help or at least to know that they are aware of this issue, working on it and expect to provide a fix on a future Windows 10 Creators update. I have not yet received a
 reply to that request.</p>

<p>Out of frustration of not being able to save, view or&nbsp;access my favorites in Edge since the Windows 10 Edge automatically installed Creators 1703 Update on April, 16, 2017, as Edge then crashes when clicking on favorites, I found a workaround by going back
 to using Explorer 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be accessed by clicking on the Windows 10 home button, then Windows System, then Internet Explorer. I then right clicked and added&nbsp;the quick start Explorer icon&nbsp;to the bottom desktop programs bar. I now have access to my favorites and can also save
 new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If at some point in the future Microsoft has a fix to this known favorites crashing problem with the Creators update, I would then revert back to Edge. In the meantime, I'll start using the already installed Explorer 11, in place of Edge.</p>

</p><p>Same here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying a couple of things that where not succesfull I finally removed Edge en did a new installation of Edge. It means you lose all old data but the new one will work normal. Then I tried to import the backup (HTML) of my old Favorites and the problems
 starts again. So, I'm going to build a new list of Favorites.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for mentioning you also are experiencing the same problem, but have too be unable to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been checking daily for 1703 Creators updates, but the couple I've received since the problem started a couple months ago still has not resolved the Edge crashing when clicking on favorites issue. Therefore for the time being, I'm back to using Internet
 Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also done searches for possible solutions, tried them and they were unsuccessful. As previously mentioned, I took my desktop to the Microsoft Windows Store, where they reinstalled Windows 10 and Edge. The Microsoft store could not even resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it hard to believe that Microsoft now after a couple months&nbsp; have not yet resolved this common problem with their own browser.</p>

    <title>What do I do to get my broken Xbox One Elite controller replaced or - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What do I do to get my broken Xbox One Elite controller replaced or repaired&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In September 2017 I have bought an Xbox One Elite controller at a store that sells refurbished gaming products. It worked great for about half a year, until the left bumper broke, seemingly out of nowhere. It was not really a surprise however, since the
 other two Elite controllers in my household have had the exact same defect. Now, because I bought the controller at a story that sells refurbished products, there was only a two-month warranty, so they told me they could not help me with repairing or replacing
 the controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on Reddit there are several people who tell me they either brought their Elite controller to a Microsoft store nearby and got a replacement (even after expired warranty), or they went through the process online. However, in my country (The Netherlands)
 there is no Microsoft store. Also, when I go through the steps in the online service center, I eventually can only order replacement kits for the thumbsticks, D-pads etc. There is no replacement/reparation option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Support Twitter account sent me to the Xbox Support Twitter account, who did not respond. Then someone else sent me here. What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Now, how it works with Xbox Accessories the manufacture warranty they get usually lasts around 90-Days. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is there anyway to get Windows 7 to properly display image XMP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there anyway to get Windows 7 to properly display image XMP fields&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have over 4000 photos that have been tagged with IPTC/XMP metadata.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each photo is labeled with a title AND a description (aka caption).&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this information is not usable in Windows 7 because for whatever reason, the description has been
 cross-referenced as title and the title information is completely lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means I cannot search on the actual title of the photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no problem with PDFs. it's just images that are messed up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I installed an alternate JPEG iFilter but that hasn't
 solved the problem. </p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the rationale for arbitrarily calling the description the title?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyway at all for me to get the actual title of the photo to be exposed in Windows?</p>

            <p>Actually, Windows 7 is supposed to support the both the IPTC Core schema and XMP.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't make any difference what kind of tool you use to describe your&nbsp;files &nbsp;though,&nbsp; Windows 7 does not treat title and description separately for images.&nbsp; The&nbsp;fields
 are handled properly for documents&nbsp;but not for images.</p>

                    So I have four achievements that aren't unlocking on this game. First is Double Trouble. You have to get 200 Overkills in double overkill. According to my in game stats I have 288 double Overkills. Next is Look Mom I Made it for completing the game on
 insane. A buddy and I have played through twice on insane and didn't get the achievement. The other two are based off that since I read that once you complete the game on insane you get more outfits, masks and tattoos. How do I go about getting this headache

            <p>Hey there,&nbsp;Goff Mania! I'm very sorry to see any issues with your achievements. I found you over in our Xbox One Games forums, so I moved you here to our Xbox 360 forums to get the assistance you are looking for.</p>
<p>The first thing we have you do is check trueachievements.com for the achievements as they may have some special ways to obtain. It looks like <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a175319/double-trouble-achievement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Double Trouble</a> does. Follow the steps there (and they do say that it may not pop the first time) and let us know how that goes. Looks like there are a few solutions for <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a175325/look-mom-i-made-it-achievement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Look Mom, I Made It</a> as well.</p>
<p>Give those a try and let us know if you are able to get those achievements afterwards. We'll keep an eye out if you continue to have troubles. :)</p>

            It seems to be a problem with msiexec possibly. Have you tried to install your games or programs in safe mode?<br />
<br />
It's mainly a memory problem. And about your sound drivers... Are they digitally signed? Windows apparently says if it's not signed it can cause issues...<br />
<br />
&gt; Your installer. Does this "error" appear right at the beginning or somewhere in the installation.<br />
<br />
&gt; Also MAKE sure you check event log (start &gt; run &gt; eventvwr.msc) and check in the application and security logs and post the errors here. I can look at the problem and others, too can look as well.<br />
<br />
You can try these methods:<br />
&nbsp;-&gt; open task manager (ctrl+alt+del) and see what installation executable is causing the issue.<br />
&nbsp;-&gt; go to (my computer &gt; properties &gt; advanced &gt; performance (settings) &gt; data execution prevention.&nbsp; Select Turn on DEP for all programs and services or something and add your installation apps there.<br />
<br />
You know, I have this error as well and I am trying to fix it too. It's something to do with your registry but I am finding a solution to this as well. If I get any answers I will test it (to see if the programs work) and give you the solution.<br />
<br />
I hope these work for you..<br />

<h2>            Problem with Virtual PC&#58; can&#39;t automatically log on to guest because host computer name is added to guest user name after entering credentials.</h2>
                    When I enable integration features in Virtual PC then the "Enter your credentials" dialog box pops up.&nbsp;After entering username and password the system can't&nbsp;log me on because the host computer name is added in front of&nbsp;the user name that I entered. Example:

 However, without saved credentials I'm asked to log on again each time I resize the Virtual PC window. Any ideas how to solve this? Thanks!

<p>Please try following steps for the computer to remember the credentials and not to prompt for the password to open each programs:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When it requests a password, click <strong>Cancel</strong> . Without Integration Feature, you are allowed to logon with an account which do not have a password.<br />
2. Set a password for your current user.<br />
3. Click<strong> Tools</strong> on Windows Virtual PC, choose <strong>Enable Integration Features.</strong>
<br />
a. Type the correct password, check the box <strong>"Remember my credentials</strong> " and click OK to logon.
<br />
b. After joining domain, logon to XP Mode with the local administrator account.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m stuck on tile mode in Windows 7.</h2>
                    I didn't know windows 7 has a tile mode. I figured out that I could press windows key+d to get back to the desk top, but when ever I open an app on the desk top, it switches back to tiles mode and opens the app. When I open an app from tiles mode (most
 are web apps),&nbsp; it uses this weird browser that doesn't have a url bar. I tried turning it off and on and it boots to tiles mode. I'm using an older computer, I'm using Windows 7, my computer is not optimized for tiles mode, like newer computers.

            <p>I figured out what the problem was. I am using a loaner laptop from my school, while I'm fixing my own computer, and I some how opened the Lenovo app store. I clicked around the bottom of the screen and it fixed itself. Also I think I may have put the computer
 to sleep instead of shutting it down. This is NOT my computer, its the school's so it has a lot of settings that I never use or like.

    <title>Lexmark X1270 Printer not compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gayboylacahotmail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lexmark X1270 Printer not compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition &#40;Questions&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My Lexmark X1270 Printer does not work with the new Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607. I tried to reinstall the software, call Microsoft for support, uninstall and reinstall the device with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lexmark X1270 Printer works fine with Windows 10 Home Edition Version 1511. All I had to do was reinstall the software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore it is very difficult to go back to Version 1607 and stay there because Windows will reinstall the update as soon as you go back to the earlier version. They will not even let you set your computer to "metered connection" in Version 1607 to prevent
 updates.&nbsp; I did set my computer to a "metered connection" quickly upon reverting to Version 1511 to prevent Windows from being able to add the updates again for Version 1511.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607 deleted all my System Restore points so anytime after the grace period of a few days to revert from the instillation of Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607 back to Windows 10 Home
 Edition Version 1511 I would not be able to go back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried Lexmark's website and phone support but they cannot help with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see it now, my only alternative for using Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607 is to buy a new printer which states that it is compatible with the new Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get my Lexmark X1270 to work with the new Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607?</p>
<p>
How can I ask Microsoft to develop a way for my Lexmark X1270 printer to work on the new Windows 10 Home Edition Anniversary Version 1607 as it did on the Windows 10 Home Edition Version 1511?&nbsp;

<h3> hsingh1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 appears to cut off sections of track names</h2>
                    I have noticed that WMP 12 cuts off track names in the library. It doesnt do them with all the tracks but enough for me to notice. The filenames are the unaffected but its just as the tracks appear in the library. I initially thought it could be a limit
 on the character length, however even with track names with relatively low character length it still cuts them off.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Peace<br />

            I have not made any noteworthy changes to my computer which could affect WMP. Ive restored the library numerous times but still to no avail...<br />
Its not clear as to why it would be cutting off the track names...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply anyway...<br />

Hello 

To further investigate, are you getting an error message when calling 1-800 numbers? What is the version of Skype you are running?

I will wait for your response. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.

<p>Hi, Julie--</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for slow reply. I was on the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that comes up reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Call – you currently can’t call this number on Skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Skype for Mac, version 7.59 (37).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happens when I attempt these calls: </p>
<p>I dial the number, 800-843-6200, via my saved contacts. (As noted, I've been calling that and various other American Airline numbers as long as I have been a Skype subscriber, so since about 2005.)</p>
<p>Skype says it's ringing. I hear about 1/2 a ring.</p>
<p>Then the "ringing" bubble, inside Skype-logo-shaped bubble, bobs in and out for maybe 10 seconds. Meanwhile, there is no ringing, no sound.</p>
<p>Then up comes that error message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This same problem occurred for weeks and weeks last year, and I jumped through a zillion hoops with the basically useless Skype customer service, via live chat. Never got any clarity. And then the problem stopped.</p>
<p>This year, what Skype customer service tells me is that these numbers are restricted for security reasons. Which sure seems unlikely, given that they're 800 numbers for American Airlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've saved transcripts of the extended chats I've had with Skype customer service. Can forward if they'd be of use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I now have another problem. Maybe you can tell me where to try to address it. For years, I've had an online number: 347-482-1858, and have subscribed to unlimited calls to US and Canada.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, since Skype messed up my renewal (for no reason--they claimed there was a security issue with my card, but there was no such), all my calls via Skype to US lines show up on the receiver's end&nbsp; as "restricted" or "unidentified caller" or the like.
 So, no one picks up my calls. So, I need to get the caller ID straightened out, to say it's me calling.
</p>

<p>I have the same issue with the American Airlines 800 numbers - never had a problem in over 10years and now i do - very frustrating. Over the past 10days Ive tried multiple times on multiple devices (not that it matters but akso from multiple countries since
 im traveling) and it doesnt work. Im runing the latest updates of skype my iphone 7, ipad and MBA - and have plenty of credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I agree with the OP it makes no sense that american would be blocking these calls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took a while to figure out, but eventually I discovered that American was blocking the calls because Skype had stopped identifying my number as the caller's. It went to American Airlines as "blocked number" or "unidentified number." AA's system is programmed
 not to take those calls, apparently. </p>
<p>All that was necessary was to go into my Skype preferences and again set things so my number would be identified in calls I placed.

<p>Thanks- ill give that a try. Still not sure why this started happening since i have never changed any of my settings on skype.? Perhaps it was an update? Anyway my Vonage accout has been working fine so can at least still make calls to 800 numbers.</p>

    <title>Changing the path location of user profiles in Windows 7. Can you do - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superbeing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the path location of user profiles in Windows 7. Can you do this and if so how and is there a need to do this&#63;</h2>
                    I was wondering if there is a way to change the location of user accounts so that they are not on the same partition as the system files, but on a separate partition? I have attempted to point the 'My Documents' folder to the D: for example but this tends
 to get very confusing if you are moving multiple user profile folders from different users. Is there an easy way to do this? Is there a need to change user profile location?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!

<p><span><span>Hi SuperBeing</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Moving the default system folders to different location is not recommended. If you would change the location, it would be
 on your own risk at Microsoft we do not recommend.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you want to change the location for all the files including the Application data and personal files then you can follow
 the below steps by logging into each account separately:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Windows explorer and create a new folder is the desired drive (Ex: D: Drive)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Re-name
 the folder as desired name (Ex: Documents)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span>the
 start menu, in the search box type in ‘shell:UsersFilesFolder’ (Without quotes)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the folder that you want to move to a different location</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 Properties</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Location tab, select move</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Navigate
 to the location you want to move ( the new folder you had created in step 1)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>viii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on select folder, click OK</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ix.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 you are prompted for permission of Move folder, click OK</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you check back at the C:\Users\ (user-name) location, you will notice that the user folder (ex: Documents) that you moved
 is no longer there, but is still at the Start Menu (shell: UsersFilesFolder) location. You will also notice that the folder at the location (ex: D drive) you moved the user folder to, now has the default user folder (ex: Document) icon.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have already tried these steps,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively, you can select only the folders you like to move by following the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the documents folder Go to Properties</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Under
 the library location tab, add a location where you like to save the files</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Qs pop up whenever I type on a browser.</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help me with this problem. Literally I am doing my work then all of the sudden my cursor cannot click on anything but it is still able to move around and go over tabs etc. but the right click on my touchpad works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats one problem. The other one is that recently when ever i go to search something up a bunch of q’s start popping up randomly or only after I type in a letter. Example</p>
<p>&nbsp; wqhqaqqtq aqrqqeq thqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqeqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is what happens and if I don’t press enter it keeps going and going and going.</p>

<p>On the Xbox 360 Support web site, Microsoft states: "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Parental controls allow you [to] control how long each family member can use the console on a daily or weekly basis</span>". &nbsp;However it does not describe how to actually do
 that, and I don't see any way to do it trying to figure it out myself on the Xbox 360 console. &nbsp;Can you please explain how to do this? &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Is it possible? &nbsp;Or is your support site incorrect?</strong></span> &nbsp;This would be a
 great feature that I would like to use. &nbsp;I'm aware that there is a feature to limit the time for
<strong>ALL</strong> users combined - but I am looking for the feature you describe that limits the time for

<p>Why is this time limit feature not on Xbox One? &nbsp;I hate this thing! &nbsp;I'm sure Microsoft realizes the fights between parents and children that ensue because the parents tell the kids to get off and the kids ignore. &nbsp;I've read many other comments from parents
 so I know I'm not alone. &nbsp;I'd throw this whole console out of my house but unfortunately Microsoft has created a culture where this is how kids socialize. &nbsp;It's sickening. &nbsp;Kids should be outside playing wiffle ball and capture the glad all summer long not
 sitting inside staring at screens. &nbsp;Anyone agree with me? How can we fight this? I want to see kids running around the neighborhoods again!!!!</p>

                    <p>Since the release,&nbsp;I played 10d+ on Fallout 4 and through all DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>I still had the original 1hr save file that autosaves before you leave Vault 111.&nbsp;I created a manual&nbsp;save for the 10d character and opened the 1hr save file and proceeded through most of the main quest until around 7hrs in with normal autosaves, etc. Technically this is the same character, with the same name, but these are multiple saves with completely different playthroughs and choices. This was done strictly for achievement&nbsp;purposes.</p><p>After a few days of playing the newer playthrough, and&nbsp;manually saving, I reloaded the 10d character to unlock 2 Workshop achievements. After those were unlocked, I removed 2 autosaves from the 7hr character. Now it looks like I removed all of those 7hr character saves, because the only one left was another manual save about 1hr in when I first reached Concord.</p><p><br /></p><p>After accepting this and playing through the Concord Museum of Free

<p>Update failure</p>
<p>When the xbox tells you an update is needed, but the update will not complete properly.</p>
<p>There are four reasons this can happen.</p>
<p>1. There are some corrupted files on your harddrive or your harddrive does not have enough space left.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. There are some previous downloads stuck in your download queue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>3. There are some settings in &nbsp;your router that are blocking the download.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>4. Your account is not in good standing.</p>
<p>First try to fix number 1: &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>Look at the contents of your harddrive and delete any files marked as corrupt. &nbsp; Then whether you find any or not, &nbsp;run the hard drive maintenance routine.</p>
<p>Harddrive cache clearing. &nbsp;If there is not enough space, delete some demos or other files you no longer need.</p>
<p>try clearing the Xbox 360 Hard Drive cache. </p>
<p>With the Xbox 360 Hard Drive attached to the console, follow these steps: </p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Locate the System section of the Xbox 360 Dashboard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Select Memory, select Hard Drive, and then press Y to view the device options screen.
</p>
<p>c. Select the Clear Cache option</p>
<p>Additional cache clearing</p>
<p>It is possible, that the console has a corrupt update download cache. </p>
<p>You can clear any failed updates by turning off your console, pressing and holding the small synch button next to the Memory Unit slots, and then turning on the console while still keeping the synch button pressed.
</p>
<p>This will clear the update cache, and force the Xbox to redownload any failed update again.
</p>
<p>To fix number 2:</p>
<p>Clear your download queue on xbox.com <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/Queue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
live.xbox.com/.../Queue</a> you can always restart any downloads later.</p>
<p>Fix number 3:</p>
<p>If that does not fix the issue. &nbsp;You will need to look at your router. &nbsp; If you have a separate router and separate modem, &nbsp; then try connecting your xbox directly to your modem; &nbsp;just to get the updates. &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have the updates, you can connect it
 back to your router. &nbsp; &nbsp;You may want to investigate the proper settings for your router to work fully on Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Fix number 4:</p>
<p>If connecting to the modem still does not fix the issue, check your account status for expired credit cards or other issues.</p>
<p>If all else fails:</p>
<p>You can also check the instructions at this site for other ways to install the update</p>

    <title>Windows 10 notebook not showing up in network devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr lambert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 notebook not showing up in network devices</h2>
                    My HP Envy notebook is not being displayed in the list of network devices. I can connect to it using LogMeIn and sync files with LogMeIn. All my other computers with Windows 10 and in fact all devices on the network are displayed as devices and aside from
 having to supply credentials (the first time I connect) to open them and view shared folders all seems to be working normally. All was OK before upgrade to Windows 10. What settings do I need to look for to make it visible on the network.

            I experienced the same problem with the most recent update of Windows 10.&nbsp; I tried all of the other suggestions and nothing worked.&nbsp; Then I noticed that the update had changed the driver on my Marvel Yukon 88E8056 Ethernet Controller.&nbsp; I uninstalled the
 driver that Windows 10 had installed and reinstalled the older driver.&nbsp; After that, everything was magically visible on my network.&nbsp; Hopefully, this resolution will work for others.&nbsp; Don't forget to download and save all the drivers before you make the change
 however, in case you can't get back on the Internet.&nbsp; That way, you can always revert back to the driver Windows 10 installed.&nbsp;
