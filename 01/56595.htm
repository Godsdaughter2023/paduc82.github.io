<h2>            How do I seperate OneDrive Documents and File Explorer Documents&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I just reinstalled Windows 10 Pro and have a problem. My 2 Documents folders (OneDrive and regular) are combined. When I install things, it automatically saves them to OneDrive. I would like to use the Regular Documents folder in File Explorer. I can
 unpin OneDrive and pin Documents but when&nbsp; I run CCleaner or update it reverts back to the OneDrive Documents. So does anyone know how I can separate these folders permanently? I might have to wait till October 17th when the Fall update comes out. Maybe that
 will fix it. This is probably an easy question. Please reply. Thanks

            Hi Schism.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This tutorial will show you how to restore the default location of the Shell User folders:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a> even if you need to resconstruct them from scratch.  So don't fear losing them because they are ALWAYS recoverable using one of SHawn's options there.  
<br />
<br />Once you have your User folders back then you can look at OneDrive folder to see if it still has it's Pictures and Documents folders and if not and you want them just add them back by rightclicking an empty area of the folder to create new Folder by those names.  These are not Shell folders so they dont' need special iconography or registry keys.  Any folder or file can be put in Onedrive folder.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, thanks for your reply. I checked your link and I'm not sure how it works. My OneDrive is under C:/Users/MyName/Onedrive which I think is fine. My other Documents is under C:/Users/MyName/Documents which is also fine. I guess my only problem is that
 OneDrive Documents show up on Quick Access. I want to pin other Documents permanently to Quick Access. And I guess I'll have to Install new stuff under C:/Users/MyName/Documents. I'm not sure if I read the article correctly because the Default is not what
 I want. (The above locations are correct.) Any ideas?

<h2>            List of Windows 10 bugs</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. At first all seemed ok except for one or two third party programs that no longer worked. But a few days later several Windows problem appeared and it seems as if new bugs showed up every day.</p>
<p>the first thing to stop working was the search. Then the start menu would act up and had to be fixed with sfc /scannow, this no longer fixes it so i now can't access the start menu at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i login to the admin account both of these things work so it seems my main account is corrupted. In the many hours i have spent searching for possible solutions some have suggested creating a new user and moving user files from the corrupted account.
 Seems it's a cheap workaround but worth it if it works, problem is i can't add a new user, i click on the option and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would roll back to Windows 7 but this doesn't work either as it claims files are missing even while i have not removed any, and the old windows folder is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if none of these bugs can be fixed i am destined to do a new install of Windows 10 and losing many of my programs along with all settings as i no longer have the install cds for some of them and would maybe have to buy them again or do without them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system restore is not possible since only one shows up and it's too recent and should have the same bugs. Windows reset does not keep my programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the ones i can recall at the moment. I guess i am also to blame, should have upgraded much later or not upgraded at all.</p>

            <p>Thought i would share this in case it helps anyone with the same issues. As a last resort attempt i downloaded the Windows 10 iso, placed it on a secondary drive and mounted it with Poweriso. I then browsed to the mounted drive and double clicked the setup
 exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the install setup had run its pre-install steps it asked me what i wanted to keep. There's a option to select exactly what is to be kept, i selected the first option, files and apps. The install started but displayed as being an upgrade. Once the setup
 finished (it took awhile). Everything was back. The next day Edge was missing again, but this time sfc and dism worked. So far all seems ok. We'll see.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 indefinite boot up circle dots - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greysonhas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 indefinite boot up circle dots</h2>
                    <p>The first time this happened was back in early February and I tried everything I could to get pass the boot up screen. I looked up multiple questions online to see how to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just recently a few days ago I tried coming back to it to see what I could do. I finally found a solution that would let me get to system recovery by holding down the power button twice then the third time it booted it would automatically go into the system
 recovery screen. Nothing seemed to work so I did my last and only option: factory reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked. Everything was working fine. I just had to redownload everything that I already had before and it seemed to be fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just woke up this morning AND ITS DOING THE EXACT SAME THING AGAIN. I can't explain how frustrated I am with my system. I have never seen a computer do this before. Ever. Can someone please help me? I have been trying to fix it all day and I feel I'm going
 to be pulling my hair out any second. Thanks</p>

            I really don't know. Like I said I had to go to the recovery setttings by hard resetting it 3 times, then factory resetting my whole system. 2 terabytes worth of software. So I suppose I had the new update because I factory reset? But if you are asking
 if any update went through a few months ago when it happened, then I don't really remember.

<p>
</p><p>I bought a brand new Lenovo E540, which came with Windows 8.1. It was working 100% , but yesterday I turned it off and then the evening when I turned it on the laptop did a disk recovery of some sorts " fixing disk errors" after that was done my Wi-Fi doesnt
 work it just shows that it is turned of. I can not enable it manually , also did the trouble shooting for it , without any sucsess . I finally found the system restore setting but nothing happens when I click on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating as the laptop isn't even a week old.</p>
<p>

                    I want to set up several Virtual Machines with Windows 7 Ultimate, for testing various versions of SQL Server.
<br />
<br />
I will only ever run one Virtual Machine at a time. <br />
<br />
Can I do this with one Windows 7 Ultimate license? How do I accomplish this?<br />

<h3> luciannesarson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multifinger gestures not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo ideapad 510S-14ISK which was recently repaired due to a corruption of the operating system. Since I received it back, however, the multifinger gestures on the synaptics touchpad have not been working. I have tried reinstalling the latest
 drivers from the Lenovo website, and have checked all the settings however nothing seems to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go onto the touchpad settings- additional settings- device settings, it will open the synaptics control panel but all of the options to select scroll speeds etc are greyed out (as shown below), and I cannot click on anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Lucianne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recommend updating your driver again. However, this time, let Windows update the driver for you. This way, it will download the latest compatible driver for your device. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;button, type<strong>&nbsp;Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Right-click</strong> the name of the device, and select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
If the issue would still persist, I'd like to ask on what is the current OS build is your Windows 10 running on. To find out which version of Windows your PC is running, press
<strong>Windows logo key + R</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, then select <strong>
OK</strong>.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>
        </p>

            When you say restart your PC and windows will&nbsp;<strong>attempt</strong> to reinstall the driver, does this mean it may not work? I do not have an external mouse here so I do not want to risk the touchpad stopping working completely.

            <p><b><span>Hi HomerPada,</span></b></p>
<p><span>Happy to see you in Microsoft community. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to help you by posting your query in Microsoft
 community. I will guide you how to troubleshoot the issue of youcam in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make model of the computer and webcam?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known
 as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Note:
</b></p>
<p>After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow Step3 to start the computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</p>
<p>Method2:</p>
<p>I suggest you to uninstall the driver and reinstall it.</p>
<p><b><span>Follow the steps provided to uninstall the Youcam driver.</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Move the mouse to bottom left corner and right-click on the ‘Start icon’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Select ‘device manager’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Expand ‘Imaging’ and right-click on ‘webcam ‘and select ‘uninstall’.</span></p>
<p>If the issue still persists please feel free to post us. We are here to help you.</p>

<p>As far as I know, Microsoft made the "free" upgrade available until mid-2016, but was "extended" until end-2017. But that was it. After that, you have no choice but to purchase a legitimate copy of Windows 10. If you purchase the upgrade, that depends on
 what your running (Home, Pro, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option is really just to buy the software and do a complete wipe out/install on your computer. Windows 10 should have all the drivers necessary for your computer.</p>

<h2>            RDP trouble</h2>
                    I have been able to use rdp until recently (maybe prior to the recent Windows 10 update?). &nbsp;I haven't changed anything on the target computer--it still says remote connections are ok. &nbsp;I have checked the modem settings, and the desktop in question is still
 designated to receive rdp connection on 3389 both udp and tcp. &nbsp;My external ip hasn't changed--I can successfully ping it. &nbsp;I get the "Remote desktop cannot connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons", etc. &nbsp;From within the network, I can connect
 without problem, using either the computer name or the network ip, but that doesn't help if I need to connect when travelling. &nbsp;I am out of ideas, and hope someone out there can help! &nbsp;Thanks.

<p>Eric, thanks for taking a look at this for me. I am working on this from home, so I have turned on my phone's hotspot and am connected to that on my laptop for these tests, remembering that I cannot connect using the external ip from within the local network
 (I have been able to connect using hotspot in the past). &nbsp;To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;When trying to connect from my phone (via MS Remote Desktop 8.1.56.294): &nbsp;"We couldn't connect to the remote PC because the PC can't be found. &nbsp;Please provide the fully-qualified name or the IP address of the remote PC, and then try again". &nbsp;Error code:
 0x104</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to connect from my laptop I get the standard error popup screen:</p>
<p>Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Remote access to the server is not enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2) The remote computer is turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3) The remote computer is not available on the network.</p>
<p>Make sure the remote computer is turned on and connected to the network, and that remote access is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I have not tried rolling back latest update--not sure precisely when the problem occurred, but as last resort I can do that. &nbsp;I assume the computer on which the problem resides is the target desktop, since I get the same failure to connect from multiple
 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Windows version on both laptops: Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.540)</p>

</p><p>That's the Creators Update and others are having all kinds of problems with local networking, especially with old devices that require SMB1Protocol.&nbsp; You might want to think about downgrading to W10 Anniversary Update (your Desktop version), unless you want
 to try diagnosing your case to find a workaround.&nbsp; In any case be aware that there are known problems with networking W10 CU to other versions of Windows.&nbsp; In the case of Remote Desktop specifically, yet again I had to diagnose a firewall issue (that a troubleshooter
 could not find or would not fix) before I could connect (and that was just locally; who knows what hoops you will need to jump through to use it remotely.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops.&nbsp; I forgot.&nbsp; Only Enterprise users are allowed to stay away from this version.&nbsp; Consumers are stuck with it as it is the new "production" version.&nbsp; So, looks like you will have to "diagnose your case to find a workaround" after all (or give up on using
 that functionality.)&nbsp; Probably your Desktop is not being upgraded because of some detected hardware incompatibilities that keep it back leveled.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Video Project - Lost Photos in Video Project for Grandfather&#39;s Wake&#58; HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a video in Microsoft Video Projects using photos for my grandfather's wake next week. All of the photos I used are were from a folder saved on my desktop, and they're still in the folder on my desktop. However, when I go to the video, none of the
 photos are in there, instead it says ":( We Can't Find This File" where each photo should be. I do believe I may have changed the name of the folder on my desktop which may have caused the issue, however I don't remember what the original name of the folder
 was to change it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? I spent about 8 hours creating this and am really hoping i don't need to re-do it all again! The wake is next week as well, so hoping to resolve this asap. HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Courtney</p>

            Hi Courtney
<br />
<br />In the error you are seeing 'We can't find this file' is the original folder name not listed on that error?
<br />
<br />If that is listed on that error, you need to change the folder name back to that name in order for the app to find those resources . . .

            Thank you. Yes thats what it says. Unfortunately I dont remember what the folder was called previously so I cant simply change it back. Is there any other way, perhaps to see what it “thinks” the folder is called?

<p>Did the PC just do an update ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the photos .jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open C:\ </p>
<p>or C:\Users</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the search box type in</p>
<p>.jpg</p>
<p>or try these extensions if you do not know the file extensions.</p>
<p>,bmp</p>
<p>.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you see one of the photos, look where it shows the folder or location it is in and then go to that folder by right clicking on one of the files and select OPEN FOLDER/FILE LOCATION</p>
<p>
</p><p>And making a video project out of photos saves the project in a file type for the program you are using until you actually create the video. This is so when you have an incomplete project, you can save the project and come back later to finish it and then
 rip it into a video. If you move the photos before you complete the project, then the project file can not find and load the photos to finish the project. The video will probably be mp4.

<br />Did you at any time open any of those files in an other application like Paint?

<p>That is what I thought. Did you rename or move the folder that the photos are in. And exactly what program are you using to create this video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you state, they were still on my desktop.</p>
<p>DESKTOP as in what ??? directly on desktop, or a folder on desktop ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you had a folder on your desktop with the photo files, or did you actually load some files from another location like your pictures folder or load files from 2 locations ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open the project file and it tries to load all the files for the project, what message do you get.</p>
<p>Example </p>
<p>the .... can not find the files in C:\Users\YOUR NAME\FOLDER NAME </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it gives you a folder name, see if it matches the current folder name. If not, rename the folder to match what the program is showing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looks like a better place to be asking about this is in a forum where this app is supported.&nbsp; Otherwise, my tack would be first checking to see if there are any clues in the Event log for this program or programs of its type.&nbsp; If that is not enough you could
 run ProcMon to try to find out what path is being used which causes the error message to be generated.&nbsp; It's also possible that the app has its own quirky diagnostics which is why asking in a forum where there is likely to be more informed help would make
 sense; however, again, ProcMon would help you discover the nature of such diagnostics.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you may have to give us a more precise name for the app you are using but see if this previous Answer helps</p>

    <title>HDMI Input causing intermittent Audio and Video signal loss issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDMI Input causing intermittent Audio and Video signal loss issues</h2>
                    When using my xbox with my Sky+HD box connected via the HDMI input, I experience Audio loss off around 3 seconds after the Video feed flickers for a split second, sometimes the video feed completely fails also for around 3 seconds. This happens wether
 I am watching TV or playing a game on a disc or a downloaded game. This happens at seemingly random times, it can go a few hours without occurring or can only go 10 minutes without happening. I have tried changing HDMI cables and the port I use on my tv to
 no avail. Changing the xbox output to 720p fixes this but who wants to play games or watch tv at 720p??? My xbox works perfectly fine in 1080p as long as I don't have anything connected to the HDMI Input. Any ideas? I want to be able to use this machine the
 way it was intended to be used but at the moment this is not possible.

<p>Unfortunately not, however I managed to stop this from happening by simply changing the HDMI cable. I was using the one that comes as standard with sky from the hd+ box to the xbone, and although this cable seems fine when running straight to tv the xbox
 just didnt seem to like it. Simple fix i think, it hasnt happened ever since l, touch wood

<p>Yea, I've been through three cables unfortunately for me. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>It doesn't happen often..it can go a whole week without it happening but once it starts I pretty much have to unplug the HDMI input and then replug it up and it seems to be fine for another undetermined period of time.</p>
<p>Truly annoying but I see a lot of people saying the HDMI input is touchy on their units as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for replying!</p>

<p>Hey there Malleus, sorry to hear about the frustrating experience. Have you tried a different HDMI port on your TV? Let's also check both ports (TV and console) and make sure there isn't anything stuck in there that could cause trouble with the connection.
 I've had a carpet fibre interfere with my own video feed before; sometimes that's all it takes.</p>

<p>I'm having similar issues. &nbsp;I run my ATT Uverse Cisco box through my Xbox One via HDMI and into a receiver, then from the receiver to my TV also using HDMI. &nbsp;Signal and audio loss are so frequent it's unusable. &nbsp;Out of the box I had no issues, they just
 started today. &nbsp;When I remove the Xbox one completely from the system there are no issues. &nbsp;Unplugging the HDMI then replugging it in does not resolve the issue, but even if it did this would be unacceptable. &nbsp;I'm using the HDMI cable that came with the console
 to connect it to the receiver, and all HDMI cables are clean and clear of any material.</p>

<p>Waxx1981,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about the issue. To get a better idea of what is at play here, the following information is very useful.
</p>
<p>1. Make &amp; Model of STB (cable/sat box)</p>
<p>2. TV Provider</p>
<p>3. Layout (example: STB HDMI Xbox One HDMI TV) (please note splitters and hubs).</p>
<p>HDMI 2.0 is good stuff I highly recommend it. </p>

<p>1. Cisco ISB7500</p>
<p>2. AT&amp;T</p>
<p>3. CISCO ISB7500 (HDMI) Xbox One (HDMI) Pioneer VSX-1021 (HDMI) LG LX6500</p>
<p>Removing the Xbox One eliminates the issue, and swapping HDMI cables into and out of the Xbox One does nothing. &nbsp;Signal loss is basically permanent now.</p>
<p>HDMI cable from Xbox One to receiver is the one provided with Xbox One, all other HDMI are insignia highspeed HDMI.</p>

<p>I'll keep posting this until people listen as I truly think this is the issue. &nbsp;The HDMI receptacles in the back of the console are set back too far and normal HDMI cables make a weak connection at best. &nbsp;The only known resolution at this point is to have
 MS send you another cable. &nbsp;If you don't believe me, just measure the ends of the cables. &nbsp;Hold them up to each other to compare and you will see that the ends of the MS cable is slightly longer and there fore makes a solid connection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been through all of these issues of intermittent signal loss, degrading signal loss, and from working pretty good at the start to not hardly working at all. &nbsp;I had the console replaced, tried 4 different brands of HDMI cables, a different cable box,
 etc. &nbsp;It took a while and lot of fiddling with cables but after determining that it was indeed due to a bad connection and realizing that he ports themselves were fine, I got looking at the cables. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I hate to keep hammering on this but, it really is important: HDMI 2.0, nothing less. It really makes a difference. Try from the Cisco to the Xbox One with the provided cable. Something else, try locking in a resolution of a 'p' setting. Try toggling Native
 mode (settings of the Cisco). I hate to use the shot-gun approach, but I know how you feel about the HDMI cable thing. I understand why it is unpopular, but the reality is people mostly buy cheap HDMI cables (I am very guilty of this also). Post back your
 results.</p>

<h2>            Asus laptop not loading windows 7</h2>
                    <p>My grandson has an Asus laptop operating system windows 7 HP. It has not been working properly for the last few days so on advice from his uncle he downloaded a fix program. It went through the disk and removed over 1000 items and he had a message saying
 he did not have a proper windows 7 program installed which I find quite suspicious as windows was working very well for 3 months! The outcome of this is that windows will now not load at all. Would be grateful for advice because otherwise because otherwise
 I can see he'll have no option but to go and buy another disk and get a professional to install it, and this all costs money! If anyone can help would be most grateful. (sorry I don't know who he downloaded this program from).&nbsp;</p>

            It should have a recovery partition to get it back to factory defaults (he will need to backup any data/files first). For an Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.<br />
<br />
Note: he will lose any software that he has installed.<br />
<br />
Edit - you should stay away from the tune up, registry fixer type programs as they can (as he's seen) create more problems then they fix.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>Hello Ivanhoe 2,</p>
<p>Before you go to a professional, consider trying one of these strategies:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternate #1:</p>
<p>1) It sounds like a virus has taken hold of his computer. Take your antivirus (I assume you have one!) and burn it to a bootable&nbsp;CD / DVD - instructions for doing so should be part of your antivirus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Upon starting his computer, press and hold the F12 Key, which should bring up a menu that'll let you specify where to boot from, select the CD / DVD drive, place the CD into that drive, and hit enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Run the antivirus from the boot menu. Quarantine and delete all that it finds. See if the computer will boot that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternate #2:</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, or he wants to start fresh, do the same 'boot from CD' procedure in #2 above, but insert the Windows System Disk that (hopefully) came with the laptop. Start the full install routine, but instead of actually installing the OS, select
 Full Install, and then format the C:\ drive. After the drive is formatted finish with&nbsp;a full install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternate #3:</p>
<p>Upon starting his computer, press and hold the F11 Key (it might be the F9 Key, trial and error time). This will boot the computer into the recovery mode dialog box. What he's wanting to do is format the C:\ drive and then restore the computer (the C:\ drive)
 from the Recovery Partition that is stored there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first approach assumes that a virus has taken over the computer and needs to be eradicated. Alternates 2 &amp; 3 assume that one or more viruses and/or malware have taken over the computer and that your grandson is wanting and/or willing to start over again
 with a 'clean' computer. <em>These approaches will wipe out the computer and he'll have to reload all his programs in and recreate any data files that were present.</em> Its choices he'll have to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you / he want to pursue any of these strategies, post back here and I can try to walk you through them in more depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            Windows update crash Windows 10 OS while updating AMD graphic driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to notify in the community that for those who running AMD APU with AMD Radeon (High specs, including 7970, 8970, and R9 series), The latest graphic driver will crash your Windows 10 OS (for my case, graphic driver for AMD Radeon HD 8970m)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an MSI laptop GX70 3BE with AMD APU&nbsp;A10 5750m (with embedded Radeon 8560G)&nbsp;with AMD Radeon HD 8970m. I'm currently running on multiple GPU. This system however has some problem with the latest Radeon Crimson software (ver. 16.xx) and the latest stable
 Crimson software that runs is Crimson 15.11. Also, the graphic package that can run smoothly is 15.300. This is due to the APU graphic Radeon 8560G could not support the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, when I'm working, the system force restart itself and Windows failed to load twice, thus forcing me to run recovery environment. Happens twice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve this issues, I have to hide this update from Microsoft Updates. To do this, as I search the internet, there is one tool for that in the Microsoft web page. Search for this article: KB3073930 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930). Install
 the application, run it, and choose to hide AMD graphic driver for AMD Radeon HD 8970m.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it would not update the graphic driver for the time being (and eternally)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Chiyawa</p>

    <title>Xbox Freezing Problems&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Freezing Problems&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I know there are countless other topics about people's consoles freezing but I have searched and can't find one like mine.</p>

<p>Starting from today my Xbox 360 (20gb classic version) has been freezing upon start-up, I've had this console for 6 years now and never had any problems! I have tried all of the suggested problems including the 360 freezing troubleshooter that so often gets
 linked. I have cleared my hard drive's cache, removed all USB devices and removed my hard dive. &nbsp;I have also tried different discs but it keeps freezing.</p>

<p>However then I tried using no discs, and the freezing stopped! I even played games on my hard drive like San Andreas and no freezing occurred.</p>

<p>I was hoping that someone here might be able to explain this! Is it a problem with the cooling system or the disc lazer thing?</p>

<p>I really need a solution because I'm pretty poor and can't afford the ludicrous £70 repair or a new console. Plus GTA V comes out in 3 weeks and I've been waiting for this for almost 3 years!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>So it would appear that playing games from your Hard Drive is working perfectly fine, but discs cause the Xbox to freeze up. I assume that by "discs", you are referring to game discs. Just to test, could you see if a DVD or music disc causes freezing at
 all?</p>
<p>If these cause more freezing, then it is likely a hardware fault with the DVD Drive and would need to be replaced or you would need to obtain a new console.</p>
<p>Sorry if I cannot be much more help.</p>

<p>Hey dude thanks for the reply, </p>
<p>I've tried out your suggestion of the DVD and so far so good, it's been playing for about 7 minutes with no freezing! So perhaps this is just a game disc problem? I've tested all my discs and some are in perfect condition (scratch-wise).</p>

<p>Right the DVD has been running for a good 25 minutes so I'm pretty sure that it's just game discs that cause the problem, any other help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
