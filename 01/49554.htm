<p>The reason i askis iv moved to a rural area, I connect my Xbox to my phones hotspot. And I have a 15 GB allowance. Under network settings you well find bandwidth management, then goto bandwidth usage. Play d3 for an hour and give me the figures it would
 really help out a lot lol the figures in on titanfall would be nice as well. Thanks a lot to those who reply.</p>

<p>I have nothing sensible to say other than you need to type slower or use auto correct....and anyone that uses a games console connected to a mobile device for gaming is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>I would never move where I couldn't guarantee a decent internet connection.</p>

<h2>            Compatibility between Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10.1 and windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am running Windows&nbsp; 7 with an old version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking [10.1].</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am worried about upgrading to Windows 10&nbsp; because I rely <strong>heavily </strong>
on using DNS 10.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;I searched bing and Google&nbsp; for answers but I&nbsp; only found people complaining&nbsp; about compatibility issue between Windows 10 beta&nbsp; and Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13![Dated February 2015]</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; so much</p>
<p />

<p>Thanks for the link.</p>
<p>The link&nbsp; states that Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10.1 is compatible. However&nbsp; it was voted as not compatible!</p>
<p>Kind of puzzling...</p>

            <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and my Dragon 10.1 is not compatible. &nbsp;It gives me a message that a critical error has occurred every time I open Dragon. &nbsp;I have tried repairing Dragon from the original disc as well as completely uninstalling Dragon 10.1 and reinstalling.
 &nbsp; I have done this twice. &nbsp;Each time I get the same message that a critical error has occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced now that Windows 10 and Dragon 10.1 are not compatible for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am downgrading back to Windows 7.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Was your Windows 10 the final or beta version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Was your Dragon NaturallySpeaking home, premium or professional version and did you try to contact Nuance ?</p>

            <p>So I did some trial and error and I was able to get the Dragon to work fairly well using the following instructions and link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I rescind what I stated previously. &nbsp;There is a way to make it work and unless it stops working this is the road I would recommend. &nbsp;I will update if things stop working.</p>

            I had Dragon 12.5 and upgraded to Dragon 13 professional because Dragon 12.5 did not work with Windows 10 I am writing this with Dragon 13 professional and Windows 10. Although I had to downgrade my Internet explorer to use it for the Internet. Windows
 10 has a voice program within it that works quite well though :-). My computer has frozen a few times since the upgrade to Windows 10 while using that Dragon 13 and or voice control from each subsequently froze thus I am looking for a fix myself.<br />

<p><span>If the drive that Windows is installed on (the operating system drive) is encrypted by BitLocker Drive Encryption, it can
 become locked by BitLocker and require the use of the recovery key</span></p>

<p>Apparently if the account you are on is under the age of 18 you aren't allowed to purchase paid content on it even if it has money on it like mine does. I bought BF4 premium from Gamestop and the code they gave me added 50 dollars to my account but I can't
 use them because my account isn't over 18 yet. Thankfully I talked to support the other day and my account is getting changed to one that would be over 18 in the next couple days but I do believe they should change this because there is also no way to get
 a refund from whoever you bought the code from because you would have already used the code but can't use the money on the code.
</p>
<p>They should have stayed with the way it was on 360 in my opinion. </p>

            <p>Hi Omkhant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the volume mixer is not working and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you referring to Windows volume mixer or any 3rd party app?</li><li>Do you receive any error message?</li><li>If so, what is the complete error message?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in sound settings or in the computer?</li></ul>
<p>If you are referring to Windows volume mixer, it could be possible that sound device controllers are corrupted/missing. Let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run Audio troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Run <strong>inbuilt audio troubleshooter</strong> and check if it works. Follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows Key +R</strong>, type
<strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type<strong> troubleshooting </strong>
in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now click on <strong>view all</strong> option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Playing audio</strong> and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let's run the hardware troubleshooter and check if that helps. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W’</strong> and type ‘<strong>troubleshooting</strong>’ in the search and press enter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on ‘Hardware and Sound’ and select ‘<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>’ and click on ‘next’ to run the
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Now try to update the audio driver to the latest by visiting computer Manufacturer website.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot state</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>Wow, thanks for the awesome feedback guys. I'd make others, but it took a while. It was neither an easy nor quick process. Adobe Photoshop sure makes it easier than it would have been though with a lot of their tools. Isolating things out, like the longshot,
 and the omen, and the cog tags, from photos I Googled is incredibly easy with the magic wand. Throw in a little creativity, using multiple layers, a lot of drop shadowing, and a Googled Gears of War font, and voila! I do have the psd file and the Gears of
 War font, so if anyone wants one of those two files, just let me know.</p>

<h2>            BitLocker Decryption interrupted by system restart. now it&#39;s shown as incompatible</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 on a lenovo thinkpad and have a partition in my laptop hdd encrypted with bitlocker. Today I decided to remove the bitlocker encryption. Recognizing the fact that the encryption would always continue after a system restart, I did
 it. and now I regret it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps showing the message: The Bitlocker encryption on this drive is not compatible with your version of windows. Try opening the drive with a newer version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This honestly shouldnt happen and I could unlock it before the restart so I am suspecting something during the restart went wrong ....</p>
<p>I have checked my windows update and it should all be up-to-date but it's still not running... even after multiple restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if anyone has any solution.</p>

<p>Hi Thank you for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the domain could be an issue I was connected my laptop to a work domain.<br />
That being said, I have solved it by just formatting the drive and recovered most of the file from my backup. Thank you for your kind help!</p>

 chrome and other browsers. &nbsp;I was told to look for certain files but they are not there. My word program is also acting up without any input from myself. I keep reading how great windows 10 is but this is not my experience/ Anyone having similar experiences
 and do you have any solutions?

    <title>I want to install a printer program designed for Win 95&#47;98 on a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poliger  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to install a printer program designed for Win 95&#47;98 on a computer with Win XP Pro., service pak 3.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I recently bought a new (well, new to me) used computer with a Windows XP Professional, service pak 3 OS.</p>
<p>My issue is that I wanted to use my old but serviceable Lexmark Z11 printer and its printer installation software (designed for Windows 95/98).&nbsp;I had no problem installing the printer but when I tried to load the software, I discovered there was no install
 button to begin the download. After searching through the XP help file, I discovered the "Program Compatibility Wizard" which restored the "Install" button. As I began the installation process, the download came to an abrupt halt with the error message, "File
 Error....Cannot find SETUPX.DLL"</p>
<p>I suppose I should be happy that the printer works without the Lexmark Printer Installation Software, but I sure would like to use it if there is a way around the error message.</p>
<p>Lexmark offers no technical solution to this problem other than to say "Your printer is obsolete but we can give you a 30% discount on a new one!".</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can offer.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input Pal. The problem is not the lack of a driver because the printer was installed although I have yet to make it print (am going to take the printer to another computer to see if the fault is with the printer or cable.).</p>
<p>The problem I have is with the printer applications software which I would like to be able to use but am unable to load because of the file error message, "Cannot find SETUPX.DLL". Do you know how I can correct this error?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Whilst Lexmark site has a winxp driver, it doesnt have the winxp software that available under win9*. Therefore its unlikely that the origonal software will install.</p>
<p>I assume winupdate has been run for Important updates, and they have all installed successfully. You might also run the System File checker - see win help</p>

<h2>            Webcam problem on Sony VPCEH2J1E</h2>
                    Hi everyone!<br />
I'm owner of a Sony VPCEH2J1E. Before several months I upgraded my pc from Windows 7 to Windows 8 Pro. Everything worked fine. 4 days ago and during a conversation on Skype, the webcam stopped working properly. I had a reboot done, I uninstalled and reinstalled
 the driver but it's not working either.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?<br />

            You really, really should KEEP 8.1, (imaged somewhere) you'll find that 10 may be a catastrophe as many like me have and need to switch back to make your stuff work again. If you wait past the 30 day window to switch back and find major problems with 10,
 you'll really be screwed.

<h2>            Run Wizard error &#58; OX80040111 - Classfactory Cannot supply requested class</h2>
                    Last night my computer would not boot. Eventually it did but I can no longer get onto the internet.
<br />
I installed Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit last Thursday and Norton Internet security 2010 on Saturday. On Sunday it said I needed to perform a backup. I tried backing up to my D drive but this was too small. Using downloaded software I resized the partion first
 to 30Gb then to 100Gb (having first defragmented with downloaded software). The D drive was still too small. I performed a backup to an external drive yesterday which seemed to go ok. However less than one hour later the computer lost its connection to the
 net and when I checked out the router (which was still working and a laptop was still on the net with a wireless signal) on the desktop I was given the following error message: Run Wizard Error: OX80040111 - ClassFactory cannot supply requested class. Does
 anyone know how this can be fixed. Would a re-installation of Windows 7 help (is a re-installation possible using the same dvd?)

<span>Hi Albion67,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Disable any security programs and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Check if any third party softwares are causing this problem.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; for a&nbsp; confirmation, type the password, or click <strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.&nbsp;Under
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>, click to clear the
<strong><span>Load Startup Items</span></strong> check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab, click to select the
<strong><span>Hide All Microsoft Services</span></strong> check box, and then click
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Disable All</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5.&nbsp;Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6.&nbsp;When you are prompted, click <strong><span>Restart</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Log back into your Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem does not return while your computer is in clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing interference. You
 can try to determine which background program is causing the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To find the process or program at cause follow the steps starting at
<strong><span>enable half of the Services items</span></strong>, from the following article:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;Refer this link for more information:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
 &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To restore your
<strong><span>Normal </span></strong>startup:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1 .Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;2. On the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click<strong><span> Normal Startup</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;3. When you are prompted, click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If this doesn’t work, then you can do a system restore.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point
 in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.
<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>1.Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>system restore</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>System Restore</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.<br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Continue</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>2.In the
<strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you own the games on the system it does not cost anything in order to play them as long as they are single player games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing the subscriptions are for is if your grandson wants to play online with other players from around the world in multiplayer games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case there are what is called pre paid cards for the subscription that can be bought at retail stores this way you would not have to put credit/debit card information on your grandsons account.</p>

    <title>A Leading Retailer&#39;s view on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Leading Retailer&#39;s view on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>(1) I'm still trying to get help to resolve&nbsp;the major problems that the latest Windows Updates have inflicted on my new Win10 laptop. [Separate thread]</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Experts on other Forums have linked me to articles in the PC/Technology media warning users not to install Updates (How - we have no choice, do we?) and so implying that I'm to blame for these problems by not taking the advice of those&nbsp;experts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) I'm running out of space on my desktop to store new documents as I've no idea if I should use the (now-empty) folders in my Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) My email In-Box is seriously swamped with "There's been a reply on the XYZ thread". That
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>is</strong></span> my fault because I feel that I'm spending my entire life reading and posting here and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can imagine how I felt when I received an email this morning (5.11 pm here) from the major retailer who sold me my new PC at Christmas without telling me about the year-old issues with Win10 (about which they must have known). "UPGRADE AND SAVE" they
 said, with some spectacular Win10 offers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to their Facebook site and asked "I'm really interested in buying a new Windows 10. Are there any problems with it that you know of? (I really like Windows 7)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And their reply? "Hi, its a big jump from 7. That being said its all about just playing with it as much possible and getting used to it.
<strong>There is no major issues, although, take a look through their forums, possibly the best indicator of current issues.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there you are. I must be having a bad dream - none of my Win10 problems have really happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you ask your Retailer the same question?</p>
<p />

            Windows 10 has now passed the 100,000,000 installations point and OS market share continues to increase.&nbsp; I think the great majority of users have not had "major" issues, which is not to say that there have not been big issues for some.&nbsp; It's really no
 different from any other release of a new Windows version, and many of the people who have had problems have brought them on themselves in one way or another.&nbsp; Microsoft shares culpability in this due to the incessant nagging to upgrade without any hint of
 a warning that an in-place upgrade is a very risky proposition.&nbsp; You can't really use the posts in these forums as evidence of widespread failure;&nbsp; no one goes to the hospital emergency room to tell the doctors how good they feel.

            <p>Hello Jim.&nbsp;You are&nbsp;an Insider and a Win10 Launch expert and I&nbsp;respect your comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm merely a&nbsp;customer, an Outsider so it seems but I have to disagree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[1] <strong><em>"I think the great majority of users have not had "major" issues".
</em></strong>What evidence have you to support this? I'm not just referring to the latest Windows Updates that screwed up my new Win 10 PC - many others too - but also to the&nbsp;fiasco caused by the upgrade to Win10 from Win7/8. Look at the two largest threads
 here ('Start Menu won't work' &amp; 'Critical Error - Start Menu has failed') - the problems have been known about for over a year but still haven't been resolved. Major Retailers must be aware of them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[2]<strong> </strong><strong><em>"You can't really use the posts in these forums as evidence of widespread failure;&nbsp; no one goes to the hospital emergency room to tell the doctors how good they feel."
</em></strong>You say that but how many&nbsp;ordinary customers have the nous to come here to complain? How many of them&nbsp;are actually aware of this excellent forum? They're more likely to have gone back to the retailer and will probably be paying for help. Or else
 they'll say nowt but tell everyone how poor Microsoft is and then go to Apple next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>It's really no different from any other release of a new Windows version."</em></strong>&nbsp; So why didn't Microsoft come clean up front and advertise this as Beta* - which is what it is, isn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm told that Beta means "a program or upgrade to a program that is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>not quite ready for prime time</strong></span> and is being tested by volunteers before being released to the public
</strong>Or is my understanding wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I would not have bought it. I do NOT use beta software as I've no desire to be a guinea pig - unless the PCs were sold at a massive discount. Microsoft in the old days would have tested everything to a much higher standard - it's all about bottom line
 now</p>
<p>
</p><p>[3] <em><strong>"many of the people who have had problems have brought them on themselves in one way or another".
</strong></em>What exactly do you mean by this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[4]<strong> "Microsoft shares culpability in this due to the incessant nagging to upgrade without any hint of a warning that an in-place upgrade is a very risky proposition."</strong> I agree and would add "also by forcing users to accept Automatic Updates."
 When I think more about this, there must be consumer protection legislation in the USA and UK that would allow customers to be compensated if they are damaged by Updates which are known to be a risky proposition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I was going to put this is a separate thread but now we've raised Automatic Updates, may I ask you a question? The only choice we have is either 'Install Now' or 'Install Later' - what's the longest period we can delay the Updates please? Then it's a
 straight choice between get security holes plugged now or wait and see how much damage the updates cause.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>I frankly get a little tired of references to the "ordinary" or "average" customer, especially when the reference is often a euphemism for "ill-informed,"&nbsp; and I'm being charitable with that characterization. It's not my fault or Microsoft's that many
 people are willfully ignorant. &nbsp; But let's look at scale once again.&nbsp; Let's say that of the 1,000,000 hypothetical people who've had problems, 95% are unaware of these forums.&nbsp; That leaves 50,000 who are aware.&nbsp; Not all of the people who know that the forums
 exist will actually use them, so we can say that some number less than 50,000 people is what we see here.&nbsp; That sounds about right, no?&nbsp;

 combinations and permutations of hardware, software, malware.&nbsp; Do you know of a way to test every possible scenario?&nbsp; As for Microsoft "in the old days" testing to a higher standard, there were far more problems with the initial release of XP than there have

</strong></em>What exactly do you mean by this?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What I mean is that the aforementioned "ordinary user" often has a PC that's infested with malware, isn't aware of the need to make sure that there are Windows 10 drivers available for their hardware, think that their XP-era&nbsp; (or earlier) software is
 going to be compatible forever, have system drives that are too small and/or nearly full, and have never backed up their data, let alone made a system image before embarking on the upgrade.

<p>
</p><p>[4]<strong> "Microsoft shares culpability in this due to the incessant nagging to upgrade without any hint of a warning that an in-place upgrade is a very risky proposition."</strong> I agree and would add "also by forcing users to accept Automatic Updates."
 When I think more about this, there must be consumer protection legislation in the USA and UK that would allow customers to be compensated if they are damaged by Updates which are known to be a risky proposition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I was going to put this is a separate thread but now we've raised Automatic Updates, may I ask you a question? The only choice we have is either 'Install Now' or 'Install Later' - what's the longest period we can delay the Updates please? Then it's a
 straight choice between get security holes plugged now or wait and see how much damage the updates cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I, and most other users, share your disdain for automatic updates.&nbsp; Once updates are available, it's usually only a matter of hours that they can be delayed.&nbsp; I think this is something that Microsoft needs to rethink, but the reason for it is (once again)
 the "ordinary user" who has updates turned off or fails to download/install them when they're available, thus creating security issues for everyone.&nbsp;

            <p>(1) Can you break down your "100M installations" between New and Upgraded? I doubt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) So having 1m failures is "Excellent"? Gee Whiz!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) You say you are a 'little tired of references to the "ordinary" or "average" customer, especially when the reference is often a euphemism for "ill-informed,"&nbsp; and I'm being charitable with that characterization. It's not my fault or Microsoft's that
 many people are willfully ignorant." You are engaging in semantics - it should be obvious that by 'ordinary' I meant the typical end-user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.1 That most don't know the difference between RAM &amp; ROM is no reason for you to call them 'ill-informed' or 'willfully ignorant'. I would say that End-users usually haven't the technical understanding or skill of the product designers. Do you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.2 Microsoft has Competencies related, presumably, to having a job with it. There are four Proficiency levels, from Level 1 (Basic) to Level 4 (Expert). Level 1 is described as "Has and uses the required functional and technical knowledge and skills necessary
 to do his or her job", "Chooses appropriate tools or technology for the task" and "Has the capability and knowledge base to share technical skills with others".<br />
What percentage of what I now refer to as 'typical End-Users" would even attain Level 1? Does Microsoft know? (Do they have CSat figures?) Do you know? The point that I'm trying to make is that we ordinary customers shouldn't have to be an expert in rocket
 science to use a PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3.3 And Microsoft Level 4 programmers can't even produce Windows Updates that cause such damage nor resolve the Failed Start icon after 13 months?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Beta - is my understanding right or wrong? Yes or No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.I totally agree with your comment about "infestested with Malware". Mine isn't - so please tell me how many of the 1M failures you mention are due to Malware infestation. You can't possibly know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. And don't you think it's ironic that you criticise people with inadequate/no security
<br />
when most of the damage caused by the 'Free Upgrade" is being blamed on customers' security programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. You criticise ordinary users for having PCs with inadequate drivers. Microsoft emails telling them that they should upgrade said Microsoft had checked their PCs and they were OK to be upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. You criticise ordinary users for 'not backing up their data, let alone made a system image before upgrade. The email I had from Microsft took a different tack to earlier ones - it said along the lines of "OK - we see you haven't upgraded yet so why not
 just download Win10 and install it later at your leisure". I pressed OK and it&nbsp;went ahead&nbsp;installed Win10. Another lie and I had no time to backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. And did Microsoft&nbsp;warn ordinary users that they should make a system image/backup first? No. It was a simple single click. Whose fault then? Microsoft, for being so determind to force Win10 on the entire universe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. I'd selected Automatic Updates - not now - but the first that I knew of the Windows Updates was a note that my PC was scheduled to have them a day if not two later. Presumably Microsoft could not cope with having to updates 100M PCs in a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited to add: Do <strong>you</strong> think that Retailers should hide from potential customers the problems?</p>

            <p>So what you're telling us, in a nutshell, is that you need help learning how to use Windows 10. That's fair. Most people find technology complicated and frightening. And if it's been a while since you've tried the latest technology, it's even more complicated
 and frightening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice is: take your time. You're not going to master Windows 10 in a day or even in a month. Buy a book, take a course, do what works for you. Take it slow. You'll get there.</p>

            I've tried in the most sensible way that I can to answer your points, but I think that the problem is that your argument assumes its own conclusion, that being that there are problems with Windows 10 that are more widespread than anyone is letting on.&nbsp;
 This is given away by your question about whether retailers should "hide" problems from potential customers.&nbsp; You have not demonstrated that anything of significance is being hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you make an argument that assumes its own conclusion, you can never
 be wrong.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>That's a very fair comment. Although I'm not at all frightened by technology, perhaps moving from Win 7 put me at a disadvantage as some of the improvements were already in Win8. Then having been&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;deceived into upgrading my Win7 to Win10 and was
 immediately&nbsp;hit by the Critical Error - Failed Start Menu. That was mid-December and I was having to spend between ten and twelve hours a day trying out all the workarounds, all of which failed. I didn't try the Clean Install to be fair and have no idea if
 that worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It was only early in January that I felt comfortable enough to set up my new Win10 and then last week came the debacle of the Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_search/start-menu-doesnt-appear/a7c56613-277c-4993-bb74-08650dce7b21?page=73">
posted here</a> that despite all my moans, I am getting used to Win10, am fast becoming a convert and would spend extra money to increase my GHz (if that is possible on an OEM PC ) if it would improve performance. So - yes you're right - I'll check my Kindle
 later to see if Amazon have any decent books about Win10.</p>

            <p>It's clear to me that there <strong>are&nbsp;</strong>problems with Windows 10, unless you believe that Windows Updates screwing up Win10 PCs is OK, or that the "Critical error - Failed Start" still unresolved after over twelve months is OK and that not even
 MVPs can come up with workarounds that actually work is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the way, my definition of Beta that I posted <strong>is</strong> correct - it's Microsoft's own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's agree to disagree.</p>
