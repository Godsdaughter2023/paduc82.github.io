<h2>            Please fix problem with headset and mic not working in xbox one s</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>This seems like a common problem among many user. We have all tried the troubleshooting guides mentioned online and in this communtiy forum. All of our controllers, headsets and mics work. &nbsp;Everything was working fine for years and one day doesnâ€™t work.
 No sound from headset and can not game chat. Stereo adapter does not work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this is problem with xbox updates or internal. Under devices&gt;controller the volume is greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really hope this issue will be resolved. So sad not to be able to game chat</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>if anyone has succesfully fixed this issue please let me know howðŸ˜Š</p>

            I've been having the same problem with both of my xbox one consoles. We have tried EVERYTHING. Unplugging, resetting, checked the headsets on other devices, and nothing fixes this. I am convinced that one of the updates pushed out about 4weeks ago caused
 this issue. There is no other explanation to having both consoles stop working at the same time. It's extremely frustrating and I'm really hoping MicroSoft figures out the issue. I've contacted them and all I get are the same troubleshooting steps that everyone
 has posted. Nothing works.&nbsp;

            It can be the controller jacks themselves. They can wear out over time. Does the headset work on any other controller? Are you able to try that?

<p>Hi Nessy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of troubleshooting. You may have already done some and there may be some you haven't tried. Number 9 usually seems to work in this situation.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>1.) power cycle console</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>2.)</span></span><span><span>Go
 to settings&gt; Kinect and Devices&gt; Devices and Accessories&gt; [...]&gt; Assign controller to account&gt; Update control&gt; unassign account&gt; test headset/chat</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>3.)</span></span><span><span>Make
 sure mic is "ON" Press the home button&gt; go to the Gear on the&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>menu&gt; Audio&gt; Turn Mic off and on. OR go to settings</span></span><span><span>&gt;
 Kinect and Devices&gt; Devices and Accessories&gt; [...]&gt;</span></span><span><span>Audio&gt; Mic on&gt; Adjust volume.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>4.)</span></span><span><span>You
 can test your controller if it is broken by "Buzzing" the controller. The buzz feature is connected to the headset port, and if the controller does not buzz then the port may be damaged.
</span></span><span><span>[Turning on Vibration if it does not "Buzz"&gt; Settings&gt; Ease of Access&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Controller&gt; Vibration Settings&gt; Turn on Vibration].</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>5.)</span></span><span><span>Some
 mics are detachable and may be damaged so try testing the headset on another device to see if it works (Example: windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Test
 the Headset with Skype Test or Voice Recorder). If there is an issue with using the headset on an Xbox controller,&nbsp; you can try using a headset adaptor.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>6.) Make sure there is no Enforcement on the account.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>7.) Make sure the controller is not full of dust in the headset
 port (you can use compressed air to clear the dust).</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>8..) Make sure controller is fully charged/ change battery
 type.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>9.) Use a headset adapter or standard headphones (Main fix)</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>10) Soft or full console reset. (may not work all the time)</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>glad I am not alone. Same issue here. Head-sets work fine on all other devices but not recognised by the controllers.</p>
<p>An old not working x-box headset is recognised however so not the socket.</p>
<p>

<p>Update!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having trouble finding the Microsoft brand xbox adapter. So i went to Best Buy and bought a Turtle Beach headset audio contoller plus but made for Xbox one. And....it worked! Fixed the problem! Yeah! &nbsp;But $40 to fix when all was working just fine before..</p>
<p>at least my son is happy!&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf52413f-2f60-43af-bdf6-e6d2835521ea?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf52413f-2f60-43af-bdf6-e6d2835521ea?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            HELP&#33;   Windows 8.1 Internet Connection Problems</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today I have "upgraded" from windows 8 to windows 8.1. &nbsp;However, since the update, I have not been able to access any web pages when using the Ethernet cable in my room. &nbsp;And when I was in the library, the wifi lost connection about every 5 minutes. &nbsp;
 I have been trying to revert back to windows 8. &nbsp;But I am the furthest thing from tech-savy and this does not seem like a very easy task... maybe there is an easier solution? &nbsp;Being a university student and mid-terms all this week this is very tough for me.
 &nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            After some research, I was able to fix my problem. This problem only started with 8.1, but we learned that Dell had not released a new driver for my machine. We installed the Windows 7 driver, and all is now well. So that's something people can try to
 see if this fix applies to them.

<h2>            Synaptics Touchpad on HP G72 and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>9/10/15-I have been trying out Windows 10 on my old HP G72&nbsp;laptop for a week. I am thinking of reverting to Windows 7 due to touchpad problems. I am having different issues with my touchpad than others it seems and I can't find any answers on how to fix
 it. It is the only issue that I dislike with Windows 10, but it bothers me enough that I will do without rather than continue to fight with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I&nbsp;downloaded Windows 10, the first thing I noticed was that the scroll feature went from me sliding my index finger on my right hand down the right side of the touchpad, to having to use two fingers in the middle and scroll in the opposite direction.
 While I could get used to this, if it worked right, the problem is, it doesn't. It's sort of hit or miss. It will work for a few strokes, then stop or I will have to keep moving my fingers to the left or the pointer will go to the top of the page and I have
 to drag it back down. I finally gave up and am using the up and down buttons on the keyboard as much as possible. Even when I try to drag the scroll bar on a page, it will start moving down and then suddenly just race to the bottom of the page. Does the same
 if I use the up/down arrows for the scroll bar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I found out quite accidentally, that I now have a pinch and zoom feature. That's great except it does it whenever it wants to, usually when I am scrolling, but also when I switch back and forth between windows or emails. What is even more maddening,
 is that I might barely touch&nbsp;the pad or I am just trying to move the pointer with one finger&nbsp;and suddenly all the icons on my desktop are huge. Then, when I try to make them smaller, they separate into groups of 4 or 6 all over the place. Then I have to right
 click and ask the computer to sort them by name. Then I have to rearrange them back into the order I want them manually. It's done this to me three times and it's driving me crazy. I have tried changing the settings and it doesn't work. And as others have
 stated, once you turn off your computer, it just goes back the way it was, but it also doesn't change anything as I continue to use it after I've hit apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing it keeps doing is bringing up tiny versions of all the windows I have open. I may just be reading something and not even moving my hands, but suddenly a bunch of tiny windows are on the screen and I have to click on the one I was reading to
 get back to it. The touchpad, in other words, seems to have a mind of it's own. I think that since my touchpad wasn't originally set up to work&nbsp;like this, it may be having some sort of allergic reaction to Windows 10 and just simply can't do what is now being
 asked of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it wasn't for this annoying problem, I would love the new Windows. But this touchpad thing is just too much. Does anyone know what is going on? Is this typical for a new release? Is it fixable? Do I just wait until there's an update and hope I don't beat
 my touchpad with a hammer in the meantime? Cause, seriously, it's making me pull my hair out.&nbsp;If it isn't fixed soon, it's back to the old Windows 7 for me.

            hi, I just faced the same problems with my G72 (120SG). I installed the latest driver from Synaptics (Vers. 19.0.19.1 for PS2) and this now works pretty well.

            Thanks for your help. I found the driver, downloaded and installed it. So far, I noticed that the&nbsp;touchpad is now even more sensitive and unpredictable&nbsp;than it was previously. Next, the little red light in the top left corner of the touchpad is on. In
 all the time I have had this laptop, I have never seen that light turn on. According to what I can find online, it supposedly means the touchpad is locked, but the touchpad is working, it's just working&nbsp;a little weirder than it did before I tried the new driver.
 I'll keep putzing with it. If I cannot find an adequate solution by next weekend, I am just going to go back to the old windows. The more things I keep downloading to fix the problems, the slower my computer seems to be running. But, thank you again for the
 suggestion. I will try going into the settings now and see if I can tone down the sensitivity so things will stop jumping around.

            I messed around with the settings in the new driver I downloaded and it is now working more like it used to. For the rest of the week I am going to see how it goes. If it starts acting odd again, I will try your suggestion. Thank you so much for your suggestion.

<h2>            Connecting two xbox ones on the same internet connection </h2>
                    
<p>Hey all</p>
<p>I've been able to connect two xbox 360s on the same internet connection with open nat no problem, I now have two xbox ones on the same connection with open nat but performance online is terrible, is it me or does the xbox one more bandwidth? Also if any
 one has two xb1 on the same connection working well, what's your internet speed?</p>
<p><br />
Cheers</p>

<p>Xbox one is most probably using more bandwidth, in this situation i would try setting up PAT ( Port Address Translation )
</p>
<p>It might be that you ports are just overloaded, as consoles are using the same ones to connect to servers. Can you please let me know whats your router model / manufacturer &amp; what Internet speed you have &amp; who is your ISP.</p>

<p>I have 15mb down and 0.47 up I have a feeling the upload is causing this ( looking at getting the upload raised from ISP as it's capped) how ever two xbox 360s worked on this speed no problem ( full green bars on cod ). Maybe the xb1 requires more upload?
 The router I have is a dlink 2640b and ISP is aol, I'm in England. I'm also looking at a new ISP to get a better upload, I usedto live a few doors away and got an upload of 1.2mb, so I know this can be done, any more further advice?</p>

<p>Can you please go on xbox one to settings - network - run network test &amp; multiplayer test and tell us all the results you get. Also. what are the games / apps that have low performance? Is it the same for every app/game you are using, or any exceptions?
 Are the 360 consoles connected to network as well?</p>

<p>The 360s are no longer connected, strangely when doing a multiplayer test with both xbox ones connected, it says every things good, when doing a detailed network test, one shows a ping of 150 with dl of 8 mb and up load of 0.3, the other had a ping of over
 700ms under a meg for dlc and 0.08 upload, this can change depending which Xbox is on first, both xbox have open nat. When signing in on both consoles they where slow and there was a lot of lag playing forza 5 together

<p>Try running 1 console at a time, to see if performance will increase. If not, unplug any internet devices from your home network ( except this one console ) , and try wired connection. That way we will understand if the problem is with connection. Also,

<p>Had the same issue on Sunday night...I was in "Party Chat" with my brother and we were playing Ghosts...every once in a while...the game sounds would seemingly cut out completely, or be very very low...and I was also then able to hear him both in my headset
 AND through my TV / Surround Sound...I also noticed that during those times...I could also hear other team members (Not in party) chatting as if I was in regular game chat...and they could hear me too....after a couple of matches...it seemingly went away for
 an additional match or two..then came back off and on...was pretty annoying. &nbsp;It's a known fact that the party chat system is less than ideal...so I'm going to assume it has something to do with that and / or the controller connectivity issues many people
 have also been experiencing (myself included). &nbsp;Powered down the console afterward (full power down, not just stand by)...and when I turned it back on yesterday...I didn't have any of those issues.....definitely NOT saying that is a fix all solution...but
 it has at least worked for me, so far....and could be worth a shot for you to try out.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself LordGarth999...but this is definitely NOT the cause of why it was happening to me...my first step was to go back into the Kinect settings and make sure that I had not selected the box for "Use Kinect for Chat"....or whatever it
 says exactly.....as a follow up...after I contacted support...they could not identify if the problem was Kinect based, console based, or controller based specifically...so they directed me to return the console to Gamestop for replacement (since I was told
 by the chat support individual that I spoke with, that only the console would be replaced if I did one of the advanced replacement things...besides...my controller was already having issues like it felt like it was coming apart and constantly dropped connection
 with the console / kinect...whatever lol)...since I hooked up the replacement...haven't had any issues...not suggesting it's the same for everyone...simply that replacing the console resolved that problem for me....however...to be fair....it hasn't been able
 to be tested out adequately since the entire party chat system seems to be fully inoperable at the moment lol.</p>

    <title>Hyper-V Broken after Feature Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithknight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyper-V Broken after Feature Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night the "Feature Update" for Windows 10 installed on my workstation (while I was asleep) and this morning after the reboot, most of my Hyper-V VMs are no longer appearing in Hyper-V manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some research and tried a number of different thing suggested on various forum posts and I can't seem to get even a fraction of my VM's back up and running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a reboot was forced without shutting down the VM's first which has somehow corrupted my environment. I'm seeing unusual behaviour such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) I can re-import some VMs back into Hyper-V and they run fine.</p>
<p>b) Other VMs fail to import.</p>
<p>c) Some VMs import successfully but fail to start.</p>
<p>d) Most unusually, some VMs import successfully but after importing they are not shown in the list and they cause other completely separate VMs being removed from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this update not only destroyed my machine but half of the virtual machines I've got running on it? Any advice on what I can do to recover?</p>

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the description of your issue, it looks like there might be some issues in terms of how your Hyper-V VMs interacts with the newly updated Windows 10 that caused corruptions. This is something that our members from

<h2>            Moving overseas with my Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™m about to move to the USA and was considering taking my Xbox One with me. I know all the games are no longer region specific but I was wondering what problems I might run into with the PSU.</p>
<p>If I get an American PSU, will it work the same or is the console going to struggle?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>If you have a Xbox One S or One X with internal power supply, you just need a power cord that fits into an US wall outlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a Xbox One with external power supply, you should contact the official support (or a Microsoft Store if you are near one in the US) to get a power supply that works with 110V.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not get power supplies from eBay or Amazon or the likes. Only order them from the official support, that you can contact via
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can try to buy a voltage converter. Be aware however, that the voltage converter must be able to sustain at least 200 Watts of power.</p>

                    <p>Since i have upgraded to windows 10 i have had a slight problem with my audio being a hair behind the video and it drives me crazy. It doesn't seem to happen with sites like youtube, but whenever im trying to play a media file with windows media player or
 even VLC the audio is out of sync by 1sec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any fix for this? What could be causing it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already selected drop frames in the options of WMP.</p>

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp; What version did you have previously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest cleaning your browser's History and Cache and run Disk Clean Up&nbsp; I probably would not delete the system files just yet.&nbsp; Do that, and than shut down your computer for a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of modem do you have?&nbsp; Do you have Wireless Internet?&nbsp; What is your router?&nbsp; How is your Internet Speed?&nbsp; What type of Internet Connection?&nbsp; DSL/Cable?&nbsp; Unplug your modem and router for a few minutes, than plug them back in.&nbsp; After they connect
 to the Internet, reboot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the "Get Other Updates the Same Way I Get Updates For Windows."&nbsp; With that checked, run Windows Update to see if there are any updates for Windows Media Player. Check within the player for updates to see if there are any, just in case Windows Update
 is not seeing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you also checked VLC's player and website for software updates?&nbsp; You might want to do that as well.&nbsp; The last thing I would say, might be to go to your computer manufacturers website, and check for any updates for your sound card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow any restart prompts for new driver or software installs as you go through the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack </p>

</p><p>Did you clear your History and Cache from your web browsers?&nbsp; I would do that.&nbsp; Than close out of everything.&nbsp; Shut down your computer.&nbsp; Unplug your modem and router when the system is shut down for five minutes.&nbsp; Plug your modem and router back in after
 five minutes and wait for the lights to come back on each one,&nbsp; (This may take several minutes. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, reboot your computer and test the audio.&nbsp; Since your drivers are up to date, we should wait to see other suggestions may arise.&nbsp; What web browsers are you using?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Cleaning your browser history, unplugging your modem, running Disk Clean Up, can help remove parts of file fragments that may have been left over from a previous version of Windows that can cause issues with other programs.&nbsp; We know that you are up-to-date,&nbsp;
 I would try the following next:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Clean your Browser History (Except for Cookies) so you don't have to redo all your user-names and passwords again.&nbsp; Do this for each browser that you use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Type Disk Clean Up in the search box and run the utility.&nbsp; I would clean up system files as well.&nbsp; This may take some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Close out of everything and shut down your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.) Disconnect the power cord from your modem and router if applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.) Wait a few minutes. plug everything back in, and wait till your online equipment comes back online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.) Reboot your computer and test a&nbsp;file with the player in question.</p>

</p><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you follow my last post of suggestions?&nbsp; I have re posted them for your consideration:&nbsp; I deleted the part about the need to have Charter come out, I agree with you that this does not sound like a signal problem.&nbsp; If it were, it would see that this would
 be affecting ALL of your videos, not just the selected ones that you indicated.&nbsp; Make sure you have a Docsis 3.0 modem and at least a Series N or AC router.&nbsp; I still think that could help with this.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Did you also unplug the modem?&nbsp; That should be done as well. &nbsp; Try the steps in this thread as well:</p>

 Don't play any video when making these changes.&nbsp; Make the changes with no video playing, close Windows Media Player and than reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recommended changes do not solve your problem, or there are no settings to change, (your settings are the same as Microsoft's suggestions,) I would start looking at your Internet Connection and the type of modem and router that you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you list for us the make and model of your modem and router? If you have&nbsp; wireless router There's Wireless "G (Oldest) may not be able to handle higher ranges, Wireless "N"&nbsp; (Middle-Good) and "Wireless AC (Best)&nbsp; If you have Wireless Internet, you should
 have at least a Wirless "N" router. to get good ranges.</p>

                    <p>My 32GB recovery thumb drive has about 23GB free after creating a Windows 10 recovery drive. Can I write additional files onto this "Healthy (Active, Primary Partition)" without compromising its use for recovery? Seems like an obvious yes, but wanted to

<p>
</p><p>Does the mini display to VGA adapter (Microsoft model 1554) have any driver's updates? Same goes to my external Mini display to HDMI adapter.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>With the projector attached and powered does your Surface Pro 3 recognise that a second device is connected at either Settings -&nbsp; System - Display or in Device Manager under either Monitors or Digital Media Devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume the projector(s) is/are set to use the input the Surface is connected to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible, even if unlikely,&nbsp;that both the adaptors you have tried are faulty or that the mini-DP port on your Surface is defective. Have you tested the adaptors on another system?</p>

    <title>How to remove a wireless display from display settings in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hlpmepls_924  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove a wireless display from display settings in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was running on two monitors with a standard display driver on Windows 10 on my Dell desktop.&nbsp; Then, I decided to see if I could connect to a wireless display using the Microsoft wireless display adapter plugged into an HDTV.&nbsp; I projected fine, but then
 my second monitor went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to display settings, the wireless display is still there (even though I disconnected it), and the display settings cannot see my actual second monitor (probably because I am limited to two monitors).&nbsp; When I select the second monitor in display
 settings (i.e., the wireless display), all options are greyed out except for the multiple displays pull down box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the choices in the pull down box include to disconnect the display or to remove the display.&nbsp; there are just the four regular options: duplicate, extend, show on 1, and show on 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select "Detect" in the display settings, I get a third display box that says "Display not detected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to remove that display from my display settings so I may reconnect my second monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a little more information, in the device manager, my two regular monitors show up normally and there is no mention of a wireless display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I recently purchased the app PhotoHandler pd through PayPal. When I down loaded it and installed it immediately froze my computer when trying to open a photograph. Iturn the computer off and restarted it. It was fine until I once again tried to open a photo.
 The scree on my computer started showing block after text block saying there was not enough memory and chirping over and over. So I shut down the computer once again and waited several hours. When I started the computer again it started chirping again and
 I had to uninstall the app to get the computer running again.</p>

    <title>Shaing Media Player With Other Users&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dirtybunny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shaing Media Player With Other Users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone please help me with this ridiculous situation? I have multiple family members that share a laptop running windows 8.1 and I would simply like to allow everyone to access my music through the media player. I have read various Q&amp;A from Microsoft
 but they all seem to point to an options dropdown under the library tab in media player. I have looked for the option to share media but it just isn't there.....or anywhere else for that matter!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: I do not want to stream my music or have it accessed through a network. I'm just interested in sharing with others that use my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Ok so I granted access to my music folder by opening the sharing box and selecting share with specific people. Then in the separate window I selected "everyone" from the drop down menu and then clicked "share" at the bottom. I then had a confirmation that
 I had&nbsp;shared my music folder. Great!...accept that when my son logs on to his account and opens up the media player, nothing's changed...Ok I think, so maybe I just need to tell the media player where to look for music?? But I can't find my music folder anywhere?
 I can't see where he can access my music folder?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t redeem Xbox Game Pass code</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to redeem a code for Xbox Game Pass and had trouble initially connecting to my billing account. I sorted that out but then got a message saying that there was a problem on Microsoft's end and to try again later. Now when I try again, a message comes
 up telling me that "This token has expired and cannot be redeemed". There's no record of a purchase in my history and I can't access Game Pass. Is there a way to get my code to work?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Agitated with context menus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmas7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Agitated with context menus</h2>
                    <p>I am very displeased with the context menus in Windows 10 ever since Build 10240. There is no consistency among them. The one for the desktop looks different than the one for the taskbar. The desktop has a "light" themed context menu and the taskbar has
 a "dark" themed one. All the context menus need to match.</p>
<p>I read that BS in the Insider Hub about why it is the way it is and it's so stupid. Here is an example, "Some Windows surfaces (e.g. file explorer) prefer light menus for a continuous experience while others opt for darker menus to maintain continuity."
 They say that as if it's actually alive.</p>
<p>I have a small screen (1024x600) and when I right-click on the taskbar, the context menus are HUGE! When I right-click on the Start icon, I have to scroll down just to get to the "Shut down or sign out" option. They're supposed to make it simpler to use,
 not add more steps.</p>
<p>This is really bothersome to me. It's like an itch that cannot be scratched, it annoys me to no end. Didn't even know I had OCD until I saw this disaster with the context menus. I wonder if anyone else is peeved at this?</p>

            <p>Personally, among all the things I have to worry about, context menus don't even rank. Don't say you have OCD, that's not a joking matter. Think of all the good things you have in life and don't worry about silly things like context menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unusual to have a 1024 x 600 monitor these days. Most monitors are bigger and so most UI's are optimized for a higher resolution, like 1280 x 1024. See if you can set your graphics adapter to 1024 x 600.</p>

            It's only a poor choice right now because Microsoft isn't listening to the feedback I give them. You know, I thought about getting Windows 10 for a new computer build I'm working on and a Windows phone but if Microsoft cannot fix the issues I tell them
 about, why go with Windows period? As I said earlier, Windows 10 works fine on my netbook except for the touchpad issue and the context menus. I brought these issues to Microsoft's attention on several occasions but they have yet to resolve them.

            <p>I completely agree. This should be simple: dark for the dark theme and light for the light theme. Having all these different context menu styles just...isn't right. Edge's has one font size, then the taskbar and Start have another size. File explorer has
 a light theme, and most don't have a nice animation when they open like they do in Edge. It does drive me crazy.</p>

            <p>We'll agree to disagree that all context menus need to match.&nbsp; The article generally gets into that.&nbsp; People are generally going to have differences in what they feel is the optimum design direction.&nbsp; If you've got further feedback upon the current design,
 providing that feedback in the Feedback application is the right next step to take.</p>

            <p>The context menus were fine before. Everything matched and they weren't ginormous either. It worked well for me and I'm sure it worked well for many others too. In my opinion, the article gives a very lame reason why they should be different. Also Microsoft
 contradicts themselves in the very first sentence of the article, "<em>You asked us to pick a menu and stick with it, and we heard you loud and clear.</em>" How can that be when there's a gazillion different looking context menus? Microsoft didn't pick ONE,
 they picked ALL of them. It looks sloppy and unprofessional. I expected better. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't Microsoft let people choose whether <em>they</em> want a light or dark theme, NOT have both at the same time. Or make the context menus match the accent color or make it match the Start menu in color and transparency. I talked with others about
 the context menus and they all agree that what we have now is ugly and needs to change.</p>

<p>Yeah, your first paragraph is explicitly addressed in the third sentence of the article you're referring to:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Consistency is tricky when you have menus built using different frameworks and principles..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted in that article, the teams got together and converged a bunch of implementations more tightly together than were they were.&nbsp; You might personally feel that they should all be lock-step perfect mirror twins, but -- it's pretty apparent that they're
 significantly more converged in 10586 than they were in 10240. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're excited about having light or dark themed or accent colored context menus or themes all the time, please vote for that in the Feedback application.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the design that design was excited about.&nbsp; If something else is way more popular with the
 world, maybe that's a better way to go.&nbsp; It's all doable, it just takes time. :)</p>

            <p>OneDrive is an entirely different team: those issues are unrelated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Context Menus too large" comments in large part centered around the 32px shell menus seen in an interim Insider build 10532.&nbsp; Due to the nature of the Insider program, people reuse existing feedback items for new/different issues, which is a problematic
 mess.&nbsp; Those shell menus are 22px now.&nbsp; Generally blurring together issues provides for very confused conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the article speaks for that better than I can.&nbsp; If you're intensely interested in this area, you can refer back to previous images of the "7 different menu types!" of context menus in 10240 and then see where those are now.&nbsp; Perhaps you want them
 even more closely aligned!&nbsp; Vote for that in the Feedback application. :)</p>

            I don't think your understanding me. ALL OF THE CONTEXT MENUS NEED TO LOOK THE SAME!!! Give me a GOOD explanation as of to why they all look different now and I'll drop the subject. Otherwise, I'm going to keep griping about it.

</p><p>"<em>How do we deliver modern, consistent menus across Windows?&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>Answer: <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Different teams build different menus for Windows</span></strong>. To achieve meaningful consistency we needed to bring everything together and agree on principles and design direction.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second part of the answer isn't being implemented.</p>

<p>Prezados,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enviei meu produto para assistÃªncia tÃ©cnica &nbsp;atravÃ©s da DHL, no dia 03 de Abril foi realizada a coleta do console e conforme o nÃºmero de rastreamento foi entregue em Valinhos-SP no dia 04 de Abril, atÃ© agora nÃ£o recebi nenhum e-mail
 informando da situaÃ§Ã£o ou mesmo foi realizada qualquer tipo de atualizaÃ§Ã£o do status no site de suporte. A DHL ja manteve contato comigo por 3 vezes para agendar a coleta do console, sendo que ele jÃ¡ foi entregue, sempre que a DHL entrou em contato ligo para
 o suporte via telefone, para a minha surpresa, nunca hÃ¡ uma atualizaÃ§Ã£o da informaÃ§Ã£o com relaÃ§Ã£o ao status de reparo do meu produto e em contato hoje fui informado que nÃ£o havia informaÃ§Ã£o do produto e o atendente me solicitou o nÃºmero de rastreamento do
 produto, mesmo eu informando que &nbsp;nÃ£o o tinha em mÃ£os no momento, mas que jÃ¡ havia consultado e que o console havia sido entregue aos cuidados da autorizada. Para minha surpresa o atendente me informou que entÃ£o hÃ¡ algum problema pois nÃ£o havia essa informaÃ§Ã£o,
 gostaria de saber se vocÃªs tem prazo para soluÃ§Ã£o do meu problema e se por acaso perderam um video-game que me custou 2 mil reais e que com menos de 1 mÃªs de uso comeÃ§ou a fazer ruÃ­dos no leitor .</p>

<p>Espero que alguÃ©m mantenha contato comigo por e-mail ou telefone para ao menos se posicionarem sobre a situaÃ§Ã£o.</p>

<p>Well I can not give you real solid advise on this issue as i currently do not have access to the game itself, and the version on the Microsoft website is for xbox version for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing is DCOM is a network related issue and can mean anything from Network software compatibly issue to Internet service provider carrying out maintence or the game server connection itself is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>overall recheck your hardware and software are correctly installed have been updated especially third party software like Java and Adobe flash player as they can cause games not to launch to reset your windows firewall and restart your computer and try installing
 the game again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try different graphic setting occasionally game launch under different graphic setting to the recommended setting on the game site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your Graphic update site to see if they actually include the game in there support information for graphic card as they sometime discontinue support for games if there is compatibly issue and they can not solve the issue with a future update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you download the game try installing the game after you move it to new folder location i.e c:\download to say D:\game store as example as the folder you down load into may not support all the installation from that folder cause it is protected and
 or locked for some reason i found this out with NVidia Graphic installation not all the graphic files were correctly installed i also found out too the protection feature of Windows defender does not allow fully installation of software critical to the software
 function until you change or turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall its probably best to see if it loads on another computer if available to rule our bad download to damage disc.</p>

<h2>            How can I get both the preview and details pane in windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need both the details and the preview pane to be able to be&nbsp;open at the same time.<br />
The placement is not an issue for me, I ABSOLUTELY NEED BOTH THE PANES SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR MY WORKFLOW!!!<br />
It's such a big pain right now. I have to either double click to open a viewer for preview if I want the details pane (for EXIF data) or if I have the preview pane, I have to right click-&gt; properties-&gt; details-tab for each file.
</p>
<p>Please mend this crippled explorer experience now!</p>

<br />
It's an absolute must-have.<br />
<br />
I need to preview my raw photos and tag them and rate them simultaneously.<br />
<br />
When I upgrade my OS, I don't expect it to not even do what my previous OS did. While I love the other changes in 8, this change screws my workflow.<br />

            <p>This really has mucked up my world too... I use file explorer to view embroidery files and choose them for production. With both panes I could quickly ascertain stitch size and other important elements without and extra click. Now I can get one or the other.
 Have no idea why Windows would have made this change! removing an important, but simple feature like this is lousy!! What do we need to do to get this fixed in the next update?!!!!</p>

            <p>Hey there - </p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for the extra information. Unfortunately, as Mister Cizl noted above, this is something you will need to speak to the retailer about. We were able to confirm that the code you provided had in fact already been redeemed on a different account&nbsp;and is no longer valid. Due to this, we are unable to assist further. We are only able to re-send codes that are sent to you initially, we cannot replace used codes. </p><p><br /></p><p>Apologies for any frustrations this may cause.</p>
