<p>System Requirements:<br />
</p>
<p>If you want to run Windows 7 on your PC, here's what it takes:<br />
*1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) Processor<br />
*1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM<br />
*16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB<br />
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver<br />
Additional requirements to use certain features:<br />
Internet access (fees may apply)<br />
Depending on resolution, video playback may require additional memory and advanced graphics hardware<br />
For some Windows Media Center functionality a TV tuner and additional hardware may be required<br />
Windows Touch and Tablet PCs require specific hardware<br />
Home Group requires a network and PCs running Windows 7<br />
*DVD/CD authoring requires a compatible optical drive<br />
Music and sound require audio output </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what you will need to run Win7. If you can answer 'YES' to the '*' then you are a go.
</p>
<p>If no? Then you will have to upgrade your hardware. </p>
<p>This is for '32-bit' 64-bit is the same except stuff that is branded 32 must be 64.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hope this helps? </p>

            <p>Hi EFBKLYN</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I was able to solve this problem and I think it will work for you too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Programs and Features -&gt; Turn Windows Features on or off -&gt; Legacy Components -&gt; Enable NTVDM</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Second:</p>
<p>Open "Command prompt"<br />
Right click over title "Command prompt" and select "Properties"<br />
Select "Use legacy console (require relauch)", then "Accept"<br />
Close and re-open "Command prompt" to test. </p>
<p>

    <title>Why dosn&#39;t Win7 install the Logitech unify receiver&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why dosn&#39;t Win7 install the Logitech unify receiver&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello everybody<br />
<br />
I have bought a Logitech M510 which uses an unify receiver. Windows doesn't install the needed driver. (No drivers have been found) I tried it on different USB ports. I tested the unify receiver on another computer. It works there. I also contacted the Logitech
 support. They said it is an issue with the windows standard HID driver. They recommended to update the BIOS and to update the USB driver.<br />
<br />
I updated the BIOS but had no luck. I could not update the USB drivers though because they are the Microsoft standard drivers for "Intel(R) ICH10 Family USB Universal Host Controller".</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>My OS is Windows 7 Professional 64bit.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can anybody help me please?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kind regards</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>

<p><span>Based on the description ,it appears that you are facing issues with installing Logitech M510 drivers. I will be happy to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>- What is the exact/ complete error message you are receiving?</span></p>
<p><span>- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> I would suggest you to follow the steps to run the hardware troubleshooter from the link and check if it helps.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Vijay</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your replay.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To your questions:</span></p>
<p><span>-The error message is: No driver installed for this device. (Code 28)</span></p>
<p><span>-I’m working with this computer for about ½ year and tried to install this mouse now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried your recommended steps…</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1: Did not work.</span></p>
<p><span>=&gt; No driver available for USB Receiver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Did not work.</span></p>
<p><span>=&gt; After uninstalling the driver, windows installed them again. But the USB Receiver (unify) isn’t recognised. Even worse, now it doesn’t even recognise the USB Receiver from the keyboard (MK320) any more.
</span><span><span>L</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3: Did not work.</span></p>
<p><span>=&gt; I tried that before. The problem stays the same. No driver available for this device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is very strange. The USB receivers normally use the standard HID driver. But it doesn’t recognise the device as such and therefore doesn’t install the driver for
 it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have any other ideas? Thanks again for your help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kind regards</span></p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Try uinstalling the USB drivers in your computer via the device manager. It will then refresh and install all the drivers. Insert your logitech and it will try to install it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If no go, then boot to safe mode and install from there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!</div>

Thank you for your replay. I tried both but without any luck. It’s still the same: “No driver has been found.” It’s the same for both USB receivers. (MK320 and unify)</span></p>

I just figured out that a USB hub, which was working before, doesn't work anymore. In the device manager it is listed as "unknown device".<br />
<br />
It seems I have some kind of general USB problem? Has someone any ideas?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<p>Go to <span>Device Manager &gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Universal Serial Bus</span> controllers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open up the section and then right click &gt; uninstall each device in the list.</p>

            Hi David<br />
<br />
The only error I have is by the <a href="http://www.bilderload.com/bild/299662/usbreciverTNW3N.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
USB Receiver</a>. I don't have any other errors. <br />
<br />
The error by this receiver says "No driver for this device have been found."<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? At the moment I'm using a PS2 mouse. :-(<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
Hans-Jörg<br />
<br />
Ps. Yes I tried uninstalling the USB hub. But it didn't help either.<br />

    <title>Cannot assign drive letter to volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjmn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot assign drive letter to volume</h2>
                    
<p>I just did a clean install of Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; This was to install it on one of two new identical 500 gb hard drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon getting it running, I went to disk management to format the drive I didn't&nbsp;install windows on.&nbsp; It seemed to work fine.&nbsp; I began copying files onto it, and while that was going I went to close the computer up, which I had left open in case I needed
 to tighten connections.&nbsp; As I did so, a cord pushed against a fan, making a noise.&nbsp; I canceled the file transfer, waited for it to finish canceling, then cut the power to the computer so I could get the cord off the fan quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon reset, the drive no longer appeared on the My Computer screen.&nbsp; I went to disk management, and it showed as present and partitioned, but had no volume letter or name.&nbsp; When I tried to assign, I recieved the error message "The operation failed to complete
 because the Disk Management console view is not up-to-date.&nbsp; Refresh the view by using the refresh task.&nbsp; If the problem persists close the Disk Management consol, then restart Disk Management or restart the computer."&nbsp; So I refreshed.&nbsp; The problem persisted,
 so I restarted.&nbsp; Still had the problem, so I deleted the partition (which works) then tried to create a new one, and got the message again.&nbsp; This resulted in an apparent partition with no drive letter.&nbsp; I then deleted the partition and restarted the computer.</p>
<p>Thinking that maybe I should have done a complete rather than quick format, I told disk manager to create a new volume while&nbsp;leaving the "quick format" box unchecked.&nbsp; It&nbsp;processed for a few minutes, then gave me the error message again, and once again displayed
 an unnamed partition on the disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Mark partition as active" has no apparent effect, "change drive letters and paths" gives the not up to date message, "format" give the "an unexpected error has ocurred.&nbsp; CHeck the System Event Log for more information on the error" message.</p>
<p>"Delete partition" seems to work fine, "properties" gives the not up to date error message.&nbsp;</p>

            RMA the drive to the manufacturer.&nbsp; You state it was new in December, so there's a 3 or 5 year guarantee on the drive (but not the data!).&nbsp; Cutting the power to the computer probably produced a spike which could well have killed the drive.

            I have precisely the problem described and have been thus far unable to find a solution. In my case, I transferred the entire contents of my C: drive to a new SSD, then deleted the partitions from the old drive using Disk Management. When trying to create
 a new primary partition, I got the error described by Benjmn above, with exactly the same subsequent results.<br />
<br />
Using diskpart was no more fruitful. I'm able to create the partition, but not assign a drive letter. When trying to assign a drive letter, it says "no volume specified," but since the volume isn't listed in "list volume," I cannot select the volume.<br />
<br />
In my case the drive was perfectly healthy until I deleted the old partitions, so I doubt that this is a hardware error (though at this point I'm starting to wonder if the firmware of the drive or a setting on it has been corrupted).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution for this problem? Everything I've been able to find online just says to use diskpart.<br />

            Hey in case it helps anyone, I was finally able to resolve this simply by writing zeros to the drive, uninstalling it in Device Manager, and then restarting the computer. After that, Windows recognized the drive as new hardware, and I was able to partition
 and format it easily in Disk Management.<br />

<br />
<br />Windows is just guessing that the mp3 files are music
<br />
<br />You can set the view for that folder to be as you like it to be
<br />
<br />On the View ribbon, click 'Add Columns' from there you can add or remove the required columns to the view o f that folder . . .

                    <p>I have win7 home premium. I'm looking to change an icon for one of my pieces of freeware. Biut when I go through the "change icon" process I get just one choice, which is the same icon currently in use. I used to have a couple of .dll files containin lots
 of icons, but I've lost them. I used GOOGLE to find something about .dll files holding icons, and encuntered a suggestion that lots of the .dll files in C:\WINDOWS\System32" are containers for icons. This turned out be a useless answer; when I browse to a
 .dll file (there are lots of them) with the "change icon" display, I get an error msg indicating that the file in question contains no icons. Can somebody provide a list of .dll files that actually contain some icons?</p>

<p>compstui, DDORres, imageres, mmcndmgr, moreicons, pifmgr, shell32, syncui, and imagesp1.&nbsp; I hope this helps; it's hard locating this info, but I am still looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have also verified netshell.dll as posted by<strong> Marilyn O</strong>.</p>

    <title>Having problems with system interrupts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willachbutlerhands  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having problems with system interrupts.</h2>
                    So I have a relatively new laptop. I say that so you know it's a laptop, you know it's new, and so you know it's running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. The system specs, as far as I can tell, are as follows:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lenovo G570</div>
<div>Processor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU B940 @ 2.00 GHz 2.00 GHz</div>
<div>4.00 GB RAM</div>
<div>Intel(R) HD Graphics Family</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Okay, moving on to the problem. My laptop has been running fine for a couple of months now(I only got it towards the end of November) but this morning, when I booted it up(from sleep mode, not a full shutdown) it was running very slowly. So slowly that
 my music slowed down and became choppy. I decided to check the task manager for any errant programs that might be running, but nothing seemed amiss from the processes tab. No one or more programs was taking that much CPU or memory. However, when I checked
 the performance tab, the CPU usage was fluctuating around 80-100%, which was unusual, because I hadn't even gone over 60% that often, and especially with not this few programs open. Fearing it might be a virus, I ran several anti-virus and anti-malware programs,
 but they turned up no results.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I did some research, and ended up finding out that CPU usage spikes were a somewhat common issue with Windows 7. I decided to use resource monitor and found this:&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/40/rman.png/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/40/rman.png/</a>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There was a lot of usage in the system, but the higher amount of usage was in the system interrupts. I googled the issue, but it turned out there were several similar issues, but I followed a lead here which led to me downloading the Microsoft SDK to make
 use of Xperf. I ran a short trace and it gave me these table summary:&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/545/xperf.png/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/545/xperf.png/</a></div>
<div><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/860/xperf2.png/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/860/xperf2.png/</a>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks like the offending process or processes are these&nbsp;0xfffffa80045fc processes, but I googled them and came up dry. I have a sneaking suspicion that it's a driver problem as was the case for some of the others with similar problems that I found,
 but I tried updating the drivers automatically through device manager, but that didn't help. I'm also wary of trying to do it manually lest I exacerbate the problem or create new problems by going at it half-baked. If someone could help me out or at least
 point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT:&nbsp;</div>
<div>So something new just happened. Everything was chugging along slowly and then suddenly a little dialogue box popped from the system tray that read "Intel Rapid Storage Technology Disk on Port 2: Detected" and then the problem went away for a little while.
 I started going about my business for a little bit, checking to see if the problem had gone away by checking the resource monitor and seeing if sound files were still choppy, but it seemed to go away. A few minutes later a similar message popped up that said,
 "Intel Rapid Storage Technology Disk on Port 2: Removed" appeared and everything slowed down again. I opened the Intel Rapid Storage Technology program and couldn't figure out what to do with it, so I closed it and kept searching for answers. However, a few
 minutes after that, the first message appeared again and the speed went back to normal. I'm not sure if this is the issue exactly or how to fix it, or if it's just a part of the issue or just a related issue, but it's more information. I'd love some more help
 on this if anyone can offer it. I'm trying to be as detailed as possible here.</div>

            <p>I believe Lenovo installs a shorcut on the desktop to obtain any updated&nbsp;drivers for your specific model (Or it maybe called Levono maintenance or similar), I'd suggest using it to obtain the updated drivers for your system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McAfee together with MSE can cause conflicts as they both feature on demand scanners, I'd suggest uninstalling McAfee</p>

            Hi,

The Skype 8 is in a transition moment, they are solving some errors, my recommendation is that you install Skype Classic, while correcting some faults, for this you have to uninstall your current version.

I hope this can help

<h2>            Dell Laptop W&#47; Vista HP, Won&#39;t connect to Wireless Internet</h2>
                    I just got a dell laptop with vista hp on it. The laptop is actually almost 2 years old but&nbsp;was never used. I have a macbook that has been connected to the same internet and router for months, but the vista won't connect.&nbsp; Did all the diagnostics.&nbsp; Don't
 know much about the router or the computer, all I know is that it is set up, and works for other computers.&nbsp; I can find the name of the connection, type the password in, but when I finish connecting, it says it is taking longer than usual to set up a connection,
 and only connects locally, so I can't access anything online.&nbsp; The wireless signal is "excellent".&nbsp; I reset my router about 20 times, rebooted the laptop, etc, followed all the instructions for the diagnostics but nothing, also checked the firewall, also shut
 off. I was told to uncheck the enable protected mode box and maybe that will solve the problem.&nbsp; Any suggestions? Would be appreciated thanks.&nbsp; ALSO, the laptop won't connect to the i

<p>Hi Polito0408,<br />
Thank you for posting your question.</p>
<p><span><span>You may try the steps below:
<br />
Fixing Common networking connectivity issues in Vista:<br />
To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:<br />
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Disable the IP Helper service:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Hold the Windows key and type R, enter "services.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
2. Scroll down to the IP Helper service, right click on it and select Properties<br />
3. In the dropdown box that says "Automatic" or "Manual", set it to Disabled and then click on "Apply"<br />
4. Then click on "Stop" to stop the service from running in the current session<br />
5. Click OK to exit the dialog</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Disable IPv6:<br />
</span></strong><span>Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack. To remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol
 "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer. Then go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span> You should do this for each
 network connection.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Disable the DHCP Broadcast Flag:<br />
Link:</span></strong><span> </span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928233</span></span></strong></a><strong><span><br />
<span>Important:</span></span></strong><span><span><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry.
 However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
 For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></span></strong></a><span><span><span>
 (How to back up and restore the registry in Windows)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Windows Vista cannot obtain an IP address from certain routers or from certain non-Microsoft
 DHCP servers.<br />
To resolve this issue, disable the <strong>DHCP BROADCAST</strong> flag in Windows Vista. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{GUID}</strong><br />
3. In this registry path, click the (GUID) subkey that corresponds to the network adapter that is connected to the network.<br />
4. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.<br />
5. In the New Value #1 box, type DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then press ENTER.<br />
6. Right-click on DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then click Modify.<br />
7. In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.<br />
8. Close Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
By setting this registry key to 1, Windows Vista will first try to obtain an IP address by using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets. If that fails, it will try to obtain an IP address without using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,<br />
Chethan Kumar.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to change password - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to change password</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have a new iPHONE and I downloaded the Skype app to the new phone since I have a Skype number that I use for work. In the new app for my new phone it won't let me log into my Skype account and says my password is incorrect even though it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to change my password but it won't let me. Now I am trying to do it again and on the Microsoft webpage it says "You can't access this sight right now."&nbsp; &nbsp;"<span>This
 site requires a security code to sign in. When your security info updates on 12/18/2017 you will be able to access this site. You can still access sites such as Outlook and Skype that don't require a security code."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I
 don't understand what is going on here. I cannot wait an entire month to try and change my password because I need my Skype number on my phone and it keeps rejecting my password for some inexplicable reason.&nbsp; Even before this issue started, the whole systems
 was taking me around in circles as I simply tried to get a new password.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I
 have never had so many problems with any other service provider as I do with skype. The entire system is so convoluted and to top it off there is no way to speak directly with a representative, there appears to be no live chat either, as most major service
 providers offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Help&#58; Surface 3 Pen not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mainworks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#58; Surface 3 Pen not working properly</h2>
                    <p>So I've had my Surface Pro 3 for quite a while (about 4 years) and it came with a surface 3 pen (the one with two buttons on the side).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been working for years, and then eventually ran out of battery, and then I ended up not using it for quite some time. Then, recently I wanted to use it, and opened it up to find out that the battery has corroded. I extracted the battery and cleaned
 the compartment then replaced the battery. It works now and turns on, however it does not work how it should. I checked the Bluetooth settings and found that even though the surface pen and my cover keyboard were working, It said that setup incomplete because
 of metered connection. However the keyboard works perfectly whereas the pen does not. I tried forgetting the device then reconnecting and it still doesn't work properly.
</p>
<p>I opened the surface app to test the pen, and the sensitivity is working fine. The button on the end of the pen works fine. I can also draw on the screen with my finger. Changing the battery doesn't help. Restarting the Surface doesn't work either. I've
 also tried installing the latest updates and using the Surface Diagnostic toolkit.</p>
<p>So onto the details of the problem (Note that I haven't used the pen in quite a while so I'm not too certain how it should work.):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Tapping with the pen causes a right mouse button click function to occur.</li><li>Naturally that would mean that I can't press on buttons on the screen.</li><li>Pressing the right click button functions normally, assuming that your meant to hold the button, then press on the screen and then when you stop pressing it calls the function. The right click function doesn't seem to be called any other way, except what
 is mentioned above.</li><li>Holding the erase button allows me to click on buttons</li><li>Drawing in paint 3D doesn't work at all, even while holding any buttons. Holding the button closes to the tip does cause me to rub out lines.</li><li>Holding the erase button in the normal paint app allows me to draw. If I don't hold that button I end up rubbing out stuff.</li><li>Holding the erase button in OneNote allows me to rub out whole lines. If I select a pencil from the top and then try drawing with the pen the program automatically selects the lasso tool and then when I release it re-selects the pencil. Selecting the draw
 with touch doesn't help.</li><li>In Krita holding the erase button allows me to erase and it does so with the pressure sensitivity.</li></ul>
<p>So I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me find a solution that isn't to buy a new one (I'll try almost everything first before buying a new pen. They're quite expensive).&nbsp;</p>

Hi,<br />
The operating system is Windows 10 and the build is 17134.765.<br />
I had updated recently already, and it did not help with the problem. There is a new update now and I will install it, although I doubt it will help.<br />
Thanks

<p>I can see your problem. You have the 32 bit OS installed which will only recognize up to 4GB of Ram. You need the 64 bit version for your PC to use all 6GB.</p>

    <title>need help with my console - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            need help with my console</h2>
                    
<p>ok so i went to turn on my xbox this morning but it was making funny beeping sounds, and so i thought it was just warming up. a couple of minutes later i went to open the disc tray to get a game out. then when i went to put the other game in, the console
 just shut automatically and started to make some really weird humming noises. what i need to know is if i can get my elite repared. it is just about&nbsp;2 and a half years old, it came with a warranty and these problems and started happening recently but i thought
 it was nothing. i want to get my elite fixed because i don't want to go and fork out $500-$600 dollars when i could get it repared for a lot cheaper. so if i can get my elite repared will it be cheaper than buying a new console.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Gente,</p>
<p>A assinatura do meu filho (Xbox Live Gold) terminou hoje, 24/01, então ontem comprei um cartão novo, mas cometi um erro: em vez de renovar na conta dele TIFUN7 no próprio console, entrei no site e resgatei o código do cartão, só que indevidamente acabei
 criando uma nova conta pra mim SAMPLEDWALL61 e os créditos de 13 meses estão nessa nova assinatura. Há alguma forma de eu desfazer ou então transferir esse crédito para assinatura do meu filho?</p>
<p>Um abraço,</p>

    <title>How can I edit a home movie dvd&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanguida  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I edit a home movie dvd&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently paid to have some camcorder tapes transferred onto dvd's&nbsp; as my computer doesn't recognise my sony camcorder. The idea was to download the dvd's onto the movie maker in order to edit them but the programme is not capable of playing the
 dvd's. They won't even play on the windows media player, the audio is there but no images. The person that did the transfers advised me to download VLC media player and it worked, that is, I can now watch the films, but I can't edit them (add background music
 etc.) which was the whole point of having them transferred. My daughter has borrowed the dvd's and played them on her computer with no problem. She has Windows 7, I'm on Windows 10, does that make a difference? This is one of the main things that I like about
 the computer, but it seems that I am now doomed not to be able to convert my older films which contain lots of memories which I also wanted to copy and share with the family.

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Editing of the movies happen if there is a Windows media center and Windows media center has been removed in Windows 10. You can download the Windows live essentials and use movie maker to edit the videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend you to try to save the files in the computer and then try to make the changes and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply to us with the status of the issue.</p>
