<h2>            Windows 10 is installing automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Today I turned on my laptop and I saw there were updates downloading. I clicked on the icon and Windows 10 was downloading. I figured it will just download in the background and then ask me when to install. It's not like I don't want it,but there is an important
 backup I need to do before and I actually don't want to install it until I'm sure there are no bugs. I am not even sure if I like it at all !&nbsp;</p>
<p>It downloaded really fast (at least for a Windows) and then it said "preparing to install" or something like that. &nbsp;I stopped it and checked Windows Update. There are 2 important updates and then I looked at the optional ones. There is Windows 10. It was
 selected!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why in the world is something OPTIONAL selected? I deselected it and started to install those 2 important updates. But again it says "downloading Windows 10". I closed the window ,reopened it and checked the optional updates. Again Windows 10 is selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have a few questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Why in the world is Windows 10 selected? IT IS OPTIONAL. I don't want to ever see it selected unless I choose to select it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Why am I obliged to install it? I deselect it (and I clicked "ok" after that) and than it magically select itself?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Why am I not allowed to install updates? I have those updates before Windows 10 got released. It has nothing to do with it. They are just updates I didn't install right then. I want to install them without seeing any Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I don't think this answers the question at all - if I'm reading it correctly the other user appears to have the same problem as me which is:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I tried Windows 10 and my laptop was horrendously slow - tried it for 4 days then,</li><li>I reverted back to Windows 8.1 and everything was fine again - however</li><li>The next time I logged on it started to download Windows 10 again - I cancelled it.</li><li>This happens EVERY TIME I log on - I have Windows 8.1 updates which I cannot download as it insists on downloading Windows 10</li></ul>
<p>So far I have</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted the update KB3035583 (i think) which appears to have something to do with it</li><li>Cancelled my reservation for Windows 10</li><li>Turned off any updates for Windows 10</li></ul>
<p>Yet despite all my efforts and hours of trawling the internet I have yet to find anything which stops this from haunting me. &nbsp;If I view my installed updates there must be a dozen failed attempts at downloading Windows 10 where I have just had to stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cleaned up my system files but don't know how to get rid of these failed attemps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO STOP WINDOWS 10 ONCE AND FOR ALL BEFORE I GO MAD !!!!</p>

<p>I'm pleased you managed to escape this eternal hell - alas for me the quest continues and neither myself or my HP Pavillion shall be happy until I find the answer. &nbsp;I have 20 important Windows 8.1 updates to do however the invisible Windows 10 one insists
 on running first and it's not even on the bloody list!!!! 😡😡😡😡</p>
<p>
</p><p>so so come on Microsoft give us the answer - some people REALLY DON'T want Windows 10</p>

            <p>I was also very disappointed that we were told Windows 10 would download and give us a choice of when to install it. &nbsp;The first of 4 machines (HP Pavillion Windows 8.1) downloaded it and I didn't realize by agreeing to the license that it would actually
 install it. &nbsp;By the second machine (new Dell Inspiron Windows 7 Pro) I was much smarter and clicked "Decline" to the license question. &nbsp;It stayed on the screen where it said it was deleting installation files forever. &nbsp;After an hour or so I finally decided
 it was in a loop and rebooted. &nbsp;I noticed the same problem where everytime I wanted to install updates the message "Downloading Windows 10" appeared. &nbsp;After removing KB3035583 and stopping the download several times, I finally decided to make a couple of System
 Image backups and took the plunge. &nbsp;I checked one of the updates to apply and went for it. &nbsp;It turns out it did NOT actually download Windows 10 - only the checked update. &nbsp;I then did the rest of the updates in two passes, and again, even though the message
 says "Downloading Windows 10" only the patches were applied. &nbsp;The other strange thing is that the message showing the percent of completion and MB downloaded didn't change. &nbsp;It appears to be a bug in the display - possibly because I canceled the installation
 of Windows 10? &nbsp;If you click on the Update Icon in the System tray it DOES show the message "installing updates" and the percent completed. &nbsp;Hopefully Microsoft will fix this problem.</p>
<p>I was able to roll back the update on the HP to Windows 8.1 with no problem, but when I tried to do the updates there, it apparently forgot that I just rolled back and again installed Windows 10. &nbsp;This time I declined and it didn't go in the loop trying
 to delete installation files. &nbsp;I then removed KB2976978 and KB3035583. &nbsp;After rebooting and checking for updates, they showed up again, but I marked them to be hidden ... THEN for the first time, the optional Windows 10 appeared and I was able to hide it also.</p>
<p>I canceled the Windows 10 updates on the other 2 computers before they started downloading.</p>

<h2>            hp elitebook 8760w windows 10 pro, the hp hd webcam &#91;fixed&#93; is black and white only</h2>
                    did a fresh install of windows 10 pro. tried updating the driver, updating the firmware, installing the hp driver, uninstalling the webcam, installing youcam. the webcam is stuck in black and white for all programs that I try it with: camera, skype, youcam.
 it seems to be a windows 10 driver issue. I even tried the Microsoft usb webcam generic driver - it's black and white too. please advise.

            Hi  jennifer,
<br />
<br />Microsoft do not produce drivers for devices :)
<br />Manufactures do!
<br />
<br />Here we should find proper driver for your device on HP website regarding current OS build. 
<br />
<br />How we can see here: <a href="https://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-elitebook-8760w-mobile-workstation/5071180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br />Device is developed for XP / Vists / 7 / 8 / 8.1.
<br />
<br />There are no any drivers related to Windows 10.
<br />
<br />In this case, yes, without proper driver camera doesn't work correct. 
<br />
<br />You can try a driver from website above, but it is from 2012 only.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work that contact HP.
<br />
<br />Have a good day
<br />

            yes, Microsoft does not publish HP drivers, but they do publish the generic usb webcam driver - which I have found does not support the "HP HD [fixed] webcam" in many elitebooks. I have confirmed the driver issue by getting the webcam to function in color
 out of the box with distros of ubuntu and android. Thanks for your comments and direction, I have already tried the windows 8.1, 8, and 7 drivers from the HP site for the 8760w. Hopefully this post can be a place that others having the same issue can find,
 and perhaps someone that finds a solution will post it here (windows 7 support ending Jan/2020 will mean more of these machines having the same issue). I have additionally reached out to HP support.

            Sorry, if the camera is showing up, I see more of it as a hardware issue. Please try plugging in a USB camera and see if it exhibits the same behavior.

            the camera works in color if I drop in an old harddrive clone of windows 7, or if I boot into ubuntu or android distro. For windows 10 I have found the HP HD Webcam [fixed] Version: 6.0.1114.4 [7/10/2015] driver that works in black and white (so do earlier
 versions of the driver). I also found a version 6.0.1114.26 [7/20/2017] version of the driver - but it just loads a black screen. I cannot find any drivers between the .4 and .26 version, or a version of the Microsoft USB video device (generic) driver newer
 than 2006.

<p>Every once in a great while, I view someone's broadcast and get the same audio issues. I broadcast and archived a few myself, but never really had any issues with quality so I believe it's at their end where they have limited bandwidth that can't keep up
 with the desired quality. Quality being an adjustable option on Twitch of course so it would only make sense to use the "get new recomendation" feature it gives.</p>
<p>If that's not it then maybe it's something simple like opening ports. Of course, doing the ports are hectic to understand, but worth it in every way.</p>

                    I'm getting error 0x8024D007 when i try to run Windows update. The server I am trying to update is aslo our WSUS server. so i guess it's trying to update via itself. It's running server 2003 and IE8<br />
Several Other servers on the network are also having trouble updateing from it, getting error code 800b0001 though they can update from the Internet fine

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> <span>&nbsp;</span>If the above article does not help,
</span><span>perform a system restore on your computer. </span></p>
<p><span>System restore will take your computer to pervious state when it was not facing such problem, this can be done by selecting the proper restore point.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Finish.</span></p>

<h3> phillip van staden  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am trying to install my Canon MF3110 on windows 8, but unable to find drivers compatible.</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased the latest version of Windows with great anticipation, but it seems that there are no compatible drivers available for the Canon MF3110 multifunction printer. Some bloggers believe that if I install drivers for similar models compatible
 with Windows 7 64-bit, I will be able to use these drivers instead, but Windows 8 will not allow drivers that are not meant for your specific hardware to be installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong or are there steps I am leaving out when trying to by-pass the installation process?</p>

<div>I've used both cmd.exe as well as trying to create a wireless ad-hoc network, but neither works because I'm unable to enable Internet Connection Sharing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried resolving this by turning on the required services in service.msc as well as turning off my anti-virus. Neither has helped.</div>

<div>Please advise.</div>

            Hi DanyelleK,
<br />
<br />You have the issues with sleep mode that check the recommendation below:
<br />
<br />1) Check Your Sleep Mode Settings
<br />
<br />Go to the Control Panel, find Power Options and check all settings.
<br />
<br />2) Check Your Drivers
<br />
<br />Chipset, network driver and BIOS drivers should be updated.
<br />
<br />3) Look at this guide: <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-wont-wake-up-from-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-wont-w...</a>
<br />

            Hi Danyellek,
<br />
<br />What is the computer make/model?
<br />
<br />1. Control Panel &gt; Power Options 
<br />Click Change Plan Settings
<br />Click Change Advanced Plan Settings
<br />Scroll down to PCI settings
<br />Click the &gt; to expand the menu
<br />Scroll down to Link State Power Management
<br />Turn it off
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />
<br />2. Look for an Auto-Detect option on the Monitor settings

<h2>            Windows Media Player &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I try to play certain songs on Windows Media Player or if I want to RIP songs from a CD, I get the following message "Windows Media Player cannot access the file. The file might be in use, you might not have access to the computer where the file is

            Hi Julius,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. You can try running these 3 easy fixes from Microsoft related to WMP
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wmpc10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_wmpc10</a>
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wmpl10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_wmpl10</a>
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wmpdvd10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_wmpdvd10</a>
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and Reinstall Windows Media Player
<br />To Uninstall - Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; Turn Windows features on or off &gt; Scroll down to Media Features and uncheck Windows Media Player &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />
<br />To Install - Check Windows Media Player in above step &gt; Reboot the Computer
<br />
<br />Source - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/0ec37853-5ef8-4be1-a771-8514935536eb">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/0ec37853-5...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Microsoft has not been investing in WMP. With each new update, WMP getting broken probability has been increasing. It is better to use VLC Media Player which has all the codecs required and will play all the audio and video files.
<br />
<br />To download VLC - <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Your Favourite Game That No One Else Has Heard Of</h2>
                    <p>and that you think deserves a next gen reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for me it would have to be Alpha Protocol. over shadowed by the simultaneous release of Fallout New Vegas by the same company, Alpha Protocol never got the advertising or hype it deserved.</p>
<p>the way the story unfolds is fantastic and is dynamically changed by everything the player does. the missions can be done in different orders which affects the different ways things play out and your actions really affect how NPCs interact with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>it was one of my favourite games but hardly anyone I know played this gem of a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so which game did you spot that flew under everyone else's radar?</p>

            Actually Alpha Protocol is fast becoming a sample of the underrated game in many youtube lists, yet the ugly truth remains that it was a rushed game that tried to combine rpg, action and stealth elements while failing miserably in everything. &nbsp;

            Capcom's 2013 gem Remember Me, that game was a masterpiece. Its score, style, its story, everything about it was really good. I wish it would get a sequel. Its a really fun semi-free roam/semi-linear beat em' up game set in the near distant future in Paris.
 Its a good game.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>All updates and Upgrades are Mandatory as of 1607 so the answer is no. There are work a rounds out there but use of them is not advisable as they violate the terms of your Windows 10.</p>

            <p>See your other replies; I also recommend that you buy a bigger drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that <span><span><span>the term "memory" is used to refer to the place where the computer holds the program and data it is working with at the moment. It's normally random access memory (RAM), but that can be extended with
 the page or swap file on the hard disk. The word "memory" is never used to refer to the space on a drive (whether that's a hard drive, SSD, diskette, CD, DVD, or thumb drive). Space on a disk drive is normally called "storage" or simply "disk space."</span><br />
<br />
<span>Calling disk space "memory" isn't so much wrong as just unconventional. In a sense, disk space is, of course, memory, but the important thing to realize is that the word is never used that way, and if you do so, you do it at the
 risk of seriously confusing your audience.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>I don't say this to give you a hard time, but to help you make yourself clearer in any future questions. I had to read your question several times before I understood it.</span></span></span>

<h2>            System freezes after booting the computer to the desktop</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Event 7009, Source = Service Control Manager, "A timeout was reached (30000 milliseconds) while waiting for the Windows Error Reporting Service service to connect."</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Event has reported other services such as 'Steam Client Service'</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Once it froze for about 20 secs, but no event report was produced.
<p>When this freeze happens, you can move the mouse and click but nothing happens. Once the freeze has timed-out all the click actions occur, i.e. if you clicked to close a window and open the menu, which was ignored at the time, this now happens.</p>
<p>The PC will then work normally for days even weeks and then it will happen again. In my case its usually soon after booting up.</p>
<p>A friend has the same make/model of PC and its happened on that PC as well.</p>
<p>If you click the help in the event report, it seems to suggest using RegEdit to change the timeout value, but I dont see how this will fix anything other than make the PC wait for a longer or shorter time. If Ive understood that correctly, isnt making the
 time out shorter just 'masking' the problem but making it less annoying I guess?</p>
<p>I have copied this from the last entry with minimum alterations, I have gone through the suggested solution and so far this the longest I have got the PC working. Was there an answer to the question that all we are doing is increasing the 'stall' from 30
 to 60 sec's?</p>

<div>Hi cliff astrand,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2. Do you have any program named steam installed on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It sounds like some program is causing this issue. Try the following steps to find the culprit and take appropriate action.</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enable the computer to start in clean boot (disable all the non Microsoft programs) to find the program that's causing this issue<br />
a. Open the article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
b. From the article, follow "Step 1: Perform a clean boot" Executing these steps will disable all the non Microsoft programs running on the computer.<br />
c. Check if the issue persists.<br />
d. If the issue does not persist in clean boot, it means that some non Microsoft program is causing the issue.<br />
e. To find out the program that's causing the issue, try "Step 2: Enable half of the services" to "Step 6: Resolve the problem"<br />
f. Once you find the culprit, check if there are any updates or patches for the program. If you find any, install them and check the difference or reinstall the latest program.<br />
g. From the article, follow "Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual"</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro OEM Key Is actually Developer Key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro OEM Key Is actually Developer Key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro OEM license key that won't activate. When trying to activate, I get a message saying that the key has already been used, even though the package has never even been opened before. I also get the error code 0x803fa071. Another thing
 I noticed, is that the Windows version changed from Pro to Pro Education after trying to activate with the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the Microsoft product activation number, and talked to a representative. After reading the product key back to the representative and verifying that there were no typos, she told me that the product key I gave her is for developers, and is not a
 key that would be sold in retail. She seemed to think that I bought an illegitimate copy from somewhere. This key was purchased through CDW, where I have purchased countless others with no issues, and who is a legitimate re-seller. The key came in the exact
 same OEM pamphlet as they always do. It says on the pamphlet: WIN PRO 10 64BIT ENGLISH 1PK DSP OEI DVD. On the license sticker inside the pamphlet, it says: Windows 10 PRO FOR OEM SOFTWARE. I can't send this back to CDW, because everything on the pamphlet
 looks to be correct, and they'll think I'm just lying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send photos of the pamphlet and license key to someone at Microsoft to prove everything I'm saying. I just don't understand how this could happen, and I feel like I've been ripped off by Microsoft. I would really like to get a new key to replace the
 supposedly developer key I got.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Justin</p>

<p>Hi Justin, <br />
<br />
The reason for this error code is a change with hardware configuration where Windows is activated, or the license has already been used to activate another computer. As a result, your license key won't activate because one OEM license is only valid for one
 computer, or is tied to the computer where the OS was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our activation team can reactivate the license if there is only a change with hardware configuration. But in your case, since it is a newly bought Windows 10 Pro OEM license. It would be best to coordinate with the retailer where you bought it, and ask for
 further verification, or a possible replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are activating (or just changing a product key) a previously activated and existing Window 10 installation using an OEM license key, and if the purchase came with a Windows 10 ISO or installer, you may try reinstalling the OS using that installation
 media, or <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and create</a></strong> a new one, before trying to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to update us on this issue.</p>
        </p>

<p>You need to perform a direct clean install of Windows 10 Pro. Because you have Windows 10 Pro Education, which is a separate SKU, your OEM System Builder Pro key won't activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.<br />

<br />
Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.<br />
<br />
BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card<br />
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/</a><br />
<br />
Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/<br />
<br />
<br />
The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.<br />
<br />
Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.<br />
<br />
Click Install now<br />
<br />
Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed
 to enter it.<br />
<br />
Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.<br />
<br />
The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro<br />
<br />
Wait while setup prepares to copy files<br />
<br />
Accept the license terms then click Next<br />
<br />
Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then
 go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select the drive then click New<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.<br />
<br />
Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK<br />
<br />
This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Wait while Windows installs<br />
<br />
When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.<br />
<br />
Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.<br />

<p>Maybe I wasn't entirely clear with my problem. The machine I was trying to activate the key on was a Hyper-V VM that was cloned from another Hyper-V VM, that's probably why I get that error code. But that's not the problem. I was able to activate the VM
 just fine with another OEM key that I have. My problem is NOT that the VM wouldn't activate, it's that one of the license keys that I tried to use is (according to the person I talked with through the Microsoft phone activation support number) a "developer"
 key, and not an OEM key (even though the package says it's OEM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to actually get the OEM license key that I payed for, and not a "developer" key that I can't actually use. Is there any way I can get Microsoft to fix this?</p>

                    <p>My taskbar is completely broken.&nbsp; Had all my normal programs pinned and everything was fine.&nbsp; Windows installed updates and my taskbar no longer has the pinned functionality.&nbsp; I can pin programs but they don't stay and immediately disappear when the program

<p>
</p><p>If I look at&nbsp;%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar I can see all the programs I have pinned.&nbsp; However, none of them show up in my taskbar unless they are actually running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deleting all shortcuts from this folder and re-pinning them</li><li>sfc /scannow (no issues)</li><li>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth (no issues)</li><li>doing all of the above and restarting the explorer process</li></ol>
<p>Not sure what else to try.&nbsp; Windows obviously knows what should be there because it's placing all the shortcuts in this folder and I can see them being added/removed when I have the folder open and pin/unpin things.&nbsp; But the taskbar just doesn't care what's

<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>How do I go about resolving this issue?&nbsp; I've found some other threads from 2016 that say the only fix is to create a brand new user and transfer everything over which is a big hassle and I really don't want to go down that path.<br />

<h2>            Problems with screen brightness and slow computer after win10 update</h2>
                    Hi everybody!<br />
<br />
I really hope you can help me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After updating my win8.1 to win10 I've lost the ability to adjust screen brightness. I cannot adjust it using the keyboard or manually.
<br />
I have tried to update my drivers ( Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 and NVIDIA GeForce GT 630), I have tried to "off" the "enable adaptive brigtness &lt;--display &lt;--advanced power settings &lt;--power options &lt;-- hardware and sound. I have also tried so reinstall the
 drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Furthermore my computer is very slow after the update, the start up process is as usual, but when I am working on the computer suddenly the touchpad doesn't work and I'll have to wait a minut or two before it works again. Happends when I am doing more than
 one thing at the time on the computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The screen goes black from time to time as well, again, when I am doing more than one ting at the time :(<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;upgrade from Windows 7&#41; bluetooth mouse issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running two Windows computers, a desktop and a laptop. Both now run windows 10 as upgrades, the desktop from windows 8.1 and the laptop (which is older) from windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a MS designer (bluetooth) mouse a few days ago. I can pair it with the desktop and am using it right now. First attempt said that didn't work but the second attempt worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the laptop the designer mouse doesn't even show up as a pairable device no matter how long I leave it in discovery mode. Other bluetooth devices work fine so I know it's not the bluetooth adapter on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some checking online and found that the designer mouse isn't compatible with windows 7 but is with win 8 and later, which has something to do with bluetooth 4 compatibility issues. I would have thought that the bluetooth driver would be upgraded when
 I upgraded to windows 10 or in subsequent updates but apparently not. I've tried running windows update but that doesn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some kind of single update or stand-alone driver I can install on my laptop to allow it to detect this mouse and/or bluetooth 4 devices? The laptop is a Sony Vaio, which Sony no longer supports. But even on the models they do support all they say
 under bluetooth is to get it from windows update, so I'm back to the same problem.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Some Bluetooth radios have firmware loaded to them by the radio manufacturer's driver.&nbsp; If this radio is one of those, then it is (at least in theory) possible that the radio manufacturer has a driver that includes newer firmware.&nbsp; But that driver may never
 have been tested on your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not run into this issue myself,&nbsp;so please don't take this as definitive guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's another option - if you have a USB port to spare on the laptop, you could get a USB plug-in Bluetooth radio that supports Bluetooth 4.0 and works with Windows 10.&nbsp; Windows only supports one Bluetooth radio, so you will have to disable the built-in
 Bluetooth radio&nbsp;using <strong>Device Manager </strong>if you go with this option.</p>

            <p>It is possible that your Sony Vaio laptop has an older version of Bluetooth radio that does not work with the Microsoft Designer mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Designer mouse requires a Bluetooth 4.0 radio on the laptop because the mouse implements (the relatively recent) Bluetooth Smart (LE) technology for increased battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an article that shows how to check whether or not the Bluetooth radio on your laptop supports 4.0 or newer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/support/bluetooth-4-compatibility</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your laptop does not support Bluetooth 4.0, then if it is feasible, you could try a different model of mouse that will work with the radio version on your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps-</p>
