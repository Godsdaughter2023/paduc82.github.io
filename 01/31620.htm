<p>If you don't have&nbsp;two&nbsp;inputs for audio, it means your TV must only have one speaker, just plug in the red rca cable.&nbsp; Your missing out though connecting the Xbox to a SD TV.&nbsp; I recommend connecting your console to your PC monitor for the best experience.</p>

<p>Yes. It will work. However, since you will only be using the red RCA input (audio right) you will be missing all of the left audio. Depending on the game, this could be an issue. You may be able to pick up a 'Y' adapter to connect both the red and white
 leads together (combining left and right audio) so that you hear both sides coming from the single speaker on your TV. Although this won't help you hear from which side the sound is coming, it will at least allow you to hear everything. It looks something

<p>If you have a scart socket in the back of your TV then you can use the rca to scart adaptor which Microsoft provide with the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>You can buy good quality HDMI monitors off Amazon now for less than the price of a 360. Plug 'n' play with one cable in hi-def. With apps like the iPlayer, you'll be getting true HD television as well through the console.</p>

<p>I suggest you follow WPAK's advice, and follow the link he provided. On that page lists several great tips about connecting your console to different TV's as well as VGA monitors.</p>
<p>Edit: It seems as though you've followed through with the advice of the other Ambassadors, and its helped! Good deal. Remember if you ever need any help with your Console or have any questions be sure to swing by again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><br />
I would suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus software installed on your computer.<br />
</span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most
 cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled,
 your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><br />
After disabling antivirus software, I would suggest you to perform clean boot and then try to install the windows updates.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click<b>Run</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type
<b>msconfig</b>, and then click<b>OK</b>.<br />
The <b>System Configuration Utility</b> dialog box is displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the
<b>General</b> tab, click<b>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted, click<b>Restart</b> to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Manually download and install the updates from Microsoft Download Center. Refer the following link</span></p>

<p>************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.</p>

<h2>            cannot connect to FTP server running on windows 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I want to use the FTP server on windows 7. I enabled IIS and FTP, configed the FTP site in INETMGR. &nbsp; &nbsp;From the Win 7 PC itself, I can login to the server as "ftp localhost". Problem is, from another PC on my local network, I cannot FTP to the Win 7 FTP
 server.<br />
<br />
I have disabled the firewall on both PCs. &nbsp;I can ping the ip address of the FTP server PC, but running FTP 192.168.3.37 gets me nothing.<br />
<br />
When I look at services, the Microsoft FTP Service is started. So is RPC and DCOM server process launcher.<br />
<br />
I started to read about giving ApplicationPoolIdentity access to the Inetpub and Ftproot directories, but that got confusing real fast.</p>
<p>What could be going wrong? &nbsp;Is there a checklist to follow to enable a Win7 PC to act as an FTP server?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the solution ended up being I did not completely turn off the windows firewall. &nbsp;I turned off the first setting - domain profile. Once I turned off public and private profiles, a client PC was able to connect to the FTP server.</p>

<h2>            Pop up windows don&#39;t work in Windows 10 on any browser</h2>
                    <p>I can browse to any website on any browser in Windows 10 (I have Chrome, Edge, and IE installed). However, if I click on any link that normally would launch a pop up window, the pop up window launches blank and says 'Unable to access the network - ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED.'
 When you click for more info, it says that the browser can't detect a connection to the Internet (even though the connection to the main site worked fine) and suggests you change your firewall settings. I uninstalled my Avast antivirus software and turned
 off Windows Defender and neither solution worked.</p>

<h2>            How can I force Windows 10 on my Acer V5-473P latpop to install the latest intel HD 4400 graphics drivers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks, looking for a bit of help here, because Acer has essentially stopped providing driver updates to my laptop, leaving me with old, probably not-the-most-optimal graphics drivers.<br />
<br />
My current graphics drivers are version 10.18.xx ... and these were last updated by Acer in 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6657d40-9aa8-4936-8635-cf42e8963308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6657d40-9aa8-4936-8635-cf42e8963308" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81497/Intel-HD-Graphics-4400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest drivers for my&nbsp;intel HD 4400&nbsp;from intel themselves</a>(as of this post, anyway) is version 15.40&nbsp;from 8/12/2016, which is what I'd like to install. But when I try, it gives me the message that I can't install these, and essentially tells me to get the
 drivers from Acer (which I already have, since they've stopped updating it, basically).<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ad18a4e-5282-49f0-b30b-4e7e6e7ebd29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ad18a4e-5282-49f0-b30b-4e7e6e7ebd29" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to somehow install the more updated graphics drivers from intel instead of staying stuck with the old ones from Acer. Is there any way I can force Windows 10 to install this? I'd appreciate the help.</p>

            <p>Hi Nate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did that but it didn't solve my problem. I was eventually able to solve it by using the zip file of drivers provided by intel intended for developers (as opposed to the automated installer I used which resulted in the original post above), after uninstalling
 the existing driver first -- the problem is now solved.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>A day ago my computer (HP Envy15-u011 x360 Convertible Touch Smart Laptop) stopped recognizing or seeing my headphones when they are plugged in. I used 2 different types of headphones (beats and skull candy) and my computer doesn't notice either,
 and both headphones work with my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speakers on my computer work just fine, I have checked for updates, re-downloaded Realtek Audio multiple times, restarted my computer, and even did a recovery on it. My computer still does not detect my headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at my Audio inputs and outputs, it shows Microphone, Speaker/HP, and Stereo Mix and under Sound, video, and game controllers it shows Realtek High Definition Audio. I do not see any headphones anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely irritating and annoying because I have no idea why the headphone was removed. I have tried multiple solutions from online and nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community and providing us with the detailed description about the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I certainly understand your concern and will try my best to help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There might be a possibility that this issue might have occurred due to incorrect settings or the audio drivers have gone bad in the system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Make sure your headphones aren't plugged into the line out (headphone) jack of your sound card or computer (unless you want to be listening with headphones rather than speakers). When you plug in headphones, most computers
 automatically cut the sound to the speakers. Ensure the headphone is fully and firmly inserted into the correct jack. Plug in the headphone and see if the same shows up in Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Run&nbsp;<strong>inbuilt audio troubleshooter</strong>&nbsp;and check if it works. Follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key +R</strong>, type&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Type<strong>&nbsp;troubleshooting&nbsp;</strong>in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Now click on&nbsp;<strong>view all</strong>&nbsp;option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Playing audio</strong>&nbsp;and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems with your volume
 settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers or headphones.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, follow method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest to download and install the latest soundcard drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>How to download and install drivers,&nbsp;</span></strong><span>please follow the link given below.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/all-drivers</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>A driver is software that a device uses to work with your PC. Every device needs a driver to work with your PC. So, in many cases, you can plug in a device, and it’ll work automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows can also download device software and info. This might include an app that the device manufacturer created to go with your device or info like the product name, manufacturer, and model number, to help you distinguish
 between similar devices.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe driver you shouldn't install.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, follow method 3.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Check with the volume settings.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Please follow the steps given below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Right click on the speaker icon in taskbar and select volume control options.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Put a check mark on "All devices currently playing sound".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Make sure you have "The default communication device unchecked".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Place a check mark on both speakers and headphones. Click Apply and OK.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, please follow method 4</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 4:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to refer to the steps in the article given below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The above article will help you identify and fix common sound problems in Windows, including no sound coming from your speakers or headphones.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Also try to install latest chipset drivers in the system and check if it helps.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>I can't do this one because when I type in "Troubleshooting" it responds with something along the lines of I don't have this.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d24d50e4-3d11-4e0d-89ed-80df9618bd00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d24d50e4-3d11-4e0d-89ed-80df9618bd00" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have Windows 10 so I had to do it a different way but I had already checked if my windows was up to date and when I ran it again it says it was completely up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have this "volume control options" when I right click my volume but I know from repeatedly looking at and messing around with my "sound and games volume" part an that that I don't have a "headphone" box to check. There is no HEADPHONE application.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6cd20fe-6da4-413a-93c9-14f30494c5ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6cd20fe-6da4-413a-93c9-14f30494c5ab" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 4</strong></p>
<p>I already tried that when it first happened, didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these solutions are also not aimed at my actual problem of, I don't have any Headphone Realtek thing. I remember looking at it once before, and it had Headphone Realtek audio, but now that is completely gone. I also noticed that as of today,
 when I click my mouse pad that the stereo\speakers make a weird sound and if I move my computer it makes a weird sound. On the picture below, there used to be a "headphone audio" and now it is just Speaker. That I believe is the problem, especially since I
 have gone through Windows and updated my audio driver multiple times and the Headphones still won't appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day ago my computer (HP Envy15-u011 x360 Convertible Touch Smart Laptop) stopped recognizing or seeing my headphones when they are plugged in. I used 2 different types of headphones (beats and skull candy) and my computer doesn't notice either,
 and both headphones work with my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speakers on my computer work just fine, I have checked for updates, re-downloaded Realtek Audio multiple times, restarted my computer, and even did a recovery on it. My computer still does not detect my headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at my Audio inputs and outputs, it shows Microphone, Speaker/HP, and Stereo Mix and under Sound, video, and game controllers it shows Realtek High Definition Audio. I do not see any headphones anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely irritating and annoying because I have no idea why the headphone was removed. I have tried multiple solutions from online and nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div><span>So this is a problem I have and no one was responding on the original so I am now re-posting this with my response to the first response from Windows.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>I have already done this before multiple times. After each update of the software, after the restart to factory mode. But there is nothing there. This is the problem that I was trying to point out and inform you. There is no Realtek headphones or
 anything for headphones and in turn my computer won't recognize it. I have updated the Realtek from the site as well as windows multiple times and it hasn't worked.&nbsp;</p>

<div>I have not been having any responses and every time I need to get a response I have to re-post my question with all the answers. I do not like doing this however due to my position of being abroad in a place that does
 not have any Microsoft stores, Best Buy, any form of computer support for HP computers I must do this. I am a student and this is extremely annoying because I need to watch movies and videos for my classes without disturbing roommates and people in public
 but I cannot. It also seems that my stereo\speaker has started making really high pitched sounds when any form of movement (breathing, typing, hand movement) occurs nearby which is irritating and unpleasant. The only way to stop it is to mute the speakers
 so now I can't even watch anything using my own computer. I have only 1 plug for headphones (it literally has headphones right next to it) so I can't be mistaking it or using the wrong one. Every other plug is USB related. Can I have an actual answer that
 is helpful.&nbsp;</div>

<strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<strong>Before I start with my Windows problems, I just want to say, I do not understand why when there is an error with Windows you cannot cut/paste to help boxes like this. That's crazy! And also, this help box itself--doesn't allow for small size text, so
 I have a huge error message from ANOTHER page I had to open, and can't this small. So NOW I am in a note program from Google REWRITING this entire message so you can read it. Is it just me or is this a ridiculous system?????? And since I&nbsp; do this all the time
 because Windows sucks, I have seen an easy fix, so if you have one, it's not readily visible to readers.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<strong>SO-my REAL Windows issues. </strong>Went to&nbsp; run&nbsp;an update since it said it was due [I thought it automatically did it, but....}] got this error message "<strong>We couldn't update system reserved partition "error installing Windows 10 update</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I look it up and find its caused by <strong>partition</strong> set aside for Windows and updates that might be full? What??? Of what?Then I have to look at disks for the type. Now run things to find out what type of partition I have-not sure if looking in the
 right place since there's a few, and there's no instruction on which one it's contained in, but I find disk 0&nbsp; is a&nbsp;<span><span>(<strong>GPT</strong>), so then there are more instructions. BUT there's
 also a <strong>DANGER-DANGER </strong>type warning about how complex this is.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<span><span>Before I do this, and maybe ruin this computer. I want to know why this happened. Would this be something that happens on either a
<strong>new or well-refurbished computer? </strong>Because that is what I have---supposedly. I have had the computer for less than two weeks, and I didn't even start using it until about 10 days ago. I also wanted you to know, the
<strong>event log has hundreds</strong> of <strong>RED ERROR</strong> messages,&nbsp; many different things, nothing I recognize.&nbsp; There's actually 27,000 RED ERRORS just in Admin. The errors, funny, start 8 months before I got this new/refurbished laptop. Wouldn't
 a laptop be thoroughly cleaned and all these error messages addressed and erased? I think I have the right to know if I was sold a refurbished computer and if so if they did a crappy job "refurbishing" it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have listed just a handful&nbsp;of the event log messages
 in case it something to you.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<span><span>Now, <strong>
<span><span>Now, <strong>
is that normal for a new or new-like computer? </strong>How could there possibly be so many errors, when there's nothing that done on my end other than normal working activity. I need some answers before I&nbsp;</span><span>proceed</span><span>.
 I fear they'll be no going back to like a system restore, or any other method they recommend. Please help me understand this. Is Windows that bad I"d have ALL these issues in such short time [actually the log showed the day I 1st used computer errors were
 recorded] or is it possible it's not a new computer and/or a refurbished one that has been&nbsp;</span><span>appropriately</span><span>&nbsp;reconditioned? I need&nbsp;</span><span>guidance</span><span>&nbsp;it
 is unfair that I have to go through all this now. I had another laptop from the same place with many problems also brand new. This was supposed to replace that mess, and yet..</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Dian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, this may happen usually with a refurbished device. However, there are also new laptops or computers that’s been stocked in a store which the operating system is already installed. In this kind of event, this could record error that
 will appear on your computer using the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In line with the Event Viewer, you’ll see there a lot of warnings, errors and additional information which may imply that your device is broken when there’s nothing really showing as an issue. The said error and warnings in the event log are always seen
 there and not of it can be solved. Most of the time, Even Viewer is used to troubleshoot that issue that you’re encountering already and not with the errors that doesn’t occur yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you’ve identified the specific event log does exist already on your computer as an issue, take note of its Event ID and the Source, or a combination of these values to find out what’s causing the issue and how to resolve it at the same time.</p>

<p>Hi Dian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me with an answer. But here's&nbsp; the actually current issue I am havinga and I don't why it is happening or if I should pursue remedies on my own since they stated it was complex. Cut/pasted from originail question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SO-my REAL Windows issues.&nbsp;</span>Went to&nbsp; run&nbsp;an update since it said it was due [I thought it automatically did it, but....}] got this error message "<span>We couldn't update system reserved partition "error installing Windows 10 update</span></p>
<p>I look it up and find its caused by&nbsp;<span>partition</span>&nbsp;set aside for Windows and updates that might be full? What??? Of what?Then I have to look at disks for the type. Now run things to find out what type of partition I have-not sure if looking in the
 right place since there's a few, and there's no instruction on which one it's contained in, but I find disk 0&nbsp; is a&nbsp;<span><span>(<span>GPT</span>), so then there are more instructions. BUT there's also a&nbsp;<span>DANGER-DANGER&nbsp;</span>type warning about how complex
 this is.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Before I do this, and maybe ruin this computer. I want to know why this happened</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Original Title: &nbsp;kb3135173</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Feb 9 my windows update installed many updates successfully. It corrected a problem I was having in ie11 when multiple tabs were being used. However, since then something changed in my computer and I'm having the same problem again ( multiple open tabs
 in ie11 were causing severe flickering on my display!)</p>
<p>Can I delete kb3135173, Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3135173), and reinstall it?</p>
<p>If so, how do I uninstall it?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, however:</p>
<p>When the display problem started I tried several solutions, but nothing helped. I have CCleaner and Ace Utilities. Have used both for years to help clean up my PC and never, ever, had a problem with either. Shortly after on Feb 9 I received a major update
 from Microsoft W10 and found that everything started working well, but the display problem started again within several days. &nbsp;I assumed it was my display driver. I went to the website and found I had the latest driver, but I uninstalled mine anyway and then
 reinstalled, just in case it was corrupted. This did not help either.</p>
<p>So, I went &amp; purchased a new GPU &amp; installed it to no avail. The flickering started again.</p>
<p>I dug into the Microsoft help area to learn more about the recent W10 updates. It mentioned that ie11 in W10 caused a flickering problem if more than 1 tab was being used. I use 3-5 tabs almost routinely and low and behold their update solved my problem.
 But I probably used CCleaner &amp;/or Ace Utility within a few days of installing the update and the problem started again. 1 0f these programs I assume has removed something vital within the updates.
</p>
<p>Now I deleted the W10 Cumulative update&nbsp;and the Adobe Flash update, then reinstalled both of these. Unfortuately this did not solve the flickering problem.
</p>
<p>I have found that the fewer Tabs I am using, the less severe the problem. I would love to solve this and get my computer back to normal if possible. Any further advice would be much appreciated. I really thought that removing those 2 updates and then reinstalling
 them would have helped!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You are experiencing this problem because there are no drivers available in manufacturers website for Windows 10. I suggest you to download the drivers for Windows&nbsp;8 and install in compatibility mode.&nbsp;Please find the below link to download the drivers:</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>Just completed a windows system image of my computer just in case I fowl up doing your recommendations.</p>
<p>There are a number of driver downloads available if I set the&nbsp;"Change" function in the link you sent me to "Microsoft Window 8".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) &nbsp;What I'm not clear on is if I need to install <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
all</span> of them for my particular problem, or only specific ones like just <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
video</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;I'm not clear on how I&nbsp;set&nbsp;the installed ones&nbsp;to compatibility mode? Aren't they already in compatibility mode since I&nbsp;changed the Windows Version from W10 to W8 in the link you sent me?
</p>
<p>Sorry, but I'm getting confused. For instance, I already have W10 drivers for my display directly from the AMD website! I'll wait for your reply before I try to download and install any of the drivers listed.</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>I did as you asked, but it still doesn't help my flickering. So, I updated my monitors driver; still no change. I will try to borrow another monitor from a friend &amp; try it. I assume if I have no problem with another monitor, then I will need a new monitor.
 It's the only recourse left to me. If I continue to&nbsp;have the problem with a different monitor I'll call in a computer repair tech to try to resolve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for all the time you've spent with me trying to help me resolve the problem. I'll let you know when &amp; how the issue gets resolved. I assume it may help you to help others that may have a similar problem. I've found absolutely NO other people using
 Google Search that have this issue; only found many that had problems with off &amp; on flickering of their display, but not changing of the colors in the display when the flickering occurs!</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>I've had my computer repair tech check out my PC system. They also checked my display screen and found it is working properly. They recommended I wait until April's W10 updates. If my problem is not resolved they will help me to do a clean install of W10
 or W7, however they preferred I went back to W7, where I had no problems. Not sure what to do, but I'll wait until next months updates.&nbsp;If you wish I'll keep you informed of any resolution.</p>

    <title>BSOD using NVIDIA 8600GTS - tried multiple driver versions, no luck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivymike1031  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD using NVIDIA 8600GTS - tried multiple driver versions, no luck</h2>
                    Anyone have a quick fix for this issue, which allows me to use both of my monitors?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've been running Vista x64 Home Premium&nbsp;since mid '07 with relatively few problems, but I wanted to try out Windows 7, so I bought an upgrade to Win 7 x64 Home Premium over the weekend.&nbsp; The system immediately became quite unstable, rarely working for 10 minutes
 without an abrupt reboot or freeze.&nbsp; Through experimentation I was able to turn the problem off/on by disabling/enabling the PCI-E graphics card and instead using the built-in graphics card on the motherboard.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
With my add-on card active, the computer will crash randomly when surfing the web or performing usual windows activities, like browsing the start menu.&nbsp; It can be forced to crash rapidly by personalizing the desktop and clicking a few aero schemes one after
 the other - it rarely allows more than one or two clicks before freezing or rebooting.&nbsp; The add-on video card is a MSI NX8600GTS-T2D256EZ HD (GeForce 256MB 128-bit GDDR3 PCI-E x16)<br />
<br />
I've tried a few versions of NVIDIA drivers to no avail&nbsp;- there is really no notable difference in the crash behavior.&nbsp; I ran the memory test tool and it found no problems.&nbsp; I've even tried "underclocking" the GPU using a tool from NVIDIA, but that also had
 no effect.&nbsp; Crashes are less frequent if I turn off Aero (but still occasionally occur when browsing websites).&nbsp; To reiterate,&nbsp;crashes are completely stopped (aero or not) if I disable the NVIDIA card and use the built-in graphics on my motherboard.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The rest of the system spec&nbsp;is as follows:<br />
MSI G33M-FI LGA 775 Intel G33 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard<br />
Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 Conroe 3.0GHz LGA 775 65W Dual-Core Processor Model BX80557E6850<br />
A-DATA 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel<br />
ASUS 18X DVD±R DVD Burner with LightScribe Black PATA Model DRW-1814BL LightScribe Support<br />
Maxtor DiamondMax 21 STM3500630AS 500GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s 3.5" Hard Drive<br />
Antec Sonata III 500 ATX Mid Tower Computer Case, 500W Power Supply<br />
ACER AL2216W LCD Monitor<br />
LG L1952TQ LCD Monitor - disconnected (Can only use one monitor w/built-in graphics)<br />
SUPER TALENT INT-AIN1-C All-in-one USB 2.0 Card Reader<br />
<br />
It all worked under Vista x64.

            2 days and no crashes.&nbsp; I've been running it ragged.&nbsp; Must have been some kind of hardware problem which mysteriously popped up when I installed 7.&nbsp; how odd.&nbsp; I've even got the original NVIDIA graphics card back in, and it's worked fine with both the WDDM
 driver and the latest&nbsp;NVIDIA one.<br />

            <p>I have the same problem. Just spoken to Microsoft support. They&nbsp;are aware of the issue but won't do anything about it as I am out of warranty.&nbsp; They say it is a hardware problem. Rubbish product. I previously had all past PlayStation consoles with any problems. Why o why did I want to try something new. Selling this junk and buying a PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Installing App Packages Without Reinstalling Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sd_001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing App Packages Without Reinstalling Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had a problem with the entire toolbar, start menu and Cortana which was solved by reinstalling Windows 10. Here's the details in this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/start-button-edge-windows-store-and-most-of-the/9c296875-f07f-48de-826c-273e0f497836</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I have two questions regarding this:<br />
</p>
<p>1&gt; I was wondering if there was a solution where you could simply reinstall the required packages from app store instead of reinstalling Win 10 again. That's less time and hassle for all. Like in Android, you simply reinstall packages affected from the play
 store or from the net. Unless they're integrated system applications, it usually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&gt; Do I have to download Win 10 every time I have to reinstall it? It takes a lot of time and I honestly could use a flash drive to reinstall Win 10 whenever I needed it, especially in places where I can't have good access to internet. So, is there a way
 to download Win 10 onto my flash drive and keep it for future use? Did I miss something?</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that after reinstalling&nbsp;Windows 10, it will install the Apps which are included with the Operating System. If any Apps were purchased before reinstalling, it will be removed and will have to be re-downloaded from Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can create an USB installation Media (ISO)&nbsp;for Windows 10 using Media Creation Tool. Please follow the steps provided in the link below for more information:</p>

Hello, </p>
<p>
I am uploading my most recent crash dump file in hopes that someone who knows more about this than I do can read it and tell me where I should be looking to solve the issue. I also understand if there is not enough information in this file, I am just desperate
 for help and this is all I have right now. I have been dealing with this issue off and on for the past 16 months and I've tried various configurations and testing to try to find the culprit.<br />
</p>
<p>
Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read over this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you both for your replies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided right after posting this to try using the driver "verifier" utility method. (Anyone else who reads this, PLEASE - create a system restore point before trying this). It was able to identify two drivers that were related to my computer's manufacturer-
 Lenovo - that were causing issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say FOR SURE that the issue is solved but since removing the drivers I've had no BSOD. I conducted rigorous stress testing to check system stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two drivers were ApsX64.sys and ApsHM64.sys. I removed them using the method in the final post of this&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Pre-Installed-Lenovo-Software/How-the-get-rid-of-Lenovo-ThinkVantage-Tools/m-p/830275/highlight/true#M20638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Thread</a>.
 This appears to be a LENOVO issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, I'll revisit this thread in a few days to update.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I am trying to perform an in-place upgrade of Windows 7.</h2>
                    I had many problems with my windows 7 64 bit installation. The main one is that I cannot install windows security essentials and several microsfot support people have tried unsuccessfully to resolve this via remote access.&nbsp; A Sony repairman told me that
 the problem is a common one for those like me who have done an in place upgrade to windows professional from home premium. Windows seems to think there is something shonky about a Sony notebook having a different windows serial number that that which is expected.
 They say the only remedy is to restore the notebook to it's purchase state and then install windows security essentials. However if I do this I would need to redo the upgrade to professional that I did online.&nbsp; How can I do this a second time if I go down
 this path. I have no windows disk as windows was purchased installed on the notebook.<br />

You must reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium, then use your key to move to Pro. If you don't have a record of your Pro key and Windows Pro is currently installed and activated you can use a program to get your key:<br />

Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer<br />
<br />
OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks.
 ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.<br />
<br />
If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ - check your manual if you're not sure how to. If you have
 install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't have the restore partition or install disks:<br />
<br />
Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.

<br />
Anytime Upgrade Using An Already Purchased Retail Pro/Ultimate Key<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 Home Premium, type Anytime Upgrade in the Search programs and files box in the Start menu and click on the Windows Anytime Upgrade icon.&nbsp; From there, you can enter your retail (Full or Upgrade) Windows 7 Professional/Ultimate product key and perform
 a simple upgrade. Online Anytime Upgrade is not available in all countries. All programs and files will stay on the computer, no disk is needed and it takes about 10 minutes.

    <title>Windows Media player issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> comnerd75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media player issue</h2>
                    So i play Warcraft 3 from time to time, and i listen to music at the same time. &nbsp;I have two screens going on, so when i turn on the game one screen shows the game and the other is left with whatever was there. &nbsp;So what I typically do is leave the&nbsp;visualizations&nbsp;on
 the other screen. BUT! &nbsp;they turn off when the game starts. &nbsp;If anyone could tell me how to keep the visualizations going I would greatly appreciate it. &nbsp;

<p><span>Hi
</span><span><span>comnerd75</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We would like to know is this issue only with this particular game or is it even with the other games you play on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps I would suggest are:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check with the game settings, if it has been set to play only one monitor, try changing the settings and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Update the display adapter or try uninstalling and reinstalling, check if that issue resolves: Steps to update Display adapter:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand Display adapter and right click on the sub item and click update driver.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If this fails then try to reinstall the Display adapter</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand Display adapter and right click on the sub item and click uninstall.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Visit the manufacturer website to download the latest display driver.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>v.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Install the driver and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>
<p><span>All the best!</span></p>

<span>Hi SevOmega,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft 7 answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>The patch which you have downloaded might support only Windows XP with (SP1 or SP2) which is not compatible for your computer
 since you computer is installed with Win7.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you visit the same website where you have downloaded the patch and download the patch that is suitable for
 Win7 and check.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest that you contact the Xbox support for further assistance:

            <p>Hi Barbara, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, you will need to install the device driver for your Bluetooth device. If the device came with a CD or DVD containing device drivers compatible with your version of Windows, insert that disk into the disk drive and follow the instructions
 to install the driver. <br />
<br />
If your Bluetooth device did not come with a driver installation disk, you will need to go to the device manufacturer's website and download and install the latest driver for your device. To do this, go to the hardware manufacturer and search on the latest
 version Bluetooth driver for your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply if you have any questions. </p>

    <title>Share apps between different users on the same laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Share apps between different users on the same laptop</h2>
                    How do I do this on Windows 8.1?<br />
<br />
Not all users have (or - to my mind - need) microsoft accounts. How can I share a Windows Store app between a user with a microsoft account and one with a local account?<br />

            I am equally frustrated with this issue. &nbsp;I have spent the last week trying to get some of the apps into my children's local accounts. &nbsp;I have gone through every step by step explanation and NOTHING works. &nbsp;I have even tried temporarily switching my child's
 account to an administrator account, signing out of my microsoft account on my log in and signing into it on his account. &nbsp;I hit a brick wall every time. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Bingo! &nbsp;I just figured it out! &nbsp;It is a royal pain in the neck, but at least my kids will be able to use the apps. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I hit the store screen that tells me to log into my microsoft account, there was an option at the bottom of the page to install apps individually. &nbsp;I hit that and am able to install the apps, one at a time, on my child's account. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also turned off all the family safety options on this child's account and changed his settings to standard user instead of child. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once I was able to install the already purchased apps on his account, I switched to another child's account. &nbsp;On the second child, I kept his family safety checks on and kept his account at child, and it is all working. &nbsp;(Troubles downloading the Kindle
 app, but I think it is a setting in the family safety. &nbsp;I am just trying to figure out which one.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think it is ridiculous to have to go through each app and manually install it on every single account. &nbsp;There should be an option to share the apps, just like sharing folders or pictures. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the store, if you go to the categories and click on "see all", it will open a box across the top. &nbsp;Click on "your apps," and choose "apps not installed on this PC" to get the list of the apps that are on the pc, just under a different user. Still
 a pain, but at least you have a list and can install one at a time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps someone else. &nbsp;I was at the point of trying to figure out how to ditch the Windows 8 for a good old 7. &nbsp;(Hubby is a programmer and two adult children are computer guys and also were unable to figure it out.)</div>
