                    <p>Not sure if this is the right place but, can someone please help me! I would be extremely grateful!</p>
<p>First off, I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to computers and their parts so please be gentle with me!</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I keep getting the following message when I try to connect to the internet using a pay as you go Huawei<span>&nbsp;

<p>Rightly or wrongly I have already called Vodafone who were extremely unhelpful and rude. I have tried uninstalling/ reinstalling also restoring the computer to an earlier time -both<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Touchscreen suddenly malfunctions on Google Chrome Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having trouble with my touchscreen for a long time. When I start using Google Chrome on my browser, the touchscreen works totally fine, but only in the first few minutes. The touchscreen then starts to do weird things and not function the way
 it is supposed to. When I try to click something it first doesn't respond, then it spontaneously shows the right-click option, along with really weird functions it starts to do. Someone please help! I have been very stressed about this for so long :( Thanks!</p>
<p>Fyi my computer is the Dell Inspiron 7548.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Yuuki</p>

            <p>Hi Yuuki,</p>

<strong>all </strong>options on the left panel.</li><li>Run the Hardware troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>You may also try updating the HID compliant touchscreen driver in Device Manager by following the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong><strong>+ </strong><strong>X </strong>keys.</li><li>Select <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Human </strong><strong>Interface </strong><strong>Device</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>HID </strong><strong>compliant </strong><strong>touchscreen</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Driver </strong>tab.</li><li>Select <strong>Update </strong><strong>Driver</strong>.</li><li>Reboot the PC once the driver has successfully installed for the changes to take effect.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Rafael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did both the hardware troubleshooter and the driver update. The touchpad worked fine for the first few minutes. Then the touchscreen started acting funny. Unfortunately, the process you laid out for me did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also realized that I did not inform you in my question that my touchpad stops working, right as the touchscreen goes funny. This is always the case, ever since the touchscreen problem has persisted. Do you know of a connection between the two, that
 you can somehow solve out?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply in advance.</p>

            If the first two methods didn't work, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer of the laptop. There's a
<span>possibility</span> that the ribbon connected to the touchpad and with the touchscreen is malfunctioning.

<p>I will try to find some time to chat with a Dell technical support assistant, and I will follow up with you how it went. However, my warranty has expired, so I am not sure if they could really help me out because of my status. Do you know if you have any
 other suggestions for me that could possibly resolve my solution as of now? Thanks! Please look forward to my reply within this week.</p>

            The first two troubleshooting steps that I gave should <span>
fix</span> it. If you're done with the <span>
troubleshooting, but</span> the issue <span>
persists</span>, there's a possible that the hardware itself is malfunctioning where the computer manufacturer can give more details on what you can do to fix it.

<h2>            Windows says I need permission from myself to move a file</h2>
                    <p>I am at my wit’s end with a problem that I am having. I have searched the web thoroughly and have tried several trouble-shooting steps. Let me give you the rundown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: My computer has multiple hard drives. I run my OS off of a SSD and all of the rest of the HDs are standard. The main disc I use for every day storage is 3TBs and seems to have possibly gotten corrupted. I purchased new HDs, but now, when I try
 to move some of the files over to the new hard drive, I’m told “You need permission to perform this action. You require permission from ********* to make changes to this file.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on extensive online research, I’ve tried the following (along with the results):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gone into a file or folder’s Properties &gt; Security &gt; Advanced and made sure that I have permission to do everything (except “Special permissions” which is grayed out). And yes… I’ve made sure to check that it should apply to all sub-folders and such. I’ve
 actually given full permission to every user and group there is, so there is no reason I wouldn’t have access.</li><li>Disabled antivirus/firewall programs. No impact. The same problem occurs.</li><li>Turned UAC all the way off. No impact. The same problem occurs.</li><li>Moved the files to a different folder on the same HD and then tried to move it off the HD. I was able to move the file to a new folder without a problem, but even from the new folder I’m unable to move the file off of the old HD to the new HD.</li><li>Installed the “Take Ownership” registry tweak. This DOES allow me to take ownership, but I still get the same error, only now it tells me that I need permission from myself to make changes to the file.</li><li>Used “Unlocker” to unlock the files. No impact. The same problem occurs.</li><li>Created a new Admin account and tried to give it all of the permissions. No impact. The same problem occurs.</li><li>Used the command prompt (as an administrator) and used the icacls command to t
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As indicated, none of these solutions worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should also be noted that before I realized I might have a corrupted HD, I thought I might have caught a virus or something so I did a completely fresh install of Windows on my SSD. Also, I am the only user on this computer and it is not in any shared
 groups or anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me state that I understand this may all be caused by the corrupted HD, but it’s pissing me off that the error seems to be tied to Windows permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts as to something else I can try to resolve this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your input!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you run the zip file, it places a new item in the right click menu called 'Take Ownership'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use it, you highlight the file or folder over which you want ownership, right click and select take ownership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, a window will appear and a lot of permissions data will pass through quite quickly. When the permissions have been granted, the window will close, and you will be able to easily access
 any of the data in the file or folder you first selected.. </p>

            <p>Well "Move" and "Copy Then Delete" are the same thing (that's what moving does in the background).</p>
<p>But like you said, since the copy didn't work, then it's definitely the destination that's throwing back the failure.</p>

            <p>OK... So the problem is with the destination drive. How does that information help (aside from the fact that it allows me to rule out the possibility that this is an issue with the source drive being corrupt)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My permissions for both drives (source and destination) are 100% "Full Control" for all users and groups, so I still don't know why Windows is asking for me to give permission to myself (nor do I know how to do that since I already have full control).</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what you mean by "redirect your libraries", but I've tried moving to simply highlight the files and folders and click-and-drag them to the new HD, and I've also tried to copy and paste the folders/files. Neither worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both drives are internal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SeaTools drive failed its scan of the source drive (which is a Seagate). That's one of the reasons why I am assuming it has bad sectors in it. I did not run SeaTools on the new drive as it is not a Seagate.</p>

            <p>The Seagate utility can diagnose most drives, doesn't matter whether they are Seagate drives, but if Seatools reported that the drive has failed then its too late to try to transfer data as that data (the files) will probably be damaged.</p>

            <p>As I indicated in my original post, I understand that files may be damaged because they live on corrupted sectors on the source drive, but that doesn't explain why I am getting permission errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the libraries and the SSD, I don't use libraries and the SSD houses the OS only so it doesn't play into this problem at all (I only mentioned the fresh install so that nobody would suggest it could be a virus attacking Windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really pretty simple: I had a huge HD with a ton of data on it. It failed. I now want to recover as much of the data as possible. I'm able to move quite a bit, but the rest is giving me permission errors. If somebody can tell me with absolute clarity
 (as opposed to a wild guess) that the permission errors are a result of the files living on bad sectors, okay. But Shawn has already said that the problem resides on the destination disc (which is fine), not the source disc.</p>

            Hi, RGORD
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running. 
<br />1. Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC. 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter: 
<br />sfc /scannow 
<br />1. Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages: 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually. 
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems. 
<br />
<br />Please see this great 3rd party link for a complete step-by-step guide

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I tried what you suggested.&nbsp; When I entered Win+X I got an option for Windows Power Shell or Window Power Shell(Admin). &nbsp; I chose Windows PowerShell.&nbsp; When I opened the CMD I could navigate my way to C:\users\niels\Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Dir from the Command Prompt while in Desktop produces an empty folder...nothing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However from the Windows 10 Desktop (i.e. the screen) I see all my files including a myexample.py file that I am looking for.&nbsp; If I use Windows explore to navigate to This PC&gt;local Disk(c:)&gt;Users&gt;niels&gt;Desktop there are no files listed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come that file I am looking (and other) are not visible when I use the CMD C:\users\niels\Desktop\Dir?&nbsp; Any thoughts. &nbsp;</p>

            Hey Cproo12,
<br />
<br />Sorry if this won't be of much help, but I've formulated a solution just now and there's not a lot of information about it out there.
<br />
<br />Right-click the Start button, click on Windows PowerShell (Admin).
<br />
<br />Enter the following: get-appxpackage *xbox* | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />This should remove the Xbox app. Go to Task Manager and ensure nothing Xbox related is open in the Details tab. Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Once you've rebooted, go to Start and search for "Microsoft Store" and click on the Microsoft Store icon. Look for the Xbox app, get it, then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Let me know how this pans out. Good luck.

<p>Hiya, HaDoK_i_H!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, it looks like you want to translate or have the game come out in Russian language. I was able to find some information in regards to this issue which I will link below. Also I suggest contacting the
 game developers to check and see if they have any suggestion or advice on this issue. I hope you find this information helpful.

"At the beginning of the game when your given the choice to pick to play as the, "Prince/Princess", look down at the lower left hand corner. You'll see the Y button icon, press Y to go into the, "Options", menu. The very first option will already be highlighted

    <title>Corrupt WMA file tags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sag000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt WMA file tags</h2>
                    I am using Vista SP2. I store all of my music files in WMA format which are stored on a dedicated external hard drive (500Gb).<br />
I have over 11,000 music files spanning about 700 albums.<br />
Until about 2 weeks ago all of these files have been ripped, stored and played without any issues; the albums list all of its tracks, durations and artist details etc without any problem.<br />
My Windows Media Player library links to the hard drive storage and also has had no problem listing and playing files.<br />
<br />
My system has no changes or updates beyond the regular Windows Vista updates.<br />
<br />
For what ever reason all of my music file information has become corrupted resulting in the album tracks reading as though it was a different album track with different artist information.&nbsp; The odd thing is that playing the track reveals that the track is actually
 the track that is expected on the desired album - it is all the tag information that is wrong.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player library now shows multiple instance of the album due to its individual tracks being listed against various random albums.<br />
<br />
I have tried a free download tag corruption repair software and it seems to have worked.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would like to know a couple of things:<br />
1) is this a recognised issue<br />
2) is there a common cause<br />
<br />
and lastly and most critically, is there an easy fix?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>The Corruption might happen due to many reasons.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the Third party application that you used to fix Windows Media player and check if any log files that it keeps inorder to identify the problem.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
 any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
<p>Hope the information helps.</p>

            Hi Sudarshan<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
Just to confirm, I did not use the third party software prior to this problem<br />
I did not use it to fix Windows Media Player.<br />
I have only used it to test its capability of fixing a small sample size of files.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell there aren't any log files that are accessable to a user.&nbsp; As such it doesn't seem to be giving any suggestions regarding what may have caused this.<br />
<br />
I apprecaite that you suggest this type of corruption can be caused by many reasons.&nbsp; Could you give me an idea of what kind of reasons so that I can explore if they exist on my computer.<br />
<br />
Also, are you aware of any Windows based solution to fixing the files as opposed to buying a third party product?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for any help you can offer.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am sorry to say that this didn't help at all.<br />
<br />
The link you added for Troubleshooting relates to Windows 7 and not Vista as I had stated I use.<br />
I did try going through the Vista Troubleshooting for WMP however it only had a list of FAQ, none of which were anything like tag corruption issues.<br />
<br />
Is there a Vista link that should have tken me to some other troubleshooting proocess?<br />
<br />
As for the last suggestion, i.e. manually correct the tagging information, I have over 10,000 affected files.&nbsp; I would be quicker ripping them all again rather than manually typing the corrections.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this sounds aboit unappreciative but I was hoping for something more reflective of my predicament.<br />
<br />
Your help is approeciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Steven<br />

I've never heard of any issue even remotely like this- for windows media player, zune, or any other media app....
<div>You do know that the tag data is actually data embedded into the mp3 or wma file, right? &nbsp;That means corruption of that data is file corruption to those music files as well, which of course would be of very great concern!</div>
<div>The worst I've ever heard of is mistaken tag data being embedded because an application made a mistaken identification of the track....but when this happens, it is a one off error.</div>
<div>If you don't mind my asking, what was the name of the tool you used to correct this?</div>

<h2>            Help&#33; Windows 10 Media Creation Tool Stuck At &#34;Making sure you&#39;re ready to install&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Windows 7 Professional on my computer and wanted to upgrade to Windows 10 so I downloaded the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool but it got stuck on "Making sure you're ready to install" for longer than 24 hours! I had even disabled Windows Firewall,
 Windows Defender, and even uninstalled some heavy files. It still stayed stuck. So about two hours ago I restarted my PC and started the whole process again. It's back at "Making sure you're ready to install" but when it started, my C drive had 440GB free
 of 910GB and after a few minutes, it showed "436GB free of 910GB". That did not happen before. Does that mean that it's downloading and it's working?? How long can this last??</p>

<p>Unless you used the Update Now button it just downloads what is needed to create the Installation USB or CD Media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it should be downloaded to your download Folder and you need to run what was downloaded to create the Install Media of your choice. Once that is done you can use the USB or CD to Update or Install Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>how far in the future is your current Gold subscription?</p>
<p>If it's 36 months or this code will make it pass 36 months in future then that is the cause, since it's only possible to have 36 months in the future. In such case you will have to wait until you can redeem that 12 months code when it doesn't result in passing
 that 36 months.</p>
<p>You should be able to see the current end date for the subscription at <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Wireless network not listed on possible networks</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm currently in Italy and having issues with the router at my apartment.&nbsp; The network won't appear on the list of possible networks, even when I have the laptop set directly next to the router.&nbsp; I can connect via cable, but this isn't terribly helpful as
 the router is in someone else's room.&nbsp; I can also connect to nearby unsecured networks, but would prefer to use the encrypted one in the apartment.&nbsp; My iphone is connected to the correct network and my friend's google phone also connected.&nbsp; I've tried restarting
 everything and switching between using Intel PROset and Windows to manage wi-fi connections, but without any success.&nbsp; Not the most tech savy person, so not much else I can do beyond that.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows XP SP2 on a Dell Latitude D630.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions - I was able to check on the configuration of the router.&nbsp; The problem was that the router was set to channel 13, while my network card would only pick up 11 channels (anyone have any idea why this is? - my iphone and other roommates'
 macs had no issues with this)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to install a new driver and I can now connect to the wireless network.</p>

            Hi Phil.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />During install set up a Local Account which after install you can convert to a MS Account:

            You're not exactly clear on what you did.
<br />
<br />I think you said you wanted to change Windows 10 to the SSD which of course if how it should be.  It reads like you did this and are having problems setting up your new install account.  I was trying to show you how to do this to avoid problems with initial sign in.  
<br />
<br />If you haven't even started changing to the SSD yet, then what is it that you did that has caused it to not be able to sign into the Microsoft Account.?
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            By changing the boot drive, do you mean you reinstalled Windows to the SSD?  Did you unplug the other drive to keep it from interfering?  
<br />
<br />If you set up the MS Account during install and it won't sign in now, see the steps I gave which include everything that can be done.  
<br />
<br />You should have your files backed up or on the other drive, correct?  If necessary then you can do it over but this time follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>So what am I to do. I've tried various things suggested by others who have had the same problem and the app still won't work, it dims the screen when I press the Solitare icon, and the notice says This app won't open. and I then close it and the screen gets
 brighter</p>

    <title>Is it possible to use Bitlocker drive encryption to permanently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradleya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to use Bitlocker drive encryption to permanently encrypt a DVD&#63;</h2>
                    I tried to create a permanently encrypted DVD. Here's what I did.<br />
<br />
I formatted a 4GB USB flash drive as NTFS file system. I turned on Bitlocker encryption for the 4GB flash drive. I copied 3+ gigabytes of files to it. Then I locked the drive with command prompt "manage-bde -lock &lt;drive letter:&gt;". I then tried to image the
 flash drive to my regular hard disk so that I could burn the contents to a DVD where it would remain forever encrypted, only accessible on a Windows 7 drive with correct password. Only problem, is the burning software I used, CDBurnerXP, popped up a "Location
 is not available" window that said, "&lt;drive letter:&gt; not acceissible. Access is denied".
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to accomplish what I am trying to do here with Bitlocker? <br />
<br />
If not, word to Microsoft. Put this feature request on your to-do-list. Thank You.

<p><span>Hi Bradley,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows 7 Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately Windows 7 does not encrypt a DVD. It encrypts only Flash drives and Hard Drives. You cannot copy encrypted data to any other media. As you know the use of encryption is to make
 the file or folder hidden or not accessible to others, so trying to copy it will not be of much help.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Missing media driver in Windows 10 Creators Update Media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cole bantam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing media driver in Windows 10 Creators Update Media</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>The Installation media for Win10 1703 (Creators Update) is driving me crazy. I have testet it on 3 PCs now, and anywhere I got the "Missing media driver" error. I already copied the MSAHCI driver to the USB-Drive and tried to install the driver from there,
 but this also results in errors (no new driver was found). I tried that with the official Insider ISO and with the media created by the Media Creation Tool -&gt; no difference between them. It seems like the Standard AHCI driver doesn't load correctly on the
 1703 Media or the driver doesn't work with most SATA Controllers. The Anniversary Update Media works perfectly on all those PCs, but its a bit frustrating to always have to install Anniversary Update first, and then do an upgrade to Creators Update.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do, or do I have to wait for updatet ISO's?</p>

            I downloaded the ISO from the page given in Ruz San's Reply but it is bit for bit identical to the one I already had. The both pages didn't give any new hints to me. I'm not booting from DVD but from Flashdrive. The Aniversay Update on the very same flashdrive
 is working well in 32 and 64bit. The creators Update fails in 32 and 64bit.

            <p>The error tells us that the media used to install Creators Update on the computers may be corrupted. If you used the same flash drive to install Creators Update on different computers and got the same error, it's possible that the flash drive has something
 to do with the problem. See if formatting it or using a different flash drive will result to the same scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try saving the ISO file to a CD or DVD. It will be helpful in identifying whether the flash drive causes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it works differently.</p>

            <p>OK, first of all, my fault to blame the ISO itself. Burnt to disk it actually worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I tested to rename the folders on the flashdrive to their original values (x64 and x86) and with that names, the Setup starts well too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why didn't I use the original foldernames at first? Because the original folders (x64 and x86) on the flashdrive were already occupied by the Anniversary Update Files. So I copied the Creators Update Files to the folders x64_1703 and x84_1703. After
 that I copied the original Boot-Entries in the two BCDs (Bios and UEFI) and changed the paths to the new folders. So my Bootmenu had the 32 and 64Bit Anniversary Update Setups, and the Creators Update entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The boot itself did work flawlessly from the new entries, only when the setup started, I got this error about the missing media driver. Now I looked for some kind of configuration file that possible has the original filepath in it and which had to be adopted,
 but I didn't find any :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have an idea how to make the Win10 Setup work well when its not in the original&nbsp;(x64 and x86) folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I find a better solution, I always have to rename the folders to choose between Anniversary and Creators Update, which is of course not very elegant...</p>

            <p>Great, I did that today, got the right driver with my son's aide.&nbsp; Now I have a big problem, though the driver worked beautifully, I started getting rapidly blinking words on some sights, especially apps and the internet.&nbsp; screen gets black then turns on
 right away, so I just get out of whatever i am in and leave it. I can get into my cdrive and work with pictures and docs = i put them all on onedrive.&nbsp; Now what I'm thinking is that when I was trying to download the amd catalyst&nbsp; omega drivers for graphics
 awhile back, i see the folder for them in local disk c right above the Dell folder I put the Dell driver info in.&nbsp; What now. Is this the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to delete this folder, but it is not in programs and features. the only file i see in there is the one i can't remove (repair, change) without fixing the transforms problem.&nbsp; I also see e-saver 1.0 which I tried a download from the monitor home
 website.&nbsp; ANOTHER thing i should mention is that i was just downloading an update when this started the wierd blinking and shaking started occurring.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope someone can help me.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I am having a terrible time finding the right driver for my win 8.1 video card.&nbsp; I have the generic Microsft 2006 driver and it just doesn't work with my monitor or graphics.&nbsp; Is anyone else having trouble with just about everything in Win 8.1?&nbsp; I can't
 get out of this system to go back to win 7.&nbsp; I'm trapped with this program. Windows 10 is trying to download through updates and fail...?re&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 570 which came with Windows XP,&nbsp; about 5 years old, I upgraded to Windows 7 and was fine with it for years. Thought I'd upgrade to win 8.1, but since that it's been a nightmare. I have a 24" AOC monitor that is only working on this
 generic driver, so it is set up as a crt monitor. I have videos and games that are choppy and cause problems.&nbsp; I can only use two settings for the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded an amd catalyst omega driver from the website for my card but it did not work. I tried to delete the installer manager from programs and features, but get a transform error.&nbsp;question:&nbsp; Is this affecting anything? I downloaded a Dell 2009 r243671
 driver from dell, which should have been the one for my card. &nbsp;it worked great, screen size at native settings, able to run videos and games, as long as I stayed in windows file explorer and anywhere else in that menu.&nbsp; Found that when I go online or go to
 my charms, screen "whacked out"&nbsp; blue, black flashing, shaking,</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUESTION:&nbsp; After checking with Dell which claims they don't have a driver that is compatible with 8.1. (bull)&nbsp; or Microsoft which doesn't have capability for the drivers I listed.&nbsp; What do I do now. Get a new computer?&nbsp; I have not heard one good thing about
 8.1 and to feel trapped in it is disconcerting and irritating. I work on my computer all day out of necessity.&nbsp; Would any other brand work?&nbsp; Such as Nvidea, etc.</p>
