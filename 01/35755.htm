<h2>            Topic for users who call Skype to switch back to Skype translator with globe icon&#33;</h2>
                    Dear, guys<br />
I guess there are thousands of people who suffer from new cloud based translation implemented as of 22 Jan.<br />
I start this thread to make our voice loud and call Skype to revert to global translation option. Please support this thread to prevent Skype company making decision without listening to users which keep this app alive.&nbsp;

    <title>After most recent update, Surface pro 3 i5 8gb overheating without - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tones32  say:</h3>
<h2>            After most recent update, Surface pro 3 i5 8gb overheating without being able to locate the culprit.</h2>
                    <p>I read overheating has been a major issue for the SP3. Before the most recent update, I was able to turn on task manager to find the culprit using the CPU at high volume and causing the SP3 to get burning hot. I could manage and change settings to what was
 the source. This seemed to have dealt with my overheating problems by disabling one drive and a few other things.</p>
<p><br />
After the most recent update, the SP3 gets burning hot every time I use the computer at random times. As soon as I open task manager to try to find what is consuming the CPU, I will see a (e.g. 53%, 72%, 43%.....etc) CPU usage and then I would not see any programs
 indicating the use for the high percentage, then the percentage drops down to a value below 10% after I open task manager. The SP3 is still burning hot. There is a CPU ghost in here or something. Help!?!?</p>

            <p>The "Edge" web browser "may" be the cause.&nbsp; Microsoft has been making updates to it and you can look at it.&nbsp; I have the i3 model and notice that the fan kicks in each time the Edge browser is opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the program "Outlook" in the Office suite: if you use it instead of the web site (outlook.com), you may find the fan kick in and also a battery drain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are two areas you can look.</p>

            I only use Google Chrome web browser. I don't even use outlook at all. I either use windows mail or use chrome to access email websites. After my brother updated the newest update, all his apps couldn't even be used, even the calculator on the computer,
 he had to clean install again. I think I'm going to try that. Thanks for the suggestions!

            <p>Google Chrome is most likely your culprit.&nbsp; You didn't mention you had it but Chrome is a problem child even with laptops.&nbsp; Also, Chrome runs even when it is not loaded (it runs in the background).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Internet Explorer is on the computer but you have to manually go to the Program Files folder and you will see the folder for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome is an odd web browser that is a complete system to include work as a server for the "cloud print" system and it also has a runtime engine to run apps.&nbsp; I just recently worked on a Google Chromebook that got "hijacked" and hackers are now using the
 app running feature to feed hacks across with it.&nbsp; You may want to watch out with that as well in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the first time I have seen a Linux system get hacked and guess what the main application is on a Chromebook?&nbsp; Chrome web browser!</p>

    <title>Xbox One External Storage &#40;Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0&#41; wont - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One External Storage &#40;Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0&#41; wont allow games&#47;app saves and cannot be formatted </h2>
                    
<p>I bought a Seagate Expansion 2TB 3.5-Inch Desktop External Hard Drive USB 3.0 for my Xbox One. When I plug it into the Xbox One, it is detected but only for music and other media. I cannot use it for storing games/apps and there is no option to reformat
 the drive for games/apps. I have done a lot of searching on the internet but can't find anything to help. I can see the external drive when plugging it into a laptop - I used Disk Management to remove the NTFS partition and also to reformat the disk - still
 no luck. I now have an $80 external drive that is pretty worthless since I am at 96% capacity on my Xbox One and need to move games/apps over ASAP. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

 HDD in see if that helps.</p>

<p>You can use any of the three USB ports on the Xbox One (2 in rear, 1 in side). &nbsp;They are all USB 3.0 and there is no difference between them.</p>

<p>Yes all ports are USB 3.0. </p>
<p>I have two HDD's plugged into the rear ones and use them both for storage.</p>
<p>I recently bought a new HDD and it wasn't detected at first.</p>
<p>I found I had to fully shut the machine down then switch back on. Only when the console had finished booting up did I plug in the HDD.</p>
<p>I was not prompted though I had to go to the settings app then to storage management then select the new HDD and choose the format option.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Select A Driver To Install&#34; Windows 7 64bit</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently finished bulding my new computer and I brought a windows 7 oem "system builders pack". When installing it asks me to "select a driver to install" for my dvd drive. I figured that windows wanted the drivers for the IDE &amp; SATA ports on my motherboard.
 So I put the driver disk that came with my motherboard and located the IDE &amp; SATA Win 7 64bit drivers. The green bar down the bottom of the screen flicked through quickly then told me "no new devices found please ensure that the drivers are on the media device"
 or something along those lines. It would not let me continue the install. What do I do?</p>
<p>Motherboard: Asus m4n68t-m</p>
<p>DVD Drive: IDE</p>
<p>250gb HD: SATA</p>
<p>CPU: AMD Phenom X4 @ 3.4ghz</p>

<p>Hi iCow,</p>
<p>Have you tried going directly to ASUS's website to download the latest drivers/updates for your motherboard?&nbsp; Please see the link below:</p>

And the printer is configured on the same LAN (wireless or wired) as the computer you are trying to connect to it with?&nbsp; (192.168.xxx.xxx or 10.xxx.xxx.xxx most likely - if a home setup)?<br />

<p>What driver do you have installed on the computer in question?<br />
Is this even a networked printer - or does it connect through a computer/network printer device and get shared out that way?</p>
<p>&nbsp; If the latter - what do you have it connected to in order for it to be shared out?<br />

    <title>Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play blu-ray or dvd&#38;&#35;39&#59;s, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yeobaby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play blu-ray or dvd&#38;&#35;39&#59;s, error code 0x91d70005</h2>
                    
<p>I've talked to support a few times with no luck.&nbsp; This is a day one console bought from Walmart in Canada.&nbsp; For the first year I never had an issue when playing any dvd or blu-ray but come December issues started but wasn't getting this error code and usually
 after clearing out the cache the disc would work.&nbsp; Early in January my xbox received an update and since then I'm unable to play any dvd's or blu-rays but game discs work fine.&nbsp; Error code again is (0x91d70005) and states "Sorry, we cannot play this disc.
 The disc is made for region 1 and this console is designed for region 2".&nbsp; My major beef is that xbox won't cover this and wants me to pay 115$ to ship this when I can buy a blu-ray player for less than 100$&nbsp; Yes I understand my warranty is up but I didn't
 break it, you broke my console on an update!!&nbsp; Can't believe they won't budge on the price to fix it, not to mention how much money we day one users paid at launch!&nbsp; It's unacceptable that Microsoft can break our consoles on an update and expect us to pay
 for it to be fixed, somethings not right here...</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has windows 8 on it and it is a lenovo U410. I don't have any windows software to fix it and I am tired of improperly powering down my computer. Is there anyway to fix the restart problem?&nbsp;</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
As per the issues description, it seems like the computer freezes at the restart screen after you install an update.</div>
<div><br />
I would like to gather few information on this issue to help you better:</div>
<div><br />
1) Are you able to boot to the computer normally?<br />
2) Have you installed any security software on the computer?</div>
<div>3) Are you referring to the update from Windows update? If yes, was the update installed successfully?</div>
<div>4) What is the KB number of the update?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the computer freezes at restart, it could be drivers conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory issues can also cause startup problems.</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to refer to the link and check if it helps:<br />

            Linking to your Microsoft account is a way to preserve some of your settings as well as other information (see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/121975/htg-explains-microsoft-accounts-vs.-local-accounts-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/121975/htg-explains-m...</a>) and also provide you with 15GB of OneDrive storage for backup purposes. If you don't want to use a Microsoft account, you can read about changing to a local account here: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/230543/how-to-revert-your-windows-10-account-to-a-local-one-after-the-windows-store-hijacks-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/230543/how-to-revert-...</a>

            It may not be a secret, but it never asked permission before it happened. I don't like having my personal email linked to a computer that is shared and used for work with other people. The bottom line is this is a bad idea from microsoft and/or windows
 10.&nbsp; One or both of these two companies are involved in this mess.&nbsp; I need this to be a stand alone computer as I intended when I bought it&nbsp; for work purposes (not linked to microsoft, apps, favorites, email, candy crush, etc...)

            There are two levels of reset. One will keep your data one one will start as though the PC is new. In either case, however, you'll need to reinstall any software you had installed. It's a great idea because it ensures you can giov or sell your PC to someone else without also transferring your data to them.

            Is it installing a regular cumulative update or a feature update (cumulative update). 
<br />
<br />When installing a new version of Windows 10, you should remove the SD card to avoid it confusing setup.

    <title>Windows 8 keyboard locked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stationusernet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 keyboard locked</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a HP Pavilion laptop, It is currently running Windows 8. I have trouble with my keyboard, it does not seem to be working. Because the keyboard does not work I cannot log into the desktop. When I turn on my computer it would boot up perfectly but it
 stops at the Lock screen. I cannot advance past the lock screen because the keyboard and mouse are not functional. During the time on the lock screen, the airplane mode button works on site, and the brightness adjustments work. The icon for the network would
 switch to airplane and no network connection icon when I press the button on command. The Clock would also count the correct time, but would not unlock at all with any keyboard or mouse functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried is to boot into safe mode, but the keyboard and mouse don't function on safe mode either. On reboot at the system options screen when I press f11 the keyboard and both the mouse's work. I connected two USB mouse's to test the functionality.
 they both work on the start up options screen. They would stop working at the lock screen. I can also access the bios menu and the keyboard would work then too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any clues on what happened? I don't believe its the driver, because the secondary mouse works on boot selection. Even if it was the driver it shouldn't lock up in such a manner. I would prefer if I can resolve this simple issue without any reinstallation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operating system are fully functional until the lock screen. The clock would continue to function, with no keyboard support.</p>

<h2>            I am unable to print checks from QuickBooks 2009 but I can print anything else from QuickBooks</h2>
                    
<p>I have QuickBooks 2009 and have recently upgraded from Vista to Windows 7. Since this happened I had to deal with printer issues (including one printer just not working). I was able to get things set up so that one of my printers works with pretty much everything.
 Except in QuickBooks. I can print out an invoice, I can export a report to PDF, and a number of other items.</p>
<p>What I can't print is checks. When I try to print a check, nothing happens. When I try to set printer properties when the check window is open, nothing happens. When I try to set the printer properties for a check by selecting checks from a different pop-up,
 QuickBooks crashes. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hi Carrie Silver</p>
<p>Occasionally a file or files that support QuickBooks successful operation becomes damaged, or might have been damaged during the initial installation.</p>
<p>When this happens QuickBooks operation becomes unstable, requiring a repair to the QuickBooks program.</p>
<p>Run the Windows Repair utility. If you installed QuickBooks from a CD, make sure you have the installation CD available in case the repair utility prompts you to insert it. If you installed QuickBooks from a download, any files the repair utility needs are
 already on your hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Repair the QuickBooks installation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You must be logged in as a Windows Administrator to perform these steps.</p>

    <title>Why does my wireless adapter take so long to connect to network after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindasview  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my wireless adapter take so long to connect to network after rebooting&#47;restarting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>I've used everything in the forum to try to get a solution to this problem which just started happening over the past few months. Yes, I looked at all the answers and suggestions and did them all, but nothing works. Troubleshooters say all is fine. I have
 Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x64 on a Dell Inspiron Laptop N7010. My adapter is the DWLAN1501 half-mini wireless adapter. It used to always connect really fast until the past three/four months. I have the Comcast Caller ID on it and a thing called the DWLAN
 Utility,and MSE. Even with these starting up previously, I never had a problem until the past few months.</p>
<p>I don't know if the adapter is configured with the proper defaults following what the help file says for the utility as everytime I've tried to reconfigure it or reinstall the adapter, I end up crashing the network! It used to always connect, right from
 the get go even with these programs running. I have not changed my router and the problem had begun prior to my ISP giving me a newer modem-about 2 months ago. As I have said, everything that has previously been suggested&nbsp;about adapters taking a long time
 to connect to the network that has been listed in this forum, I have tried. I am curious if anyone else has this problem with this particular adapter, but more importantly, why did it happen just over the past few months? Nothing was changed and yes, I've
 done safe mode with network, IP Config, and even trying a static IP address with my DNS servers' addresses put in, but that didn't work either. I've accessed the Linksys utility, changed channels, but nothing works to speed it up. My CallerID for the PC from
 Comcast does immediately connect, but meanwhile, the adapter still has this circle spinning around it. We have a number of wireless devices, but none of them are new, ie, just during the past3/4 months. Most are manually set to turn on the wireless network
 on once they are turned on&nbsp;except for the printer and two tablets. Maybe there is no way to correct this after having tried everything that's all ready been suggested to other people on the forum with the same problem, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have
 WPA2 personal with AES. Thanks. Oh, it is also taking IE longer to connect to the Internet as well, once the adapter finally connects and yes, I have disabled add-ons to no avail.</p>

            <p>Hi Mann Manohar:</p>
<p>I did everything you said. I also ran the diagnostics. Also, I've got no virus's as I scan all the time-especially the network! So a virus is not the problem or malware. So, here's where I'm at:</p>
<p>Did as you said-disconnected/disabled, enabled/reconnected and rebooted and it was the same problem. My friend and I timed it and it took almost 4 minutes for the wireless adapter to connect, even though, my Comcast CallerID connected immediately. I know
 that despite it being connected to Comcast, it is picking up on my land phoneline, if you can understand what I am trying to say.<br />
 Atheros card)then "Broadcom Virtual Wireless Adapter"(not connected) and Microsoft Virtual Wifi miniport adapter-not connected. When I run the diagnostics on all networks, I got two logs-ADM0.etl, and ADM1.etl. The logs basically say the adapter has low health,
 and runs these tests between mounds of YYYYYY's and OOOOOO's. I have the logs saved, and because they are so long-even with the "Y's" and "O's" taken out, I don't think you would care to see them. In essence, it's a hardware issue and one that is above my
 baseline on knowledge of hardware or else I would have fixed it :). When I plug in my Atheros Ethernet Adapter, naturally, everything starts faster, but the den where the cable modem is and my router is not where I use my laptop. That's where my AIO desktop
 computer will be going, later this year, and probably will be the only device in the house connected, using the ethernet. For now, because of convenience,I run a total wireless network, with a silly name.
<br />
Dell does not have any updated drivers for this card which is a Broadcom/Dell config card. The only update I had was for the driver, dated 2009, in order to make it compatible with Windows 7, but there's a problem with that as I state further down. There is
 no updated driver for it since that one. Broadcom does not have the DWLAN1501 as it was special to Dell, from what I understand when I contacted them.<br />
As I said, I do have the logs from the latest diagnostics, but because of sensitivity issues, I can't post them here as I'd probably open myself up to attack-despite my security being fairly strong. Rule of thumb, "Do not tempt fate".<br />
What I don't know is if I should have the other two wireless devices enabled as I don't understand why the show up as "Wireless Local Area Connection(Network cable unplugged,Broadcom Virtual&nbsp;Wireless adapter)" and "Wireless &nbsp;Network Connection(not connected,Microsoft
 Virtual Wifi miniport adapter)"-which I have no clue as to that meaning. As I said above, it's got two different names and shows up in Device Manager when I view hidden devices. In the first log, it says something about IPSEC and something about a filtering
 policy blocking network connectivity for my program and repeats "Low Health", but says"WinInetHelperClass sucessfully received 200 from:www.microsoft.com". Then it goes on to diagnose- "S e t t i n g&nbsp;&nbsp; i n d e t e r m i n a t e&nbsp;&nbsp; t o&nbsp;&nbsp; a l l o w&nbsp;&nbsp; f o r&nbsp;&nbsp;
 F i l t e r i n g&nbsp;&nbsp; d i a g n o s i s ." That comes back with this:"W i n I n e t H e l p e r C l a s s&nbsp;&nbsp; L o w H e a l t h&nbsp;&nbsp; d i a g n o s i s&nbsp;&nbsp; s t a t u s&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; [ D S _ I N D E T E R M I N A T E ]&nbsp;&nbsp; H R E S U L T&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; [ 4 8 0 4&nbsp;&nbsp; m s ]&nbsp;&nbsp; d e s c r i p

I also have:"W i n I n e t H e l p e r C l a s s&nbsp;&nbsp; L o w H e a l t h&nbsp;&nbsp; h y p o t h e s i s&nbsp;&nbsp; T
 c p W i n d o w S c a l i n g ." In the second log, I get a message "I P&nbsp;&nbsp; a d d r e s s )&nbsp;&nbsp; i s&nbsp;&nbsp; l i n k&nbsp;&nbsp; l o c a l A d d r e s s A c q u i s i t i o n&nbsp;&nbsp; I P v 4&nbsp;&nbsp; i s&nbsp;&nbsp; O K ,&nbsp;&nbsp; I P v 6&nbsp;&nbsp; ( I P&nbsp;&nbsp; a d d r e s s )&nbsp;&nbsp; f i r s t&nbsp;&nbsp; u n i c a s t&nbsp;&nbsp; a d d r e s

There's also something about the network adapter
 having a problem, but it names my network, not the adapter. I also get "low health" and because I don't have NAP running, "T h i s&nbsp;&nbsp; m i g h t&nbsp;&nbsp; l i m i t&nbsp;&nbsp; a c c e s s&nbsp;&nbsp; o n&nbsp;&nbsp; n e t w o r k s&nbsp;&nbsp; t h a t&nbsp;&nbsp; u s e&nbsp;&nbsp; N A P&nbsp;&nbsp; t o&nbsp;&nbsp; v e r i f y&nbsp;&nbsp; t h a t&nbsp;&nbsp; c o m
 p u t e r s&nbsp;&nbsp; m e e t&nbsp;&nbsp; n e t w o r k&nbsp;&nbsp; r e q u i r e m e n t s ."&nbsp; There's more in this log, but basically, it comes out "success" through various channels such as DHCP, but still declares the adapter "in "low health". The adapter does have configuration
 settings in device manager and as I said, the utility help file gives the defaults, but whenever I try to do something to the adapter, it throws me off the network and I usually have to run a System Restore or I unplug the modem, wait, and plug it back in.
 However, because there are at least two people on the network at the same time, when I go to unplug the modem, I make someone terribly unhappy as the network goes briefly down! Also, the updated driver I am supposed to use, does not have the hardware qualification
 certificate even though that's supposed to be the driver for Windows 7 compatibility. Sorry, this is so long, but I did try to trim the logs down. Dell never could help me with it nor Broadcom, so I figured I'd try here. I just don't understand what happened.
 I'm quite sure the answer is somewhere in the logs, but as I said, it's above my knowledge base in working with wireless adapters, configuration, and installation of drivers. Also, it's strange that in the second log, it doesn't talk about the adapter, but
 instead, uses the network name. However, under "description" it does name the adapter and its "OEM" file.Thanks for any help you may be able to give. The second full log, I believe, has the answer somewhere in it, but I don't understand it enough. Yes, as
 a system admin for the household and about eight wireless devices, including my HP Printer, I've done fairly well for everyone else, just not me!<br />

</p><p>Needless to say, I have no clue how or why this shows up. On my map of network neighborhood it shows my computers and devices, a "switch" and the linksys router. I also don't understand how these devices are listed as running when all the adapters, except
 to Broadcom DWLAN1501 is the only adapter that I use. I also don't understand the Microsoft Wireless Router Module and all the stuff that is displayed under "Details". Thanks so much. It has to be a config problem as well as even though the ethernet adapter
 is Xed out, it's still using resources and I have no idea what that Microsoft Network Module thing is. Like I said, I installed the linksys router, but somehow it comes up as an MS Router?</p>

</p><p><span>Since we have already tried a number of troubleshooting methods and none of them made any difference to the way your wireless adaptor connects to the network. Disconnecting,
 reconnecting, resetting, repairing, uninstalling reinstalling wireless adaptor and driver produces the same results. However, other computers connected to the same network work fine. This indicates towards some corruptions within Windows.</span></p>
<p>

<p>I'll run the system file checker as I haven't done that in a while tonight. Also, when you mentioned that, I realized I hadn't run my Diskeeper Defrag tool in a year, so maybe that will help. I also don't know if I have the proper settings on my wireless
 adapter. As I told you, it comes with this utility and a help file about what the defaults should be and I may have played with that. I appreciate the help you gave and will report back. It was strange today, as I cleaned-up some useless junk on the computer
 and when I restarted, the connection happened right away. However, my printer all of a sudden disapppeared from the network and in the process of running the HP Printer diagnose tool, I had an update and then the darn software uninstalled and I had to reinstall
 it. When I rebooted again, it ran slow, once again. I disabled a number of start-up programs using the RevoPro uninstaller utility(Msconfig doesnt play nice when you disabe start-ups, as you know), but that didn't do it either-make it faster to connect. So,
 yes, I will do as you said as well as defrag and I'll get back to you. I'll also see if, in the long list of things for my adapter, I changed anything from the defaults. Awwwwgh! Thanks again for your time and I'll get back to you.</p>

            <p>Hi Mann Manohar:</p>
<p>Well, it's still slow, but I guess I just have to live with it. I installed a new Router as the other one didn't have the reach I needed. Anyhow, after doing every possible thing I could playing with the adapter, I've called it quits. Also, the updated driver-the
 original was for Vista then Dell/Broadcom rolled out an upgrade for Windows 7 in December, 2009, that does not pass the hardware compatibility test, even though the certificate says it is certified. So, the driver I need for it, does not allow me to install
 it.(Hair Pulling time).&nbsp;It's not worth the hassle and in the end, I'll probably just get a USB one and disable the internal network wireless adapter. Back to Linksys/Belkin I go. By the way, if anyone is interested, the new Linksys AC1900/EA6900 is phenomenal
 as far as carrying wireless signals across large amounts of square feet. It was fairly easy to set-up, but I have to redo it as I like giving my network a "quirky" name!</p>
<p>Anyhow, Mann, thanks so much for trying to help me with this issue, but I'm not going to spend anymore time on it!(don't want my hair to get thinner, either)!</p>
<p>Onwards and Upwards!</p>

            <p>Eddie:</p>
<p>Sorry I didn't see the post earlier. Have you run the Network adapter troubleshooter? You go to the start menu, open control panel and in the search box, type Troubleshooting". Then, when the window pops up click on "View All Trouble Shooters". There's one
 for your adapter. It has a log when you go into details-normally says it couldn't find a problem, but look at the diagnostic info. Through all the "Y's" and "0's" there is some stuff as I show above. When you go to check the log, by the way, IE will ask you
 if you want to download, open it, or save it. I open it using notepad-it's a blue link and ends in.".etl"-event log. As you can see from the partial log I posted, it talks about low health, but I have no idea how to get it out of it's poor health-so to speak.
 Have no clue as to how to tweak it. Your best bet is to contact Atheros and see if they have an updated driver. I do have one that Dell pushed out in 2009 to meet Windows 7 Hardware Compatibility with the driver for the wireless adapter, but Device Manager
 won't let me install it-saying the certificate isn't signed, but it is. So, I've just had to deal with it. Hope you got your problem solved as I didn't so I'm buying a USB wireless adapter to go with my new router and that, I know, will work!</p>

            <p>Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. I'm sorry you were not able to cure your version of the problem, but I'm sure your USB adaptor will be better. Personslly, I am suspicous that a recent Windows update has caused this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Troubleshooter and it dosn't report any specific problem. It just run through its checks and re-starts the adaptor. Meanwhile, the wireless eventually comes on anyway. I didn't actually look at the log, so I will try that.</p>

</p><p>Here's some further info for anyone who might be able to advise further: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My other laptop runs Windows 7 Home Basic. (So maybe not subject to the same updates as Home Premium.) This one doesn't have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried turning off the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Run Uniblue and corrected registry errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- run the check for a newer driver - reported that it had the latest</p>
<p>
</p><p>- checked the adaptor settings for IPv4 and IPv6 (as described in another string of this forum - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/computer-slow-connecting-to-wireless-network/e917136c-5093-412c-abbf-f28d080b0c7c)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- probably tried something else but I can't remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
