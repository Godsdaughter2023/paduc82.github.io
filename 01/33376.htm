<h2>            windows 10 action center and power will not stay open</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Version 1607 was running fine on my computer. After upgrading to Windows 10 Version 1703, the power button will not stay open to let me select restart, shut down, etc.. and the the Action Center will open and close or hide quickly.&nbsp; I don't even
 have time to read what is in the Action Center.&nbsp; Also, when running some apps the title bar will blink and if the app allows a search box, I can only type when I can sync&nbsp; with the blinking.&nbsp; What can I do to correct these problems.</p>

            This solution did not help. Now, after doing the repair, I still have the problem of the power button not staying open, with the apps, etc., but now Windows will freeze up at random and I have to hard boot the computer. &nbsp;This is getting very frustrating.

<p>I have the same problem (not helpful, I know). Maybe I can add a clue or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of 14 PC's of friends and family, this&nbsp; problem has shown up on ONLY the two Atom-based net. One is a Samsung and the other , a Gateway, both with @GB memory (max) and running 32-bit Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All others are regular desktops and laptops (Intel and AMD based) using both 32 and 64-bit Win 10. Even an old Pentium-D based system with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a gracefull shutdown on these netbooks, I have to do a CTRL-ALT-DEL and use the power icon in th lower right corner</p>

<p>
</p><p>it isn't a solution but a work around. If you need to see what messages are on the action centre - set the registry value to 1 and when you want to turn it off set it to zero</p>

<h2>            Why Does My Computer Switch Itself Off</h2>
                    Every time I want to use my computer (hp Envy 23 with Windows 10) I have to switch it on.&nbsp; It is not a matter of touching the keyboard or mouse!&nbsp; The settings are set to sleep after 45 minutes but it simply switches itself off.&nbsp; I don't lose anything but
 it takes ages to restart and this is most annoying when I need to resolve customer queries.&nbsp; I simply&nbsp;cannot keep them waiting on the telephone while I wait for the system to boot up and install my programs. Help please.

<p>Rockstar Games has issued a response in regards to fans expressing their frustration on the lack of new information for the upcoming multiplatform video game, GTA 5&nbsp;According to a report by Gameranx&nbsp;on March 24, the publisher apologized for frustrating their
 community. They also disclosed that they aren’t holding back new details for the latest installment of the “Grand Theft Auto” series just to torment the fans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are sorry if you find this frustrating, but please understand, we don't do this because we 'don't care about our fans', 'don't respect our fans', 'hate GTA fans etc' - precisely the opposite!"</p>

<p>GTA 5 was originally slated to come out sometime during this spring for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 current-generation consoles. However, Rockstar Games announced a delay to extend the development time for the sequel. They haven’t revealed any new details
 since the postponement news.</p>
<p>GTA 5 is now scheduled to launch in the North American region on Sept. 17.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What do you think? Are you frustrated they are holding back everything. Or are you fine with it?</strong></p>

<p>They would not make a lot of money if they released on next gen because not everyone is going to fork up a huge amount of money for a new console right away.</p>

<p>You're happy with current graphics? I'm not. &nbsp;I'm pretty sick of all the techniques they now have to use to even make a game look okay; glow around objects instead of anti-aliasing to prevent jaggies, crappy quality textures, low resolutions to improve frame
 rate... the list goes on... Far Cry 3 is a stunning game, but on console it looks like low quality PC.</p>

<p>I think R* does a good job with the current gen, but I will be buying a next gen console pretty much at release (most likely a PS4, unless the nextbox has GDDR5 RAM), the past year or so, I have really noticed the difference as publishers tend to use PC
 footage more and more for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>BTW OP, The Examiner is generally full of rubbish and not worth linking to, unless it is to laugh at misleading article titles.</p>

<p>@Hellfire, I'm guessing you are a PC gamer or a graphics nut. I'm the exact opposite. I'll sacrifice excellent graphics for more content and better MP/SP anytime. I'm a believer that gameplay is more important than graphics. Sorry.</p>

<p>Better Graphics = more immersion. You're not going to get anywhere by holding back graphics, all the does it make your game look less than the current market. You'd rather have an iPhone than a Blackberry, even though they both do the same, they only difference
 is that the iPhone has a bigger screen and is more shinny. </p>

<p>I'm neither really, although I would say I'm an advocate for absolute realism in games (of course we all love fictional games), but that's the standard I put for appearance, physics and gameplay. &nbsp;I suppose my point is when the 360 came out games were so
 fresh and profoundly better than before, now it's just tired, for my 'most anticipated game' I would want the best possible version and will gladly pay for it.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access file share on windows 7 PC from my windows 10 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a file share on my windows 7 PC and I'm trying to access them from my windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>I have locked down my file share on my windows 7 PC, and only my username (which is my windows 7 pc user name) can access them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the user name and password from my windows 7 account I try to access the files on my windows 10 machine using those credentials.</p>
<p>I can map the file share to "my computer" but when I click on it, it says that I do not have permission to access the folder.</p>
<p>I then removed my credentials from the file share and added "everyone" to the security permissions. Of course I can now access it from my windows 10 laptop, but I need the file share to be locked down and not accessible to everyone &nbsp;on the network.</p>
<p>How can I fix this? Thanks in advanced!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then I got your answer: DownLoad and RUN your Windows SCAN (+fix): I did run</p>
<p>--- NO Viruses were found.</p>
<p>Then, I tried again: still, each time I open a folder under Music - and Play it</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to delete a frame &#40;or multiple frames&#41; from a movie&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Working with frames in Movie Maker...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to delete a frame (or multiple frames) from a movie on my computer (ie: long stretches of silence, where I just want the frames with sound)? Every time I select a frame/frames and delete, the surrounding rest of the movie goes away, keeping
 the frames I want to delete. And I don't just want to take out part of the beginning or end. How can I accomplish deleting a&nbsp;single&nbsp;frame or eight or ten from the middle?</p>

                    I have managed to successfully upgrade to Windows 10 via the Software Creation Tool, and it works fine. &nbsp;However, I cannot connect to my wireless router. &nbsp;Any idea why? &nbsp;It says I'm connected to an unidentified network, whose location is public. &nbsp;I have
 a home network set through a Windstream Wireless-N router.

            <p>Same. I keep getting the "default gateway not available". You can troubleshoot the connection which brings it back for a while then it disconnects again half hour to an hour later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connected by Ethernet also. This is really irritating. How do you fix it?</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Games With Gold always download corrupt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> demonnus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Games With Gold always download corrupt</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Two of the last Games With Gold have failed to download / install on my Xbox 360. The games in question are Hitman Blood Money (October) and Assassin's Creed (November). Both these games appear to download / install fine on an Xbox One, but fail every
 time when attempting to download on my Xbox 360 S. As soon as they reach 80% download, a message appears saying they cannot be downloaded. Both games always show as a corrupt file on the hard drive.</div>
<div>​</div>
<div>​</div>
<div>What I've already tried:​</div>
<div>​</div>
<div>- Deleting any partial / corrupt / incomplete downloads and attempting to re-download again​</div>
<div>- Confirmed my region locale to be United Kingdom (this should never have changed as I've always been based in the UK)​</div>
<div>- Deleting and re-downloading my profile​</div>
<div>- Deleting the System Cache for all storage devices​</div>
<div>- Deleting the Marketplace file from System Storage​</div>
<div>- Formatting the internal hard drive and attempting to re-download again​</div>
<div>- Attempting to download to an external storage device instead of the internal hard disk.​</div>
<div>- Removing and reinstalling all system updates for the console (using the controller button combination while viewing Storage)​</div>
<div>- Using a wired ethernet connection instead of Wifi</div>
<div>- Downloading the same games direct from the marketplace (via PC) to queue them on my Xbox 360​</div>
<div>- Confirmed that downloading previous games from my download history work fine, along with downloading demos etc. Only the recent GWG appear to corrupt.</div>
<div>- Attempting to download on a different Xbox 360 console with my same profile - the same corrupt downloads occur. This leads me to believe it's nothing to do with the Xbox 360 console being at fault.​</div>
<div>​</div>
<div>​</div>
<div>After trying all of the above, I can only assume the issue must either by with my account / profile or there is something wrong with the games themselves when attempting to download on an Xbox 360. I've seen a lot of mention regarding downloads becoming
 corrupt at 80% if your account region is incorrect? My console has always been based in the United Kingdom and I've never had need to swap my region. Previous Games With Gold have always downloaded fine and I have an active Gold membership until January 2020.
 I've seen on Twitter for Xbox Support that there's been recent issues for digitally downloaded content on Xbox One - is there anything affecting Xbox 360 too? Does anyone else have the same issue?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>Many thanks for any help you can offer, I've literally tried everything I can think of to resolve this.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is just to double check, the country/region field in the second column on this page shows UK, Correct?<br />
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformation</a></p>
<p>And it also shows the same country (UK) for any payment options shown at <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>If it shows UK on that page, then your account is indeed a UK based account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've tried quite a bit already it looks like, as much as it might stink trying, have you tried doing a complete xbox format and just reset everything back to factory settings?&nbsp; It sounds like something is really going wrong in there but none of the common
 fixes are taking care of it.</p>

<div>Thanks for the replies and help with this. I've checked both links provided and for each I confirmed it states 'United Kingdom' for both.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've also tried a format of the internal Xbox 360 hard disk / resetting all settings to default but the same issue still occurs. I've also tried downloading the same games on a different Xbox 360 with the same profile, and still the downloads are corrupt.
 It feels as though the problem is something related to either my profile or the games themselves rather than a console issue, but I'd appreciate any other ideas I could try.</div>

<p>Hi Demonnus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out! I thoroughly read through&nbsp;and appreciate all your efforts in trying to resolve this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an issue with the profile then I would recommend trying to download another profile onto the console. Then using that new profile, try to install the Games and see if it completes the install. If that works then that means there is an issue with
 the account itself which our team would be happy to look into for you. Otherwise it might be an issue with the games itself. I understand you said that this issue occurred on another Xbox 360 as well so we do not really have to look into the console itself
 as of yet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes after using another account. Thank you :)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help. I tried what was recommended, by downloading another user's profile on my Xbox 360 and then downloading the GWG that had been giving issues - and it worked for that profile, leading me to believe that the problem still lies
 with my own profile in some fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I conducted an online chat with an Xbox support advisor, and they checked my profile to confirm that it was indeed set to 'United Kingdom' (it showed as 'GB'). We also went through some basic troubleshooting but a solution could not be found.
 It was left with me uploading some screenshots of the issue so the offline team could perform an investigation. It feels as though I've literally tried everything that could resolve this, I hope the team - or anyone here - can help further. For reference,
 here's what I'm seeing when attempting to download either 'Hitman: Blood Money' or 'Assassins's Creed':</p>

<div>
<p>I can now also confirm that the most recent GWG for Xbox 360 - Dante's Inferno - fails with the same corrupt download.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I've also found several other posts from the last few months on this forum that detail a similar or exact issue as to what I've been seeing. One poster was based in the US instead of UK and found he was also having issues downloading Assassin's Creed III.
 I knew that I'd successully downloaded that game previously from GWG a number of months back, so I attempted to download it again from my Download History. This time it failed, showing as corrupt like the others. For me personally, that totals four games I've
 found that always corrupt on download, all from Games With Gold:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Hitman: Blood Money<br />
Assassin's Creed<br />
Assassin's Creed III<br />
Dante's Inferno</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I'm becoming more convinced that the problem must lie either with the profiles of those of us that are affected or something Xbox / Microsoft end. For me, this issue stated with attempting to download Hitman: Blood Money on Xbox 360, on the 16th of October,
 2018. All downloads before then were fine. I hope the Xbox team can find a solution for this and it doesn't get ignored.

<p>I have a similar issue</p>
<p>my account is French, but I'm currently in the USA.</p>
<p>I have 5 games that when downloaded are corrupted</p>
<ul>
<li>Avatar LDM LRTF</li><li>Army of Two (EU) *</li><li>BlazBlue Calamity Trigger</li><li>Battlestation Pacific *</li><li>Lost Planet Colonies</li></ul>
<p>While the * games are GWG the other I bought</p>
<p>I have other games that are downloaded and works fine (Metro Last Light* ,Metro 2033*, Bastion, Shadowrun, Tomb Raider* ) some are GWG (with *) the other I bought,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the reset of the console, the reboot, downloading from the download history or from the store nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how to fix that annoying issue.</p>

<div>I've managed to find the solution to this annoying issue and I hope this post can help others in the community if they find themselves in a similar situation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I found it came down to was the public IP address I'd been issued by my ISP. I'm based in the United Kingdom, using Plusnet. The IP address I'd been issued was within the range of 146.x.x.x. Checking this IP address online showed it to be a UK address
 but it thought the ISP was based in the United States. Therefore, when attempting to download the problematic games, because they're region locked, it would see that my Xbox profile / account was all set to UK, but it deemed the IP address / ISP to be within
 the United States, hence, corrupting the download.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Googling this issue shows it to be quite common (geolocation data providers). For Plusnet at least, a solution was to turn off the router for 65 minutes and then turn it back on, and hopefully you should get a different IP address assigned (this time for
 me it was within the range of 88.x.x.x). After I'd done this, all games that previously corrupted on download worked fine. Granted, this may not be a permanent solution, if my router resets / is turned off / on again, there's a chance I may be given a 146.x.x.x
 address again. At least there's a work around for now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This solution may not work for everyone, i.e. those in different countries to myself or using different ISPs, but it may help a few others for this annoying issue.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Temp Profile fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before anything, I've tried Reprofiler with no **** help. All it does is make 6 more temporary profiles I'm forced to sign in to. I read about copying files and making a new account, would be great if I could even make a new one, even after scanning with
 sfc/scannow it shows dick wrong with it. I made an admin account, might as well be another temporary. I've tried recovery and restoration. BOTH DON'T WORK, I can't even make a restore point.
<br />
</p>
<p>All this started when I changed my **** font/app size and rest my computer, also during the first login in I had access to all my stuff as normal, but everything I ever signed into was asking my info again (Skype, Steam, Microsoft account with which I
 had never set up nor should I need too to get on my own damn computer) so tell me **** I'm suppose to do!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>please WINDOWS 10 HELP ONLY.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <span>I suggest you to check in Clean Boot state as below and check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a> (Applies to Windows 10 as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>” to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>I suggest you to install all the latest pending Windows updates as below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to “settings” and click on “update and security”.</li><li>Under tab “Windows update”, click on the icon “check for updates”.</li><li>Then once you find the pending updates install it and check.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

            In Windows 10 there is a "hidden administrator" profile. This profile apparently takes presidence over the owner. NONE of my settings keep, and Windows 10 ALWAYS goes back to it's default. This is highly annoying. Every time you re-start you must sign
 in and verify every site you've ever been to! HORRIBLE!&nbsp;In order to syc your settings, you must first sign into Microsoft. I did. I still could NOT sync because my administrative profile is a TEMP! WTH?

            <p>You are signed into a temporary profile because your user account has become corrupted, either from something you did to it or by an attacker. You will not be able to use the corrupted user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to copy the user folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos) to a new or another user account. You might be able to move other user data, like your email or bookmarks, but that depends on what application you use for these things. Each one works
 differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once all the data you need has been copied, you should delete the corrupted user account. You'll be prompted to save the user's personal data, and you can say yes, in which case a folder will be placed on your desktop. I advised you above to do this manually
 against the possibility that you are not offered the opportunity by Windows. I would run a thorough malware scan to be sure any possible infection doesn't do the same thing all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the corrupted user account is the only Administrator, you've got bigger problems. This is why Microsoft has for many years advocated to not use the computer's Administrator account for day to day computing.</p>

            I do NOT buy that answer. I have been prompted to upgrade to Windows 10 for over 6 weeks now. I finally gave in and downloaded it straight from Microsoft. If you read about Windows 10 it clearly states that there is a "hidden admin". Now, putting that
 aside, Windows 10 also prompts that you are signed into temporary profile. &nbsp;I have absolutely NO data in any folder. When Windows upgraded me from 7 to 10 it took all of my files and folders and photo's with it. The only way to access those things would be
 to over ride their ghost admin (I am assuming) or to get rid of the temporary admin account. I have read that a lot of people are having the same problem. Just wish there was an east solution. I haven't had Windows 10 for a whole week yet.

            <p>It doesn't matter what you 'buy' or what you assume. And I hate to tell you this, because you don't want to hear it, but if you know how to upgrade the right way, your personal files aren't touched, so it wasn't Windows that took all of your files and folders
 and photo's with it, if in fact they really are gone. And even if they really are gone, that wouldn't be a problem at all if you had them backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what you do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Find someone who knows the Windows operating system really, really, well <em>
and</em> who knows how to make a disk image with third party tools.</p>
<p>2- Make an image of your hard disk the way it is now.</p>
<p>3- Before going any further, find out whether all the hardware in your computer is compatible with Windows 10. That includes obscure things like your chipset drivers and storage controllers. If your hardware is not compatible with Windows 10 (or can't be
 made compatible with a driver) then stop there. You're done. No Windows 10 on that computer.</p>
<p>4- Assemble all the license keys for your paid software. You'll need them when re-installing your software.</p>
<p>5- Do a clean install of Windows 10. Let Windows Update run until it's done.</p>
<p>6- Reinstall your applications.</p>
<p>7- Mount the disk image and explore it. Look for your old files. Copy everything from the image that you want to keep and transfer it to your new installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>8- For heaven's sake, buy a book or take an online course on using Windows the right way. Forget everything you thought you knew and adopt the attitude that from now on you're going to do things the right way. Believe me, if I can do this - and I'm really
 stubborn - so can you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the day (because all this will take a day) you'll have a working copy of Windows 10 and a foundation of knowledge on how to use it. If you add to this the habit of making regular backups, you will never again have to suffer through crises with
 your computer.</p>

            <p>Thank You for your reply BulldogXX. Not everyone is a computer technician, and I do appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Here is what I did.</p>
<p>I restarted my computer, and immediately hit the F8 key.</p>
<p>Windows 10 started, and put all of my original files back in place.</p>
<p>This took me about 7 minutes tops.</p>
<p>and NO, I cannot explain it either.</p>
<p>(I have always backed up my computers/laptops twice per month.)</p>

            <p>I'm very glad that you retrieved your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to interest you in backing up every day. It's easy, it's quick and it can be automated so you don't have to think about it. It's the ultimate salvation for the great majority who are not computer technicians (and shouldn't need to be.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by backing up your personal data. You can do this on your own, but third-party backup software makes this easy. Don't use Windows built-in backup utilities. Third-party software is easier to use and understand and has extra features that come in handy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when you're ready to move up to the big leagues, learn about disk image backup - making an identical copy of your entire drive compressed into a single file. How would you like never needing to re-install Windows ever again? How would you like to recover
 from the worst software disasters in minutes, like nothing happened? That's what a disk image does for you. The pros have been doing that for years and we can too.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t seem to add contacts from mail to the People app.  And I can&#39;t &#34;see&#34; contacts in Mail that I have manually added to people.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 home.</p>
<p>Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.321).</p>
<p>All possible update applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I open a newly received email and decide I would like to add this person to my People app contact</p>
<p>In mail, I left click on the user name and then click on "Open contact" in the dialog that pops up.</p>
<p>I am taken into the People app and it shows all the information that I would expect to add to my contacts. (A GOOD thing.)</p>
<p>I then click on the little icon that looks like a diskette to save the contact information.</p>
<p>But instead of a save confirmation or nothing at all, I am taken to a People "Choose a contact screen".</p>
<p>This like the same screen I would use to start to manually add a contact with.</p>
<p>And of course the contact I tries to add doesn't seem to be anywhere "find-able".</p>
<p>Not in People and not in Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling People.</p>
<p>And reinstalling it from the MS store, but the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start my pc with an MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have a gmail account.</p>
<p>And Mail works perfectly well.</p>
<p>In that, I receive emails from my google account, I can respond to them and I can create and send new e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I "manually" add a contact to People, I can see it just fine from People.</p>
<p>But I can't seem to invoke it or call it up from Mail for some reason.</p>
<p>But I can send an e-mail to that contact, via the people app.</p>
<p>So that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just this adding contacts from the mail app to the People app and getting the Mail app to recognize conatacts that I have added manually, that is my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any replies.</p>

            <p>Okay then, I think I have figured it out.</p>
<p>It's not very intuitive.</p>
<p>But it make make "sense" to me sometime latter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event this is what wrked for me........</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To add a contact into People, from an e-mail in the Mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zero:</p>
<p>Open the Mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One:</p>
<p>Left click on the email address of someone that you want to add to People.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two:</p>
<p>Left click on "Open Contact" on the right side of the little dialog that pops up after executing step One:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three:</p>
<p>The People app should open and you will be looking at the contact information associated with the email address you just left clicked on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Four:</p>
<p>Left click on the little "save" icon at the top. (It looks like a little diskette.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Five:</p>
<p>A "Choose a contact" dialog will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what was throwing me for a loop ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Six:</p>
<p>At the bottom of the "Choose a contact" dialog, left click on the "+". (Plus sign.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seven:</p>
<p>A "NEW GMAIL CONTACT" dialog appears. &nbsp;&lt;== I have a GMail account so that's why is reads "GMAIL".</p>
<p>At this point you may choose to edit the contact information as you see fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eight:</p>
<p>When done editing, (or if you choose to simply accept the contact information as it is.), left click the little save icon (looks like a diskette) in the upper right of the "NEW GMAIL CONTACT" dialog.</p>
<p>Yes, it's a different save icon than referenced in step Four (above.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nine:</p>
<p>You are returned to the same screen you saw in step three (above.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done !</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you close the above screen, and reopen the People app, it will open with your contact (or contacts if you have more than one) listed.</p>
<p>Or you can start typing the name of the contact you are interested in finding in the "Search" box at the top left of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to the People app.</p>
<p>So maybe this technique of adding contact information from an e-mail will grow on me.</p>
<p>But now that I know about it, it sure does save time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above is of some little help to anyone else who was as confused as I was.</p>

<h2>            Fresco Logic xHC1 &#40;USB3&#41; Root Hub driver problem Code 31</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; have the Lenovo Ideapad S206 Windows 7 32 bit&nbsp;and have a driver problem which I believe is due to a Windows update at sometime. I get the following statement :-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;"The device is not working properly because Windows cannot load drivers for this device (Code 31)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone very kindly please advise me&nbsp;how to sort this out. Apparently uninstalling the driver and then reinstalling does not work.</p>

    <title>Duplicate devices shown on Media Streaming Options page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshington  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate devices shown on Media Streaming Options page</h2>
                    <p>For starters I'm no expert with networking tasks, but just some basic info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;On a wired home network</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows 8.1 on Dell XPS8700</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;been&nbsp;playing with the library streaming functionality on Windows 8.1 since I realised I could stream music from the PC to Xbox 360, and recently I noticed that after changing the 'show devices on:' option from Local network to All networks, there are
 four entries on the devices list which all have the name of my PC (not&nbsp;including the 'Media Devices on This Pc...' entry). For now they're all checked 'Allowed'. Clicking on each of the names reveals no available&nbsp;info other than a MAC address which varies
 slightly for each device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the 4 I know are 2 which each have the physical addresses of the Ethernet and Bluetooth adapters, so that seems to make sense. I don't recognize the other two, but I'm guessing they could be related to the wi-fi adapter built into the computer. I
 can't confirm this because I don't know how to check it's MAC address from the network connections page under control panel like I&nbsp;did for the Bluetooth and Ethernet. Just for reference, I've disabled the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi adapters&nbsp;on the network connections&nbsp;page
 because I have no use for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how these&nbsp;particular devices&nbsp;in the list&nbsp;work in relation to streaming media to devices I know of around the house, and weather leaving their 'Allowed' boxes checked is particularly a good idea.</p>

            Thanks for the feedback, Meg. In this case, what we can suggest is to perform a clean install of Windows 10. Just a heads up, performing a clean install will remove or delete all your personal files and installed programs and apps.

    <title>Skype account. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype account.</h2>
                    I lost access to my password to my skype account.&nbsp; the email I used to create it no longer exists because it was a university account and I'm no longer associated with the University. I created the account many years ago and my phone number is different
 now.&nbsp; I have gone to a page that asks me to answer a bunch of questions and I answer them but it says it doesn't have enough information to reinstate my account. I could create a new account but I would lose all my contacts, which is problematic because I
 do skype sessions with many people as part of my job.&nbsp; I've tried to find a way to talk with a real person about this issue but every "contact us" option seems to lead to a dead-end, so haven't been able to talk to anybody. What do I do?&nbsp;

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c6098969-43ca-40e2-8665-e6a98b961391" title="MarkLyon1">
<p>
</p><p>When you lose access to your Skype account, there are two options you can try and that will be
<strong>password reset </strong>and <strong>answering the verification form</strong>.&nbsp; Since you no longer have access on your email address password rest is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you've already gone through the verification process but failed, while we understand that it is important for you to recover your account to be able to continue communicating with your contacts, we encourage you to answer the form again
 to recover your account. This time, make sure to provide as much information as you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you do not have access to the old email address, that's fine as long as you still know it and it is the same email address you have on your account, please provide it. Here is the form again:
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account recovery form.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If in the event that you failed to verify your account again, we can only suggest to try answering it again. But if you failed for a couple of times already, may be it's time for you to consider creating a new account. As for the contacts, as long as you
 do not have access to your original account, it would not be possible for you to retrieve them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have questions and clarifications, please do not hesitate to reply.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information.&nbsp; My issue with the questions on the verification form is that one of them actually doesn't permit me to put the correct answer.&nbsp; It asks me the last four digits and the expiration date of the credit card I used to make my last
 purchase, but since I seldom purchase anything through skype (only for the rare occasion I had to make a long-distance call) that card expired in 2016. However, it doesn't even allow me to put 2016 as an option, and only accepts future dates.&nbsp; The only other
 question I might have gotten wrong is the zip code I've created the account.&nbsp; I could easily state the places where I've tended to use the account over the past three years (I've lived in Las Vegas, Palo Alto, California, and then in Hanoi, Vietnam) but I
 could have possibly physically created the account when I was visiting parents in Arizona or somewhere else.&nbsp; If they are so concerned about security, I could easily provide a passport photo or something of that nature.&nbsp; There are many ways I could verify
 that I am me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the third attempt, I think I finally succeeded in answering the questions to their satisfaction, but instead of reinstating my account I got an e-mail saying that I should contact IT management at my university since you don't handle institutional accounts.&nbsp;
 This answer doesn't make sense because my skype is not an institutional account, not set up by my university, but it is just one that I used my university address for because that was the primary address I was using at the time.

<p>Here is the e-mail I received with the service number.&nbsp; My main issue is that it tells me to constitute my "institutions IT department" when they have nothing at all do do with my skype account. I had just used a .edu address because that was the main e-mail
 address I was using at the time, but I set up the skype account myself, not through the university:&nbsp;

</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email reply from our accounts team asked you to contact your IT department to allow sensitive information from Skype like password codes be delivered on your email&nbsp;so that you will be able to reset your password. Also, if you'll use .EDU email address,
 regardless if you set up your Skype account for personal use, it will be considered as a business type account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you no longer have an access to the .EDU email address, please check the private message I sent you.</p>
