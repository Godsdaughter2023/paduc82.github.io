<h2>            Nuance Paperport Professional 14 suddenly stopped working.</h2>
                    I've had this program for a long time and depend on it. &nbsp;It was working properly on my Windows 10 system until it just stopped about3 days ago. &nbsp;Has there been a recent update that I need to address in order to restore Paperport's functionality? &nbsp;Removing
 and completely re-installing did nothing./

<p>The most anticipated DLC for a lot of gamers lately is the First DLC package of the game Brink. We know it was supposed to be releaced as of wendsday, August 3, but it is not on the marketplace. As of right now, the kids on the Playstation are playing the
 new maps, but we're not. So what's taking so long for our maps to come out? Is it because it's not a Call of Duty game? Did Activision pay you not to put it out? how about EA? But wait, they take care of their customers! so I'll wait another month, like I
 have been since it was announced, waiting for you all to get your act together.</p>

<p>Yeah I was wondering the &nbsp;same thing. I even woke up early this morning to start the download but like you said, It wasn't there. :/ Yeah I don't know why it's not up. All I know is that Playstation users got it early evening yesterday.

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

            Hi,
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

<h2>            Windows 10 with Intel HD Graphics 4000 - Only 1 Monitor Shows Windows</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual monitor setup on a machine that runs Windows 10 Pro with an Intel HD Graphics 4000 display adapter built-in to the mother board. Everything was running fine until today's update and then one of the monitors, the one on the HDMI cable stopped
 responding. Windows went to running in single monitor mode on only the monitor on my right, the one with the VGA cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded and installed Intel's latest driver for this adapter which was dated 12/2017 so it's quit recent. When this software was running it got to a place where the 1st monitor woke up again and all looked well. But the software said it needed to
 restart the computer so I did and the 1st monitor goes dead again. The first few seconds of Windows boot up it's working but then stops. If I run the driver install again the same thing happens but this time I told it not to restart. So for the moment, the
 dual monitors are running great. But each time I restart the first monitor goes south again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel driver is version 10.18.10.4885</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Version: 10.0.16288 Build 16299</p>

            If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, Windows Update KB4057291 has been released that will install a driver to restore multi-monitor display and resolution control capabilities.  Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install the update to resolve your issue.  You can also go to the Microsoft Update Catalog website to install the update.

<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

            Hi Bill.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works. 
<br />
<br />  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />You can roll back Fall Creators Update Version 1709 to the older version until it matures:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />

<p>I've tried everything listed in these two replies. Nothing works except reinstalling the new Intel driver but then when the computer is restarted it goes right back to single monitor again. I even went to the Asus website and tried their latest version of
 the video driver. All I end up with is the monitor on the VGA cable working. My dual monitor setup is useless this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again M$ for making life miserable for your users. I have assignments due tomorrow at the office and this is slowing me down big time. You guys sure know how to take the "Personal" out of a "Personal Computer".</p>

            If you want to address Microsoft you'll need to use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback; you can even click the Share button there to generate a link to your Feedback to post back here for others to vote up or add to it. <br /><br />But Microsoft will not see it here as this is a mostly volunteer-staffed forums where we try to solve your problems.<br /><br />I am also escalating this issue today. Until we get some traction on it the only known solution is a clean install which I linked for you earlier. You might also try running the latest version 1709 media over your install to do a repair install.

            Thanks. I did a clean install of the OS and it's working fine. But the problem is that as soon as this thing updates, and it's already trying to do so now, then back it will go to single monitor mode. So I have turned the sleep function off and will just
 leave the computer running until I can get time to do the resolution correctly or the driver gets fixed.

            Bill, I'd install the Hide Updates tool and search for Updates to see if it offers the driver so you can hide it:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Please also report  the Version and Date of the driver and Update KB number in the Feedback Hub app (reached by pressing the Windows key + F) then report it back here so we can monitor it as well.  This is how Windows developers want feedback, although something this critical should also be picked up in telemetry soon, one would hope.

<p>The date of the driver is 12/21/2015, it's number&nbsp;10.18.10.4358. But this same thing has happened when I used the driver I got directly from Intel and the Asus website for this model of the mother board. I don't know how to find the KB number. I posted in
 the feedback area like you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was running fine last night but sometime during the night it updated and rebooted so I'm stuck with single monitor mode again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick update, this time before I shutdown the computer I checked the properties of the display adapter in device manager and it finally offered the choice to roll back the driver. I did this and now I have a driver dated 7/10/2015, #10.18.10.4252. My dual
 monitor setup is back working again.</p>

            I'd either uninstall the Driver in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, or by running System Restore:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />As soon as it's gone then restart the PC and run the Hide Updates Tool to search for the Update again and this time Hide it.

<p>Okay here's the latest...the computer was running fine last night after I let it run several hours using dual monitor mode. This was after I had "Rolled Back the Driver" to the version installed on the clean re-install of Windows the day before. Next morning
 I find it sitting there in single user mode...again. So tonight I downloaded the drivers for the Intel HD Graphics 4000 from Ausus website. When I run it or the newer one available from Intel, the installer gets going and then poof, I have perfect dual monitor
 functions before it finishes. But sooner or later Windows shoves something into the chute that whacks everything up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's running fine right now so I'll leave it up again all night and see where it's at in the morning.</p>

            Again, you'll need to run the Hide Updates tool to intercept the driver or Update that Windows is pushing before it installs.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

<h2>            On start up in Windows 10 receive an ERROR&#58; This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithims</h2>
                    <p>The pop-up message in full is:</p>
<p>Unable to connect to the Internet</p>
<p>You must adjust your local security cryptography settings to allow this application to connect to the internet. Please follow the steps by clicking the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ERROR: This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Learn how to Turn Off FIPS Compliance Checking</p>
<p>
</p><p>So read the information on how to turn off FIPS or disable the FIPS Compliance Checking. I did that and still get the pop-up message. I'm not sure which program is causing the error and error message doesn't lead to the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to connect to the internet in every application I used so far on this new upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The only issue I have found so far is in Quicken, Quicken isn't able to connect to all my financial institutions. &nbsp;It only connects
 to 3 out of about 12 banks and financial companies. &nbsp;The error there is Quicken is unable to connect to the financial institutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having similar issues or had, if so, did you get a fix for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Found out the message was related to Driver Boost Pro software. &nbsp;It appears that Windows 10 is not giving it access to the internet to do it's driver check and update. &nbsp;I check Windows F&amp;Qs and they point you to a firewall issue. &nbsp;Well in my case I am using
 Norton 360 and it manages the firewall and not Windows. &nbsp;I couldn't any issue with Norton 360 as it works on my other laptop running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still not know how to fix this issue.</p>

<p>WIndows 10 does not run well with only 2GB of memory installed. If at all possible you should have at least 4GB or even better 8GB of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 can leverage memory more efficiently by actually using RAM compared to earlier versions which tended to use the disk over RAM.</p>

    <title>Unknown programs in MSCONFIG Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drewstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown programs in MSCONFIG Startup</h2>
                    <p>I was almost hit with a scam from India where the callers pretended to be from Dell or Microsoft and they somehow knew (which is disturbing!) that I had not installed a Dell update for the Bios that I had only received a few hours prior to that! I was figuring
 I could install it later so just hit the X to get rid of the reminder box that had popped up on the lower right of my screen.</p>
<p>They (as were two calls) tried to install possibly install something via "remote assist" (Citrix) and I shut the computer down. I then checked for any suspicious programs in "Programs &amp; Features" and uninstalled Citrix for sure. Then checking msconfig Startup
 I noticed two programs that are "unknown" yet when I Google them they are supposedly part of Intel graphics stuff...but then WHY ARE THEY "UNKNOWN" INSTEAD OF HAVING INTEL IN THE MANUFACTURER COLUMN??? Is this normal? Or is this how somehow these scammers
 knew what I had not done on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The names of the two "unknown" programs checked to start in Startup are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Startup Item&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Manufacturer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Command&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Location</p>
<p>~ Persistence&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"C:\Windows\system32\igfxtray.exe"&nbsp; &nbsp; HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Run</p>
<p>- IgfxTray&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unknown&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"C:\Windows\system32\igfxtray.exe"&nbsp; &nbsp; HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Run</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in the Startup I have two other programs that DO have Intel Corporation as the manufacturer (Delayed launcher, and Intel(R) USB 3.0 Monitor) and are in part of the Intel Command line, etc., etc.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit, and have all updates, etc. and Avira anti-virus running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with these "Unknowns" above appreciated...They make me very suspicious for obvious reasons!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Michael M.</p>

<p><span>-&gt; You can disable any program under the Startup tab in msconfig. Windows will start regardless. If something then no longer works the way it should then you can re-enable it. There is no risk.</span></p>

<p>The file igfxtray.exe puts an icon in the notification area (near the time display) that will allow you to access the Intel Graphics Control Panel.&nbsp; You don't need this because you can access the Intel Graphics Control Panel by right-clicking on an empty
 spot on your Desktop and selecting "Graphics Properties."&nbsp; However, if you are in doubt about any file you find on your computer, you can upload it to VirusTotal for a check using multiple antivirus programs:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virustotal.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why there are two instances of this entry showing in msconfig, but you can get rid of them by using Autoruns (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns</a>).&nbsp;
 When you run Autoruns, select the "Logon" tab.&nbsp; You can search for igfxtray.exe by using CTRL+F.&nbsp; Either uncheck the entry or entries (which will allow you to put things back simply by re-running Autoruns and re-checking the items) or delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer using Autoruns to msconfig because using the latter will nag you to return to normal startup unless you check the "Do not show me this message again" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also be able to disable igfxtray by starting the Intel Graphics Control Panel, selecting "Options and Support," and then selecting "Preferences."&nbsp; Then disable the Tray icon and click "Apply" --</p>

<p>Frederick and LemP... Thanks much for your replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off though I find it hard to believe there was any "coincidence" as they actually knew I had not installed that Bios update 2 hours after I had first seen it....AND I have not had a Dell pop-up box like that in maybe two years! Thus my concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LemP...Thanks for all the detail though I wish I knew more than I do as feel "unsure" about what to do about some of your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one, when I look for&nbsp;<span>C:\Windows\system32\igfxtray.exe in the C drive, etc. I can indeed&nbsp; find an entry/file for igfxtray alright, but it is clearly from Intel as has an
 intel icon. Clicking on properties/general does show that it is an .exe file though, so not sure where I stand with that v. the "Unknown" part mentioned in initial post. As there are those two other Intel startup items I mentioned which do have Intel Corporation
 in the "Manufacturer" column - so begs the question, why not for the "Persistence" or "igfxtray"?</span></p>
<p><span>Also, as that one looks like a genuine Intel file in my C drive\system 32 I doubt it will freak out in a Virustotal scan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did run Microsoft's Autoruns as you suggested and found "ixgcui" with again, no description or publisher! So would this imply it is an "impostor"?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ae76e97-326f-4a17-84c7-b2c1ae9be88a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ae76e97-326f-4a17-84c7-b2c1ae9be88a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>In the process I also found a couple of lines in "red" highlight (but no explanation as to what that means in the Microsoft instructions there):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35a610cc-8fb0-420b-9d7b-9bdff9ab7324?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35a610cc-8fb0-420b-9d7b-9bdff9ab7324?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If I right click on it and select Properties it says that it is a VBS script file and opens with Microsoft an is "gathernetworkinfo.vbs"...so I googled that to see what it was and ran up against my lack of wisdom in computers. First implication in the forum
 is it is a legit program or feature, then you get a comment like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abdbd8cb-0194-407e-bba0-e5f71f1c5baf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abdbd8cb-0194-407e-bba0-e5f71f1c5baf?upload=true" /></a><br />
So, of course, I get praralyzed, not knowing thruth from fiction?! Though this sounds more scary than my intial "call from India" trigger!!!</p>
<p>I wish that Microsoft could have at least added some instructions about these "red" and "green-yellow" color highlightings in the Autoruns instructions to help with this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, long enough post here and sorry if it just makes things more confusing - though of course like most of us I plain donlt want malicious stuff on my computer, which is the core of the whole issue here. Would appreciate any further clarifications.</p>
<p>

<p>Autoruns shows a lot of information, and as tempting as it may be, deleting items other than in the "Logon" tab can be potentially quite dangerous.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The colors in Autoruns:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Blue: shows the location where the following group of&nbsp;entries&nbsp;is found - usually a Registry key</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Pink/Red: no Description or Company Name in the file version resources or no version resource (always true for script files). If the Verify Signatures option is on,&nbsp;file is&nbsp;unsigned.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Yellow: file not found in the expected location</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Green: shows changed entries when using Compare from the File menu</div>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The "Verify Signatures option" is under Options &gt; Scan Options.&nbsp; If you select that, most of the lines highlighted in red will become "Verified" and the red will be removed.&nbsp; The ones that are left are either scripts (like your "gathernetworkinfo.vbs") or
 they have no digital signature or a signature that is invalid for one reason or another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, an item highlighted in yellow refers to a registry entry that points to a file that is no longer there.&nbsp; These are usually the sort of "orphaned" registry entries that registry cleaning programs will delete.&nbsp; My suggestion is to leave them alone
 unless they result in one of those pop-up warnings that complain that a file can't be started.&nbsp; This generally only happens with entries in the "Logon" tab.<br />
</p>
<p>The entry for igfxcui (which is also on my Win 7 Pro system) is related to your Intel graphics.&nbsp; On my system, this entry points to a file named igfxpph.dll although according to some Google results, on some systems it points to igfxdev.dll.&nbsp; In either case,
 the file is missing from the location where the registry entry is pointing.&nbsp; I don't know why or what exactly these files do, but my suggestion is to ignore this entry in Autoruns unless you are experiencing some difficulty in accessing your Intel Graphics
 control panel through the right-click context menu (i.e., when you right-click on a blank spot on your Desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GatherNetworkinfo.vbs script is part of Windows 7 and is, in and of itself, safe.&nbsp; The comments you quoted (similar to the post from the same person at
<a href="http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2015/12/you-can-trust-gathernetworkinfo-vbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2015/12/you-can-trust-gathernetworkinfo-vbs/</a> display, IMO, a fairly high level of paranoia.&nbsp; However, if it would make you feel more secure, go to C:\Windows\system32 and rename the file from GatherNetworkinfo.vbs to GatherNetworkinfo.xxx
 (but make a note somewhere about what you did so that you'll be able to rename it should you ever feel the need to run this script).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read more about the script here <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/does-anyone-know-what-gathernetworkinfovbs-is-its/63a302a6-cf69-4b9a-a3ef-4b2aff1b2514">

<p>LemP.... Finally! Looks like Microsoft fixed this site as I could not get back to thank you for all your very generous help above! The formatting of this site went all goofy and the reply button did not work for me at all....So a belated THANK YOU!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggested I did this:<br />
<br />
<em>The "Verify Signatures option" is under Options &gt; Scan Options.&nbsp; If you select that, most of the lines highlighted in red will become "Verified" and the red will be removed.&nbsp; The ones that are left are either scripts (like your "gathernetworkinfo.vbs")
 or they have no digital signature or a signature that is invalid for one reason or another.</em><br />
<br />
I was not sure if one had to click all the check boxes in the Scan Options but seemed like the right thing to do or no scan would happen, so did that. However, I was never sent to any kind of "agreements" page with
<em>virustotal.com</em> - which was part of that scan agreement supposedly???</p>
<p>So not sure if the scan actually happened as immediately after I clicked the OK/Start all my entries in Autoruns disappeared except for a few red ones at the bottom (HKEY's or something). I wondered if I had unwittingly eliminated everything and freaked
 out a bit - but after a lot of fiddling found out that I had to uncheck those boxes in the Scan Options, then everything re-appeared again. Whew! But still all the red entries were unchanged and as before with no verification signatures.</p>
<p>By this point I decided to quit and leave all alone as don't have the expertise to know what I am doing really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm posting the details here in case anyone else follows my tracks and gets confused.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end though, I am still no closer at this point to finding out what could be on my computer that enabled those scammers to know what I had
<em>not </em>done, so quickly after that Dell update. However, I will be ready next time if they try!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks so much for all the help.&nbsp; &nbsp;Best... Michael (Drewstone).<br />

                    &nbsp;it would be great convenience if we have to option to make windows 7 calculator buttons larger. I would personally prefer to have each button sized at 2cm by 2cm.

    <title>Intel rapid storage&#47; MSATA Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aro247  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel rapid storage&#47; MSATA Question</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Envy TouchSmart Ultrabook running windows 8.&nbsp;I have been having a problem with the intel rapid storage drive/ MSATA chip&nbsp;since&nbsp;I purchased this laptop and am quite confused about how to go about fixing it.&nbsp;A couple months after I first purchased&nbsp;this
 laptop it crashed with a blue screen saying critical process died and after it gathered information it shut down and came back on as boot device not found. I soon&nbsp;contacted HP and they&nbsp;sent me a usb windows 8 reinstall kit which I ran and did a&nbsp;clean reinstall
 of windows 8. After doing this and setting everything up on it I closed the laptop for the night and it went to sleep. Upon waking the laptop&nbsp;in the morning it said the same thing as before,&nbsp;critical process&nbsp;died and boot device not found. so I&nbsp;called&nbsp;HP and
 sent&nbsp;it off for a repair. I believe they put a new hard drive in it. Soon after getting it back again it crashed&nbsp;for the second time&nbsp;so I contacted&nbsp;HP and after complaining they told me I could take it apart and try to fix it my self. They said that the Caste
 drive/ MSATA&nbsp;chip needed to be taken&nbsp;out and&nbsp;to perform a fresh install of windows then to reinstall the caste drive/ MSATA chip&nbsp;and then to install the latest version of intel rapid storage driver&nbsp;which I believe was 12.5 after doing so it worked for like
 5 months I had no problems eventually I downloaded the new windows 8.1 and ran it for a couple of months with&nbsp;no problems.&nbsp;One day it froze on me and crashed upon booting I could not do a system recovery and decided to just do a clean boot of windows 8 and
 start over since&nbsp;I had already backed up my files prior to all this because my comp had&nbsp;failed before.&nbsp;After doing a clean reinstall of windows 8 I installed the 12.5 intel rapid storage driver and after putting my laptop to sleep it did the same critical
 process died as it had done in the past so I decided to take the caste drive/MSATA chip&nbsp;out of my computer reinstall windows, then&nbsp;reinstall the caste drive/MSATA and boot and install the intel rapid storage drive 12.5 well that didn't work&nbsp;after putting it
 to sleep it did the same critical process died. So then I reinstalled windows 8 AGAIN&nbsp;but this time I didn't install any&nbsp;intel rapid storage drivers but after putting the laptop to sleep it still crashed with critical process died and so at this point I took
 the caste drive/&nbsp;MSATA chip out of the laptop and did a clean install of windows but I never reinstalled the MSATA Chip I just completely removed it&nbsp;and after putting it to sleep NO PROBLEM it didn't crash.
</p>
<p>I guess my question is&nbsp;will my laptop be ok without the Caste drive/&nbsp;MSATA chip inside it? This&nbsp;seems to be the main reason for my computer crashing and taking it out makes the computer run without crashing after it sleeps.</p>
<p>Or maybe I needed to install a new driver for the intel rapid storage? </p>
<p>Since I am not installing a intel rapid storage driver will it just make my computer slower?
</p>
<p>Also I have never heard anyone call the MSATA chip a caste drive besides the HP people who helped me the first time so I am not sure if its the correct term I tried looking through forums but could not find a fix to this problem any help will be greatly
 appreciated. </p>

            <p>I am going to try to update the bios and see if it might help fix the problem. But I believe it is due to faulty hardware as I removed the SSD Card from the computer and it booted properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still not sure how different my laptop will be by not having an SSD Card in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been running fine for a few days without the ssd but what difference does it make having it or not?</p>

    <title>Forza Horizon freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onemanmilitia67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Horizon freezes</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so about a week ago I bought Forza Horizon and every time I played it, it's worked fine. Today when I turned on my xbox and started Horizon (the first attempt) , it didn't load properly, it skipped the Turn 10 and the Playground Games logos. This was
 when the xbox was cold and had been off for about 14 hours. Whenever I played it the days before, I only played for about two hours, so I don't think overheating is the problem. Whenever I start the game it starts up how all my other games start, but after
 a couple seconds it makes this noise like it's spinning the game faster than it should. &nbsp;After that it slows down to a little slower than it started, then it just stops. It gets to the terms and conditions screen and goes black. Every time I get a notification
 about one of my friends while the game's loading, the pop up just freezes. Now nothing happens unless I eject the disc, then my xbox returns to the dashboard. I've tried clearing my cache for my devices (2 8GB USB flash drives and 4GB internal memory) but
 nothing's changed. I've tested a few of my other games and they start and load without a hitch. Forza 4 loads just fine, so it's only Horizon that's not working. I've had these kind of problems before and I was able to fix it no sweat, but right now I'm stumped
 and don't know how to proceed. Help would be very much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>can you try the game with a different profile, to see if it is related to your profile (savegame).</p>
<p>Or try moving the save game to a different memory device and remove it before loading the game, so that the game will start with a new save game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Side note, clearing the cache is an option on every memory device, but it clears the cache for the console itself, so doing it once for a device will clear the cache for the complete console.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp;laptop with Windows 10 (online upgrade).&nbsp; Since 13 January 2015 Windows Update finds and installs "<em>Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package (KB3119142)</em>" at each search (automatic) for new updates. I have already
 in "Update history" 15 lines with "<em>Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package (KB3119142)/ Successfully installed on</em>" dated from&nbsp;1/13/2016 up to 1/15/2016.</p>
<p>How can&nbsp;I "teach" Windows Update that this update is already installed ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I had installed both C++2012 and C++2013. I uninstalled C++2012.&nbsp;I leave this question for others who meet the above described problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp;laptop with Windows 10 (online upgrade).&nbsp; Since 13 January 2015 Windows Update finds and installs "<em>Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package (KB3119142)</em>" at each search (automatic) for new updates. I have already
 in "Update history" 15 lines with "<em>Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package (KB3119142)/ Successfully installed on</em>" dated from&nbsp;1/13/2016 up to 1/15/2016.</p>
<p>How can&nbsp;I "teach" Windows Update that this update is already installed ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kindly ask other&nbsp;Window 10 users to check if KB3119142 is repeatedly installed and join me asking Microsoft experts to deliver a fix for that illogical&nbsp;action performed by Windows Update.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this post.</p>
<p>

<p>Im seeing the same issue on my desktop as well.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You have to go to this exact place and right click the 2012 -X86 -&gt; change -&gt; Repair. Do the same for the X64 and this should fix the issue</p>

</p><p>Point your mouse cursor at the start icon at lower left hand corner.&nbsp; Instead of left clicking on this icon, right click on it.&nbsp; The resulting pop-up menu will have the Control Panel listed in it.&nbsp; Or you can enter Control Panel in the search box next to
 the windows icon on lower left to find the control panel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            I have just done this as was suggested and I still have 11 showing in my update section. I did it to both (x64) and (x86) with not results. Now I assume the proper result would only show one update instead of 11. I have three other computers on Windows
 10 and they are okay. This happened on my Dell laptop.

            <p>The fix does NOT change your prior update history.&nbsp; What is being fixed is problem described by the start of this thread.&nbsp; That is , every execution of Windows Update&nbsp;finds and installs "<em>Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package
 (KB3119142)</em>" at each search (automatic) for new updates.&nbsp; In other words, KB3119142 is repeatedly installed&nbsp;by Windows Update.&nbsp;&nbsp; So once you apply this fix, execution of Windows Update no longer finds and reinstalls KB3119142.&nbsp; However, your windows update
 log will still have an entry for each of the prior attempts to install KB3119142.&nbsp; The exact number depends upon how many times KB3119142 was installed prior to performing the fix for this problem.&nbsp; Does this clarify what should occur?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in to MicrosoftAccount or create new profile</h2>
                    When clicking on settings/accounts/Sign-in options, the usual menu stopped displaying and just showed the circles going from left to right instead. I changed from my Microsoftaccount back to the local account to see if that made a difference and it didn't.
 I now can't sign in to the Microsoft account as it just stays on the 'Just a moment' screen. The same happens if I try to add a new user. Can anyone help?

</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>I can sign into my account on the web. Windows Store and outlook still work, I just can't seem to change away from a local account on my PC. I have other PCs which sign in to my Microsoft account without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 shows an error as the C:\Windows\Winstore path does not exist.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice but I had already tried that a month ago plus many other ways of switching accounts and creating new ones. The only way I could create a new account was using the netplwiz command but still the computer would freeze whenever I tried
 to switch to the new account (Or at least forever try to load it) and even safe mode wouldn't allow me to sign in with another account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried the factory reset option and still this would not load into a new account on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, I had cloned a windows 7 OS with a non-microsoft product and could then 'upgrade' to windows 10 from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

Hello. So my problem is very weird. When I watch a video or zoom a picture, I can see a very very transparent taskbar on bottom. I tought it was because of the main taskbar then I moved it to te top. The transparent one is still there. It's like a picture inlaid
 in the screen. I tried to take a picture with screen capture tool but it does not appear.</p>

            Hi Boss.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To reset this the easiest way is the change the Theme from Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes.  There are a bunch more free spectacular themes here to download and choose from in that location here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/windowsthemes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collectio...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you change the Theme it should reset the graphics somewhat.  If not enough to get rid of the apparition, then try these next steps:
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Easy way to check if it is burn-in is go to display setting and reset to portrait mode and if moves to the left or right it is a graphic issue if stays on the bottom it is a monitor issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing slow logon times on a Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium. There is a ~30 second black screen after the computer boots and before the log-in screen appears .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the&nbsp;Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) and ran a boot trace using the Windows Performance Recorder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Windows Performance Analyzer I can see that the&nbsp;<strong>sftlist.exe</strong>&nbsp;service takes around 25 seconds to initialize (<em>see screenshot below</em>). This is part of the
<strong>Microsoft Application Virtualization Client</strong>, the installed version is
<strong>4.6.3.24650.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The services to the right wait for sftlist to finish which might explain the black screen.</p>
<p>Any ideas why it takes so long to start and if there are any fixes? Thank you.</p>

    <title>Runtime Error when installing a software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mimerton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime Error when installing a software</h2>
                    After downloading software from a CD, I receive the message: "Runtime Error! This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way." This is software that I originally had in Windows 7 &amp; XP with no problem. I know that there is a
 hotfix for this error message when it appears in Windows XP, but I have not found a solution for Windows 10. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated since this is a&nbsp;new computer and the software is important for my research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Touchpad wont tap to select</h2>
                    I can use the touch pad on my laptop to move the curser and the buttons work to select. However I cannot use the touchpad to tap. I know it works because I can use this function when I log in but from them on it will not tap to select on any program.
