<h2>            Hacker&#47;Anonymous hacker</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Xbox Live Community,</p>
<p>I am posting this to see if anyone else has recently had their accounts hacked and information has been changed. My friends and I are at the mercy of a hacker who we suspect is<strong> [MOD REMOVED]</strong>. He has hacked into my friends gamer tags, sent
 out offensive messages and got their gamer tags banned. He also hacked their Live accounts so all of their Battlefield 3 unlocks have been erased. Please report this individual for system tampering if you come into contact with him. I also have an audio recording
 of this individual admitting to being a part of the Anonymous hacker group.</p>

<h2>            Blocking and Allowing a Certain Program to a User in Windows 10</h2>
                    On windows 7 I was able to give a user access to a certain program in which I allowed them to use from a list of installed applications in my computer. Now I am having trouble finding that option , I created a account to use the family feature and from
 there I was only able to block programs from a certain rating. Have they removed this feature in Windows 10 and if so for what purpose?

            <p>The Xerox website does not say that W10 is not support it says to use the Version 3 Driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you try this:</p>
<p>Disconnect printer from PC device &gt; uninstall all current driver relating to printer from PC&nbsp;&gt; restart PC &gt; download &amp; install the&nbsp;most recent drivers available for your printer (Ver.&nbsp;3) &gt; when you install, install in Compatibility mode with Admin Rights&nbsp;&gt;
 Turn 'Off'&nbsp;PC&nbsp;&gt; connect&nbsp;&amp; power on printer &gt;&nbsp;Start PC &gt;</p>
<p>Check &amp; test printer for operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works in most cases!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
According to the links you posted there are no Windows&nbsp;10 drivers for that <br />
printer.<br />
<br />
As OEM Xerox&nbsp;is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Xerox Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver. If there<br />
are no Windows 10 drivers try the latest Windows 8/8.1 or others.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand your inconvenience regarding this issue. As mentioned in the previous post you need to purchase the installation disc in order to perform In-place Upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the kb articles that are failed to get installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer the steps to install <strong>Windows update</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press (Windows + X) keys and select control panel.</li><li>Select Windows update.</li><li>Check the View update history.</li><li>Install the pending updates.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have asked a question, is there any way to delete the uninstalled updates from the update list?</p>
<p>The uninstalled updates are not installed hence there is no point in deleting the uninstalled updates from the update list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link below to remove an update.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To help enhance the security and performance of your computer, we do not recommend removing updates.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You would need to have an installation media to perform an In-Place upgrade. As you are using an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), you would need to check with HP and they would help you with the installation media.</span></p>

<p><span>Hello Hawk7236,<br />
<br />
You will want to ensure that the <b><span>Desktop Window Manager Session Manager</span></b> service (and)
<b><span>Themes</span></b> service are both started. If they were stopped or disabled via an application that limits startup items Aero will not be an option. Please try manually starting both of these services to
 see if you are then presented with the options to enable Aero from the Personalize menu.<br />
<br />
<b>Starting Windows Services</b></span> </p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Click

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.&nbsp; Sorry to hear you are having trouble with a Bluetooth keyboard and your Surface RT.&nbsp; I can certainly understand how frustrating this can be, lets see if we can get you going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to consider, not all devices will be <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Compatible</a>.&nbsp; If a Bluetooth device requires installation of a program to run, you could have a problem.&nbsp; Only apps available from the Store can be installed on Surface RT and Surface 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Surface fully up to date?&nbsp; There have been many patches to expand functionality and correct issues.&nbsp; Try manually installing updates, be sure to restart between layers of updates:</p>
<p>Desktop&gt; Swipe for Charms&gt; Settings&gt; control panel&gt; Windows update&gt; check for updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also some <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-bluetooth-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshooting</a> ideas posted on the Surface site, take a look.</p>

    <title>What happened to Microsoft support&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What happened to Microsoft support&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>One thing I liked about Microsoft is there customer support use to be pretty damn good. Even if your old console was out of warranty they would still help you out and fix it. But anyhow for the first time in a few years I had to contact them. As one of my
 old 360's died. Well it works just not the HDMI port. I know it was out of warranty by about 2 years. But I thought I would see if they might know away to get the HDMI back up and running.</p>


<p>So I went on to the support section for the number. I then noticed they had a Live chat option now (not the ambassador chat). So I tried that. After about 20 minutes of waiting I finally get someone. After confirming some details and explaining the problem.
 The guy told me to try a few things. I tried but still the HDMI port was not working. So he said it needed repairing he said it would cost £65. I said am not willing to pay that sort of money considering this is just a spare Xbox and I can just use a component
 cable. He then said after looking on my account I have 9 Xbox 360 consoles registered to my account. This is true due to 7 breaking on me over the last 6 years. He then said he would book a free repair for me. How nice of him. A few minutes later he asked
 if it was ok for me to call me.</p>


<p>So he called me. He confirmed my details and now here is where things started to get weird but I did not notice at the time. He said to close all web browsers on my PC and if possible restart my PC. Just so the Live Chat page could refresh. So I did so and
 he said ok good it has refreshed then he said so where booking your console in for a free repair correct. I said yes then it appears he put the phone down on me :|.</p>


<p>At this point I was a little confused but I though I will just try again tomorrow. So tomorrow came (today) and I tried the live chat again. I told this new agent what went on yesterday. He then said he is looking at the chat log and noting like that was
 said no mention of a free repair. He went as far as said on this chat log the customer agent clearly said it will cost you to repair the console and he mentioned noting about a free repair. I then told him they even called me up. He said no such phone call
 took place :| so yer I was confused and angry at the same time as they where making out that I was a liar. So I just ended the live chat.</p>


<p>Am not bothered about not getting the console not getting fixed for free. It is 2 years out of warranty and it still works via component cable. What has annoyed me is the guy offered me a free repair. If he would of just said it cost £65 to repair like her
 did and when I said no he should of just said ok not a problem goodby and I would of been on my way. But no he offered me a free repair called me on my phone put the phone down. Now I don't know if the same agent is denying everything or the guy I talked today
 was just being a idiot. But it seems Microsoft support has went down hill.</p>


<p>P.S sorry if this is just a wall of text to you.</p>

<p>I remember the days when I'd ring Microsoft support and get through to someone, and having complained about something breaking I was offered free games, free pads, free cables (HDMI&amp;VGA), free HDD, headsets, the lot! &nbsp;Those days are long gone. &nbsp;It's a shame.
 &nbsp;I loved all those freebies, now I don't get offered anything. &nbsp;It's enough to have me consider jumping ship, I tell you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>I wonder if Microsoft will once again start the wonderful customer support they used to have when the "ONE" is released.</p>

<p>Depends if the One is plagued with problems early on like the 360. Am not bothered about not getting the free repair. I just don't like getting lied to. Also I don't like getting called a liar.</p>

<p>So speaking with my IT support hat on, if they've got logs of your conversations, then surely the burden of proof is upon you to prove they are incomplete?</p>
<p>Back in my old 1st line support days we'd get users and customers trying to pull fast ones
<strong>all the time</strong>. Got people trying to pretend to be other people to get access to personal information. Others would simply refuse to talk to me and insist on trying to get directly to the manager when our manager at the time had just started
 his job having previously gone through the management course at McDonalds and his IT experience was fixing his mums computer. He didn't last long!</p>
<p>It's not that second support person is accusing you of lying, but it's simply a case that they are protecting their livlihood. Don't take it personally. If anything, blame first Support person for not keeping logs in the system.</p>

<p>It is a shame you didnt take the option to email yourself a copy of the chat log so you could use it to show that you were offered the free repair.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Other then that, its not so hard for the chat log not to be recorded for whatever reason the chat got interrupted. But considering its out of warranty its not hard to see why others are not accepting that you were offered a free repair as there is no logical
 reason why you would have been offered one</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and Dell E6420 Cellular problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Dell E6420 Cellular problem</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hey</p>
<p>I got Dell E6420 and Windows10 in it. Everything is good but I got problems with celluar internet that I didn't have in Windows7.</p>
<p>It happens rarely. I got disconnected with celluar network with no reason. Then I have to connect again. Sometimes it's harder. It says that I disconnected OR sometimes It looks like I am still connected OR I'm connected but I got limited access and I don't
 have internet. In all these 3 issues I don't have internet. When I want to open a webpage it says that I don't have internet. Then I can disconnect. BUT!! I can't connect then. It says that I need to enter APN or sth like. It was never needed and I've never
 entered any and I still got internet. BUT. Even when I enter or I got entered APN it still says that I don't have APN and i need to enter it. DAMN IT! Then I go to 'change adapter settings' and then I disable this device. And in a few seconds I enable it again.
 And then I can freely connect to cellular and surf the net.</p>
<p>BUT!!!!!!! Sometimes happends something like that that I can't fix it and then my computer got freeze. When one of these 3 issues happens I try to disable this device. OK. I disabled. But! I can't enable it. I rightclick and then 'enable'. I got notif. that
 I enabled it. But it's still disabled. I can't do anything to enable it again. So what can I do? I turn off my laptop. Well, actually, I try to turn my laptop off but it doesn't work. When I click to turn off. I see shutting down screen and then my screen
 goes blank. But my laptop is still on. And no matter if I wait an hour, a day or a millenium my laptop won't shut down. So please. I think this may be because of driver not applicable to windows10 or problem with windows 10. No matter. I think you can fix
 it up.</p>
<p>My device info. DellE6420. Windows10 Enterprise 64bit. newest windows10 version xxx.104 and I got newest driver of my cellular it's:&nbsp;1.3.0.11</p>

<h2>            Connection issues between Xbox One S Controller and Windows 10 via Bluetooth&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using my Xbox One S Controller with my Windows 10 PC for about a month using bluetooth and it worked pretty good up till recently. When I turn on the controller's discovery mode, my PC doesn't detect it. My android phone is able to detect it and
 my PC is able to detect my phone though for whatever reason, Windows 10 refuses to detect the controller.</p>
<p>The controller still works via USB though I'd like to know if its possible to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Idk if this is related or not but when the controller was being detected, I had to unpair and reconnect my controller to my PC repeatedly as when I set it to charge via USB and unplugged it from my PC it refused to reconnect automatically.</p>

<p>What i do to get my controller reconnected is by turning the controller on and press the sync button few seconds,</p>
<p>then i click on the "notifications" icon button on my pc's task bar at the bottom left corner and click the bluetooth button</p>
<p>to turn the bluetooth off and then back on,&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;The option I checked was remember headphones, since then there is no drop down menu that always appeared when any device was plugged into this combo mic/hesdphone/headset/etc... jack. Now I need other options for this combo jack but can't find it anywhere
 on laptop so I can configue it. No device shows in device manager in any audio. Where can I find how to configue 3.5mm combo jack? My current audio default device is tv through HDMI port, but I have changed that to laptop speakers &amp; back, no effect on 3.5mm
 jack.<br />

&nbsp;Please explain what you mean by "it goes to files".&nbsp; I've been using WLM for 3 years and have never seen or heard of such a thing.&nbsp; Do you mean the new messages go to separate folders?&nbsp; Do you have some message rules?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to moving your emails back to your Hotmail Inbox. There are two ways on how to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Drag and Drop</strong> -&nbsp;kindly&nbsp;click on a message and with the left mouse key still held down, drag the email to your Inbox folder and then release it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Selecting/checking the messages by clicking on the box</strong> -&nbsp;select/check the message and click the<strong> Move</strong>
<strong>to</strong> link and specify the folder to which the email message needs to be moved to, in this case
<strong>Inbox</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>No notification popping up when Windows 10 has downloaded and is ready - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No notification popping up when Windows 10 has downloaded and is ready to install new updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Microsoft Windows 10 home. For the last several weeks when my computer automatically downloads Windows Updates, it automatically restarts without giving a notification.
</p>
<p>My Windows Update settings are&nbsp; as follows:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Active Hours</span>: 0800 AM to 0100 AM.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Restart Options</span>: The option to "Schedule a Restart Time" is grayed out; I can't edit this option and pick a time at all. The option to "Show more Notifications" is enabled, but I don't receive any notifications
 regarding Windows or Windows Updates- my computer simply restarts randomly, regardless of what I'm doing.
</p>
<p>I'm a student and the system restart has interrupted my work on a number of school projects. Is there anything I can do to fix this (like enable the&nbsp;"Schedule a Restart Time"?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>Turn this switch ON.</p>
<p>This will reduce the amount of updates you are receiving from Windows.</p>

<p>I have done the above, but it has not helped. I've also checked to make sure that the "quiet hours" setting isn't activated when I'm working on something. But my computer continues to randomly reboot without any notification given.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can check to see if it's another program, and not windows update, that's causing my computer to reboot?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi MKU2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device randomly restarting after the recent update can be related to a possible startup or BIOS error. As an initial step to isolate your concern, we suggest that you disable the fast startup feature which collects images for faster boot up. To do this,
 follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel </strong>in the search bar and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>On the upper right pane, select <strong>Small </strong><strong>icons </strong>
from the <strong>View </strong><strong>by</strong><strong>:</strong> drop-down list.</li><li>Click on <strong>Power </strong><strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, select <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Turn on fast startup (recommended)</strong> box to remove the check mark.</li><li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done, restart your device and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

    <title>Windows Server 2003 and MSXML 6.0 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Server 2003 and MSXML 6.0</h2>
                    <p>I have a need to install MSOffice 2010 on a Server which is running Windows Server 2003 SP2, unfortunately I am encountering the error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setup is unable to proceed due to the following errors:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation of MSOFfice 2010 requires that MSXML&nbsp; version 6.10.1129.0 be installed on your computer.&nbsp; Install this component and re-run setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty straight forward error message, I therefore sourced Microsoft Core XML Services (MSXML) 6.0 Service Pack 1 and went to install this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have encountered a problem when trying to install MSXML6.0, which is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This installation package is not supported by this processor type, contact your product vendor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing that I am attempting to use an incorrect version of the MSI package but I cannot seem to find anything other than:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>msxml6_ia64.msi</span></p>
<p><span><span>msxml6_x64.msi</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>msxml6_x86.msi</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Which all seem to not what I'm looking for, I have attempted to google MSXML 32 bit but without much luck.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>I wondered if such as thing exists or if anyone has any advice that might assist me please?</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Many thanks for looking.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Kind regards.</span></span></span></p>
