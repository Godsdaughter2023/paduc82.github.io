<p>Knight, understood that you know what you did wrong. I have nothing further to say except, post this same thread in the Clan Discussion section of the forums. You should be able to find it fairly easy. Good luck!</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently had this problem with the Search/Cotana box. The search box worked well previously however, after updating the Window Defender and install Korean language pack (I still chose the English as the default display language), I can'y type anything
 even when I click on the box, nothing happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has the same problem? What should I do next? Use the window restore?</p>

            <p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Cortana is not working, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press Windows key + R, type <em><strong>regedit </strong></em>and click OK.</p>
<p>b) Go to the location: <strong><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER&gt;Software&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;CurrentVersion&gt;Explorer&gt;Advanced</span></strong></p>
<p>c) <span>Create a new DWORD(32-bit) value, type: EnableXamlStartMenu"</span></p>
<p><span>d) </span><span>Open task Manager and close Microsoft EDGE from there ( if open )</span></p>
<p><span>e) </span><span>Restart the system </span></p>
<p><span>f) </span><span>Search on Cortana to test if it is working fine.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi MelvaMoore</p>
<p>
</p><p>it wasn't easy. I tried a number of different things and eventually got it sorted. I think running sfc \scannow probably sorted it. Incidentally I had another problem which was tricky to track down so in the I reset the laptop keeping my files folders and
 reinstalling various app. It too a while but my laptop is now running better than before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi MelvaMoore,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After multi tries, I finally fixed that by reseting the system. Sfc scan or something else from MS techs did not help at all. All they tried to do is scanning the system for nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could reset the system following these steps:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Reset</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;this
 PC &gt; Get started and look for Restore factory settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">That works for me though took plenty of time</span></p>

<p>Cannot believe that the only chance to solve this macroscopic bug is to reset the system or create a new user profile (both solutions are deeply annoying).</p>
<p>No other ways to get it?</p>
<p>OMG!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A dirty trick to workaround this handicap is to copy and paste text in Cortana.</p>

            worked for me, however, I wish there was a simpler solution for those less technically inclined. hunting for the folder, etc is easy for me, but no one in my household would be able to do this. perhaps add photos or create a faster copy paste so someone
 does not have to dive in so deep

<h2>            Can I delete KB uninstall keys from registry&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>I am running some utilities for cleaning my PC. I Used CCleaner and it deleted windows xp update files (those files stored at C:\WINDOWS\$NtUninstallKB######$\). However, if I run Wise Registry Cleaner, I will find that registry keys are still kept, I mean,
 for example, for KB971468:</p>
<p><br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP4\KB971468]<br />
"Description"="Actualización de seguridad para Windows XP (KB971468)"<br />
"InstalledDate"="2/13/2010"<br />
"InstalledBy"="SYSTEM"<br />
"UninstallCommand"="C:\\WINDOWS\\$NtUninstallKB971468$\\spuninst\\spuninst.exe "<br />
"Type"="Update"</p>
<p>As you can understand, UninstallCommand will point to an invalid file (the folder "C:\WINDOWS\$NtUninstallKB971468$ was deleted by CCleaner).</p>
<p>If I run Wise Registry Cleaner, I could delete UninstallCommand key, but all the other info (InstalledBy, Type, Date, Descriptio, filelist), will be kept, and seems senseless keeping uncomplete information.</p>
<p>So my question is: After I am sure I can delete update files, what is better?</p>
<p>-Delete only UninstallCommand key (as suggested by Wise Registry Cleaner)</p>
<p>-Delete the full tree entry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP4\KB######)</p>
<p>-Doing nothing, although invalid information is kept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 8 update reverting changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> partha_940  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 update reverting changes</h2>
                    I have read a lot of threads on this issue and since I'm not so computer savvy, I still can't get the hang of it. I have a new asus windows 8 64-bit laptop (x202e) and every time windows update installs automatically, it says failure ..reverting....you
 know the drill. Every time after it settles down and restarts, I run the windows update troubleshooter from the microsoft support page. But the problem reappears the next time automatic updates run. I am at my wit's end and don't know how to solve the problem.
 I contacted asus and they told me to contact microsft and refresh my PC. I refreshed my PC but the problem has again reappeared. Can I fix it on my own or do I need to bring in a techie? Please help. Urgent. I run windows defender. There is no third party
 antivirus. There is no third party firewall. <br />

            Thanks for your response. Unfortunately I have tried the troubleshooting tool and it doesn't help as the problem seems to reappear. I have also tried system restore once. I called up asus and they say it's a microsoft problem. I think some of the updates
 may be interfering with some driver. I don't know. Please tell what to do. Should I install updates one by one? How do I do that? Are there any other options I can try on my own? I hope there is a solution otherwise I shall be forced to turn off windows update.
 My anti-virus is defender and that is updating fine. Firewall is microsoft firewall. I have no third party antivirus. Thanks again and waiting for your response.<br />

            I'm with you. I have an Asus laptop that out of the box hung on its updates. The only thing I could do is a system restore. A system restore for a machine with less than five hours of runtime! I hope they answer your question soon.

            Hi Mr Srimadha. I have tried both these methods and it has not succeeded. With a clean boot, windows configured to 98% before reverting. Should I now try the DISM tool? Please guide me on how to use it. Also, i noticed that windows modules installer is
 'stopped' in services. is that important? Eager waiting for your advice.<br />

            Hi Mr Srimadha. The problem wasn't going away even after system file checker, so I got asus to install windows 8 all over again. Now it's working fine and the first lot of updates didn't throw up any problems. I have 2 questions:
<br />
<br />
1. If i set windows updates settings to "check for updates but let me know whether to download and install them", can I still update windows defender manually? I don't use third party antivirus.<br />
<br />
2. If I update windows defender manually regularly (say once a day), do I actually need to install the other 'automatic' updates?<br />
<br />
I have had so much problem with this, I thought I would just update windows defender and nothing else for a while. Dont want to see the blue screen "configuring windows update" for a while at least, hence the questions. Thank you and eagerly waiting for your
 reply.<br />

<h2>            blue screen error 0000034 boot config data missing</h2>
                    <p>Laptop bought with windows 8 installed - opted for the free upgrade to windows 10 on this laptop. Have no idea what triggered this situation as I had made no major changes. Can I get the digital licence from Microsoft onto via my account using another computer
 (like the one I am using now!). I think the licence (in lieu of a product key) is needed for me to save the necessary tool onto a usb stick in order to get my computer activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently I would have had to done some kind of system back-up but that is not so evident if you are unfamiliar with such things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am still not clear the steps needed. I know if I press F12 when powering up I am out of the blue screen but still need the repair tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please oh please someone help me through this!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>My question is how I can the digital license for the windows that had been installed on my Toshiba laptop before the bug crashed it (if bug and crash are the correct terminology) using someone else's computer and thereby download the necessary tool to start

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, apart from the blue screen and the screen that appears if I press F12 at startup, I am blocked.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to barge in. We noticed that the thread became inactive for a couple of days now. We just wanted to check if you would still need further assistance in this regards.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please help us understand <em><strong>which specific tool is this</strong></em> that you're referring to. Were you able to access the
<strong>Advanced Startup options</strong> (Startup Repair screen)? You can repair the boot from there by using the
<strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong>. Here is how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>From the Startup Repair screen, click on <strong>Advanced</strong>
<strong>Options</strong>. Under the </span></span><span><span><strong>Choose an option</strong></span></span><span><span>screen, select
</span></span><span><span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong></span></span><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span><strong>Advanced options</strong></span></span><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><strong>Command</strong> <strong>Promp</strong><span><span><strong>t</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><br />
<br />
Please enter the following command:</p>
<p><br />
bootrec /fixMBR<br />
bootrec /fixBoot<br />
bootrec /rebuildBCD<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us about any result. </p>

<p>Why would it become inactive 4 days after I posted? And two days after I replied to an only reply to my query. Of course I would still would like answers.&nbsp;I don't know that I am able to access any start up options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only going by what I was able to find through my google searches. I think I am referring to the media creation tool or media installation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10<br />
</p>
<p>Obviously though I would have to do this using someone else's computer.</p>

</p><p>"<span>To get started, you will first need to have a licence to install Windows 10. "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how I can get the the digital licence (that apparently replaces the product key). Surely if I bought my Toshiba laptop with windows installed and upgraded to Windows 10, I have a legitimate &nbsp;claim to a digital licence?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Start your System, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT ====================================================================</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Command Prompt and run the commands Marc Cai suggested above, run the commands one at a time, hit enter and wait before running the next command</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">bootrec /fixMBR</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After running these commands, reboot and see if your system boots into Windows . . .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>END EDIT =================================================================</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if you have a recent restore point you can revert to<br />
<br />
If you do not have a recent restore point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click restart.<br />
Upon restart press 4 to boot into Safe Mode, if you can get into Safe Mode, backup your data, reboot and see if your system boots normally<br />
<br />
If all this fails go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep all your files and Apps<br />
This will re-install Windows 10 whilst keeping your data and applications<br />

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade font problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade font problems</h2>
                    <p>My upgrade to windows 10 was painless... Until I tried to search for something in Microsoft edge, one of the system fonts seems to have been replaced by a symbol font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can copy and paste the text to read it, but it's affecting other programs. Anyone have any ideas how to fix this?</p>

            <p>YES! Only a short set of Type 1 fonts is (was) showing in my fonts folder. The system is calling from this set for the UI and it's AWFUL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose a font (just one) that I had backed up, reinstalled it (yes to the overwrite prompt), and instantly many more fonts showed up in the system fonts folder (not all) including some OpenType, TT, etc. - hopefully this does the trick on a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND NO - restart, reverts the fonts showing up in the folder back to the short set of Type 1s and the UI is still horrible - seems like the font registry is corrupt and cascading a bug throughout the OS!</p>

            <p>I ended up having to roll back to 8.1 because the font issue cascaded into Adobe Illustrator crashing on start up because of font registry issues. I did notice that with the update install there's two fonts directories the one where they system is looking
 as well as some other software c:/windows/fonts and one in and "old windows" directory. This has to be fixed before I can use 10.</p>

            Even after reverting to Windows 8.1 - after a shut down and reboot, font problems return. Something with the update to 10 totally screwed the fonts registry entry, and it seems to be cascading in the system.<br />

            <p>OK - problem actually solved now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was not a Windows 10 issue at all, but I'd recently installed fonts for a project from a Mac colleague. A couple of .ttc files (TrueType Collection). Those fonts seemed to mess with the fonts registry on a reboot - and were not showing in the font list
 (along with a ton of other fonts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled them (choosing yes to overwrite), which put them in the list. I then deleted them from there. Rebooted, all fonts came back, all software working normally again. And Windows 10 installation went fine - stable after rebooting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We think we've figured out what's going on causing your issue.&nbsp;There are a lot of threads dealing with variations of the same issue, so instead of explaining here, here's a link to a thread with the details:</p>

<h2>            Denon Envaya - playing from my mobile but not my PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to install my new Denon Envaya Blue tooth speaker on my ASUS laptop (which runs windows 8) for three hours but with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new Denon Envaya bluetooth speaker. It plays from my phone with no problems but it cannot play back from my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It pairs with my computer fine but then will not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver on device manager has the little yellow exclamation mark next to it, this will not update and says their is an error.&nbsp;I have reinstalled the speaker. I have updated all the drivers but the speaker is still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In playback devices, the bluetooth speaker doesn't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how it feels when things do not work as expected. Don’t worry; I will assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might occur due to driver incompatibility or corruptions. Sometimes, the device might be too busy or have too many connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to follow before connecting a Bluetooth device.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the device and your computer are the correct distance apart. The device information should include the correct distance.</li><li>The device might be too busy or have too many connections. Wait until the device is less busy, and then try again. Or, to reduce the number of connections, set the other devices so that they are not discoverable. If you're not sure how to turn off discoverability,
 check the information that came with the device or go to the manufacturer's website.</li><li>Make sure that your computer is trying to connect to the correct device.</li><li>Have you exchanged passkeys with the device? Some devices require a passkey before they can be listed in Bluetooth Devices in Control Panel.</li><li>Make sure Windows is configured to accept incoming Bluetooth connections. To do so, if you have Bluetooth wireless technology installed on your computer, you can check Control Panel for Bluetooth enabled devices. Here's how:</li><li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then click
<strong>Bluetooth Devices</strong>. Click the <strong>Options</strong> tab, select the
<strong>Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>If the device is close to other devices that use radio frequencies (such as microwave ovens, cordless phones, remote controls for electronics or lighting, or 802.11 wireless networks), those devices might be creating interference. Try moving the device
 that isn't working farther away from the other devices.</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to refer the link below on how to add the Bluetooth device on Windows 8/8.1.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + letter ‘R.’</li><li>Type the command <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and hit OK.</li><li>Right click and delete the Bluetooth driver with the yellow exclamation mark.</li><li>Restart the computer.</li><li>Try to pair the device and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the above information is helpful to you. Please reply to us with the status so that we can help you further.</p>

    <title>Multiple Problems with Windows 8.1 lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Problems with Windows 8.1 lock screen</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'm having several problems with lock screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp; Going to the lock screen will sometimes freeze my computer.&nbsp; Specicially, I see the photographic lock screen and swipe it to call up the box to enter my password.&nbsp; Sometimes (but not always) my computer will lock up at this point.&nbsp; The photo will disappear
 and a black screen will remain.&nbsp; The password box never appears. &nbsp;I have to pull the battery to force a reboot. &nbsp;(Actually, it may not be freezing in the conventional sense of the processor/hard drive locking up -- but it's the equivalent because the computer
 is useless and will accept no commands -- nothing works, not escape or control-alt-delete.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.)&nbsp; Sometimes (but not awlays) Windows will&nbsp;revert to&nbsp;the default photo for the lock screen, rather than the one I selected.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this happens, I also notice that the color theme will revert to default (dark blue), rather than my personalized theme (green).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This typically happens only when I first boot the computer.&nbsp; After I've successfully logged in once, Windows goes back to my theme (green) and my personalized lock screen photo.&nbsp; (Obviously this problem isn't as significant as the first, with the computer
 freezing up, but it's annoying...&nbsp; and possibly related.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.)&nbsp; When I am able to enter my password and successfully unlock my computer, it now takes a full 30 seconds to pull up my desktop.&nbsp; 30 seconds may sound insignificant, but it used to take literally 1 second.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly something has changed, in that the
 process is 30 times slower, and that change occured over night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few other notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop and copy of Windows 8.1 are only five months old.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not experienced&nbsp;any&nbsp;of these probems until I installed the large Windows update that was available this weekend.&nbsp; I realize a simple solution may be to use system restore to undo the changes implemented by that update, but I'm sure that update was
 important.&nbsp; I don't want to have to choose.&nbsp; I should be able to install that update and having a properly working OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my Windows Updater has recently started freezing as well.&nbsp; I ran the native diagnositic, which seems to have fixed that problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably not related at all, but I'm mention it for comprehensiveness.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is the computer working correctly after you have logged in successfully?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried changing the lock screen image?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: </span><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">Control panel</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. (You can type troubleshooting in the Control Panel search bar as well)</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click <strong>View all</strong> on the left pane of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the list of options, click on <strong>System maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2.</strong></span></p>
<p>One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the drive. Follow steps from this article.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive<br />
</a></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong></span>Upgrade the graphics drivers to the latest versions by using the driver update utility provided by your laptop manufacturer or download and install manually form manufacturer website.<br />
<strong>Download and install drivers<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a></p>

            <p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp; I will try some of these suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I've succesfully logged on, if I allow my computer to go to sleep, the problem arises:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp; I press power to awaken my computer.</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp; It takes me to the lock screen with the photographic background.</p>
<p>3.)&nbsp; I swipe (or click) the screen.</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp; Then it goes to the solid color screen that *should* have my account photo and a box to enter my password.&nbsp; However, neither my photo nor the password box is present.&nbsp; It's just a solid color screen (it's green, which is the theme I chose).</p>
<p>5.)&nbsp; Seeing as I can't enter a password, the computer is, in essence, frozen on the solid color screen.&nbsp; I have to pull the battery to force a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I can get to the lock screen, but there is no way to enter a password...&nbsp; so I am stuck.&nbsp; You can't move forward without entering a password.&nbsp; The screen will be permantely green and the comptuer is useless.&nbsp; There is literally nothing I
 can do.&nbsp; I have to pull the power source.&nbsp; (It may not be frozen in the conventional sense of the processor or harddrive been locked up, but it's in effect the same thing.)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>
</p><p><span>I tried each of your suggestions. &nbsp;Here are the results:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: &nbsp;I went to the trouble shooting menu. &nbsp;That fixed the problem with Windows updater. &nbsp;However, nothing else in that menu addresses the other problems I'm experiencing. &nbsp;I see options for trouble shooting audio
 recording and network connectivity, running programs from previous versions of Window, and cleaning up unused files. &nbsp;None of those options would address a bug in Windows that causes the password box on the lock screen to disappear (or cause the lock screen
 photo to&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;revert to the default).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: &nbsp;I skipped the optimizing part because, again, my problem isn't one of performance -- it's that my lock screen is not giving me an option to enter a password. &nbsp; However, the link you provided also had instructions
 for running an error check on the hard drive. &nbsp;I tried that and it found no errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; I checked my graphics driver and found it’s already up to date (though I&nbsp;</span><span>wasn't</span><span>&nbsp;sure what that had&nbsp;to do with Windows not giving me an option to enter my password after if goes into
 sleep mode).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>The article on Windows 8 haning/freezing</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; I followed the directions (I went to: PC Settings &gt; Update and Recovery &gt; Recovery &gt;Advanced Startup &gt; Restart Now).&nbsp; According to that article, after my computer reboots I’m
 supposed to be presented with a “Choose an Option” screen (where I’d pick “automatic repair”).&nbsp; However, I’ve tried that three times and I’m never presented with the “choose and option” screen.&nbsp; It simple reboots and brings me to my desktop. &nbsp;So I'm unable
 to try automatic repair.</span></p>

            <p>
</p><p>Now that I've been experiencing the problem for a few more days I can be a bit more specific:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first boot the computer, I typically do not experience any problem. &nbsp;I'm taken to the lock screen, I swipe it, then it presents a field for me to enter my password. &nbsp;Good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the computer has been running, if I let it go into sleep mode, the problem will arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) &nbsp;I press power to awaken it.</p>
<p>2.) &nbsp;The lock screen with my wallpaper appears.</p>
<p>3.) &nbsp;I swipe it.</p>
<p>4.) &nbsp;I *should* be taken to a screen with my profile picture and a box to enter my password, but that doesn't happen. &nbsp;The screen is solid green (my theme), but there is no profile pic or field to enter my password.</p>
<p>5.) &nbsp;Being unable to enter my password, I can't proceed. &nbsp;(So it's not necessarily frozen in the conventional sense of the processor/hard drive being locked up -- but it's in essence the same because you can literally do nothing with your computer at that
 point.)</p>
<p>6.) &nbsp;If I press the power button I can put it back to sleep. &nbsp;But if I try to awaken it, the same problem occurs -- there is no means for me to enter my password. &nbsp;Thus, I have to pull the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, there is a bug in the Windows that causes the password field on the lock screen to disappear when it emerges from sleep mode. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you have a second monitor you could try attaching?&nbsp; This symptom could have an explanation which would involve a video system which thought it had an extended display configuration.&nbsp; nVidia apparently have done that in some cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, a workaround
 would be to press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter&nbsp; as if you could see what was on the other monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW before I became aware of this workaround other users were getting quite creative in figuring out what all they could do by pretending they could see the elements
 of their Lock Screen.&nbsp; For example, if you didn't want to risk figuring out whether you were safely in your password field so you could start typing there (but possibly lock yourself out of your account if you made too many mistakes), you could try this loop:&nbsp;
 Shift-Tab, Shift-Space, Wait to see (or hear) any possible consequences of the last "command" and then repeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. potentially that could put you into the Lock Screen's Shut down menu, go up into the Restart item and "click" it while pressing Shift- -- result,
 (hopefully) the Advanced Options page, hopefully with better visibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

</p><p>I do not have a second screen, however I tried this anyway. &nbsp;When I was on the blank lock screen I pressed Win-P. &nbsp;It called up the options to project to another screen. &nbsp;I could clearly see them on the right side of my screen and could scroll through them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This validates my assumption: my computer isn't actually frozen when the lock screen appears (the processor and the hard drive are functioning normally). &nbsp;But for some inexplicable reason, the lock screen doesn't have the field for me to enter my password.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, it's just a missing field, not a frozen PC. &nbsp;But that field is super important and I literally can't use my computer without it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, this missing password box happens when I try waking my PC from sleep mode (not when I initially boot). &nbsp;I have to pull the battery and force a reboot.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned in an early post that I'm sometimes presented with the wrong lock screen photo (the Windows default, rather than my personalize selection) and the wrong theme color when I initially boot. &nbsp;In and of itself, I am not concerned with this problem
 (it's annoying, but doesn't prevent me from using the computer). &nbsp;The only reason I mention it is because this error also involves the lock screen, and it began occurring at the same exact time as the disappearing password box -- so I'm wondering if they are
 related... &nbsp;perhaps they are symptoms of the same problem???</p>

</p><p>My lock screen is blank.&nbsp; I tried pressing tab, but nothing happened.&nbsp; If I press WIN-p it does call up the options for connecting to a remote screen, and I can cycle through them, but I can't get anything else to appear.</p>

<p>Oh.&nbsp; I thought it was just missing the password field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the Event log for clues?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. looking specifically for signs of a problem with the video system.&nbsp; Then this might be another reason to have another (different, perhaps older) monitor to have attached.&nbsp; E.g. I was not expecting you to see
 the&nbsp; Project&nbsp; dialog;&nbsp; I was imagining that it would be appearing on the phantom monitor but that since it has such a simple UI that you would be able to use it for a refresh.&nbsp; Wait a sec.&nbsp; You said you could see and use it?&nbsp; So, why not try to make it do
 a refresh?&nbsp; E.g. switch from Extend to Duplicate so you don't lose anything but do cause a refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, try booting in Low Res Video mode?&nbsp; It's surprising what you can do then.&nbsp; About the only thing you can't do is open MUF apps.&nbsp; But more significantly, if you can use it to get past your problem symptom you can then use Win-P again, and (surprisingly
 IMO) switch your video back to normal that way.&nbsp; Depending on your video support you might have even more painless workarounds available.&nbsp; For example, with AMD's CCC you can create hot keys which allow new display configurations to be switched to more quickly
 than using the standard GUI for Screen Resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get into the OS I imagine there are some other troubleshooters you should be trying but I don't know what they are off hand.&nbsp; I think they might have to be downloaded though.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Thanks for your detailed reply.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be perfectly clear: When I say my lock screen is blank, I mean it is a solid green with nothing else on it.&nbsp; (Green is my theme, so that it correct.)&nbsp; There are 2 other things I should be seeing: my profile picture and a password field.&nbsp; However,
 I see neither of those.&nbsp; (I haven't emphasized the missing profile picture because that isn't what's stopping me from moving forward.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I pulled up the options to project my screen, I did try clicking on each one.&nbsp; (Even though I didn't have another monitor, I wanted to see what would happen.)&nbsp; I'd wait a minute, then&nbsp;switch it back to the&nbsp;laptop screen hoping that&nbsp;might&nbsp;somehow restore
 the&nbsp;password field.&nbsp; It didn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried checking the event log, but I can do that.&nbsp; I assume I can find that with a simple search?&nbsp; Once I'm in the log, what exactly should I be looking for?&nbsp; (I'm not very knowledgable about computers, so please be patient with me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not familiar with low res video mode.&nbsp; How do I access that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I don't know much about computers, but the fact that I can call up the screen projection options, and the fact that I can see the lock screen photo (not my profile picture, but the wallpaper-esque screen I see and swipe prior to the lock screen),
 suggests to me it's not a problem with video resolution.&nbsp; If it was, the lock screen photo and projection options would distorted, if not missing altogether.&nbsp; I was thinking it may be a problem with the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem first&nbsp;appeared immediately&nbsp;after the large Windows update a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; I'm considering doing a system restore to a date prior to the update to see if that fixes it, then trying to reinstall that update and hope it doesn't corrupt my OS
 again.</p>

<p>The xbox status message says you can't 'download' content you have purchased. It does not say you can't 'Play' content you have purchased though 'downloads' and already have on your local machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought this issue was only affecting games with 'Online' content like Black Ops and Elder Scrolls but none of my 'non disk' content will work even if it is a completely stand alone local game that happened to be purchased as a 'download'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The status doe snot reflect that level of an outage or even acknowledge it exist and there is no mechanism to provide feedback other than this forum to 'report' this as a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not saying we are 'owed compensation' for an outage but I think they do 'owe' us some tools that would at least give us the ability to 'report a problem' that is clearly not covered in their status outages listings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear they don't even provide a forum page to report outage information. This forum is not even for this purpose. Accessibility is meant to be a place to discuss things like improving UIs for players with disabilities not for user to report issues
 with connectivity to Xbox Live.</p>

<h2>            Why Forza Horizon 4 doesn&#39;t work...</h2>
                    I asked the same question yesterday, but soon after five seconds after the game, the game goes off without any warning or error. I tried to solve the problem by going into the link that was answered yesterday, but it was not resolved. I am embarrassed
 because it works out well until a few days ago but it does not suddenly work out.And Horizon 3 goes without a problem.

<h2>            Streets and trips 2013</h2>
                    Hello, I am also having a a problem with an error message that states " a licensing error has occured. Please contact customer service for more assistance. Error 0xC004D301". I know streets and trips is no longer being made, and I've seen that you can
 call Microsoft and get &nbsp;reset tool to fix this error...is this true? Is the reset to still available for this software? I rely on streets and trips for my job, so I &nbsp;would hate to see this be the end!! I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, cleaned my registry
 files, and have no viruses or malware. It just would not open one day and keeps sending the error code. Any advice tips or answers would be great...

<p><span>Hi gdsnz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Code 43 implies that Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the problem, let's first open the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Hardware
 and Devices troubleshooter</span></a> to run the automated troubleshooting services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the troubleshooter does not fix the issue, let’s u</span><span>se Device Manager to
 disable and re-enable <strong>all</strong> the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
 type <strong>device manager</strong> in the<strong> </strong>Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Expand<strong>
 Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.<br />
<strong><br />
Note</strong> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the first USB controller under&nbsp; <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 the above step for each USB controller that is listed under&nbsp; <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the USB device to see whether it is working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, make sure you update the chipset drivers on your computer. Download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers and check
 if that fixes the issue.</span></p>

    <title>Media remote not connecting with TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> admofthefleet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media remote not connecting with TV</h2>
                    
<p>I'm just trying to connect my TV (be able to control volume, mute and power) with my media remote. I have an IR extender plugged in. I have it detect the TV, which it does with the remote code T1480. It is an Insignia 40 inch with a model number that is
 not listed on the manual set up list.</p>
<p>In addition I've tried multiple times to remove and re-add the TV with the auto setup. I'm guessing it's just detecting the wrong TV/code. I would love to try and enter a remote code manually, but have no idea what it could be.</p>

            Hi Lori.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>i can access command prompt sscreen- but- trying to &nbsp;get to safemode from command promt get me an access denied</p>
<p>
</p><p>bios does not show a fast boot anywhere??</p>
<p>
</p><p>i know there is a fix for this-- because TONS of other people are having this same issue all over the internet!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>im not tech savy- the affected computer cannot get internet- &amp; the one im on now is VERY VERY old with limited access/ capabilitues</p>

            Lori, did you try accessing the Repair Mode by every method given here?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If so then you'll need to create bootable media so you can access the repair options, and if those fail try the Reset, and if that fails use the same media to do a Clean Install which if you follow the tutorial I will give you will avoid all future problems by having the best install problem.  In WIndows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore to go back to before the Update, Startup Repair or if that fails go back to Troubleshoot options to try the Reset.
<br />
<br />If those fail then choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry you're going through this but the path out is to let me help you get the best possible install that avoids these kinds of problems.  The Clean Install I linked has been used by hundreds of thousands of consumers recently without a single reported or repeat problem.

<br />
<br />You may be better off doing the Clean install yourself as it is a much better install in the tutorial I gave you than any shop would ever do, and also teaches how to maintain Windows with everything that works best.  No one who has done this Clean install has come back to report any further problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I am the author and will also be here to guide you just as I have millions of other consumers who have used my Clean Install tutorials for WIndows 7 and 10 for the past ten years without a single complaint.

<h2>            Why is Access Denied to a Registry Key Folder that is Preventing me from Installing an Update to One of my Programs Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, my question has disappeared off the forum without an answer, so I am re-posting in hopes that someone can assist me with a fix:<br />
<br />
I am trying to install an update to my embroidery software program, and I am getting this error message:
<br />
Error: 1402. Could not open key:&nbsp; <br />
UNKNOWN32\5DEmbroidery.Document.1\Shell.&nbsp; Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact your support personnel.<br />
<br />
This is an embroidery editing program, it is already installed on my computer and has been running just fine on Windows 8, no problems.&nbsp; It is JUST the installing of this last update (fixes not related to Windows 8) that is causing this error message to pop
 up during the install process.&nbsp; I have tried contacting the software company, and they have not been able to assist me.&nbsp; Instead, suggesting that I reimage my computer, which would be a huge, huge hassle for what I think is a simple fix. Because it is an .msp
 file, when I right-click, I am not offered a "Run as Administrator" option, unfortunately. I am logged in as the Administrator and I am the only profile on my laptop.&nbsp; I am not sure how to reassign privileges to this registry key, as I'm not sure where or
 how to find it.&nbsp; Can someone walk me through where to find this particular key in the Registry, and then what to do to fix this?&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; I have done some research on 1402 errors with the "UNKNOWN32\" in the message that tell the user to browse
 to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Curr

            <p>First, make sure you're logged in as Administrator.&nbsp; Then try right-clicking not the file but the folder, and see if it's a read-only folder, which HKEY files usually are.&nbsp; Then change the folder and all sub-folders and files from read-only, re-run your
 update, then be very sure you change to folder back and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the Win 8 equivalent of regedit to alter the specific file only, but I'm not sure how to get to regedit in Win 8.&nbsp; It didn't come up in my explorations (yet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After either of these changes,&nbsp; you will have to re-boot your comp before you re-run the update software, and re-boot again after you changed the file or folder back.&nbsp; That's because your hkeys are already loaded into memory and so can't be editted.&nbsp; They
 can only be changed by re-loading the changed file/folder though a reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps some.</p>

            Thanks, Ron, I did find my original post right after I re-posted, but I was still having troubles replying and having my entire message show.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
GardenLady, I am logged in as Administrator - I am the ONLY profile on this laptop.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say, "Then try right-clicking not the file but the folder".&nbsp; This is an update file I've downloaded from the manufacturer's web
 site.&nbsp; It's sitting in my "Downloads" folder.&nbsp; When I right click and select "Properties", and un-check "Read Only", then click "Apply" and close out.&nbsp; If I re-open Properties, the "read only" box is still checked.&nbsp; So, are you saying I need to un-check the
 "read only", then re-boot and try to run the update?&nbsp; Regedit in Windows 8 can be found by prssing the Windows key down then pressing the "R" key (to pull up the "Run" window), then type in "regedit".&nbsp; \<br />

            <p>Are you SURE you're logged in as Administrator?&nbsp; Oddly enough, even if you're the only user on the system, you're not automatically running in administrator mode.&nbsp; Though if you're not and try to take an administrative action, it usually asks if you want
 to run the program as administrator.&nbsp; I found out the hard way that even if you're the only user, you're not necessarily in administrator mode.&nbsp; If your checkbox is unchecking itself, you may not be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's a file sitting in downloads, be sure it's unzipped, and do try right-clicking on the file itself.&nbsp; My own embroidery program updates come zipped in self-extracting files that you double-click on, and they self-extract into a folder containing new
 patterns and updates, with an install or setup file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you try regedit (which you can easily mess up with a typo or transposed number), you might have a look at your embroidery program in the add/remove&nbsp;programs function of control panel.&nbsp; It sometimes offers an "upgrade" or "change" option in addition
 to uninstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Else, all I can think of is, as you say, regedit, typing carefully and proofreading 3 times.&nbsp; It may be that your program is adding a new feature or new patterns that have their own HKEY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best advice I have to offer.&nbsp; Sorry I can't be more helpful.</p>

            Hmmm.&nbsp; On second thought, I do have one more idea before regedit.&nbsp; Have you tried right-clicking your file, selecting "run in compatibility mode", and then trying to install it again?

            Yes, I'm sure I'm on as the Administrator :-) When I check it shows as "Patty", "Local Account" "Administrator" "Password Protected".&nbsp; And, this update file is an .msp file, so there is no right click option to run in compatibility mode.&nbsp; The file is not
 zipped, and that shouldn't make a difference, anyway with the registry key permissions issue.&nbsp; And, there is nothing to uninstall - this update will not install without getting this 1402 error message.&nbsp; It will roll back.&nbsp; "Upgrade" or "Change" will not install
 this update.&nbsp; The update file needs to launch to install, it's more than new patterns, it is actually an update that fixes a few little issues with the software.&nbsp; Thanks, GardenLady, but I really, really, really need someone to help me to get to the correct
 registry key and fix the permissions.&nbsp; This is the crux of the issue, I believe.

            <p>I wish I could help you more, but you're yet to tell us which program you're using, and whether or not you've gone to "device manager", located the H_KEY files (hint:&nbsp; They're under either Windows or System), then looked for that particular H_KEY.&nbsp; If it's
 there,&nbsp; you can right-click and change permissions on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's not there, right-click on your install or set-up file, or your update file, choose "run in compatibility mode" for the installation/update program, and it will probably then create the H_KEY you need.</p>

            GardenLady, my software is by VSM (Viking/Singer/Pfaff), it is 5D.&nbsp; And are you meaning Registry Editor and not Device Manager??&nbsp; This are no H-Keys in Device Manager??&nbsp; When I open up the Registry Editor, I have these main HKEY options:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
HKEKY_USERS<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG<br />
<br />
No "Windows" or "Systems" option.&nbsp; Now, if I select the "LOCAL_MACHINE" HKEY, there is a "SYSTEM" pathway.&nbsp; But, I don't see my software listed.&nbsp; This is what I need - I need to know how to exactly navigate the Registry Editor to get to the correct HKEY.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;And I think I've already explained that this update file is not an executable file (.exe file), but an .msp file, and there is no right-click option to run in any compatibility mode.&nbsp; No "Run as Administrator" either.&nbsp; I'm not getting the typical right-click
 menu you'd see with an executable file.&nbsp; Windows is not "seeing" an .msp file as an executable file, so I get a standard right click menu, instead.&nbsp; So, I can't run that file as the Administrator or in any compatibility mode.<br />

            <p>With the new details provided, I did a little research for you.&nbsp; I located the tech support for your VSM software.&nbsp; It doesn't list Win 8 as a supported system, so before you used regedit (which can be dangerous--a typo can get you into a non-boot situation)
 I'd call your software manufacturer and get them to help&nbsp;you.&nbsp; I found their link at:</p>

<p>You may need to do a fresh installation of your core program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your other question, you probably want to check ALL the HKey groups.&nbsp; You may find the particular key you're looking for in one of the with a $ in front of it, meaning it's disabled or has been replaced.&nbsp; But I'd really try the software manufacturer
 first.</p>
