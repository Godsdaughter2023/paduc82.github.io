<h2>            Windows Activation Error &#40;0xC0000022&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Sony Vaio Fit 15E&nbsp;running windows 8 (preinstalled)&nbsp;and have just recently refreshed it. I had logged on and then it says to activate windows. I tried to activating through Computer properties but it said that Product ID wasn't available. I then
 ran slui 03 (The phone activation was displaying an error)&nbsp;and entered my product key and then the following error came up : "The following failure occurred while trying to use the product key: Code: 0xC0000022 Description: {Access Denied} A process has requested
 access to an object, but has not been granted those access rights."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet looking for a solution but couldn't find one. Please try to help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I purchased a laptop with pre-installed Windows 8 in November 2013.</p>
<p>I was able to upgrade to 8.1 successfully when released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last weekend though I was having problems and rest my machine back to factory defaults.</p>
<p>When I check it states windows is activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now want to add features and upgrade to 8.1 again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try I am taken to a page that gives the following 2 options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I want to buy a license 2. I have a license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I select option 2 and then I am asked for my product key.</p>
<p>Windows 8 machines now have this embedded in their bios so I had to use third party software to detect my windows key. When I had found it I entered it onto the page where I was asked for it and then get the message: This key won't work. Please check and
 try again or try a different key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do now? The software pre installed - Windows 8 is genuine installed at manufacture. (I purchased this machine as second user) so have no box / manuals / instructions etc.</p>

    <title>touchpad sticks in DRAG mode, touching buttons moves cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randomstuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            touchpad sticks in DRAG mode, touching buttons moves cursor</h2>
                    <p>I've used touchpad/button laptops for years. Not new to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just bought a new laptop, with new hardware style which extends touchpad over buttons</p>
<p>
</p><p>One apparently unsolvable problem this creates is that when you click the button the cursor moves a bit because the button surface is touchpad. What person thought this was a good idea must have precision machines for hands. Every time I click the cursor
 moves, often means I clicked the wrong item. Looked for setting to desensitize the area of the touchpad which doubles as a button, nothing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second problem, click down and drag and release</p>
<p>OR double click then drag, both scroll bars and windows, </p>
<p>the drag sticks on (usually say 4/5 times) cant see any settings related.</p>
<p>My old laptop end drag as soon as finger is lifted or button unpressed.&nbsp;<br />
Again see no settings related.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>(Have not altered default access related settings, but looked for any that might affect this.
</p>
<p>This seems a software issue but both old and new system running up to date windows 10)
</p>
<p>Not understanding why different hardware would make drag stuck on, which is why I'm posting here.
</p>
<p>Have sent the question to Dell support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a software setting to turn drag off when you stop drag that I am not finding?</p>
<p>Is there a software setting to tell the touchpad driver to ignore touches to the button area?<br />
</p>
<p>Would someone please speak sharply to the person who decided to make buttons move the cursor?&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the touchpad on your laptop isn’t working properly, it’s possible that software conflicts occurred or there are incompatibility issues with the driver installed on the device. Let’s isolate your concern to know more about
 the behavior of the touchpad when using it, follow the methods below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update drivers in Windows 10">Update drivers in Windows
 10</a></em>. This will provide fixes and enhancements to the installed drivers and make it compatible with the device that you’re using.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: Use the touchpad under
<strong>clean boot</strong> state. It will help us determine if there are third-party software that may cause conflict. To do this, please click
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">here</a></em>. Once you’re in the basic state, try to navigate from your screen
 using the touchpad and check the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the result after performing the methods below.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I will follow those suggestions and report back if I find anything.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I have found the bug which answers my second problem.</p>
<p>Background: I went back and forth between my old HP with a precision touchpad but had windows non-precision dialog. Precision features handled by synaptics hardware vendor. By exausting the varios dialogs, the new Dell has only microsoft windows dialogs,
 one of which was the MOUSE dialog. (I have no mouse connected, so should not be relevant.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the MS settings-&gt;devices-&gt;mouse dialog, click "additional mouse options". It brings up the old style mouse window, tab 1 is "buttons" On that tab is a "click lock" checkbox, which was checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now a) Should not have any effect with no mouse!</p>
<p>b) The click lick is for a fast press/release (click!) and then it should lock in drag mode.</p>
<p>It should not (and with my mouse on another system DOES NOT) lock if you do a long press of the left button. Similarly double click/long press drag of window or scroll bar does not trigger click lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my new Dell, both of those operations would (usually) enter click lock state, although</p>
<p>a) I had NO MOUSE. </p>
<p>b) I did not click (press-release rapidly a single time) to begin the drag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the mouse setting is USUALLY but inconsistently causing drag operations on the touchpad to enter click lock state and stay there till another click resumes normal state. Again, the way I use the touchpad (and mouse if I had one) should not enter click
 lock state, because I only did operations where the drag was begin by double tap or long press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off click lock (which I actually like and sometimes use) fixed the buggy behavior on the touchpad. I no longer feel like flinging the laptop across the room when it keeps dragging a window about forever for no reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In further experimentation, I noticed a new and annoying thing, sometimes double tap/drag on windows maximizes them instead of dragging. Not a fan of that. I expect that is hardware issue failing to distinguish double tap from tap tap/hold&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the problem remains: there is no way to click on this toucpad which does not move the cursor at least a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is made worse by the fact that I have a partially crippled hand.</p>
<p>SO THIS SHOULD REALLY GET SOME ATTENTION FOR EASE OF USE OF TOUCHPADS.</p>
<p>Even people with two good hands will likely want to be able to touch the button area without the cursor moving. So how about it microsoft, obey the Americans with disabilities act and fix this problem pronto!</p>
<p>People with shaky hands need to push buttons too.</p>

<p>There are two issues that remain unresolved, both Microsoft Windows issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st) There is an Americans with disabilities act issue, specifically that touchpad hardware has evolved to place buttons under the active touchpad, so it is not possible to click a button without also being in contact with the cursor moving function of the
 touchpad. For people with disability (myself included) such as hand injury, it is not possible to click a button without also moving the cursor. This is also try of elderly people (myself included) whose hands simply shake or unsteady. This is resolvable with
 a currently non existent ease of access setting which would cause the software NOT to move the cursor when touching the button portion of the touchpad. This is a common problem affecting millions of users, which is unaddressed in the software provided by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd) There is a bug in the settings of MOUSE which affects behavior of TOUCHPAD causing drag state to become locked. Note that although there are similarities between mouse and touchpad devices, both can be attached at once. The settings for MOUSE may be
 set deliberately in ways that are different than the desired behavior of TOUCHPAD, and so MOUSE settings and TOUCHPAD settings should be independent of one another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of these issues is resolved, as both require software fixes from Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue of drag state becoming locked on in TOUCHPAD can be prevented by unchecking the click lock option of MOUSE. This is not a fix, as one could well desire the click lock option when using a mouse, and still want a well behaved TOUCHPAD. (my situation
 exactly).</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the link, signed in, only to find there is no way to contact them in writing, like email or with a forum style dialog.</p>
<p>I can call or video them, but being part deaf not a fan, or chat, being typing challenged (this takes a while for me) also not a fan, but most important, no way to have a written recorded conversation to report an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, seriously? No persistent way to report new problems evolving hardware causes disabled people?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have little trust of reports filed by phone going anywhere, much less becoming resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are in microsoft, how about you forward this post to the disability issue team. While they are at it, they can put up an honest problem reporting web page and not a phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In spite of the tone if my reply, I do appreciate your personal good intentions.</p>
<p>Decades of having no way to report windows bugs has left me pretty skeptical.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can offer some additional information. Previously high precision touchpads had vendor supplied drivers &amp; control software.</p>
<p>Although the ones I am familiar with did not specifically address the button issue, the one I last used, Synaptics I believe,</p>
<p>allowed one to select a region oon the bottom and side of the touchpad to be treated as a scroll bar, so finger movement</p>
<p>across the bottom for example moved the horizontal scroll bar (if one was active in the focused window), so</p>
<p>it had the additional benefit of preventing cursor movement on the touchpad region over the buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This effectively eliminates the problem for old or disabled people like me who need to be able to click</p>
<p>a button reliably without moving the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, this may seem trivial, but at least one I accidentally button the wrong start menu item to uninstall, and proceeded</p>
<p>to irreversibly uninstall the wrong app.</p>
<p>So probably be a good idea if that had a confirmation. If I delete a file there is (optionally) a confirmation so I know I am deleting the intended file. There is no such confirmation when uninstalling an app from the start menu. If your finger shook on
 the initial right click, you just uninstall the wrong thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minimally, the "unpin from start" should say "unpin &lt;foo&gt; from start" and "uninstall" should say "uninstall &lt;foo&gt;" so there is some kind of feedback you are uninstalling the intended app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As is it invites disaster.</p>

<p>RandomStuff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short answer is that the settings available within Windows to control the TouchPad are dictated by the TouchPad driver i.e. the hardware maker.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows can only work with what is presented to it by the TouchPad driver.&nbsp; So the options available in
</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings, Devices, TouchPad</li><li>Control panel, Mouse, TouchPad tab [<em>if it has one, my new Dell does not</em>]</li><li>Start menu, Dell [<em>if there are any relevant utilities, mine does not have any</em>]</li></ul>
<p>are all that Windows can alter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is Dell &amp; only Dell that can provide a solution.&nbsp; A replacement driver would be required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Dell Inspiron 7779 has the same touch-sensitive TouchPad buttons as yours.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>I also think it is a terrible idea.&nbsp; </li><li>I had a look around Dell support &amp; the <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dell user forum</a> but could not find any guidance on the subject.</li><li>I have not contacted Dell support about this issue because I am too busy nagging them about their failure to stock replacement batteries for the computer [being an internally-fitted main battery, the usual third-party suppliers do not bother with it].</li></ul>

<p>Thanks for your input. I dont disagree with anything you said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came close to returning the dell, but reviewing other laptops I saw the same buttons-under-touchpad problem almost universally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell support said its a Microsoft problem, but responsibility is clearly shared, and equally clearly neither Dell or Microsoft have made any attempt to address the issue that this increases the difficulty for disabled and elderly users, and as such is a
 violation of the Americans with Disabilities act. The law requires "reasonable accommodation", and equally clearly no effort has been made to correct this. Dell points the finger at Microsoft, and Microsoft has a phone number, not web page, to report disability
 related problems. Sort of makes sure elderly and hard of hearing people dont complain. The other option is a "chat" page, which also makes sure elderly people with hand issues dont complain. So they pretend to have a method to address problems, but the contact
 methods are themselves a pretty strong filter against elderly people communicating. They could for example accept email or have an email equivalent web page to accept reports from people like myself who type too slowly and poorly to use chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This probably does not get fixed until a class action lawsuit happens. If I were Microsoft, I think I'd lean toward making it happen before the lawsuits. Its sad we live in a world where it takes lawsuits to fix what should be fixed by competition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the driver reports touch location(s), the upstream software that microsoft provides could easily be made to ignore regions of touch or treat them differently, such as Synaptics did with horizontal scroll region. I expect quite a few ways to solve this
 are out there, it requires the "reasonable accommodation" effort to be made.</p>

<p>Hello Death Angel!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I will be happy to assist you with your inquiry today. Just to clarify, you've already tried to set your actual Xbox One console as your home Xbox, correct? Also, when trying to make your console the home console
 did it happen to mention how many switches you had left? In any case, I would suggest trying a power cycle of both console to make sure that we clear the cache of the system. If you need assistance with
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing the cache</a> please follow the link provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have any further questions, feel free to reply back letting us know. Again, thank you for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

            You may want to try power-cycling your console (press and hold power button on front of console for several seconds, until it shuts down; then, after it's off for 15-20 seconds, restart it) and trying again.<br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind, as well. Home Xbox is not designed to be passed around to others, and the Xbox Live Code of Conduct prohibits users from exchanging account details (that means you can't give your account and password to someone else).

            <p><span>Hi Thomas,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Do you receive any error codes or messages?</span></p>
<p><span>2. When did the issue start?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Have you made any recent changes on the system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may </span><span>run the Fixit from the following link and check if it can fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_media_player_diagnostic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Windows Media Player video, and other media or library issues

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are still facing the issue, then you may perform a</span><span> clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.

<p>Hi Ash, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Re-paring the Surface Pen with the device usually resolves the issue sending screenshots to OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you follow the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the top button for 5-7 seconds.<br />
<br />
If the LED light blinks continuously:<br />
<br />
That means the pen is receiving power and is trying to pair with a device. Follow the steps to pair Surface Pen with your Surface. If that doesn't work, restart your Surface and try pairing again.<br />
<br />
If the LED light blinks for 2-3 seconds:<br />
<br />
That means your pen is already paired to another nearby Surface.<br />
<br />
To fix this, find the Surface and remove the pen. For info about how to remove it, see Remove a Bluetooth device. You’ll need to look for Surface Pen in the list of Bluetooth devices.<br />
<br />
</li><li>After you remove the pairing, go back to the Surface you want to use Surface Pen with and pair it again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, please contact our<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Assisted Support</a> for further assistance and to know your options.</p>
<p>

<p><span><em>Is there some way of telling W10 to maintain my restore point settings during major updates?</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; No, there isn't. In fact it is worse: Automatic updates have a nasty tendency of disabling the System Restore mechanism.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To retain your ability to undo an automatic update you would need to create a system image prior to the update.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. Let me assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has an option, set by default, for 'Fast Restart' which is sort of a partial hibernate - so after a shutdown, at next start up you would not see the bios options or have available the F12 or whatever to access the startup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can disable Fast Restart from Power Options, on left menu is 'choose what closing the lid does. Then select the blue text for 'change settings that are currently unavailable'&nbsp; Scroll down and you will see Fast Restart &amp; a checkbox to enable or disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Computer not booting</h2>
                    My computer will not boot. I have tried a system restore using the installation media, but it wouldnt work. I have tried just about everything on the internet, and nothing works. There is nothing wrong with my hardware (i tested it), and i keep getting
 a blue screen with a stopcode DRIVER PNP WATCHDOG. I googled to see what that code meant and how to fix it, but it never worked. Please help me.(btw i have the installation disc)

            Hi CanonShaw ... you will need to fully wipe and format your drive and preform a fresh clean installation.
<br />See link below by Greg on how to do this.

<p>Hi Indranil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem with your Mobile Hotspot connection may have something to do with the current driver of your network adapter. It may need to be updated as the issue appeared few days after the installation of Windows 10 Creators update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure that your network adapters have the latest or updated drivers, we suggest that you proceed with the driver update. Please follow the steps in
<strong>Update the network adapter driver</strong> provided in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

 change to this AP. I tested another devices like Cell Phones, tablets and XP SO and the random works fine. But with Windows 7 don´t, we already upgrade the wireless card and change some parameters in "device wireless properties" without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>¿Someone can advice me how determinate this issue?</p>

<h2>            Printer won&#39;t install. System cannot find specified path.</h2>
                    Old printer broke. Jammin' paper all the time. Got a new one. I keep getting the same error message when I try to install it. System cannot find specified path. Very important that I get it up and running. I suspect a registry error. Here's a screen shot
 of the error message I uploaded to my facebook. http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2110831&amp;id=1213798194&amp;saved#!/photo.php?fbid=1894758128027&amp;set=a.1894758048025.2110831.1213798194&amp;theater

<p>Most printers are 'discovered', and, have a 'generic driver' installed....via the OS (operating system), they are first connected to any computer.</p>
<p>When the Software that comes with any/all new printer is installed, proper ATTENTION has to be paid.........to 'how' this process actually works.</p>
<p>It may have asked you, during the process, to TURN the Printer 'ON'. And, plug in the USB cable. Most are set up in this fashion..........CONFIRM the printer's presence, to the software being INSTALLED.</p>
<p>OooopS! You got an 'error' message, instead!</p>
<p>Okay, where's the Manual for this printer?</p>
<p>Give it a thoroughly good read through, and, redo everything again, once you clearly understand/comprehend the whole process....to realize 'where' you went wrong with the installing of your printer.</p>
<p>Don't rush doing it the 2nd time around.</p>

    <title>Problem printing to a shared printer on home network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troz1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem printing to a shared printer on home network</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop PC running Windows 7 with two USB printers attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Dell laptops running Windows 10 Home.<br />
</p>
<p>I have installed the printers as shared printers on the laptops. One laptop can use both printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other laptop can use <em>one </em>of the printers perfectly using all applications. When using the other printer, it exhibits the following behaviour:<br />
</p>
<p>Printing test page - yes<br />
Printing from Wordpad, Firefox, Thunderbird - yes<br />
<strong>Printing from Office 2010 or Acrobat Reader - NO. When printer is selected in print dialog, it says "connecting to printer", then the application stops responding.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried the following, without success:<br />
- run printer diagnostics</p>
<p>- delete and reinstall the printer (multiple times)</p>
<p>- check for driver updates</p>
<p>- turned off "print in background" in Word<br />
- uninstall and reinstall Office<br />
- stop and restart the printer service, purge the spool queue<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating, hope someone can help.</p>

<p>Answering my own question to report a solution.</p>
<br />
<p>Had good support from a Dell technician who spent a couple of hours remotely logged in to my machine, but couldn't isolate the problem.</p>
<p>
Tried various other things including a complete re-image, no success.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I noticed that on the original install disk for the Fuji Xerox printer there were both Postscript (PS) and PCL6 drivers. If I let Windows choose the driver, it always chose the PS one. So I manually installed the PCL6 driver on the desktop machine to
 which the printer was connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I uninstalled and re-installed the printer on the Dell laptop. This time, when I selected "connect to a shared printer on another computer" it gave me the choice of "Fuji Xerox P255 PS" or "Fuji Xerox P255 PCL6". I chose the latter, and suddenly MS
 Office and Adobe Reader were able to talk to the printer, and I could open the printing preferences dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why one computer refused to talk to a printer with a Postscript driver when two other near-identical computers on the same network were happy to do so remains a mystery to me, but at least I have a workaround.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install games on my external ssd even if I have 1TB of space left and hundreds of games already installed on it.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm having a problem with my external storage and I found out where the problem lies but not a way to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried almost everything from "clear local save data" to "Clear Blue ray space", hard reset, soft reset etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem appeared&nbsp; when I bought 3 games off of Microsoft Store. One of them, Spyro, succeeded in installing on my external hdd.</p>
<p>But Bully and Resident Evil 7 failed. This is where my problem gets really tricky. I already had a good amount of games on my internal hdd and proceeded to move most of them to my external, just to clarify if only those two games from previously had the
 issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my suprise, several of my games suddenly got the same error message, "Installation has Failed" but some of those games also managed to move to my external SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox says I have exactly 1TB space left on my external SSD but will not install more games. However, I am allowed to install games on my internal HDD</p>

<p>Hey there Anonymous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue concerning being unable to install your new games unto your external hard drive. I just wanted to add that another good troubleshooting step for this (at least to make sure the issue's not resulting from
 some bug) would be a soft reset of your console. <span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they

<p>Hi Anonymous,</p>
<p>I had a similar issue, here's how I resolved it. For the games that failed the initial install, try to install them again. Usually if a download is interrupted, (or if a game is interrupted when moving between storage devices) reinstalling the game will
 fix that problem, and allow other games to install to that hard drive again. I would try this before reformatting the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't let you install it because the external is connected, disconnect, download, and then reconnect the external, then move the new download to the external.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem moving Forza Horizon 4 between hard drives over the weekend and this method worked.</p>
<p>Let me know how everything turns out!</p>

<p>Hey Hayden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have formatted my external SSD a few days ago, but before that, I tried seriously everything you recommended but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not uninstall and install back to my external SSD.&nbsp; Xbox would only let me install on my internal and then again would not let me move it to my external. So RE7 just stayed in the internal hdd. Same with other games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, things started to get tricky. Other games from years ago could install on External SSD without problems and some could not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still downloading a ton of games like Halo, Red Dead 2, GTA and others with insane amount of GB so this will take some time...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know if anything new comes up :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help Hayden.</p>

            All SSD's by the nature of their read/write process use a process called "Provisioning" to set aside a portion of the total size to move data around when it receives requests. Typically this amount is 10-15% of the total size so the fact yours may have
 provisioned 33% (if it isn't a fault) can be adjusted via software.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 7 Upgrade through Mentor Media - Update&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> germerican  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Upgrade through Mentor Media - Update&#33;</h2>
                    Over one week after Windows 7's official launch date it appears that almost anyone who is expecting a Windows 7 upgrade from Mentor Media, for a qualified laptop or PC, which they purchased after June 26, 2009, has neither received their upgrade nor gotten
 any updated information from either Mentor Media themselves or the various manufacturers who administer the upgrade program through Mentor Media, about the status of their orders. It also appears that many customers have had their credit cards charged, without
 having received an e-mail that would have included shipping information. Furthermore, for many the order status field on Mentor Media's website no longer contains any information but instead shows a black bar. Many people are upset about the fact that virtually
 no information is being provided by any of the parties involved (including Microsoft). Mentor Media does not respond to e-mail inquiries and the manufacturers refer customers back to Mentor Media. I think I speak on behalf of many (especially those who were
 charged a shipping &amp; handling fee for their "free" Windows 7 upgrades) when I say that we'd really appreciate it if anyone could provide information on the status of our orders. In addition, it would be nice if anyone has answers to the following questions:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>What does the black bar next to the order status on the Mentor Media website mean?
</li><li>Has anyone actually received their upgrade from Mentor Media? If so, when did they submit their upgrade order and when did they receive it?
</li></ul>
<br />
Please understand that it is not necessarily the delayed shipping that is upsetting so many people but rather the complete lack of communication on Mentor Media's part, as well as on the part of the manufacturers and Microsoft. There is a fairly extensive thread
 over on <a href="http://forum.lenovo.com/t5/Windows-7-Launch/Win-7-upgrade-program-delivery-updates/td-p/167868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lenovo's customer forum</a> regarding this issue. Another thread on <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=429060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
NotebrookReview.com</a> is discussing the non-existing order status in particular. Perhaps posting it on here will reach customers of other manufacturers who are experiencing the same problem.<br />

            I have spent a week talking to Microsoft who claim it is a manufacter issue, e mailing Mentor Media with no reply, PC World who sold me the computers.&nbsp; I am wating for two "free" upgrades, ordered in August for Acer and Packard Bell.&nbsp; Have not been able
 to get through to packard bell and left voicemail messages which have not been returned.&nbsp; Got through to Acer today who gave me an invalid Mentor Media website address and finally got the correct one with with no UK contact number.&nbsp; Acer say they are using
 a third party and it is nothing to do with them, I say that I ordered through the Acer website and bought an Acer computer with a "free" upgrade so I hold them accountable.&nbsp; They refuse to help so how can I complain to a company that has not contact information,
 ie Mentor Media.&nbsp; Microsoft endorsed them with distribution and should take reponsibility for the absoulute shambles.&nbsp; They have taken my money twice and I have not idea about when either of my discs

            This whole thing is getting ridiculous. Microsoft blames the manufacturers who in turn say it's Mentor Media's fault. Mentor Media on the other hand is using a completely different approach by just not saying anything at all, and I mean that literally,
 they are not communicating with end users whatsoever. When you take into consideration the fact that Microsoft hired Mentor Media to distribute the Windows 7 upgrades, the vicious circle closes itself back up again and the customer is left standing in the
 rain.<br />
<br />
Now, for me personally this saga is just annoying and frustrating but if I think about everyone who actually had to pay shipping and handling costs in order to receive their upgrade, I feel disgusted. You shouldn't be taking someones money without at least
 telling them when they can expect to receive what they paid for. Not only that but when I look at the amounts some people had to pay, the least you could expect is for the upgrades to be shipped expedited via courier but to be honest I highly doubt that will
 happen. Why won't Microsoft intervene?<br />

            I am personally disgusted by the service I have received from Mentor Media after taking my money. I have issued a chargeback and encourage everyone else to do so as well. They have no right to take your money and then dissapear without communicating any
 problems. Its experiences like this which just nudge me over to Apple little by little every day. Why cant anyone from Microsoft get an authoritative answer as o what is going on?

            I have just sent an e mail to Packard Bell about the updated information on receipt of my upgrade, their forum in down and they do not answer phone calls "due to unusual heavy demand", I have threatened Acer with legal proceedings and they are supposed
 to get back to me by Tuesday at the latest.&nbsp; I have started a Facebook group "Mentor Media and Win 7 upgrade" and hope people find it and we can use it as a communal link to achieve public awareness of the many many disappointed and frustrated customers -
 maybe then Microsoft will update the masses.&nbsp; I feel I have been conned, the upgrade is not exactly free, £9.99 for Acer and £19.99 for the HP "postage" but the inability to either get a refund or my discs is extremely frustrating.&nbsp; As I ordered in August,
 I think they have had plenty of time to put a shipping label on an envelope - I mean how hard is that.&nbsp; I am now waiting for Microsoft to send me details of how I can officially complain, I requested information over the

            Interestingly I did not get a response to my e-mail inquiry I sent on October 23rd but my order status on Mentor Media's website changed back to Pending for Fulfillment. Some users on other forums reported having received e-mail responses from Mentor Media
 as well and some even reported having received their copies of Windows 7. At least it appears that something is happening. What I find a little surprising is that Mentor Media is acting like they didn't expect this demand. Hellooo??? They've had forever to
 prepare. If I treated my own customers they way I'm being treated right now I could close my business and file for bankruptcy.

            As you rightly say, they know how many people pre-registered for the Windows 7 upgrade and thus know what the demand is, so there is no excuse for such a delay or the phrase ' due to unprecedented demand'. They obviously don't have the resources to handle
 an activity of this scale. But it looks like we have no option but to wait...and wait...and wait.<br />

<h2>            How to perform System recovery, computer goes to black screen</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - System Recovery Options</p>
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm going to try to quickly sum up what happened to my computer. I was transferring some pictures off of my iPhone and into a folder in My Pictures. The computer had been running just fine while I was playing games and watching youtube just the couple hours
 before I started the data transfer. While it was copying the files, my computer froze up and it seemed to be a windows explorer issue. I eventually had to restart my computer and it booted up just fine and I tried to continue with the transfer and after about
 20 seconds into the transfer it the windows froze up again and I had to close windows explorer and reopen it and then try again. Well, it froze another time and I restarted my computer only to have it go to a black screen with a blinking white cursor.<br />
<br />
It has continued to do this and I have not been able to get it to boot back up properly. I went into my BIOS to see if my hard drive was showing up and it is being recognized as its proper 1TB Western Digital hard drive. My boot order is correct, but every
 time I try to get it to boot back up, it goes to the black screen with flashing cursor and it asks me to insert a cd or device. I then tried to do a system restore with a disk, and when I get to the System Recovery Options, there is no operating system showing
 up to select and it won't let me restore because I have not selected an operating system. The same thing when I try to get to the advanced boot options menu at start up, my Windows 7 that I have been using for the last year and a half is not showing up. I
 do not understand what is going on. Since my hard drive is being recognized, it makes me think it is a windows problem causing this to happen. I unfortunately have not backed up my system on an external source, so I am hoping to get this thing up and running
 properly again, but if at the very least, be able to retrieve all of my data from my hard disk. Please help me get this resolved.<br />
<br />
Matt<br />

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7. <br />
<br />
</strong>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best<br />
option though here are a few others.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an <br />
external drive case and then backing them up. Do so using several <br />
methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer shop or <br />
your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer</a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double
<br />
Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click on <br />
Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;<br />
and Safe Mode) is to CTRL + ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on <br />
Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - <br />
then on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in<br />
EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by repeatedly tapping F8<br />
as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back<br />
to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is <br />
usually on a hit or miss basis. That there is no information on a black<br />
screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the difficulty. Often <br />
using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have <br />
worked however these cover a wide field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. <br />
If you do not have the disks your system maker will sell them cheap. <br />
Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.<br />

You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else's same version<br />

</p><p>Windows has encountered a problem communicating with a device connected to your computer.

<br />
This error can be caused by unplugging a removable storage device such as an external USB drive while the device is in use, or by faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD-ROM drive that is failing. Make sure any removable storage is properly connected and
 then restart your computer. <br />
<br />
If you continue to receive this error message, contact the hardware manufacturer.

            I disconnected the SSD with the OS on, the first in the boot order and it booted from a Windows DVD. So good so far got to the choseu a language screen and went into the recovery section. I wanted to shut the PC down properly so hit shutdown and got a
 flash of a BSOD with the unhappy sideways face!? It reset and rebooted from the DVD the next thing I saw was the Blue window of the DVD booting up againe then a blues screen saying:<br />
<br />
RECOVERY<br />
There was a problem with a device connected to your PC<br />
an unexpected 1/0 error has occurred<br />
error code Oxc00000e9<br />
<br />
This problem can happen when a removable storage device is removed while it's in use or failing. Properly connect any removable storage and restating your PC may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
I held down the power button to shut down then I reconnected the SSD. I tried starting up and this time it found the DVD and booted from the DVD. I tried going into recovery went past the chose a language screen and again BSOD with the side ways unhappy face
 flashed up and rebooted next thing is the blue windows logo again. BSOD then reboot windows and into the language menu I chose the language and then Navy blue screen and nothing, frozen. Held power button to shut down.<br />
<br />
Rebooted PC got the Over clock has failed screen, the over clock is mild CPU not RAM with XMP profile and completely stable.<br />
<br />
Went into BIOS and removed OverClock and now back to the first situation booting a nd rebooting cycling through the first screen i described at the top of this post.<br />

I created a boot able Windows USB from the DVD on my Mac and tested it on the mac and it booted into windows installation. I then put it into the PC went into BIOS and found the USB but its called a generic storage device and before it would name the brand.
 I tried booting from the USB but just get the same screen as I first explained cycling in and out, booting and rebooting.<br />

            I got the "American Megatrends This Over clock has failed" screen again with no overclock.<br />
this is something that has happened before. I was having shutdowns for no apparent reason during idle or low activity states, never during load. It has never crashed or shut down during Prime 95 or Cinibench or any of the other benchmarking programs only when
 idle or doing light work. I have had HWmonitor up on screen for weeks and the temperatures have risen above 70c.<br />
<br />
I never found the source of the problem and in the end when I changed the way the GPU was plugged in to the PSU and changed the PCI slot the problem seemed to vanish though it was intermittent so there is no way to know for sure if it was gone before this total
 failure.

            <p>I am new to PC's this is this first I have built and the first I have ever used so I can get lost with terminology pretty quickly though over the last month and a half I have run so many tests and such I'm a lot better now. Just so you know who your talking
 to.</p>
<p>My OS and programs are on the SSD </p>
<p>
</p><p>the RAID 0 is on 2x3TB HDD on the Marvell controller on the board the other controller is the Intell one and this I'm sure is the Primary controller if the Marvell is the secondary.</p>
<p><strong>Intel® X79 chipset : </strong><br />
2 x SATA 6Gb/s port(s), gray<br />
4 x SATA 3Gb/s port(s), blue<br />
Support Raid 0, 1, 5, 10<br />
<strong>Marvell® PCIe 9128 controller : </strong><br />
2 x SATA 6Gb/s port(s), navy blue<br />
Support Raid 0, 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>There Is no optical drive i installed via a USB but when all my troubles started weeks ago I bought a USB3 external optical drive to test things with and it is this with the windows 8.1 DVD in that the PC was booting from. It is plugged into one of the USB
 sockets at the rear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other drives are the 2 HDD's in a RAID and there is another 4TB one which has a backup on it. In BIOS I can see all the drives but the removable USB drive is not named correctly and I cant boot from it. Are you suggesting I disconnect all the drives
 but the SSD? I may lose the RAID I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try it now.</p>

            <p>I disconnected all the drives and all of the peripherals and I got a successful boot, I was so happy to see the screen. I have a Tablet for drawing, a keyboard, a mouse, a USB connection to the smaller Dell screen. a USB3 extension running to the Asus screen
 that feeds the USB ports on the screen, A display port cable running to the second Asus screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try plugging things back in one by one to see what was the problem. I cant believe that a USB cable from a tablet or screen could stop the whole system from booting up? The overclocking warnings when there was no overclock, these are strange and worrying
 and have happened before to me? the BSOD and freezes while running from the installation disk? The inability to boot from the USB windows drive or the USB Acronis true image recovery drive? Though I may have done something wrong with the creation of the Windows
 USB but it did work on the Mac and I could boot with it on the MacBook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My project contains over 500GB of footage and will be many weeks of work if this system is not stable it could course me lots of problems later. I know little about windows PC's but this behavior seems very strange, is it normal? can I keep working on this
 PC? Or do you think There is something else happening and if so what should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had a long thread with a guy who tried to help me on another forum and he felt that the PC was running too hot but we could never find out why. For a while it would just shut down all the time and reboot but there was no way to see what was the course.
 We tested memory, CPU drives GPU as best as we could but all were fine under duress then when idle it just went. In the end I changed the slot my GPU was in and some cables and the problems seemed to stop though we never knew why and I still keep getting critical
 warnings in my log and it's only been a week so it could start again at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was such a good idea to build a PC and was so sick of Apple but I'd do anything to be able to get the money back and buy a Mac that just worked.</p>

            <p>I guess 8.1 is different as the menus in repair were different but there was an option saying "repair startup". I tried this and it told me after a bit that:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>START-UP REPAIR</p>
<p>Startup repair couldn't repair your PC</p>
<p>Press advanced options to try other options to repair your PC or shut down to turn off your pc.</p>
<p>Log file G:/windows/system32/logfiles/Srt/Srttrail.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>there was no next option but it did say if problem persists you can:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now click on <span><strong>‘Advanced Options’</strong> and then on
<strong>‘Windows Startup Settings’</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>this is not in the Advanced options or anywhere else in troubleshooting as far as i can see in my DVD and there's only 12 options. I did find a way into safe mode but it's unclear what it wants me to do there apart from a way to boot into windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the log in windows and it says all boot tests were successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have plugged everything back in and there is no problem now to boot. So nothing showed up as responsible. It would be nice to think it was the overclock but the PC failed to boot after the overclock was remover and even showed the overclock failed screen
 after the overclock was gone. The overclock was mild and the PC passed extensive stress testing with it applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know something is very wrong and know it will come up again soon. the longest I have managed in the past 6 weeks before it goes wrong is about a week and It is not much use for working on in this state but I can not see how to diagnose the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must sleep now but I'll be up again staring at it tomorrow if anyone has any ideas?</p>

            <p>hello, I'm using win10 pro, which is updated from win 8.1.. in win 8.1 I encrypted one of my drive, at that time that worked perfect. after upgrading to win 10 pro, initially my bitlocker was working fine but now &nbsp;my drive is encrypted and neither show any
 option to open nor for decryption. and there is no bitlocker available in control panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried several options like "edit local group policy" and allow bitlocker without TPM. but still there is nothing in control panel and no option with my drive. this message arrives when I open local group policy.</p>

    <title>Win 10 doesn&#39;t recognize second Win XP ntfs formatted old data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeljko_05  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 doesn&#39;t recognize second Win XP ntfs formatted old data disc &#40;not boot disc&#41;</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10 on a new solid-state drive, I wanted to connect another drive (an old NTFS formatted disk I used as a data second disc, not boot disc, in work with Windows XP operation system). But Windows 10 doesn't recognize the second disc,
 displays blue screen, runs into search problem solution procedure, with no result. BIOS recognizes the second disc. &nbsp;When I disconnect the second disc, Windows 10 regularly boots-up to the desktop window screen. The second disc works ok when I connect it again
 in the combination with the old Windows XP boot-up disc.<br />
What I need to do with the second data ntfs disc to be recognized by Windows 10?

            <p>Hi Nyima,</p>
<p>I don't know if my&nbsp;Old Windows XP NTFS SATA hard drive is compatible with Windows 10. The HDD model is WD Caviar 320 GB, SATA II, 3.5", 7.200 rpm, purchased in 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 10 boot disc is SSD SanDisk Ultra II 240GB SSD, 2.5” 7mm, SATA 6 Gbit/s, SDSSDHII-240G-G25.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since last reporting I have deleted complete volume of the old disc, during work under Win XP.</p>
<p>After that I&nbsp;connected cleared old disc in combination with Win 10 boot disc, but with the same result. Blue screen appears and message something like - boot disc not recognized. After disconnecting&nbsp;the old disc and start computer, Windows 10&nbsp;<span>takes
 about</span> <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>and three</span> <span>restarts</span>
<span>to recover from</span> <span>problematic</span> <span>configuration.</span></p>
<p><span>I have enough</span> <span>experience</span> <span>in the administration</span>
<span>of Windows</span><span>,</span> <span>since</span> <span>Windows</span> <span>
NT</span> <span>and</span> <span>BSoD</span> <span>screen</span><span>,</span> <span>
and</span> <span>as I recall</span><span>,</span> <span>I</span><span>'ve never</span>
<span>had a problem</span> <span>with</span> <span>combining the</span> <span>discs</span>
<span>formatted</span> <span>on</span> <span>any</span> <span>platform</span> <span>
NT</span><span>,</span> <span>2000 or</span> <span>XP</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that this is a problem in Windows 10 and it should not be happening after more than 20 years development cycle of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately</span> <span>I am not able</span> <span>to test </span>the old hard drive in work under&nbsp;Windows 7 or other&nbsp;version&nbsp;of Windows.</p>
<p>Also, I am not able to try to connect the old disc with&nbsp;USB&nbsp;adapter to the computer and check if the hard drive is getting recognized or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your persistent assistance.</p>

            Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
1. Are these computers connected to a domain network?<br />
2. What is the complete error you receive about the C++ run time?<br />
<br />
Let's try the following steps in XP computer and check if they help.<b><span><br />
<br />
Method 1:</span></b>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Remove the existing Visual C++ installations.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer to this link:</span></p>

<br />
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<b><span><br />
Method 2: </span></b><b><span>Perform clean boot and run the application and check.</span></b>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
