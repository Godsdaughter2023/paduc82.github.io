<h2>            Do I need to re-activate Windows after replacing Motherboard and Processor</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>New Motherboard and Processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dual boot system with Windows 8.1 Pro and Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I purchased Windows 8 Pro online and was given a product key to activate it. I subsequently downloaded the free Media Centre add on and was given a product key to activate it. After this I upgraded to Windows 8.1 via the store and have no product key.</p>
<p>I am about to replace my motherboard and processor due to hardware failure.</p>
<p>Can I just boot from the disk and let Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 look after getting the correct drivers for the new motherboard and processor?</p>
<p>If not how do I get a clean install of Windows 8.1 with the Media Centre and activate both of them?</p>
<p>As I understand it I cannot use the Windows 8 key to activate Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Will I have to re-install Windows 8 and activate by phone since the activation will fail because it looks like I am trying to install on another computer, then re-download the Windows 8.1 upgrade and the Media Centre add on?</p>
<p>Are the Windows 8.1 free upgrade and the free Windows Media Centre add on still available?</p>
<p>I assume the same activation problems will occur with&nbsp; Windows 7 Home Premium. I have an OEM System Builder Pack for this.&nbsp;I know that the initial activation tied this to the motherboard but can I get a new activation code for the new motherboard?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacing motherboard and processor might lead to an inactivated and minimal driver copy of Windows 7. But it should boot up and if it boots you can try installing the drivers manually. If not you have to perform a clean install and to activate Windows 7
 again. Coming to Windows 8, I believe it will not boot because product key comes inbuilt in BIOS. So for Windows 8 you have to perform a clean install and then activate it. After activating Windows 8 you can install the Media Pack and then you have to go through
 the entire procedure of downloading and installing Windows 8.1 through Windows Store.</p>

            When you say that it can't scan do you mean that you don't find the scanning software that you had for the Pixma on XP or that you found scanning software but it didn't work?&nbsp; Many printer manufacturers did not supply new scanning software for Windows
 7 even though the drivers they supplied do support scanning with other scanning applications.&nbsp; Did you try Windows Fax and Scan (under "All Programs" or just type "scan" in the Search programs and files box immediately above the Start button)?<br />
<br />
If it is a driver issue, the Windows 7 driver for the MP140 is available at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp140#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p><span>I can vouch for what the original poster is saying.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Canon Pixma MP140 has problems with Windows 7 even though Canon says that it's compatible. A quick Google search will confirm this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 7 32-bit, the printer prints but the scanner doesn't scan. Have tried the latest drivers and older drivers and even installed and run the drivers in Windows XP compatibility mode with no luck.
 The scanner refuses to work in Windows 7 32-bit. Have tried Windows Fax and Scan too with no luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, it's a different story in Windows 7 64-bit - it works perfectly in Windows 7 64-bit. If you're using a 32-bit system then it will work perfectly in Windows XP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that answers your question FoxFifth.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Will someone from Microsoft please correct the listing on the Windows 7 Compatibility website? As the Canon Pixma MP140 is NOT compatible with Windows 7 32-bit.</span></p>

<h2>            Signature will not save</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first post, so I'm hoping you'll be kind. I've been using Windows Mail for a few months now. Originally I set up my mail signature, and it worked fine. For some reason, it recently reverted to the default "Sent from Windows Mail" message. (I've
 made no recent changes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Accounts Settings page, and saw the default message in the signature field, and updated it to my original signature. The field is now correct, but the update I made to my signature won't apply to new or reply emails. I've tried rebooting and
 trying again, logging in as Administrator, but nothing's working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a scan on my computer using Spybot 1.6.2, which confirms there's no issues. Could this be a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions you can make will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marg.</p>

            <p>Hi Marg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the signature does not apply when you try to send emails using Mail app, I wold suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>It could be problem with the Mail app settings. Run the App troubleshooter and check the issue.<br />
Try running the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apps troubleshooter</a>.&nbsp; This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, please reinstall the Mail app.<br />
Right Click on Mail app and select Uninstall.&nbsp; When you try uninstalling Mail app, other apps such as People and Calendar app would also be uninstalled. You can reinstall them from “<strong>Your apps</strong>” section from Windows Store;</p>
<p><br />
Refer to the article:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I ran the App troubleshooter, but it didn't help. I'm too scared to uninstall the Mail app, for fear I might lose things I need. It's not alot of trouble to add the signature to an email.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for your perseverance with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Troubleshooter, which gave me the following result;</p>
<p>"No root causes found and created logs". It asked me to attempt again what I was trying to achieve. I deleted my signature, and re-entered it, changed the "Use an email signature" to Yes, but the default signature persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempted to create a new account, and entered my email address, I received the following message;</p>
<p>"An account using this Microsoft account already exists on this PC". The only option was to "Finish", which closed the program. I do not wish to change my email address to overcome this problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can create a new local account and test the issue. If the Mail app is working correct in the new local account, then you can transfer all the data to the new user account and then convert this local account to a Microsoft account. By doing this you will
 using the same email address.</p>

            <p>Hi Rajith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last few weeks I seem to be plagued with computer issues. I fix one thing, and develop a new issue. I now have a runtime error, “runtime error 217 at 500e8338”. Flash constantly crashes. FF, Excel, Word are often unresponsive. I have uninstalled
 Adobe, re-installed it, updated my plugins and Windows gets updated automatically, but the problem continues. My antivirus is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, not being technically minded makes the job much harder to fix. I feel I'd be inviting trouble if I created a new account and transferred all the data to be honest. I was hoping for a quick fix, but it's not to be. It's easier for me to put up with
 the signature issue, than to chance something else going wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Do you have Norton software installed on the system?</p>
<p>2. When do you get the runtime error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>New user account was just to check if the current user account is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing different issues, I would suggest you to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for system file corruption.</p>

 back up to enter user and password.&nbsp; I can map my XP without any issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            To answer everybody's question about the x-box controller and windows 8;&nbsp; Microsoft has yet to develop the drivers needed for windows 8, and 8.1, If you have downloaded drivers for windows 7 64bit, it will work but poorly, there is a lot of lag time involved,
 and screen freezes, and do date there is no patch to fix this problem as of yet, I to have been trying to do the same think as many of you, and have been in contact with MSN, and X-box support teams, they all tell me the same thing be patient, we are working
 on developing the drivers, and keep check back with us<br />

<h2>            When printing some emails, &#194; appears scattered all over in place of some whitespace.</h2>
                    <p>In case there are encoding problems on this website too, the foreign character I am talking about is the capital A with circumflex. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They seem to appear in place of a certain white space character, maybe non-breaking-space or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Options &gt; Read &gt; Fonts... , Encoding is the default "Western European (Windows)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, in&nbsp;Options &gt; Read &gt; International Settings, "Use default encoding for all messages" is NOT-CHECKED, then when viewing the problematic messages on screen, the&nbsp;Â do not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;"Use default encoding for all messages" is CHECKED, then the&nbsp;Â do appear all over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if I use the "encoding" button at the toolbar of the single-message-view-window, and select "UTF-8", then the&nbsp;Â characters disappear as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of the whether "Use default encoding for all messages" is checked, the&nbsp;Â will appear when the problematic emails are
<strong>printed</strong>, either to a PDF printer or to a real printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that when WLM is rendering an email for printing, it does not respect the settings in Options &gt; Read. &nbsp;Where can I set the render-behavior for printing?</p>

<p>If there are supported drivers for Windows 8.1, yes you could. Please note, 6 and 7th generation Intel processors such as Skylake and Kabylake do not support Windows 8.1 or Windows 7. You will also need to furnish your won Windows 8.1 license depending on

<p>Does anyone know if there is a problem with the loading of Fortune Island for the Forza Horizon 4. It was bought as part of the Ultimate Edition, by my son, when it was launched. He can see the expansion on the screen and it says it is installed but nothing
 happens when he clicks on the Fortune Island icon.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any news... Forza forums are unresponsive at the moment...maybe too much traffic?</p>

 to the non-authoritative computers to read from the authoritative one? And what would I put in as the server? My initial thought was the IP address, but when I try that it just gives an error after trying for a little while.<br />

            This is an interesting question.<br />
<br />
Of course, if your LAN is connected to the Internet, the obvious solution is to sync both computers to the same Internet time source, such as time.windows.com or time.nist.gov (see
<a href="http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi</a>).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The internal real time clocks (RTC) in most computers aren't particularly accurate, but if what you want to do is have two computers sync'ed to the same clock, put all those registry settings back to their defaults and see the response from Hans-Georg Michna
 here&nbsp; --&gt; <a href="http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/sync-time-among-pcs-lan-ntp-t244334.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/sync-time-among-pcs-lan-ntp-t244334.html</a><br />
<br />
The "windowsservername" corresponds to the "full name" of the computer. Right-click My Computer, select Properties, and select the "Computer Name" tab.<br />
<br />
If the computer name isn't recognized, it's probably because NetBIOS name resolution isn't enabled.&nbsp; To test, open a Command Prompt windows (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK) and type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ping computername&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
Note that you don't use the two back slashes for the ping command.&nbsp; For example, if computers named Alice, Bob, and Carol are on the LAN,&nbsp; on computer Alice, you would type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ping Bob&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
but if you were trying to sync the time on Alice using Bob as the source of the time, you would type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; net time \\Bob /set<br />
<br />
To test the net time command, run it without the set parameter.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; net time \\Bob<br />
<br />
You should get the following output (following is from Windows 7, but it should be basically the same for XP):<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]<br />
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.&nbsp; All rights reserved.<br />
<br />
C:\Users\LemP&gt;net time \\Bob<br />
Current time at \\Bob is 7/10/2013 2:30:30 PM<br />
<br />
The command completed successfully.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
To enable NetBIOS name resolution:<br />
<ul>
<li>Open Network Connections (Start &gt; Run &gt; ncpa.cpl &gt; OK)</li><li>Right click on the icon for your LAN adapter and select Properties</li><li>Select "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP" and click the "Properties" button</li><li>Click the "Advanced" button</li><li>Select the WINS tab</li><li>Select the middle radio button to "Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP"</li><li>OK your way out</li></ul>

<p>I eventually started in Safe mode, uninstalled all the Windows updates I could as far as KB4054022 (which did not allow uninstall), renamed the SoftwareDistribution &amp; catroot2 folders and re-started the laptop.</p>

            As another thought in case this points to the issue better, the laptop is also missing icons to the Microsoft Store app and some games which my mother likes to play. I can find the store app if I run wsreset.exe, but it is not reset and I cannot pin it

<p>Sorry for the late response. Some system files may have been corrupted, causing Update Issues and missing Store applications. To troubleshoot this while updating your PC at the same time, we recommend doing an
<strong>in-place upgrade</strong> or a <strong>repair upgrade</strong>. A repair upgrade is the
<strong>installation of Windows 10 over your existing Windows 10</strong>. Performing this could also<strong> repair possible software corruptions
</strong>while preserving your personal files and applications. To do so, kindly refer to this

<p>Thanks, I was thinking that it was a software corruption as well as the store app would not fix using Power shell reinstall commands.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had also done a hard drive scan using the built in windows tool and it had found an error which it fixed, so there may
 have been a temporary hardware issue which caused all this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother's laptop has a support agreement with a shop (the supplier), so I've taken it to them to deal with now in case there is a hardware issue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be case closed.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello KatrinaPappas, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest you follow the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />
<br />-Search for "Bookmarks.bak" in Windows Explorer
<br />-Right-click the file and choose "Open file location" to open the folder, which should be your Chrome user data folder (i.e., Users/[Username]/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default)
<br />-Open the bookmarks backup file in Notepad. Your old bookmarks, hopefully, are listed there
<br />-In Chrome, go to Settings &gt; Advanced sync settings (under the Sign in section) and change the sync settings so that Bookmarks aren't synced, if they currently are set to sync
<br />-Close Chrome
<br />-Back in the Chrome user data folder, find another "Bookmarks" file without an extension. Rename it "Bookmarks2.bak"
<br />-Then rename the "Bookmarks.bak" file to "Bookmarks"
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

<h2>            How to make Windows act like an OS and not like a nanny&#63; Problem connecting to a resource on my LAN without internet access</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Rant]</p>
<p>You have been making my life more and more complicated with every other major update. I'd very much like to ask you to add an option to use your OS like an OS instead of a web-client. I didn't purchase Win 10 Pro Licenses to be hampered by my own OS. Generally
 I prefer using any Linux distribution for work, because it doesn't act like Windows, unfortunately, some machines require Internet Explorer to set-up remotely and for some reason the WinE version doesn't cut it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it did, no machine I have control over would run Windows ever again just so I can avoid wasting time.</p>
<p>[/Rant]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I'm trying to work with some legacy hardware that requires Internet Explorer, I usually run into problems: I'm trying to access 192.168.x.x . While Firefox opens the local address fine without me even having to turn my Wi-Fi on [ or any other Internet
 connection, for that matter ], IE keeps insisting to search for the address on Bing, Google, or wherever else I set a search engine to. What's worse: It keeps insisting, that I am "Not connected to a network". Sometimes it works, once or twice, which is even
 more puzzling. It's called a PROTOCOL because it's supposed to be followed. It's not a "maybe sometimes" thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since when does the definition of a network contain mandatory connection to the internet? I'm pretty sure that LAN and WAN are both networks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now... basically my question is: How do I make Windows a useful tool instead of an extensive Internet browser? How do I get rid of all the nonsense you people keep insisting on pre-installing onto a Windows Professional version?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need it. </p>
<p>I don't want it. </p>
<p>It makes my job more difficult. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I bypass all the nonsensical stuff that keeps asking me for an Internet connection while I'm somewhere without an Internet connection because I don't need one to do my job? [ Yes, yes, google it. I know. I generally do. But this time I came to fix
 a small problem but I first have to figure out why Windows doesn't want to work properly _before_ I can fix the problem in question. It costs me more time for no good reason. About 5 times as much time as I need to solve a small issue of changing a few settings
 on a network device ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I am very angry, because this isn't the first time your products complicate my work needlessly. It happens every single time by now. As I said previously: If there were no machines and maybe a few applications that need me to use Windows, I'd burn
 all the purchased Microsoft installation media and use anything except Microsoft products. Either make a product that is useful or provide support for older Windows versions that can actually be used for work.</p>

<p>Let's leave your emotions out of this discussion and stick to technical matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need Internet access when networking PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a router then you should activate its DHCP server so that every PC gets its own IP address. They can then ping each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a switch without a router then you must give each PC a fixed IPv4 address, e.g. 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11 etc. Again they can then ping each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they can't then you should disable your firewall in order to find out what blocks the test packets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use a wireless rather than a wired network then each PC must, of course, establish a connection to your WLAN.</p>

<p>I don't understand exactly what you want because you seem to be rambling. Here is some information, derived from your post, that I hope will be helpful in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>I'd very much like to ask you to add an option to use your OS like an OS instead of a web-client.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have correctly observed, operating systems are, in fact, becoming web clients. Google's Chromebooks are exactly that, and Microsoft has been struggling to catch up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the operating system is in the cloud, the developer takes care of updating it and fixing it. That makes life much easier for computer users. It means that computers can be simpler to operate and much less expensive. This is the future, so you would
 be well-advised to embrace it or you'll get left behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>I'm trying to access 192.168.x.x&nbsp; ...</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open any web brower and type the address into the Address bar, then press the Enter key on your keyboard. For example, 192.168.1.15 is the configuration page for my printer. These addresses can only be accessed from other devices on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>I'm pretty sure that LAN and WAN are both networks.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's correct. For home users and small offices, LAN (<strong>l</strong>ocal <strong>
a</strong>rea <strong>n</strong>etwork) means their own internal network and WAN (<strong>w</strong>ide
<strong>a</strong>rea <strong>n</strong>etwork) means the internet.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the advice. While it didn't help in my case at all, it might be useful for people who don't actually work as IT specialists for over 10 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to add some more information:</p>
<p>I'm not using any switch, server, hub, proxy, router or anything of the kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply took an Ethernet crossover cable and connected directly to the device. Hence my frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did it break? No clue. I remember a MS Windows 2008 Server simply breaking it's network config after running for years. I was quite baffled to realize that with Windows, a fixed configuration that shouldn't ever expire CAN expire.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What helped me?</p>
<p>I first restarted network services and once I got fed up I disabled and enabled the network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I re-set the network client configuration [ as in: I set my computer's address manually to the desired value to be on the correct subnet ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>After refreshing the IE window a few times I remembered that for some strange reason I need to open the new GUI for network settings for the OS to realize that it's actually connected to a network and access the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For people facing a similar issue with legacy systems - mind you: For some functionality one requires adding said IP address to the "Compatibility list" to avoid having to confirm each launch of the the modules.</p>

<p>As an IT specialist with over 10 years experience you might know that posting important technical details (e.g. "no switch, hub, router but a cross-over cable") would be much more valuable information in a technical forum than the 2,700 character post you
 wrote, which you correctly labelled as "rant".👎</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I want a local system. That is what I'm paying for. If I wanted a Chromebook or an Apple product, I would buy a Chromebook or an Apple product. Just because something is fashionable it doesn't mean that it's actually good.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Snarky remark: Yeah, I really want a car to start updating while I'm driving on a highway. I hope the brakes are the first thing to get initialized and last thing to allow access. Some people use their computers for work. In some cases time is a crucial
 factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: That is not why I pay for MS licenses. If I wanted to purchase hardware for a few thousands USD/EUR to have a netbook, I'd buy a Chromebook for a lot less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>I don't want ANY dev to be touching ANY system I'm currently working on. That is why devs have testing environments to play around on. I'll update my system when I, as the sysadmin, deem it right. I'll never forget how I spent a few hours on restoring
 a project that I left open and crunching one night because I was tired. I wake up the next morning and my Windows was happily telling me how it got updated and how it corrupted my project because it didn't wait for an OK to reboot. I purchased a Professional
 license because I am a professional in the field. Frankly, I was baffled that something like this can happen. I learned my lesson and I don't use Windows for coding anymore.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Go take a look at how well Sharepoint servers handle some Windows Updates. I'm quite certain that those poor sods that ended up with a broken storage will appreciate your defense with good humor. I mean: It's just a few hundred thousand ( moneys ) lost,

<p>Why, dear sir, that is precisely why I posted the issue as "Discussion" instead of a "Question".</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I do realize that me being frustrated is not really helpful, neither is the fact that almost every other time I'm trying to work on Windows I encounter problems that shouldn't even exist nowadays. If this was the first time Windows requires either
 a restart or extensive troubleshooting to just work as it used to 15 years ago, I wouldn't be posting in this discussion. If there were useful people on the MS helpline able to tell me where I can actually find a real diagnostic tool instead of some GUI stuff
 that _has_never_ever_fixed_a_single_network_issue_ I've had, maybe, just maybe I wouldn't bother logging into a MS account that I had been forced to create about 2 years ago, and posting a rant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very much thank you for your help and your time. Now I'm going home to lay down, because my back is killing me. Have a nice day.</p>

<h2>            Remove personal mobile number permanently from account and log in detail</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked into this issue, but have so far not seen a match for my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)I have a personal mobile number (phone) which had to be used to create a skype account with for work purposes.&nbsp; I shortly after added my work email address to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I already had a skype account but this was for personal use and this personal account at the time of last using, did not require a mobile number to be added to the account.&nbsp; At some point after this was setup, your security setup must of changed so was
 unaware of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that I keep getting asked on my personal skype account to add my mobile number, but it states that my mobile number has already been used, which does make sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I permanently remove the mobile number from the 1st account (work one) as I have removed it from the caller ID but it still seems to allow this number to be used to log in with. &nbsp; I don't have a work mobile number to change this to, so how can I
 get around this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to ensure my mobile is completely removed from the account and I would like to add this same number to my personal skype account.&nbsp; I need to retain both accounts though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cannot retain both, please advise how I can delete the 1st account completely ( which should remove my mobile number as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is regardless of platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            EDIT::<br />
<br />
I spoke too soon....(deleting HKLM\\SOFT\MSOFT\FAX\FooBar made no change) I now know that the offending account (microsft) only appears when I start windows fax and scan again....if I haven't deleted that last Fax contained in Microsoft account.<br />
ie. When the fax comes through, I only get one copy. But when I start Fax and scan Gui I get the offending account with a copy of the most recent fax that hasn't been deleted.<br />
<br />
I am starting to think that Fax and scan has got it in for me.... so any ideas? (other than baby-ing advice)<br />
<br />
<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
--\&gt;this is wrong and does not do anything!&lt;/--&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;|<br />
\|/<br />
<br />
Well I deleted FooBar - problem solved.... shame no-one could tell me that.<br />
<br />
FooBar seems to be the placeholder for the intial "microsoft" account.<br />
<br />
It is now gone and I only get one fax..... I can't imagine why it doesn't get deleted as per usual on winXP, once a local account is created. Microsoft will have look into why this has occured.... my first instinct brings me to beleive it to have something
 to do with aschronous reads and writes from the registry... something gotted lagged and skipped. ---&gt; could also be a permission issue, the old microoft fac<br />
x and scan hasn't been upgraded to the new style of elevated permissions mechanism microsoft has been missing for so long.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows homegroup and a Linux network</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a home group set up with two windows PCs. One runs windows 7 and the other windows 10. This is fine and each computer can see the others' documents, picture, video, and music folders. This is what I want. However when setting up the linux machine
 to access the windows machines I found that by installing SAMBA on the linux machine I can access not only the above folders on the windows machines but a raft of others too. I can access default folder, public folder, and the user folder. In the user folder
 I can access a total of 16 folders. These include everything from contacts to downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come windows is allowing the linux machine to see so much on the network? Is there a way I can exclude some of the windows folders? Do I need to set up a more specific kind of network than the home group into which the linux machine appears to be able
 to see?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards Steve</p>

    <title>Skype INVITATION URL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexaladdin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype INVITATION URL</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all Skype professionals, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's so hard to find any article or video on how to invite somebody by using an INVITATION URL link. Yesterday I had a meeting with a prospective customer. Usually I use Skype to arrange a demonstration and screen-sharing. And it takes a lot of time to explain
 to any user who is a newbie in Skype how to send a contact or confirm my request. I know how to create a link for&nbsp;a group conversation, it looks like this one&nbsp;<span>https://join.skype.com/kWasdkhbjgfd. But the last user sent me the&nbsp;link with&nbsp;<strong>/invite/&nbsp;</strong>like
 this one </span>https://join.skype.com<strong>/invite/</strong>GrUhgsdfhgdh</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Why URL I've sent to user differs from that client sent me? Also, w</span>indows<span>&nbsp;opened with links are different: my asks for group conversation and his link asks for an invitation. Please look at the attached pictures.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please help me with this&nbsp;</span>issue. By the way, I contacted Skype support and they&nbsp;couldn't help me. Guy replied that it's not a Skype invitation link :)))))))&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Alex</p>

<p><span>Hello Alexaladdin,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Both are Skype invitation links.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first one is sent to non-Skype users - to invite them to register to Skype, create an account and use the application.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The other link is an invitation sent after creating a group chat and can only be sent to registered Skype users.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need anything else.</span></p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Alex, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are pertaining to the link for inviting members&nbsp;to a group chat -&nbsp;it is system-generated and the member will be added once the link is clicked.
