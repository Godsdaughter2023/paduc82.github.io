<h2>            Blue Screen of Death Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: SLOW</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing on my computer now runs as well as it did before I 1) got the Win 10 upgrade, and especially now since 2) I got the Nov update late in Dec. &nbsp;I can't do anything hardly, except view my e-mails and LOOK at internet sites. &nbsp;Trying to open a folder and
 work with it is just about impossible, opening &nbsp;two is. &nbsp;I have no control over my own computer. &nbsp;I have seen 2 different Blue Screens of Death. &nbsp;The first, I found out what it was supposed to be, did the corrections, and I'll be damned, if it didn't start
 do it again after that. &nbsp;The other showed once before my computer restarted, and hasn't shown since. &nbsp;I am beginning to think the Blue Screens are tied into the upgrade to Win 10, and now with the update, that I oh so foolessly thought would correct the first
 set of problems, I'll be damned if it didn't add to it. &nbsp;Right now, I just wish I hadn't gotten the upgrade an have just stayed with my windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have not been able to see anything that was changed anyway.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a
<br />
process of elimination :<br />
<br />
Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin) - at the prompt type in <br />
<br />
MSCONFIG <br />
<br />
and hit enter<br />
<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows&nbsp;- Windows 10 is essentially the same<br />

<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
Do all of these :<br />
<br />
If you had a 3rd&nbsp;party antivirus&nbsp;on the OS you upgraded OR if you&nbsp;have one<br />
now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender<br />
which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus.&nbsp;Despite&nbsp;all the hype&nbsp;out there<br />
Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are&nbsp;true superstars.<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
Right Click Start button - Control Panel - Troubleshooting - on right side click View all -
<br />
System Maintenance.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the<strong> major on-board and separate&nbsp;<br />
device&nbsp;</strong><strong>drivers</strong>.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update
<br />
those without&nbsp;Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>Can&#39;t run any program as administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george xy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run any program as administrator</h2>
                    <p>I can't run any program as administrator on Windows 8 Enterprise, 64 bit. I am the only user and administrator. All programs that I have tried now, notepad through cmd, run smoothly as 'normal' none as admin. &nbsp;When I try the latter, I
 see the 'sytsem busy' cursor for a second, then nothing (no error message ether). &nbsp;I am not aware of any change in my system since it worked as it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In safe mode I could run sfc/scannow, and open its log (lacking elevated cmd). The program finished with reporting that it had found but could not fix some corrupt system files. In the log these lines may refer to some issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to resume suspended COM objects. [HRESULT = 0x80004015]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to initialize all COM objects, ignore the failure since service is shutting</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed during startup processing, continuing with Trusted Installer execution [HRESULT = 0x80070bc2]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQM: Failed to start upload with file pattern: C:\Windows\servicing\sqm\*_std.sqm, flags: 0x2 [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQM: Failed to start standard sample upload. [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;SQM: Failed to start upload with file pattern: C:\Windows\servicing\sqm\*_all.sqm, flags: 0x6 [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQM: Failed to start always sample upload. [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]</p>
<p>CBS SQM: Warning: Failed to upload all unsent reports. [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startup: Failed to initiate a rollback transaction. A restart will be performed, prior to trying again. [HRESULT = 0x8000ffff - E_UNEXPECTED]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registry value for the force canceled transactions is not available. Resetting. [HRESULT = 0x80070490 - ERROR_NOT_FOUND]</p>
<p>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed during startup processing, continuing with Trusted Installer execution [HRESULT = 0x800f0923]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Automatic Repair’ also reported to have found but unable to fix some problems, while, however, ‘MS Fixit’ said the system is fine nothing to repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise the laptop works perfect and I can't clearly define what I can or cannot do of what requires administrator privilege.</p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

<p>Change your email address and take good care not to let others know your email address unless they need to know. When you order things on line do not accept offers about future literature. Always uncheck relevant boxes. Never respond to spam. By replying
 you confirm to the other person they have a valid email address.</p>

            Unfortunately there is no good solution for spam once it has started. &nbsp;One thing that you can try is to set filters to block certain email addresses that are sending spam. &nbsp;What email client are you using (Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, Windows 8 Mail App, Thunderbird,
 etc.)? &nbsp;I can send you instructions on how to set the filter once I know that.
<div><br />
<div>One suggestion that I would make is whenever you are signing up for something and you don't want to give them your real email address (I use this for almost anything that I sign up for) is www.mailinator.com. &nbsp;This is a great tool... just pick an address
 that you would like to use (like say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; although I would use something that is a little less popular so that it is easier to find my email), use that as the address as the signup email address, then go the mailinator.com, type *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 into the "check email" box, find the confirmation email that you need to click, and congratulations! &nbsp;You just successfully signed up for an account and ensured that you will not receive spam! &nbsp;:)</div>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no standalone installer for Movie Maker. The whole Windows Essentials installer is needed to install Movie Maker, although you can opt to install your preferred Essentials programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still want to troubleshoot the installation issue, please refer to this thread for the troubleshooting steps:</p>

    <title>Turn 10 and Forza 7 Moderator. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viewinggem5698  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn 10 and Forza 7 Moderator.</h2>
                    <p>So recently a mod has been going around on the Turn 10/Forza Forums and censoring/banning people who use apparent "abusive" language, however they have not set a reason for the moderation as required by their own guidelines when muting, editing, banning, or censoring a post. Adding onto this there have been multiple reports of this same moderator censoring posts by completely removing the topic and/or deleting the post altogether for no other reason justifiable than they simply don't like it. I'm currently unable to provide any sources into this as the posts in question have since been deleted by this same moderator, and when I used my account to post about a bug in their recent game, it was swiftly banned for having "abusive" language in it, though it was never proven and there's no way to fight this.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I for one find this to be a blatant misuse of power and a blatant disregard for the legalities surrounding freedom of expression, opinion, speech, and criticism. To be banned for nothing other than the whim of one self-entitled moderator is beyond the scope of violating their own Terms of Service, but can also be grounds for legal action. I have since tried contacting Turn 10 directly about these matters but have so far been ignored.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I understand that this has nothing directly to do with Microsoft, but if they're going to support a platform or company that employs these types of people who show complete disregard for not only their own TOS but also international law then something needs to be done. So far there hasn't been a concrete amount of evidence for a legal case, but if things continue with how they are, and this moderator in question goes unpunished, action will have to be taken, and as seen in the case of Digital Homicide vs Jim Sterling and the current Alex Mauer vs Imagos, this is a very real possibility and is not only a lengthy process, but also extremely expensive.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Since I'm unable to contact Microsoft nor Turn 10 directly about this issue, my only other option is to write a forum post here in the hopes it might be noticed, as posting on the Turn 10 forums has so far ended with my posts being edited by this mod, or removed entirely. In the interest of protection however, I cannot name this moderator, but that doesn't mean they'll be hard to find. They have been active in several recent bannings.</p>

            <blockquote>

 </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately this isn't an in-game ban, but rather a forum ban. It may seem like a petty thing to complain about, but as with a lot of things, if nobody speaks up about it, eventually the right to do so will be removed. As I said, I've attempted contacting both Turn 10 and Microsoft directly about this troublesome mod, but on the Microsoft Live Chat I was told to contact them by email, and Turn 10 on both their Social Media platforms and customer support addresses fall dead because of how much traffic they get. Contacting Live Support again basically yielded the same results, as there's nothing directly they can do. As I said, posting directly on the Turn 10 Forums has just lead to my account eventually being banned with no reason given, and all topics and posts I've made about the subject have been deleted or heavily editted. There is also a person claiming to be me and causing even more trouble now which has incited another mod to come and edit their posts as well, so it's gradually getti

            1. If you have more than 1 hard drive, make sure you <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are installing to the boot one.<br />
2. Unplug any USB drive, card, or other storage device<br />
3. make sure your mobo's BIOS is up to date<br />
4. make sure install Dvd is clean<br />

            Its possible your optical drive could be faulty. If you can, temporarily change the disk drive to see if you can get the OS to install.

            I've tried that.&nbsp; I don't get the "install" option.<br />
<br />
Instead it says the app is already installed...except when I click the icon, nothing happens and it doesn't give the option to "run as administrator" either.

<h2>            How to get a valid digital licence for a recovered ISO Windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>- I have a <strong>valid Windows 7 Product Key</strong>.</p>
<p>- I submitted the Windows 10 upgrade <strong>request in 2016</strong> and received the Microsoft notification that
<strong>my request was being processed</strong>.</p>
<p>- I <strong>waited for months</strong>, but did not received the upgrade link from MS.</p>
<p>- Then I recently heard about the expiration time and hurried up to upgrade somehow.</p>
<p>- I tried the upgrade spending many hours via some procedures in the forum, but always
<strong>getting issues and totally stuck during the installation</strong>.</p>
<p>- So, because of the expiration, in <strong>Dec/2017 I decided to download the Windows 10 ISO from MS site and install via USB</strong>. So, the installation worked.</p>
<p>- Now, I have been receiving a notification in Windows 10 that I <strong>need to put a valid digital licence</strong>!</p>
<p>- I want to buy the Office 365, but I am afraid it won't work in this scenario.</p>

            Hi Ricardo.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where did you submit this Upgrade request?  I've never heard of that.  Digital Licenses are assigned when you do the qualified Upgrade or Clean Install and insert the old Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key.   The normal free Upgrade expired almost two years ago.
<br />
<br />There are reports that the free methods in this link have been extended:  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-...</a>
<br />
<br />There are also reports that inserting the old OS Product Key to activate is still working, so you can try that first. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I submitted the request via "Windows Upgrade icon" appearing in the Task Bar. As far as I recall, it was in 2016, maybe even earlier! Not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the old OS Product Key, I am following Andre's recommendation.</p>

<br />
<br />That was only to go ahead with the Upgrade from Windows 7, not assign a Digital License any other way.

            You currently have Windows 10 home Installed and the error code says no valid license could not be found.
<br />As per:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10738/...</a>
<br />
<br />You might see this error if you entered an invalid product key or a product key for a different version of Windows.
<br /> 
<br />Enter a valid product key that matches the version and edition of Windows 10 installed on your device.
<br />What was the edition of Windows 7 key? Professional, Ultimate or something else?

<p>Hi Sumit, Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a "<em>Sony Vaio - Windows Vista Home Premium OEMAct</em>", with a free migration to a
<em>Windows 7 Home</em> at the time I bought my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was instructed by Microsoft support to call this number 1800-642-7676 and ask to
<strong>connect supplementary support </strong>and they will check my previous Product Key
<strong>and provide me the Valid digital license key</strong>. My key was checked and there is no block on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I give you here my previous Product Key here, are you going to be able to provide me the valid digital licence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<h2>            XBOX ONE ON COMMAND NOT WORKING</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi all, not aware if there is another thread on here so I will start a new one.</span></p>
<p><span>my Xbox one on command is not working, I have everything set up as it should be. I have recalibrated the Kinect, made sure all setting are checked ( wake up Xbox with command ) I have
 even changed the location to&nbsp;US but still wont work. its not just me with this issue, have a quick look on Google and it seems a lot are having the very&nbsp;same problem. all other commands &nbsp;work. I have spoken to a Microsoft agent and she has advised me that
 a update is required, but she said the update probably wont arrive until the 3rd/4th quarter of this year.... This is a major selling point&nbsp;for the Xbox one, they even advertise this on the television, but it simply&nbsp;doesn't work. I have&nbsp;had it working maybe
 once in about 100 attempts at this command.&nbsp;Has anyone got a solution to this problem, or maybe you are experiencing this&nbsp;problem.?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi there try a console reboot keep your finger on the power button for 5 seconds or until the light on the power brick turns orange. Then reboot the system to see if that helps. Also try speaking very clearly when you say "Xbox on" if your not speaking clearly
 it will not work.</p>

<p>Does it fail all the time or only some of the time? &nbsp;When it fails, can you simply manually turn it on with the controller or with the power button? &nbsp;Also do you notice if the xbox one power light comes on briefly and then goes out?</p>

<p>The forums are riddled with this issue. Xbox on is broke....You will drive yourself crazy over this, its a software issue MS needs to fix. &nbsp;best to just wait for an update, problem is no one knows when that will occur and MS has been tight lipped on this.
 Save your sanity, use the power button, a Logitech harmony or the controller. </p>

<p>I have powered the xbox one down unplugged for 1 minute. Still not working, it's worked maybe 1 in about 50 attempts. I can power it on straight away with my controller and direct from the xbox. Me and the &nbsp;Microsoft agent went through everything that we
 could think of and still not working..... other commands work just xbox on..... strange! &nbsp;It has to be a software issue due to the other command's working when it's on.</p>

<p>@PrimitiveMeat, yes im well aware it's a software issue mate. It's just annoying me, this is my second xbox one with kinect issue's, and yet MS still has it advertising on the television ( xbox on) and straight away it's on..I'm thinking of making the very
 same advert, that consists of a man yelling at his xbox until he admits defeat and just grabs his controller.Lol</p>

<h2>            Intel graphic driver issues and black screen when power conncted&#47;disconnected</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I own Surface Pro 3 for about a year. It on 16-18-th refresh cycle and it second replacement device so far (and probably last one since warranty is out). I had issues with graphic driver crushing in MS collections solitaire and during any video playback
 (just video file, streaming....). I went to online support and they found bunch of corrupted files and "fixed" them. Subsequent refresh took 5 hours to complete. 3 of them on 0% advancement. I could bring my tablet to MS store which is in 60 km from me while
 it still was stuck. </p>
<p>Fix for a driver problem was new driver from Intel website. I have no issues with device crushing during video playback, however there is new issue : when you connect or disconnect power cord. screen turns black for couple of seconds.</p>
<p>Did someone experienced similar issues? Is there are a fix. One not involving refresh or reformat?</p>
<p>Frankly I spent 1.5-2 working weeks of my time on getting tablet together after refresh cycle. This is unacceptable.</p>

            <p>Hello Tony_MC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your query regarding the screen turning black after connecting/disconnecting the charger from your Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sounds as if the Intel driver that you downloaded hasn't correctly configurated itself on the Surface Pro 3. In this case I would suggest downloading the specific drivers for Surface Pro 3 and use those to correct the functionality of the Surface Pro
 3.</p>
<p>You can find the drivers from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and the correct pack to download is SurfacePro3_Win10_151026_2.msi for Windows 10
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the end results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

            I had constant driver crushes with consequent program shut down which was resolved by Microsoft Store technician (on January 2 2016)&nbsp; through installation of latest Intel graphic driver. therefore installing Up to date MS Surface Pro 3 driver will roll
 my system back to problems. I already had latest MS provided driver obtained&nbsp; via update and/or separate download. While having it i had constant app and software crushes .&nbsp; So i am won't rush trying old driver again.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In this case then, there is no other than to wait newer driver update as the Intel driver you are using isn't made for the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>I would still recommend reinstalling the Surface Pro 3 drivers and if the earlier issues reappear, you can then of course install the Intel driver again.</p>

            <p>Through countless tech supporters from answer desk (Kudos to all of them), they have installed the latest driver which solved the brightness issue but the stop code error comes up an hour later and crashes my computer again! The original version:&nbsp;10.0.14393.0
 will not cause the laptop to crash (at least from my prolonged use with that version), but will annoyingly have the brightness at max... I checked and the setting was already on the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter. I rolled back the driver for ease of use
 despite the annoyance of the brightness. The troubleshooter only said that windows is set to never install updates as I presume manual input or automatic will not affect it since the tech supporter did not activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the answer, but I indeed require more assistance as the updated driver does not seem to function without fault.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Skype needs your attention&#34; on Android. Security risk&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, my phone buzzed with a notification from Skype saying "Skype needs your attention". I was wondering what that could be, and why specifically me if I've logged out and my phone
<em>shouldn't</em> remember my login details. I double tapped it, Skype loaded, and asked for my login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little later, while having Skype running on my Desktop computer, when a message was sent to me, my phone would buzz again with "Skype needs your attention". My suspicions were confirmed as to that even if I Sign Out of Skype, and tell it to "Sign Out of
 all MS accounts", And close the app, Skype is in some way still running and logged in in the background. How else would it know to tell me that I've received a message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer experts around the world always say to log out of any account you are not using to avoid being hacked. I do this on the stationary computers quite often, but vigorously on my mobile devices because those are easier to steal. Even if one needs to
 log in when one launches Skype, if those login details are still hiding in a cache file somewhere, who is to say that can't be hacked and abused? No wonder I've been getting spam messages from my friends, who in turn change their passwords, but maybe in vain
 if those login details are never truly cleared when logging out or quitting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me doubt that Microsoft actually takes security seriously. It's bad enough that I have to be constantly logged into Google to use Android fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>/Edward</p>

<p>Ok, was kinda busy for a while, but I'm doing the steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>I logged in to get Skype running, and almost immediately it "needed my attention".</li><li>I exchanged a few words</li><li>I logged out, checked "Sign out of all my Microsoft accounts"</li><li>I tapped the Task Bar so I got all applications tabbed, and closed Skype.</li><li>I asked that someone type something while I had logged out. He did and nothing was announced.</li></ul>
<p>Guess something got fixed while I was absent from my mobile Skype. Glad I won't be woken at 3 in the morning by random Skype chatter.</p>

<br />
Before doing any driver updates, can you please follow the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/49e45609-cb57-98de-43e8-8b1cdb9f081d/change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a> to see if changing the screen resolution will get you the monitor's full display size.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Driver updates for Windows 10 and many devices (such as monitors, printers, and video cards) are automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update. While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're
 having trouble with a device, you can try fixing it by updating the driver or reinstalling it. Click on this

LINK</a> to see how.<br />
<br />
If suggested steps above won't work, you can try to search for compatible driver from the manufacturer's website.<br />

Let me know if any of these helps. <br />

            <p>Hi Guillermo,<br />
<br />
Let's try another procedure. If you are using an ATI Graphics Card, configuring the
<strong>Scaling Options</strong> might fix that. Please the follow the suggestions from Duncan E on this

<h2>            Windows Update fails and error code 0x800F0906</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Update | Directplay</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, I have a Windows 8.1 computer, and I am currently trying to enable the "Directplay" feature under Windows Features "turn a feature off or on". When I check the box, a Windows Update window pops up and it asks to download the necessary files. When
 I click yes, it'll load for a bit and then begin the download. However, the download bar never moves, it gets stuck and a few mins later I get a message that says the download has failed and it asks me to try again. My internet connection is fine so it's not
 because Windows Update is losing connection. Does anyone know what causes this and how I can fix this? I am so fed up with this right now that I am seriously thinking of going back to windows 7. Never had any trouble there. Thanks :) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Along with the message after it fails, it says I am not connected to the internet. I have checked my connection through the process several times and that definitely cannot be the problem. I get an error code "0x800F0906"</p>

<h2>            Games purchased online and downloaded disappear.</h2>
                    
<p>In the last week or so, I've purchased two games from xbox one from the online store. Both games went into my queue, showed as installing, but once installation completed, disappeared. They don't show up in my apps and games. What gives?</p>

<p>Hey there&nbsp;MrMacDaddy71,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about the issue. Could you post up what the two games are you experiencing this with? Also, when you have some time set aside, I would suggest trying out these troubleshooting steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Power cycle your Xbox One console</span></a><span> by&nbsp;holding the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;button on the front of the console for approximately 10 seconds.</span>
</li><li><span>Once your console is completely off, unplug&nbsp;the console from the power source and give it a few minutes.</span>
</li><li><span>Then, plug all the cords back in and </span><span>turn the console back on.</span>
</li><li><span>Sign-in to your profile and check to see if those missing games are now listed within Games &amp; Apps.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>If the steps above don't seem to do the trick for you, please post back and let us know. Thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you have been running into these issues with the Xbox One console. Now after going through the support page "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I get an
 error message when&nbsp;I run the Test network connection on Xbox One</a>" does state that it could be an issue with the consoles internal wireless adapter and that the console might need to be serviced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when you try to connect to your Hotspot does that work perfectly fine as far as it actually getting you online? If you are able to connect with the Hotspot then I would advise that you Reach out to your ISP to see if they are able to walk through the
 troubleshooting with you to see if there is anything that you are missing. </p>
<p>Other than connecting to the Hotspot have you also attempted to connect anywhere else? Maybe a family members home, or a friends house so that we can test and see if the issue could be on the console or if its coming from the Routers side.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>
<p>

            Hello!<br />
<br />
The first thing I would try is a hard reset on the console to see if that clears anything up, just press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds then power it back on.&nbsp; After that also just reboot your networking equipment for good measure.&nbsp; Which security
 protocol are you using?&nbsp; Hopefully it's WPA2 (Personal), if not I would change it to that.&nbsp; You could also try creating a new wireless network ID (SSID) and a new password to see if that makes any difference. &nbsp;

</p><p>Uninstalling the Skype app and reinstalling it wont affect on how you sign in to the Skype app. The issue is the sign in details that you are using, you will need to make sure that you are using the correct
<strong>Skype name</strong> (username) or <strong>email address </strong>to sign in. On your laptop, just select your profile picture and look for your Skype name, use it to sign in to your&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;desktop app. Now, if the password&nbsp;did not&nbsp;recognize, you can
 try to reset your password using this FAQ link: <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa95/how-do-i-change-or-reset-my-password-for-skype?q=reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I change or reset my password for Skype?</a></strong></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 audio only sporadically works after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twwva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 audio only sporadically works after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>For a year the&nbsp;audio on my&nbsp;Surface Pro 3 running Windows 8.1 worked just fine, in and out of the surface pro 3 dock, through the Surface's speakers, a Dell U3014's speakers (via HDMI)&nbsp;and/or through Backbeat Fit Bluetooth headphones. I was always impressed
 with how seamless it worked in&nbsp;this configuration using several playback devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all of that seamlessness went away after&nbsp;the Windows 10 upgrade. The audio has become a frustrating disaster---sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I can restart and then it will work, other times it just remains silent, in which case&nbsp;the
 playback devices will say they are working, and&nbsp;display activity on their graphical meters,&nbsp;but no sound. I have tried numerous suggestions on the internet and this community. Nothing works *permanently,* it always reverts to no sound about 75% of the time.
 If I stay out of the dock it does seem to work more reliably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a real fix to get audio back to its reliability under Windows 8.1?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have (multiple times) uninstalled / reinstalled the device manager for both the Realtek Audio (Surface Speakers)&nbsp;and the Intel Display Audio (Dell U3014, HDMI Digital Jack), set each as Default devices (many times)&nbsp;in the Sound &gt; Playback window.&nbsp; I've
 played with the Default Formats selected for the Dell U3014 under Advanced. At one point I put additional focus on reinstalling the Intel Display&nbsp;Audio and trying lots of different properties there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most consistent pattern seems to be if I restart and immediately start playing something (such as iTunes) it will work&nbsp;(with any of the playback devices) until the computer goes to sleep. However if the Bluetooth headset it used then it in will longer
 work on the Intel Display Audio. In other words, if I start playing something on the Intel Display Audio soon after the computer is restarted it will work on the Dell monitor. On the other hand, if I restart and wait, run various applications (e.g. Edge, Excel,
 Outlook, etc) and then try to play something (e.g. in Edge or iTunes) it will not work on Intel Display Audio but will usually work on the Realtek Audio or Bluetooth headset.</p>

<h2>            hid mouse driver is corrupted, driver update says is most current</h2>
                    A toshiba laptop has any mouse/touch pad input has stopped working.<br />
Device manager lists several HID compliant devices as having problems.<br />
&nbsp;When I click on device, it says driver is corrupted.&nbsp; When I try to update, windows says that I have the most current driver.<br />
I have tried several different mouses and track balls along with the touch pad.&nbsp; Even the wireless keyboard does not work.&nbsp; the laptop keyboard does work.<br />
The mouses and trackball were working on other computers.<br />
How do I fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
Thanks<br />
Jeff<br />

            You will have problems finding the HID drivers as a download.&nbsp; They are built-in to the Windows system files.<br />
<br />
You might need to do a SFC / scannow in order to fix these:<br />
