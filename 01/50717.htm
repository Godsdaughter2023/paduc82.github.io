<h2>            Console repair status &#34;cancelled&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I sent in my Xbox One about a week ago for repair. When I checked the repair status today it read as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>✔Your replacement device has been shipped</p><p>✔Your order was cancelled</p><p>✔Thank you! Your order is complete&nbsp;</p><p>Does anyone know of any reason why&nbsp;it would say "Your order was cancelled"? I never cancelled the order and I'm&nbsp;pretty sure you can't even cancel the order once Microsoft received and processed it. It's kind of confusing.</p>

    <title>Why making Xbox360 to play iTunes music files is important - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why making Xbox360 to play iTunes music files is important</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.<br />
I apologize if this is not the right section on the forum to post about this issue.<br />
<br />
I'm aware this is a well-known problem, still I would like Microsoft to reconsider its position.</p>
<p>Right now Xbox360 does not play music files bought on iTunes platform (.m4a).<br />
This is a major problem, not only for me.<br />
I have a 40GB music collection bought on iTunes; none of this music is playable on Xbox360, but you can play it normally on any other Microsoft platform by default, including Windows Phone.<br />
I know I can convert my .m4a audio library on .mp3, but it will result in a mess: thousands of duplicates files to reorder, manually.<br />
I would buy Xbox Music Pass, but I can not stream the music while playing on Xbox360, because Xbox Music is a separate App, so it is useless for me now.<br />
Also considering I only have 3.5Mb download, I do not feel confortable to reduce further my bandwidth while playing online.<br />
<br />
I know I can buy music on Xbox Music, but only on Windows8 systems, and I'm still stuck on Windows7.<br />
However the problem remain: I have a serious music library that can be played everywhere (including PS3) except on Xbox360.<br />
<br />
Do not underestimated this issue because is widespread and many users are complaing about that: just do a simple search on the internet.<br />
<br />
For this reason I demand that Microsoft reconsiders its position about this matter, making music bought on iTunes playable on Xbox360.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>I dont think making demands is going to fix your issue. MS would have to make the audio format compatible with the 360. As of now it is not and probably wont be any time soon as MS has its own music streaming service and wouldnt want to encourage you using
 a competitior</p>

<p>hi compatibility is really hard &nbsp;for music because they have mp3, wma, AVV, M4a, mp4 (ect.) here is a way everyone can use (xbox, windows media player, itunes, ect.) change every song to file format mp3 so it can work on itunes and xbox. now why the xbox
 dont accept AVV is because it is made by apple and they are rival companies (like when i put an ipod in a windows computer windows media player dose not read it because of them being rivals now sony dont have a diff with apple so they can read AVV. hope that
 helped :D</p>

<p>You can play music you have downloaded from iTunes as long as it doesn't have Apple's DRM on them. You will need to download the Optional Media Update -

<p>You can't stream iTunes through to the Xbox 360 but if you wanted to stream them you could use TVersity instead of iTunes to send them to your Xbox.</p>

<p>Hello, and thank you for answering.<br />
<br />
I'm aware Microsoft and Apple are competitors in the digital music market, still making Xbox360 not able to play iTunes files is a big issue for a lot of users.<br />
Every song bought on iTunes has a sort of DRM, but you can play those files everywhere, except Xbox360.<br />
<br />
I can not convert my library with iTunes because we are not talking about hundreds of albums.<br />
When iTunes converts files to mp3 format, they are placed in the same folder of the original m4a, so you can imagine the mess and the dublicate files on iTunes that after I have to delete manually.<br />
So I have to buy a 3rd party software to do that, and repeat the task for every song I buy.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to point out that even Sony and Apple are digital music competitors, still PS3 and PS VITA play iTunes music without problem.<br />
Microsoft even provides a software to sync Windows Phone with your iTunes library, including playlists.<br />
<br />
Finally I can NOT buy Xbox Music Pass, because as I already stated I can not use it while playing, as custom soundtrack, so it has not use for me now.<br />
<br />
As for "streaming" my iTunes library I have plenty of options, but thank you for the advise.<br />
<br />
I believe the fact Xbox360 does not play iTunes music file is a big problem for many users.<br />
Microsoft is delivering a disservice to every custumers, based on a corporate stance that I doubt will have benefit, except putting Xbox360 in a bad light.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>I really do not care about Apple devices incompatibility: I only use an iPod Touch for music and movies.<br />
<br />
My problem is here, on Xbox360, a platform where has been decided not to play iTunes music files, while in every other Microsoft systems is possible without fuss.<br />
<br />
I bought on iTunes because it has been the first serious digital store for music, and, up to these days, it has the more extensive catalog (I'm not into "mainstream" music, so this very important for me).</p>
<p>At the moment I can not buy on Xbox Music because I have not Windows8.</p>
<p>Also I would like to pay a small fee, if necessary, to make Xbox360 compatible with iTunes music files, avoiding all the hassle of converting my library and keeping 2 music libraries updated.</p>

<p>Hi I seem to have had success in the past by enabling hard drive mode on my apple devices, I also have the optional media update installed.</p>
<p>To enable hard drive mode simply tick the box next time you sync your apple device to a PC/Mac</p>

<br />
I'm afraid though that at this point it is not possible to play those files, due to restrictions of the file format. &nbsp;I can understand why converting them all may be difficult, but honestly to get them to play on the console that may be your best bet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problems running Microsoft games Jigsaw, Mahjong etc Microsoft Mahjong is currently not available in your account. Here&#8217;s the error code, in case you need it&#58; 0x803F8001</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday the Jigsaw game stopped working and I received a similar message to above . Now I'm getting the same for Mahjong.</p>
<p>I tried removing Jigsaw app from the computer and reinstalling it but the Apps Store won't allow it. The icon appears in the Start menu but does not do anything and I cannot remove it.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with a corrupted file on the PC but I have exactly the same issues when trying to play these games on my laptop. Clearly the problem is at the Microsoft end but how can I get Microsoft to do anything?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both PCs are running Windows 10</p>

<p>But when I search for known new messages, I can see them.</p>
<p>This is going on since quite a while.</p>
<p>Many people asking this question.</p>
<p>This problem has survived a reinstall of windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I've two email accounts -- both are associated with my windows account.</p>
<p>One at sbcglobal.net which is my main windows account email.</p>
<p>The other one is outlook.com and is my secondary email also associated with the same windows account.</p>
<p>I'm using my windows account for login on this windows 8.1 machine.</p>
<p>I'm synching both email accounts on my windows phone without a problem.</p>
<p>The sbcglobal.net email syncs fine.</p>

<h2>            Computer Reset, Now Windows 10 Minecraft is Not Owned by Me.</h2>
                    A while ago when Microsoft gave Java owners a free copy of Minecraft for Windows 10 I redeemed my code. The game was installed and I could play it. Now, after factory resetting my computer, the Microsoft store does not think I own the game. I claimed the
 code on&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">28 November, 2015</span>&nbsp;and would now like to be able to download and play it again. Please help me, seeing as how I do not want to purchase another copy of Minecraft.

            Hello Bryce1000000, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor. Factory resetting your computer does reset your computer to factory setting and may restore your past purchases and delete data as it should state and warn you that it will before doing so.
<br /> As a possible resolution, I would suggest restarting your windows store by:
<br />1.  Press the “Win Logo” + “R”
<br />2. Type: WSReset.exe and press “Enter”.
<br />3. Restart the computer and check.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend as another method for you to run the Windows app troubleshooter for Windows 10.
<br />Follow the link below:                                         
<br />Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/r...</a>
<br />
<br />Also, right-clicking start and select Run and type. "WSReset.exe" and then open up the store and signed out, after that, close out the store, and sign into a local account under user settings. Once done so, sign back into the store and u should be good. 
<br />
<br />I hope these methods help try doing them one after another and see which method will resolute your issue as they all may be helpful. Thank you and I hope you can get your game back. Let us know if you need help with anything else or if these methods didn't help. Thank you, best regards- Irisdiel H.

<h2>            my laptop won&#39;t boot up at all, is it confirmed dead&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I was using my laptop when the screen suddenly froze into a blue screen of death with stopcode BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO. After restarting the laptop, I found that it wouldn't boot up and fiddled with the recovery options(automatic repair, safe mode,
 system restore, reset and CMD commands chkdsk and sfc /scannow). However, none seem to work and gave me other error messages for each of the recovery options. Currently, I've disabled automatic repair to see if I could end the loop but I simply end up with
 another error message claiming my system registry file WINDOWS/system32/config/system is corrupted or missing(error code 0xc0000225). Does anyone know a way to save my laptop? ;(</p>

            Hi ZombiePeggy 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive.

<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<p>hello. I am having a terrible time trying to figure out how to connect my xbox 360 to my wifi PC without using any cables so i can browse the internet on my 360. when i go to windows media center from my xbox 360 dashboard it tells me i need to go to xbox.com/pcsetup
 to setupd windows on my xbox and enter a pin, but everytime i go there i just get a bunch of information that doesnt have anything to do with entering a pin and im lost. where do i go to enter this 8 digit pin?</p>

<p>i think i need a different version of windows media center, all the videos on youtube show it having a "tasks" option to go to and click "add extender" but my version doesnt have the tasks option at all, and i dont know which version to get and i dont want
 to pay for the wrong version, can someone please send me a download link for the correct version of windows media center so i can connect it to my 360?</p>

<p>This only works if you have a Windows computer preferably Windows 7. What you need to do is click on the start button (Windows button) on the bottom left of your screen then click/mouse over "All Programs" and Windows Media Center should be there, or to
 simplify the search just type in Windows Media right below the "All Programs" tab. Hope that helped :)</p>

<h2>            Card Reader, WPD File system volume driver, code 10 </h2>
                    Used to have a Vista system with windows 7 upgrade on top, and the card reader worked with no problems, done a full clean install of windows 7, the card reader shows up four times (once for each slot in the card reader) "Device cant start code 10" "WPD
 file system volume driver". If I for example put a Memory stick card in to the slot, it then shows up in my computer as a usable drive to read and write from.

<p>The external USB card reader that I keep with my camera also has the same problem. This worked just fine with XP and Vista on this PC, the internal card reader that used to be in this PC also worked just fine under XP and Vista as well as Windows 7 which
 was installed over the top of Vista.</p>
<p>I have checked for new drivers for the new card reader, the are none for Windows 7, so there shouldn't be any issue here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like I've solved it, went into computer management, disk manager and found that there weren't actually any drive letters assigned to the card reader. It seed that when media was put in, windows assigned a drive letter automatically, once the media
 was ejected the assigned letter was taken away, this was causing the error WPD error 10, so I've manually set a drive letter for each slot on the card reader all the errors are now gone.</p>

 this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did you make any recent

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check if "Windows Management Instrumentation" service is running, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Login
 as administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on start, type services.msc in the start search box and hit enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Scroll
 down for Windows Management Instrumentation service and check if it is started.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 no then right click on it and click start.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 it is already started, you can stop the service and start again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
If that doesn’t help, then try running system file checker and see if it helps, here is the link:<br />

            No worries at all! That is fantastic you’re able to donate machines like that. I also take laptops, reimage them and find families (with children) in need so I can help them out. It’s not much, but I figure I know how to do this stuff and it’s a decent way of giving back :-) - you’re awesome, keep up the great work!<br /><br />So there are 2 ways you could go about this. <br /><br />1. When the laptop turns on, press the F11 key rapidly, depending on the model/BIOS depends on what screen you’ll see, but you should see something to the affect of system recovery. If you follow the prompts, there be a way to go to out of the box factory settings and the laptop will be good to go. <br /><br />2. If that doesn’t pan out, you can do a windows Reset. <br /><br /> Start &gt; Settings<br /><br />Click on Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery <br /><br />Once in that tab, click on “Get Started” under Reset this PC. <br /><br />This should take a moment, and you’ll be prompted to “Keep my f

<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.

<p>My suggestion was to <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> use Setup.exe at all to install the driver.

<p>
</p><p>Install the driver manually using the<strong> .INF </strong>file&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Windows 8 driver folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to this Dlink driver below, using File Explorer, pick the driver folder (32bit or 64bit)&nbsp;that matches your version of Windows. Right&nbsp;click the .inf file- select Install.</p>

                    <p>A small but annoying problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I restart my computer it will switch from my Australian keyboard to the UK one. How do I stop this happening?</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's annoying because the UK keyboard has different keys e.g. the \ key.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Does it end up showing an error message or an error code?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.<br />
</strong>If you are using a CD to install this game, copy the contents of CD to desktop and then running the setup from there.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2. </strong><strong>Restart the computer by using a clean startup procedure</strong><br />
When you start Microsoft Windows, other software may start automatically together with the operating system. These programs and services can include antivirus software and system utilities that may interfere with the game. When you perform a clean restart,
 you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</div>
<div><br />
For more information about how to perform a clean startup procedure, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br />
<strong>Perform a clean startup to determine whether background programs are interfering with your game or program</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Once you are done with this method make sure you return the computer to normal state as suggested in the article above under the section<strong>"How to return windows to a normal startup".</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3. </strong><strong>Delete the contents of the temporary folder in Windows<br />
</strong>To delete the contents of the temporary folder in Windows, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, type %temp% in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. <br />
2. On the Organize menu, click Select All.<br />
3. On the Organize menu, click Delete.<br />
4. Click Yes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
If the issue still persists refer to the methods listed in the article below:</div>

<h3> sanei7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to internet or update drivers after June update</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I use a lenovo v110-15ast laptop on windiws 10 and have installed the june update for windows 10. After this, windows security centre notified me that a driver is outdated but would not update on its own. So after ~3hrs of searching I used the official
 Lenovo system updater which told me that there were 8 driver updates required and 1 BIOS update. I double-checked that all of these updates were for my model and proceeded with the updates everything updated sucessfully apart from the LAN and WLAN drivers.
 I found thise drivers from the offical Lenovo website again and manually installed them both of the drivers failed to install again. Just in case, the drivers failled to install on the C: drive but there is also a D: drive (labeled 'LENOVO') where the rest
 of the drivers are including the (guessing) old WLAN and LAN drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and the BIOS version I currently have installed is labeled as '1PCN70WW'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution is a welcome one but I would rather keep my files&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi  Sanei7
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started.
<br />
<br />I also recommend you try upgrading to the latest version of Windows 10, 1903:
<br />
<br />Go to the following page then click 'Update Now'

</p><p>Based on your post, it seems that you are using&nbsp;your school's VPN or internet connection and using different devices.&nbsp;Skype detects this&nbsp;as an unusual activity. To secure and protect&nbsp;your account from fraud it is prompted to verify you as the owner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that Skype takes your account's security as top priority. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If indeed you are using your school's internet connection, we would suggest for you to get in touch with your school's&nbsp;IT department and request them not to restrict Skype access.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is recommended to use just a particular device to prevent frequent account verification.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>File menu in Edge web browser on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldguru  say:</h3>
<h2>            File menu in Edge web browser on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>How does one turn back on the file/edit/view/tools menus on the browser in windows 10? The alternate locations for this functionality seem scattered and obscured to the point of uselessness. E.g rapid use of the edit-&gt;select (surely we have not regressed
 back to 1993 and wordperfect style key combinations for this......). Equally the settings options I have found do not list everything that was in the tools menu...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reg key for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I really stinks that one has to go to another app&nbsp;to complain about something, which will be ignored there also if the past is an gage.&nbsp; I do not for a moment believe&nbsp;you understand&nbsp;a concern, and that&nbsp;this is just a canned replay.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;have reverted
 back to Firefox, which I had hoped to get&nbsp;away from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            It is very disappointing that the new Microsoft Edge does not allow you to right-click on a PDF file or provide any other way to save an online file to the destination folder of your choice with the name of your choice. It is also very disappointing that
 there is no Menu for File || Edit | View | Tools I Help .... like there used to be. Once again Microsoft is taking handy features away from us. The older IE&nbsp;was my default browser. Now I have set FireFox to my default browser, as have many other users that
 I have talked to in my professional community.

<p>&nbsp;I would go back to firefox but they do not have a 64 bit version and the 32 bit version keeps freezing up. what idiot decided we do not need a file menu?? way to go M$ another screwed up release.</p>

            <p>Edge is amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The look and feel is something out of the early 80's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The usability has to be the worst I've seen on anything calling itself a browser anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ... if you want to do basic things, like opening an html file ... be prepared for
 a research project to try and figure out what happened to the "File" menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Edge is just symptomatic of a trend in MSFT that has been evident since the introduction of the ribbon in office and the utter failure of Windows 8 that there appears to be no one left in MSFT with&nbsp; authority who has any relationship, concern or understanding
 for support or end users or their expectations of laptop and desktop software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently examined a new out of carton Lenovo thinkpad 10 Windows 10 tablet with keyboard dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite being a new product out of the carton with windows 10 pre-installed it proceeded to spend 11 hours installing windows updates, including an entirely new build of the operating system and following this and a vast number of reboots&nbsp; the keyboard dock
 ceased to function. Neither reinstalling drivers or any other obvious remedy caused the dock to function again. Indeed only the purchase of another (albeit folio type keyboard) allowed the device to function.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It decided despite being set for Ireland that no matter what once joined to a domain the keyboard would be unable to enter a \ (as in domain\username) and had to be removed and the onscreen keyboard utilised on each occasion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hideous and laughable tablet mode switch had to be disabled for each user account that logged onto it in turn. VPN clients installed crashed and there was no way top peconfigure hidden SSID wireless networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The configuration UI was appalling........the regional keyboard setting so charged from the win7 and preceding simple interface that support staff were familiar with to an over graphically rich&nbsp;&nbsp;mess that failed to function and was almost&nbsp; impossible to
 navigate given the incredibly difficult to use narrow vertical scroll bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither did screen scaling on RDP function well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course edge and live tiles ON A DOMAIN BUSINESS SETUP prompting for one drive and promoting a GAMES CONSOLE called an XBOX. Does MSFT wish to encourage domain business users to play video games and upload business confidential files to random cloud
 locations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've personally given up on MSFT. The only and last operating system product of theirs I will ever use is Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed I have alredy completed disk images of e.g Linux and android based RDP network clients and am undertaking function specific server builds or non MSFT products for specific network functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A dear friend of mind recently contacted me. A month earlier they had (prompted by endless nagging) upgraded a functional Win7 asus laptop to Win7. Their career necessary applications ceased to function and the incredibly poor search (how it has declined
 to the point of uselessness since 2000 pro) meant they could no longer effectively manage their files.&nbsp; When I informed them that it was to late to remove win10, they were actually reduced to tears. There appears to be an upsurge in SMEs being reduced to metaphorical
 rubble by the prompts to install windows 10 to an extent that I was pondering whether
</p>
<p>this has actually contributed to the surprisingly low US GDP figures this quarter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I assume the course windows has taken at this juncture is a deliberate strategy to alienate all remaining end users and IT professionals from Microsoft operating systems as part of some cunning plan we are yet to be aware of. I can't see any other purpose
 to software such as edge with a UI that is such a catastrophic&nbsp; and clearly deliberate failure to understand the usage requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a business operating system it is clearly a practical joke to include XBOX live tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why should I use an app to report my feedback by the way? Is this site not run by Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well done MS (ironic) you finally completed the circle by making something worse than OS/2 warp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just stop MS. You can't even do keyboards anymore. DOS was actually superior. Win 3.1 was light years ahead of Win10 in terms of the user acceptance I have witnessed of the interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As regards edge. A web browser designed for people who don't use computers in a&nbsp;professional capacity. Limited and regressive interface that actually mandates using a competitors product for a vast number of scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just stop. So evidentially in terminal decline at this point it is like watching a man die while spluttering obscenities provoked by a terminal mental disease. And that is what the edge UI and windows 10/8 is. An obscenity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No manager who was employed by MS during the evolution of win10/8 or those involved in soliciting product&nbsp; feedback could be&nbsp; taken seriously by me any more. Perhaps due to organisational rot their morale is so low they just don't care anymore.</p>
