<h2>            .tmp print files not deleting after print</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure how to continue the discussion on this subject from August 2017 but today my computer did a Windows 10 update. In addition to it taking about 4 hours where I could do nothing on my computer because the screen was oversized thus not allowing
 me to minimize it and continue working - another issue for another day, I began to have a problem with my wireless printer. I had no problems before this update.&nbsp; It is the same as has been previously reported - there seems to be some malware hiding out there
 in the guise of <strong>printfilterpipelinesvc.exe</strong> that won't allow the user, even with full admin privileges, to delete these odd files that have the .tmp extension.&nbsp; I read through the previous comments, did 2 reboots of both the laptop and the
 wireless printer but still had to go through the commands to stop the print spooler, clear the SPD files, restart the spooler, refresh the print dialog box to ensure the previous print job was cleared before starting another print job and the whole process
 all over again.&nbsp; Sorry not sure what happened in the Windows 10 update that I received and I surely would like to know how to get rid of this interloper.&nbsp; I have a separate anti-virus PLUS the Windows Defender, both of them stated there were no problems to
 be found - no virus, malware, etc., but obviously THAT is so NOT true!&nbsp; Only on a really old desktop connected to an equally old printer have I had to do this dance sequence of commands to clear the print spool, but I have never, NEVER, NOT been able to clear
 .tmp files from that queue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information:</p>
<p>&nbsp; I was working on printing saved Adobe pdf files (tax season), not an .XML extension.&nbsp; I tried to do a screen capture of the error message but that didn't work so the message was: File in Use&nbsp; PP6vlemz5py9xHazefw0wa0llc.TMP (this reference changes each
 time but hey play with the Hex and maybe find it)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The action can't be completed because the file is open in&nbsp;<strong>printfilterpipelinesvc.exe</strong></p>
<p>Then it gives the a Try again option or Cancel option - the Try again just keeps saying that so you have to Cancel trying to delete these files</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A solution <strong>please</strong> before I have to spend another 3 hours printing, clearing, printing, clearing.....You get the idea - I&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Marcia.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Windows Defender is a full antivirus now and should not be run alongside any other antivirus.  I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running the built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best. 
<br />
<br />Have you Clean Installed Windows 10 yet?  There is a reason why most enthusiasts will never run a factory or Upgrade install, because they'd expect endless issues like these.  I would  follow  the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Short of that you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />As to the printer Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.

<h3> dregus311  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Surface Pro 3 battery life is only 2-3 hrs since Nov time frame. Need help</h2>
                    <p>So starting in late Nov my Surface Pro 3 has had terrible battery life. To be honest battery life has been terrible for most of the time Windows 10 has been installed on it. I did a battery report last night and discovered that since the first week of Dec
 the battery degradation has quadrupled! I went from around 42K to last night it was 27K. &nbsp;I appear to have a damaged battery or something. I have been checking for things that cause the battery to drain fast while in use but I have only been web browsing and
 some pages do causes the Surface to go crazy with the fan. This is not all web sites but primarily news sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced these issues? Does anyone else have this same battery degradation issue? Lost almost half of its capacity in a month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Dregus311,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I myself would first recommend reinstalling the battery drivers:</p>
<p>1. Open Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Expand batteries and you should see two battery drivers named Microsoft AC adapter and Microsoft Surface ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the drivers and choose uninstall. There will be a warning text and it will ask if you want to delete the driver software from the device -
<strong>Do not mark the box</strong>.</p>
<p>4. After uninstalling the drivers, restart the Surface (not shut down).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this I would also redo the indexing of the Windows as the fan is also kicking in unnecessarily:</p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel</p>
<p>2. From top-right corner change the <strong>View by </strong>to Large icons and then choose
<strong>Indexing options</strong></p>
<p>3. Go to <strong>Advanced</strong> and then under troubleshooting choose <strong>
Rebuild</strong></p>
<p>4. Restart the Surface</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend to run the battery completely empty by going through the options to disable the sleep options and then keeping the Surface running to empty the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of these help you to better the battery life then you might need to go through recovery options as explained
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-or-reset-surface?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the issue still remain then you will need to contact the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Support</a> to replace your unit.</p>

    <title>Printer Driver problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old_hand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer Driver problem</h2>
                    <p>I've posted this to <strong><em>HP</em></strong>, but it seems their <strong><em>LaserJet Pro 1102w</em></strong> isn't at fault, neither are their drivers.</p>
<p>Basically, I had to re-install this printer because it just refused to do anything - the item just sat in the
<em>Print Queue</em>. To test the hardware, I plugged it into and installed it on my other, newer pc, and it was brilliant. A few minutes, and up and running, from the original
<strong><em>HP</em></strong> disk.</p>
<p><u>Back to the bad one</u>. Even uninstalling with <strong><em>HP</em></strong>'s downloaded software and trying to reinstall with it or the disk gave the same problem. It took the program ages to determine that the
<em>usb</em> was plugged in - all the usb software is OK, everything else is working&nbsp;. When it got going, the installer just kept running. It had said it
<u>loaded all the drivers</u> and software, yet <em>Windows</em> insisted that there were no drivers loaded. The
<em>Install</em> had to be stopped [no point leaving it going on forever for what should have been minutes]. So, there is the icon of "unidentified" printer in
<em>Control Panel</em>. Printer is useless.</p>
<p>I tried your related&nbsp;link from this page, earlier, when <em>Community</em> wouldn't let me
<em>log in</em>, but all I got was a list of commercial web pages.</p>

<p>As I pointed out, I have all the new drivers and the documentation from HP, and the 1102w works OK on my other pc.</p>

            <p>Well, I did everything:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <em>printui</em> wouldn't let me delete the "package" because this would remove the other,
<strong><em>HP 5440</em></strong> printer. <u>Should I do this</u>? I take it that the package is something of
<strong><em>HP</em></strong>'s. The other printer is OK.</p>
2. The Printers Folder under "spool" was empty.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When the <strong><em>1102w</em></strong> is plugged in, <em>Windows</em> doesn't see it, as it is supposed to do when any
<em>USB</em> device comes on board. It seems to be looking at a "Mass Storage Device", instead.&nbsp;That is why it won't let the program load.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over to you, again.</p>

<p>The whole thing is: I hadn't been printing for a few weeks; a few days ago, the little icon was in CP, ticked, but the
<strong><em>1102w</em></strong> wouldn't do anything. And my attempts to fix by re-installing have now led to
<em>Windows</em> not receiving any of the installation. And, of course, the USB isn't recognised.</p>
<p>If I can't fix this, I have a daunting option ahead of me: swap the 2 pcs, which will involve expensive hardware changes.</p>

            <p>It's <u>mea culpa</u> time.</p>
<p>I looked back through my pc log [I keep one for each pc] and noted that&nbsp;on <u>
March 31</u> I got a <em>blue screen</em>. This occurred when attempting to download
<strong><em>INTEL</em></strong> updates from them. It wasn't the updates but the supplier's
<em>Downloader</em> that caused the problem. I think it has upset&nbsp;the <em>Download</em> facility&nbsp;in
<strong><em>WINDOWS</em></strong>. This is why I got the message about not "checking"
<em>WD</em>s in <em>Update</em>, when they have never been unchecked. Because I haven't got a
<strong><em>Win 7</em></strong> disc or a full <em>Restore Image</em>, I may have to revert to
<em>Factory Setting</em>, in order to mend/replace whatever is damaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any advice.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for the advice, but the driver update problem was irrevocable. This is my last comment on all above, and I hope it may help others.</p>
<p>I had a 2009 vintage DVD <strong><em>Win 7</em></strong> Bundle that I bought to update my old
<em>XP</em> 32-bit pc [now gone]. It had 2 disks: 32- and 64-bit, so I installed the latter&nbsp;to replace my damaged o/s [and it didn't complain that the existing one was newer]. Obviously, it is older than the nailed-in one
<strong><em>HP</em></strong> supplied&nbsp;with the computer, but it's OK for a&nbsp;spare to my newer pc.
<em>WINDOWS old</em> kept all my <em>Win</em> documents, programs, etc. But, if I hadn't had another pc, I couldn't have found the Ethernet driver to get connected. The one on the disk wouldn't even look at my system. So, NB, make sure you've got the up-to-date
 Ethernet driver somewhere handy like a Flash or HDD if you have to replace an o/s.</p>
<p>I'll probably be begging for more help as problems arise.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Before reinstalling the operating system, using old Windows 7 DVD we will try to perform repair installation.<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> If you have 32-bit operating system installed, you need to use 32-bit operating system disk to perform repair installation. Similarly 64-bit operating system, you need 64-bit operating system disk.<br />
<br />
<span>Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Refer to the following link to perform repair install.<br />
</b>How to perform an In-Place Upgrade on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 &amp; Windows Server 2008 R2
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2255099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2255099</a></p>
<br />
 settings, hardware driver information, and software programs. If a worst case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage devices before you perform an in-place upgrade.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Mouse Pointer Misbehaving</h2>
                    I'm new to Windows 10 with a new Lenovo laptop and Microsoft mouse. When scrolling the pointer with the mouse often the pointer goes nuts and all sorts of symbols appear in place of the default arrow pointer. Sometimes things get moved around, sometimes
 I can't get the pointer back without closing a window, etc. What's this all about, and how do I get the mouse pointer to just point? Whatever it is trying to do I don't want it. Help please? Thanks, Mike

            Make sure you didn't change any drivers when you setup the laptop. You must use the Lenovo drivers that came with the laptop especially for video drivers. Changing the drivers that came with the computer can cause mouse problems. It also could be caused
 by using an external mouse with a laptop. Make sure you have the correct drivers installed for the external mouse. Remove the external mouse to see if the same problem occurs with the builtin mouse touch pad. If it does, contact Lenovo for support for your
 new laptop.&nbsp;

            When you click "Show Price" it will load the price after a while.<br />
It is basically connecting to the old X360 store so it's a bit different than buying/redeeming Xbox One games.<br />
<br />
After you click "Show Price" you should have the "free" label :)<br />
<br />
Let me know.

<p>Hey there spudladmurf! Sorry to hear you are having these frustrating connecting issues. I think you should try these.</p>
<p>Reset the network settings</p>
<p>Reset the network settings on your Xbox 360 console to the defaults. Here's how: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Wired Network.</p>
<p>Select Configure Network.</p>
<p>Go to the Additional Settings tab, and then select Restore to Factory Defaults.
</p>
<p>Select Yes, Restore to Factory Defaults. This resets the console's network settings only, and not other settings.</p>
<p>Now, restart your console and test your Xbox LIVE connection. Here's how: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart your console.</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Network Settings.</p>
<p>Select Wired Network.</p>
<p>Select Test Xbox LIVE Connection.</p>
<p>If this solution worked, your console will connect to Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>Not work? Please tell me which error are you getting?</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>ICMP Error</p>
<p>Your console can connect to Xbox LIVE, but your router or gateway isn't properly responding to ICMP responses.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>MTU Error</p>
<p>Your network doesn't have a sufficient MTU setting.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Internet Error</p>
<p>Your console is connected to the Internet but can't contact Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>1, 2 or 3 please tell me if resetting the network settings does not work. Good luck.</p>

<p>hi again, thanks for telling me about your error, Please have a look bellow:</p>
<p>Firewall or ISP blocking access?</p>
<p>A firewall or your Internet service provider (ISP) might be preventing your Xbox 360 console from connecting to Xbox LIVE.
</p>
<p>Firewall</p>
<p>If you are using a software or hardware firewall, make sure the following network ports are open on the firewall:</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>If you need help configuring your firewall, please refer to your firewall documentation.</p>
<p>ISP</p>
<p>Your Internet service provider might be preventing your console from connecting to Xbox LIVE. Contact your ISP to see if there are any known issues related to connecting to Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p>As far as I know my firewall is turned off so are the ports unnecessary ? Could this problem be due to the recent update as I hadnt got a problem before it.</p>

<p>Sorry I'm wrong, someone in my house had changed the firewall to medium level firewall protection. Would I be better to change the firewall to low (which allows me to connect to xbox live) or leave it on medium and open the ports ?</p>

<p>Rather than make a new thread, I shall post here.</p>
<p>I'm getting the third error "connected to internet but cant contact Xbox Live" I've tried the usual things such as restarting the console, resetting the router and so on, but it still wont connect to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>I have no issue connecting to the internet itself and there has been no issue with router/firewall settings in the past (other than NAT settings which resetting the router always fixes). I was on XBL only yesterday and it was working fine and nothing has
 been changed my end to affect any connections today.</p>

<p>I had the same kind of problem too. Every time I start up my Xbox, it keeps telling me that I'm signed in to the console, but not Xbox Live. I have a good internet connection to the console but it won't let me connect (it keeps telling me that I have an
 IP address or DNS server error whenever I test the connection) until I unplug and plug my modem and router back in. It's been going on for a past month.
</p>
<p>Any reasons why this frequently happens every time? And what can I do so that this won't happen again?</p>

<h2>            Rise of the Tomb Raider achievements</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I'm hoping someone can help or has any advice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I completed RotTR late on Friday night (15th) and the 'Price of Truth' achievement for 125G didn't unlock. I googled why not and found multiple other posts saying something like you had to wait 48 hours for it to do so (something about contacting both Square
 and MS's servers?), but anyway here I am on Monday night, the 19th and still it isn't showing. In fact according to my achievement list I'm missing the following;</p>

<p>Renegade - 5<br />
A Trusty Old Friend - 10<br />
The Price Of Truth - 125<br />
Secret Achievement - -<br />
Paying Respects - 10</p>
<p>Under all of these the phrase 'Done! Unlocking...' &nbsp;still showing.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what's going on?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hmmmm, well that's just ridiculous. If you're hunting specific achievements then you need to know fairly instantly whether youe made them or not, not hanging around sor weeks at a time for the possibility that you
<em>might </em>have gotten them.</p>
<p>Guess I'll just have to keep an eye out, thanks.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I'm having the same problem too, on Wednesday 24th of February I too unlocked these achievements "the price of truth, no stone unturned and ultimate survivor" and possibly two more and mine didn't ping. Spoke to a Microsoft agent and told me to
 do all sorts of steps and nothing worked, told me to wait 72 hours and last night was the 72 hour mark and still no luck. But my other games are pinging achievments so it just seems to be RoTtR problem.

<h2>            skype address on iphone gone</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 skype addresses, one is private and the other is for business and I have a US phone number that I pay use for this. I had the skype app on my iPhone 5S working perfectly well so I could also receive and send messages on it too. This included receiving
 and making phone calls via my business skype address. The phone app updated and now it won't recognise my email address to sign in. I tried opening a new account in my business name but that hasn't worked. How can I get to my skype addresses on my iPhone again.
 Fortunately both Skype accounts work on my computer ok.</p>
<p>Thanks for all help</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Troubleshooter says &#34;Windows Update components must be repaired&#34;</h2>
                    So my initial update to Windows 10 was a bit rocky due to Norton Antivirus keeping the desktop from loading, but once that was resolved (by uninstalling Norton), I am still having some trouble with Windows 10. While I love the new format, and it runs very
 quickly on my six year old laptop, the Windows Store won't download anything. When I tried running the troubleshooter it said "Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found..." Underneath it says "Windows Update components must be
 repaired. In the Windows Store, if I view all the programs queued to download, it says "try that again" and then next to it says "see details." When I view the details, Windows references a couple different error codes: three programs show error code 0x80246008,
 and the other three show error code 0x80080005. the other four programs just sit there showing 0.0 mb loaded out of x mb. Please help me resolve this problem. I love Windows 10, but will love it even more once I can actually

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to manually reset the Windows Updates Components.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Resetting Windows update components diagnoses and fixes problems with Windows Update. I suggest you to follow the below steps to Reset Windows update components:</div>
<div><br />
Method 1:</div>
<div>1.Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.<br />
2.Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands in command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</div>
<div>3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and&nbsp; Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</div>
<div>4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start bits </div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</div>
<div>5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2:</div>
<div>Registry disclaimer</div>

            <p>I tried what you said, and when I got to step 3 and typed in "ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old", it gave me a message that said "access is denied." tried two more times and it gave the same message, so I just skipped that and
 kept following the steps you laid out. When I got to where I had to start BITS again, I typed in "net start bits". Then it said "The Background Intelligent Transfer Service service is starting", before proceeding to say "The Background Intelligent Transfer
 Service service could not be started". Underneath it said "A service specific error occurred: 2147942402. More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3547".&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do now? I followed the link you posted at the end of your answer, but I don't see a Windows 10 specific method. Thank you for responding to my query so promptly, and I hope that we can resolve this issue.</p>
<p>

            I forgot to say in my original question that the mail app is not working either. After I signed into my account it will only allow me to add another account, not access my own. I tried signing in again but it said that I had already signed into my account,
 but again, I couldn't access it. It's not a big deal, I normally use my browser to check email anyway, but I thought maybe it could help you figure out what's going wrong.

                    <p>Vista Home Premium 32 bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like if you ran it and then ran it 2 days later. Does the running of it so close to the last time mess things up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also does it sometimes erronously indicate that files are not fixed, when they actually are fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have to reboot twice after running SFC /scannow?</p>

<div><font>One&nbsp;common false positive&nbsp;is a text file called settings.ini that stores the settings for the sidebar. If you've added a gadget or even started it the file will change, as it should, remembering your settings. SFC stupidly thinks it's corrupt.</font></div>

    <title>Quick Scoping is for n00bs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maj kusanagi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quick Scoping is for n00bs</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing CoD for a long time (still play the first one from time to time).</p>
<p>My memory is pretty bad, but from what i remember, quick scoping was originall a BUG that was accidentally carried over into multiplayer. People liked it, so they left it. People continued to like it, so they kept keeping it. But how much sence does it make
 when a 'pro quick scoper' can hold ground better than someone using an LMG or **** rifle? Its gotten to the point that when i see a MSR Extended Mag, i will just leave the game there and then because it almost always means there is someone quick scoping
 so much that the 5 round mag isn't enough.</p>
<p>Now i fancy myself a fair sniper, certainly not the best, but i can shoot better than most. But its not common that when sitting in a vantage point (of which there are FAR too few in any newish/new CoD game) that i need more than 5 rounds to put someone
 down. Even in face-off i can normally put down the two or three people charging me without much trouble.</p>
<p>So my question to the people here: why do you/they quick scope? Why do the game companies continue to include what was originally a bug? and do you believe it is fair? Why or Why not?</p>

<p>Well this may start a heated debate.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In my eyes I don't really like it. It usually just costs my team the round on Search and Destroy when the last player is going for some sort of "Sick Nasty 360 Jump Crouch 240 Super Awesome MLG Proz" Trickshot and he/she just gets killed by the other teams
 player when he/she very well could have just aimed and fired and we would have won. So personally quickscoping/trickshotting is a no no for me. I would rather use a sniper like its supposed to be used and scope in, or as the kids call it now a days "Hardscoping".</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On the other hand there are players who are insanely good at quick scoping and love it. If that's the case then I'm fine with them doing it as long as it won't hurt the team.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So what I am getting at is that I personally don't like quickscoping. I think it overall just hurts the team on S&amp;D. However I also appreciate the fact that other players have found a way to play the game that might make it more enjoyable for them, which
 I think is pretty cool.</p>

<p>I don't think it is in any way a bug, I mean there is no way to make a bug like that. All it is is firing before your scope is fully seen. Perks are continually included in these games because it is something that a great deal of people like to do. A lot
 of people quick scope either for the fun of it or because they think it makes them look like a 'Pro' (which I think is ridiculous). For those that would want to know why I think it's ridiculous, I think it is because most times it isn't skill, it's luck, and
 so many people try to quick scope/trick shot for youtube in private matches where they set up shots which is really lame. It is fair because there is always the high chance of them missing while someone 2 feet away from them is spraying them down with a rapid
 fire pp90. I quick scope sometimes because it changes the game up, but I stink at it. I feel people should be able to quick scope if they want. Btw you're probably going to get a lot of hate for your post.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldnt call it a bug, but there is no doubt more to it than firing before the scope is up.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a trick to it that takes advantage of game mechanics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Without getting into a long explaination or debate, anyone who disagrees with me and feels they are talented because they can qs, there are 2 tests i can suggest that will give you the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First.......... are you a good aim, or is it aim assist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to black ops and play hc mode. Use any weapon OTHER THAN a sniper rifle. &nbsp;Play a few atches with target assist on and a few off. Keep alternating with it on/off over an evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your accuracy is better when using target assist on than it is with it off, chances are your qsing skill is really the game's aim assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Second ............. play hc mode in mw3 and use a sniper rifle to qs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your k/d drops, then you arent that great, you are just taking advantage of a ohk weapon/aim assist combo. In hc mode everyone has the advantage of a potential ohk weapon/aim
 assist combo regardless of what weapon they are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been quite impressd with some qsers. But their aim has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A good qser is one who can quickly identify targets over any range and be able to stay alive while confronting multiple enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what impresses me.</p>

<p>Not saying something because you fear hate is letting their form of terrorism work.</p>
<p>And i'm not sure KG x Disarray understands the function of quick scoping. Its not just 'firing before your scope is fully seen'. quick scoping uses a form of 'auto aim' that was originally put into single player game mode to aid the player in getting targets
 into their scope. The simple explination is that when you pull the scope up, it acually pulled the weapon onto the target if they are in the correct position in front of you. This was offset by only doing it for the exact instant you pull up the scope, the
 idea being a moving target would move a little before you can see again and pull the trigger and yet would aid in putting the scope's view on a target. At some point (early on i believe), players figured out that if they pull the trigger at that exact moment,
 it will auto-aim the following shot.</p>
<p>Quick scoping is in actuality a game-sanctioned form of auto aim designed to help snipers scope targets in single player where NPC's are often found standing still or moving slowly.</p>
<p>As for Dubset Kittens, it was meant to be a debate. And while you are looking at it from your team's point of view (which is great), you fail to see the point of view of the 3 to 4 people that didn't even get a chance to see them because they are using a
 'bug' in the scope of the rifle. On that note, i agree that 'hardscoping' often would fix the epic phails you see in final kill cam. Its also obvious that you play a majority of S&amp;D, with little to no other game modes. At the very least you didn't take into
 consideration that TDM is far and large the most played game mode, and that S&amp;D is something more like a niche mode. I for one cant stand S&amp;D. Try looking at this topic from others view point, and in a game mode that MOST people play.</p>

<p>The trick is to fire the second you are fully scoped in, NOT before. If you get this timing right it will be as accurate as can be, then when the person you kill watches the killcam, it looks like you have fired before being fully scoped in. I've seen a
 YouTube video demonstrating this. If you shoot any time before you're scoped in and get the kill, it's pure luck. One of the best qs around (Grizz) has stated this numerous times. If you watch the killcam on any gun it looks like the player started shooting
 just before he fully ads.</p>

<p>I don't think it is in any way a bug, I mean there is no way to make a bug like that. All it is is firing before your scope is fully seen.
</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Its not a bug unfortunately , they stated on a blog (twitter or something) before the game came out that quickscoping will be making a return in MW3 , its easy for them to stop they can just block any firing ability until the scope is fully engaged...but
 they didnt . Im not a fan of it tbh , it can be very annoying in games such as search and destroy but other gametypes its not that bad you can keep out of their way for the most part</p>

<p>if you don't like qsers NEVER play drop zone thats there breeding ground, have like 2 or 3 on the opposite team an your in for a long one, qsing absolutely takes skill an a lot of them only play certain game modes I mainly play tdm and drop zone, there rarely
 in tdm but they flood drop zone, me personally its great competition to go up against some really good ones</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Outlook work after Windows 10 automatic update&#63;</h2>
                    Yesterday Outlook worked. Last night Microsoft did an automatic update. Today my Outlook doesn't open completely. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,

            I am using Office 2010 and now Outlook isn't working as it was before this latest update for Windows 10. Pictures aren't downloaded, so everytime I go into Outlook I have to go change the Trust Center settings so it will download pictures automatically.
 I have to do this every single time I open Outlook---it won't hold the setting change. I get a lot of email and I want to see the pictures, without having to right click on each email to see them.

                    As bizarre as it may sound I am considering buying Windows 10 to replace Vista. &nbsp;Clock speed more than adequate and RAM more than adequate and more than adequate storage space. &nbsp;However, I am uncertain if this chipset will meet the requirements of the
 DirectX9 &nbsp;with WDDM driver...will it work?

<p>my current dell G43/G45 doesnt have much after vista....Everything you listed in the post,just wont</p>

<h2>            forbidden windows kernel modification detected</h2>
                    <p>This keeps cropping up with the Insider Program on games that use Easy Anti Cheat. Why has it taken so long to come up with a permanent fix? From what I can see the three parties who make the game, EAC and of course Windows Insider are blaming each other.</p>
<p>What is it that allows this to recur over a number of months now.</p>

<p>The error arises when running Uplay games before the game actually starts, it happens for me on Far Cry 5 from a Steam linked game and Ghost Recon Wildlands as a Uplay game. As you can see from the image it is a Uplay/EasyAntiCheat error report.I have been
 getting this error since 18252 of the Insider version of W10, a month or so now. It has continued with 18262 and 18267.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A response I've had from EasyAntiCheat is that Windows is to blame but I have seen reports going back to May 2018 of this error occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ubisoft have just said it's EAC or Microsoft getting something wrong. My situation is that the three companies involved should be talking but I can't see any proof of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb5a359c-fe16-4576-916e-b97dcac32ff0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb5a359c-fe16-4576-916e-b97dcac32ff0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If this error was to get into the mainstream Windows release it would create a lot more discussion as I suspect all games using EAC would be affected.</p>

This is happening with Far Cry 5 and Ghost Recon Wildlands to my knowledge but I suspect other games using EasyAntiCheat have the same problem.

<p>IMO this error doesn't look like a Microsoft error message.&nbsp; As such, it's most likely from one of the other companies.<br />
The error states that it's an unauthorized kernel modification - but that can simply be due to the changes in the Insider released kernel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, your thought that the 3 companies should be talking is likely correct.</p>
<p>As a forum member, you can report this in 2 ways:</p>
<p>- in the Feedback Hub of your Insider build, and</p>
<p>- in the Windows Insider forums &nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum?sort=LastReplyDate&amp;dir=Desc&amp;tab=All&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=All&amp;isFilterExpanded=false&amp;page=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I presume that you have already tried uninstalling/reinstalling the affected programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that's the case, then I'd suspect that the only "fix" for right now is to revert to an earlier Insider build to see if that fixes it (or try it on a current
 release W10 system)</p>

<p>... and finally after 5 updates Far Cry 5 and Ghost Recon working again, Win 10 Insider v 18277 I believe.</p>
