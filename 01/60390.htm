<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>We (the Malware Removal Community) were dealing with an infection commonly known as "Wareout" or "DNSChanger" a while back which changed the DNS settings in the router.&nbsp; I have posted the instructions below that worked with this infection below (originally
 posted by Bill Castner MVP):</p>
<p><em>Access your router interface and make a written note of the configuration necessary to authenticate with your ISP.&nbsp; When you have done this, shut down all computers connected to the router.<br />
<br />
Now look for the Reset button at the back of the router.&nbsp; Press and hold the Reset button down for 30 seconds.&nbsp; Next unplug the router and wait for a minute.&nbsp; After a minute, depress the Reset button again and plug it back and continue holding the button down
 for another 30 seconds and then unplug the router again.</em></p>
<p>Run your antivirus/antimalware program before plugging the router back in.</p>

<h2>            Getting green screen or freezing up while watching videos on Hulu and Netflix, but the audio is fine. </h2>
                    
<p>This has been happening the last couple of days and my connection is fine. I can play multiplayer games online with no problems, but when I go to watch a video it will freeze up or lag and eventually go to a green screen but the audio is still working perfectly.
 It's weird on Hulu because the channel icon is still in the bottom right corner. Does anybody have a fix for this?</p>

<p>I've been experiencing the same thing over the past few days ( live video streams or recorded video streams stutters and then eventually stops as audio continues, screen sometimes goes blank (green), stuttering video looks like it's skips frames forwards
 and backwards in a loop ). The same problem has occurred in these apps : Amazon Instant Video, YouTube, CBS News, and ABC News. I could have checked other apps, but what's the point? It's got to be affecting all video apps I'm sure. I checked both full screen
 and Snap video for all these apps and the problem is the same.</p>
<p>XBox Live on the XBox One has been a terrible experience for me over the past year or two. This is just the latest problem. One buys a game console or set-top box to get AWAY FROM this troubleshooting nonsense.</p>

<h2>            XB1 won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play at 1080p</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Toshiba model 42HL196, it's full HD 1080p, but my xbox will only play at 720. I'm running my stuff through a sony receiver that supports HD. &nbsp;I've checked all of the settings on my TV, Xb1, and sony receiver. &nbsp;For some reason it won't play at 1080p.
 &nbsp;I understand some say that there's not much of a difference between 720 and 1080, but I have 1080p so I WANT to utilize it. &nbsp;I tried bypassing the receiver by plugging the hdmi directly to the tv and ran the audio from the tv to the receiver but still no
 &nbsp;luck. Any help would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>There is a 1 star review of this TV on Amazon that says that even though it's advertised as "1080p full HD" it can only accept inputs up to and including 1080i, not 1080p. The Xbox One does not support any interlaced resolutions, only progressive, so your
 problem may very well be the TV.</p>
<p>Here's a thread on another forum where a guy is having a problem trying to get a 1080p upscaling DVD player to work with the same TV, but it won't work. The first reply says: -</p>
<p>"Your HDTV model accepts 1080i input signals max (just like my current 1080p DLP). It does not work with 1080p input signals."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avsforum.com/t/926231/hd-a35-toshiba-42hl196-no-1080p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.avsforum.com/.../hd-a35-toshiba-42hl196-no-1080p</a></p>
<p>So, unfortunately, it seems that your TV is not capable of accepting a 1080p input and the Xbox One only outputs at 720p, 1080p etc. not 720i or 1080i and that's why it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Did some research on this T.V and it is not a true 1080p panel i'm afraid.</p>
<p>It will take a 1080i signal and upconvert it, but x1 does not output 1080i.</p>
<p>Toshiba are kinda being a tad misleasding it seems.</p>

<p>First, you should review your account's purchase history at <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com</a> under Payment &amp; Billing. If you see two purchases for the same item at about the same time, make a note of the order number for the second purchase (the bad one) and
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/payment-and-purchases/request-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit a refund request at this site</a>. If there is just one, contact <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Support</a>, then your bank (or the company that provided the payment method you used that got the duplicate charge), because the charge may have been accidentally submitted twice.</p>
<p>

 o mesmo item em aproximadamente ao mesmo tempo, anote o nÃºmero da ordem para a segunda compra (a mÃ¡) e envie um pedido de reembolso neste site. Se houver apenas um, entre em contato com o suporte do Xbox Live, entÃ£o seu banco (ou a empresa que forneceu o mÃ©todo
 de pagamento usado que recebeu a cobranÃ§a duplicada), porque a cobranÃ§a pode ter sido acidentalmente submetida duas vezes.</span></p>

    <title>How can I tell Microsoft that Windows 8.1 does not fix Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I tell Microsoft that Windows 8.1 does not fix Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
How can I tell Microsoft that Windows 8.1 does not fix the issues many of us have with Windows 8.<br />
<br />
1) I have noticed that many people find Windows 8 to difficult to navigate. This might surprise some of you, but many people find it difficult to bring up the Charms, just as much as they do the Full Screen Start menu. If with have a "Start tip" in place of
 a "Start Menu", then we also need a "Charms Tip" as well so people can access the Charms menu. (yes, this is mainly related to non-touch screen use of Windows 8)<br />
<br />
2) There are those of us&nbsp; who understand the Full Screen Start menu, but we just don't like it. Our dislike can be for a number of reasons, for example; a) takes the visibility away from the desktop, b) is too visually noisy, c) just prefer to use simple easy
 to read menu as we have it now, d) sub menus can exist and work well.<br />
<br />
3) I rarely use the "Search" feature, and if someone tells me that I need to use Search to find programs, then I am going to point out that this indicates just how ineffective the Full Screen Start menu really is.<br />
<br />
4) The Metro/Modern applications should work in overlayed Windows so they can be accessed in Desktop mode.&nbsp; Docking a few Metro/Modern applications on the same screen might be useful for limited small screen Tablets, but the concept is a step backward for Desktop
 Users.<br />
<br />
5) The vast and sudden change to Windows from Windows 7 to Windows 8 is TOO MUCH of a change, making too much of a learning curve for corporate users, and also home users.<br />
<br />
6) I can appreciate the <b>concept </b>of having one interface for all Microsoft devices, however&nbsp; I believe that Windows 8 has shown that in reality a single interface means a design that does not work the most effective on any device.
<br />
<br />
7) Working on the theory that Windows 8's GUI is here to stay, then maybe when the features and usability of Metro/Modern applications exceeds that of existing Windows applications, people might see some value in using Windows 8.&nbsp; Until then I can only see
 that they will strongly dislike Windows 8.<br />
<br />
Microsoft, please carefully consider what you deliver with Windows 8.1, as so far I see little that will be addressing the real issues that Windows Users have with Windows 8.&nbsp; When reviewing the pre-release versions of Windows 8, I made mention, as did many
 others, that we did not like the Metro interface and its Full Screen Menu.&nbsp; We were ignored, and guess what was the reaction by people when Windows 8 was released.&nbsp; Are you really going to continue the "Well you can take it or leave it" stance ?&nbsp; Please reconsider

<br />
Thank you for your reply of " you cannot personally recommend anything to Microsoft without an authorization", can you tell me if there is a way to get "authorization" ?&nbsp; for example is there a forum or beta group that Microsoft queries for their comments/feedback
 on changes, on which I could register so that I could find a "authorized" method for returning feedback ?<br />
<br />
Do you know of a Microsoft approved method to resolve the issue that users have with getting to the Start menu and/or the Charms menu when using a mouse&nbsp; or touch pad ?<br />
<br />
The link you provided was not useful in resolving these issues.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi again Windows8TablePC,</p>
<p>I was pretty much aware that the link won't help because that's for issues.</p>
<p>What I mean by authorization is being an authorized person.</p>
<p>An authorized person is someone who is working in or connected with Microsoft.</p>
<p>A good example of a connected personnel is an MVP. An MVP is a person who has established close contact with Microsoft for a few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the exact issue that you are experiencing?</p>

            Ashwin0, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. I doubt if there are any solutions two the two issues I raise below, but if I mention them, maybe you know of some settings that will help. At least the Windows 8.1 Start tip may help with finding the Start screen when using a mouse?&nbsp;
 If you know of other things that could help mouse use of Windows 8, please suggest.<br />
<br />
1) When using a mouse and keyboard at their desks, our users complain of difficulty in getting the Start Menu and/or Charms menu to display when required and not to display when not required.<br />
<br />
I too when attempting to show them how to use Windows 8, have had issues with the Charms menu either not appearing or not saying there while I attempt to select one of the menu options.<br />
<br />
Other time I have noticed that when moving the mouse around on the Desktop screen, the Charms menu will slide out, then slide away again, that is when not actually trying to access the Charms at all.<br />
<br />
I have seen this on different computers and so it does not seem hardware specific.<br />
<br />
2) Another but lesser issue, is that finding applications in the Start Menu is not easy, as there is too much "visual" clutter, while the application's actual name (text) is very small.&nbsp; This is a usability limitation with Windows 8, and I guess that it cannot
 be solved.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
A problem with using icons in the Full Page Start Screen is that as they say, "A picture says a thousand words", and while some icons are easy to guess, other icons are not. A picture can say different things to different people, where as with words it is much
 easier to be specific, thus words are more effective for menus.<br />
<br />
If there are no easy ways to change Windows 8's behavior in the above two items, then do not worry, our users will figure it out, all be it while being greatly frustrated with Windows 8. The sad thing is that they get to vent on me, and Microsoft's designers
 do not get to see the pain they are causing users by their poor GUI usability choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : (<br />
<br />
If you want to understand the seriousness of this issue, our management has put a hold on the&nbsp; IT department from any further role out of Windows 8 at this time due to the issues that users have having with its usability.&nbsp; In the work environment I actively
 encourage Windows 8 and support people using Windows 8, but in this forum I have to explain the issues that users are having, and the road blocks we face in rolling out Windows 8 across our company, in the hopes that there will be positive chances made to
 the Windows 8 GUI.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>You are right about 2). We cannot do anything about it. In the&nbsp;desired list of improvements Windows 8.1, this is not mentioned so I am sorry to inform you that you may have to wait for Windows 8.2 or Windows 9.</p>

            Ashwin0,<br />
<br />
That was a great idea, looking for Registry settings to control Windows 8's behavior.
<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you are aware of any other registry settings beyond the ones below;<br />
<br />
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell\EdgeUI</p>
<p>DWORD DisableCharmsHint set to a value of 1<span>&nbsp;
</span>(disables the top-right and bottom-right hot corners)</p>
<p>DWORD DisableTLcorner set to a value of 1<span>&nbsp; </span>
(disables the top-left hot corner)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DisableCharmsHint stops the Charms Hint from popping up, while still allowing you to put the mouse in the bottom left corner and slide up to bring out the Charms bar (Windows key + C also works, but means you have to put your hand
 back on the keyboard). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then DisableTLcorner seems to totally disable the Task Switcher, however if you do not mind using the keyboard Alt-Tab works great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this change useful as it removes the Lock Screen, displaying the Logon screen when first powering on.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization</p>
<p>DWORD NoLockScreen set to a value of 1<span>&nbsp; </span>
(disables the Lock Screen from being displayed)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The above registry changes could help some of our users.&nbsp; Though I might wait for Windows 8.1 before troubling people, just in case any of these settings are lost in the coming update.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am still finding that it is hard to activate the Charms menu when using a mouse. I guess over time I will learn to use the keyboard instead. It would be great to have a "Charms Tip", like the "Start Tip" which I hope will be an option
 in Windows 8.1, this might help the many people having issues accessing the Charms menu. Right now most rants seem focused on the lack of a visible Start button, if this is solved, they may start ranting about how the Charms menu also needing a "tip".<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Of course it would be great if there were two modes (i.e. two GUIs), one for Desktop (when using a Laptop or External Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse), and one for Touch Screen only, when using as a Tablet.&nbsp; Many of us miss the Start button
 with its Menu, it was so more user friendly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance...<br />

            Scott,<br />
<br />
I really dislike what has been done to Windows via Metro and in particularly the FULL SCREEN START MENU and hidden Charms menu, however I do want let you know that these registry hacks are not required in Windows 8.1 as the Desktop UI allows users to set these
 options by right clicking the Task bar and selecting the Navigation tab.&nbsp; Windows 8.x is technically "usable", in fact I have actually met someone who likes Windows 8, just that for me it is not as "usable" as it should be, nor does it provide enough user
 customization. <br />
<br />
I would like to see the ability to use a Start button with a Start menu (as in Windows 7) when using a physical mouse or track pad, and only use the FULL SCREEN START MENU when using Touch screen (e.g. when I am not using a mouse or track pad).<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to change the icon and the size of the text for applications on the FULL SCREEN START MENU.&nbsp; I would like to create my own Tiles like I can create desktop shortcuts (maybe we can but I just don't know it).<br />
<br />
I would like to see a "Charms" tool tip (e.g. like the Windows 8.1 "Start" tool tip, so it would be easier for mouse/trackpad uses to access the Charms menu.<br />
<br />
I would like to see people have real options in different themes, like rounded Window edges and true transparent Aero effects.<br />
<br />
If Microsoft want to depreciate the Desktop environment, then we cannot stop them, we can only move to other OS's.&nbsp; But if Microsoft wants to support both Metro and the Desktop environment they should be nice to the Desktop environment (including its users)
 and not make Windows less usable.<br />
<br />
In the work place I will support and assist people with Windows 8, but at home on my desktop PC I have removed Windows 8,&nbsp; moving back to Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I find is easier to use and more pleasant to work in.&nbsp; This is my personal choice. There will be those
 who disagree with my choice and those who agree. Microsoft will know which group is the largest.<br />
<br />
I have also been investigating Ubuntu, Gnome 3, and Linux Mint.&nbsp; I think that Ubuntu and Gnome 3 like Windows 8 have it wrong when it comes to a desktop GUI.&nbsp; When I installed Linux Mint, I immediately loved the GUI. I read on the internet the statement "We're
 working on making Linux Mint 15 better than Linux Mint 14 on the very same equipment we've been focused on since 2006:
<b>the PC</b>. If we can make things better for people whose screen is tactile, we're happy to do so.
<b>If it's at the cost of frustrating desktop computer users based on the limitations of these portable devices, we're not interested</b>", and I would say they have done this, and I like their attitude. At this time I want to stay with Windows 7, but if Microsoft
 gets rid of the Desktop environment, at least there is a OS or two out there which still supports the desktop user.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Treasure Hunt</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem playing Treasure Hunt on Windows 10.&nbsp; The underlay (uncovered areas) covers the entire field, but the active overlay only shows&nbsp;75-80% (moving from L -&gt; R) of the game field, and then stops, exposing&nbsp;only the underlay.&nbsp; The action figure
 can move into the exposed underlay, but disappears from view.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling, restarting my system, and reinstalling the game, but the same problem exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for the Solitaire collection: most menu selections for options&nbsp;do not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm finding that several games which worked fine in Windows 8.1 now have issues in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Treasure Hunt -- As mentioned in this thread, the rightmost columns won't display. In another thread it was stated that using the mouse wheel to change the zoom level would let you see the rightmost columns, but the only way that trick works for
 me is if I zoom in to the maximum level, and even then it looks like the rightmost column is invisible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Sudoku -- As mentioned in other threads, the advertisement covers up part of the upper right corner of the puzzle, making it impossible to see what's in those blocks or to put numbers in them. I've discovered that if I grab one of the vertical
 (left or right) edges of the window and move it inward (i.e., make the window slightly narrower), the ad disappears completely and I can see the entire puzzle with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Solitaire Collection -- As mentioned in other threads, on my laptop the game was getting stuck whenever I started it up; it would say "importing save game data" but as far as I could tell it wasn't actually importing the data (although apparently
 it did create the folders for said data). Yet it was working okay on my desktop computer. Now the situation is reversed; the game is finally working on my laptop, but on my desktop it no longer works because as soon as I start it up it closes and logs an error
 in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taptiles -- The game runs fine (as far as I can tell), but when the window is opened at its default size only three of the five Daily Challenges are displayed. If I maximize the window then all five Daily Challenges are visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Mahjong -- This is misbehaving the same way Microsoft Solitaire Collection is; when I start it up it shows the splash/title screen and then just closes the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry, but I don't think these issues are being caused by a display driver or a Windows update that needs to be applied. These problems are happening to too many people on too many different devices. The funny thing is, I've played a few games from other
 publishers and so far they seem to be working okay, yet it's the games from Arkadium or Microsoft Studios that seem to be having all these problems, which is ironic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where I am now: It's almost August 15. Should I just uninstall Windows 10 on both my desktop and laptop computers while I'm still within the "first month" window of uninstallability, or should I just tough it out and hope that someone working at Microsoft
 Studios/Arkadium finally gets their act in gear and gets these issues fixed? I mean, I'd really like to keep Windows 10 and move forward, not backward, but this situation with the games is frustrating. Or maybe this is a sign from the universe that I should
 just stop wasting so much of my time playing these games from Microsoft Studio/Arkadium?</p>

            I uninstalled the Video Driver and updated it.&nbsp; I also uninstalled MS Treasure Hunt and reinstalled the game.&nbsp; The same problem still exists.&nbsp; Several days ago,&nbsp;I contacted MS Windows Support; I also suggested that they can duplicate the problem on a freestanding
 PC w/ Win10 installed (if the problem doesn't exist of the server).

            I checked drivers and reinstalled as with another post on this forum to no avail; I am also having the same problems with these games. There obviously is an incompatibility issue with the Arkadium games and MS10. At this point I too am also wondering whether
 I should roll back to Win 8.1. Please provide a workable fix for these!

            <p>Yes, this is&nbsp;obviously a Win 10 problem.&nbsp; My subsequent contact with reps from MS Games/Arkadium have acknowledged that there is a problem and it "was kicked up to the next level of support for it to be addressed..."&nbsp; The first rep has emailed several times
 with "suggestions"; the last being that I contact Windows support directly for them to look at my laptop to check for correct drivers (they found all drivers up-to-date, and all settings were correct).&nbsp; I have heard nothing since then from MS Games support.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, people who&nbsp;are playing the game on a desktop with a stand alone monitor, the game may play correctly;&nbsp;I have the game installed on 2 fairly new&nbsp;laptops (2014 Intel i3 and a 2013&nbsp;AMD A4), and both have the same problems with the game under
 Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Hibernate Option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david van o.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Hibernate Option</h2>
                    <p>My first PC was a laptop running Windows 8.1. It was weak, but it did what it needed to do. I hibernated it frequently when I was going from class to class in school. I then upgraded to Windows 10. I love that OS. One issue, though; I couldn't find the Hibernate
 option in the shutdown menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25793d93-d66d-4bd5-a1ac-5dec43d9688d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25793d93-d66d-4bd5-a1ac-5dec43d9688d" /></a></p>
<p>Being Command-Prompt savvy, I made a batch file to do this. However, this is sort of weird to do. The worst part is, when my friend got a MacBook Air for Christmas, he, not liking Mac OS, installed Windows 10. He has the Hibernate option. My&nbsp;new laptop came
 with Windows 10 PREINSTALLED, and it can't do it. Is there a setting I'm missing?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 WiFi Network Connection Drop</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Installed Windows10 several months ago, worked just fine.&nbsp; Around April 21 the system got flaky - just started dropping the WiFi&nbsp;Internet &nbsp;connection after some period of inactivity.&nbsp; Windows 10 indicates the network is still up but has no Internet connectivity.&nbsp;
 I can recover just fine if I click on the network "icon" down in the taskbar and then disconnect from the network and re-connect to it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to regret ever having upgraded to Windows 10, this is quite annoying and if it doesn't get resolved I guess I'll go back to Linux.</p>

<p>On the Xbox one Console it is similar, Every attempt i do there and it keeps saying "Oops, something went wrong but we don't know why?" Is there a fix to this?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>since you have trierd this on several computers it does seem like an account issue.</p>
<p>Be sure to verify all your details and information is correct at <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> and on <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>And try again after that.</p>
<p>If it still results in issues, then I suggest contact Xbox Support (Phone or Microsoft Support Chat) via <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>Xbox Support should be able to take a more in depth look into the account and hopefully see what is the issue.</p>

    <title>Dear MS&#58; Please allow CPU limiting in Power Options with CS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> overzeetop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dear MS&#58; Please allow CPU limiting in Power Options with CS</h2>
                    <p>I've just switched back to Connected Sleep on my SP4 given all the hype around the improved sleep performance. However, I totally forgot that with CS enabled, I can't cap my CPU MAx state. This is a big deal because the OS/processor is easily fooled into
 turbo mode by many programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>Playing a video (x264, .mkv container), of which I have about 4TB in my library, keeps the processor running in the 2.7-2.9GHz range on my SP4 i5, causing the battery to go dead in 3 hours. HOWEVER, the CPU utilization is in the 10-15% range. It also has
 the fan running non-stop. Playing the identical video with CPU Max set at 40% (in the traditional power profiles) extends the life to 6+ hours and the fan doesn't run. &nbsp;There is no stuttering or dropped frames - everything works perfectly - while the processors
 runs at 1GHz and the CPU stays between 40%-50%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that the idea is to have the SP4 as responsive as possible, but the inability to effectively optimize the CPU usage to what is demanded is killing the battery. I WANT CS to work, but to gain back a useful sleep mode I don't want to have to sacrifice
 1/2 of my active usage time.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Take a look at the post by @KentSpain85 in this thread:</p>

            <p>I'll have to try it again,. Switching back to CS seemed to have lost some of my power profiles. I may try creating one under CS, then turning it off and modifying it and re-enabling CS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OTOH, it really should be an available option for the CS-enabled state. It doesn't appear to make sense to prevent it if it (apparently) works fine when you jump though hoops. Even a "power" slider or toggle (like sound or backlight) would be a welcome addition
 if MS thinks percentages are too scary for users.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Tyrone, thanks for your question. Hopefully I can help!
<br />
<br />Your neighbor's devices likely support WiFi Direct, so they don't need to be connected to your network for them to show up, just like Bluetooth devices.
<br />
<br />If you'd like to disable Wi-Fi direct in Windows 10 so those devices won't show up, you can do this in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />Click Start and type Device Manager. Click the first result.
<br />Click View -&gt; Show hidden devices
<br />Under Network Adapters, you should see "Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter"
<br />Right-click and disable this.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this is the information you needed. Please let me know if you need any more details. Thanks again!       
        </p>

            Hi Tyrone.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A device can detect a Chromecast or cast display target even if both devices are not connected to the same wireless network simultaneously. Go to your device SETTINGS&gt;DISPLAY and find the Cast option, uncheck the box titled âTurn on Wireless Display.â This should prevent your device from detecting your neighbor's Chromecast.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

What is Network Access Protection?
<p>Network Access Protection (NAP) is a platform that network administrators can use to help protect the security of a<span>network</span> . When you connect to a corporate network that uses NAP, your computer is checked to make sure that it has the required
 software and settings, and that the software and settings are up to date. If anything is missing or outdated, your computer can be automatically updated. Your network access might be limited during that time, but usually this process happens quickly, after
 which full network access is restored.</p>

<p><span>Hello Robinc15 â Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is Network Access Protection?</strong><br />
Network Access Protection or NAP is a network platform which Administrators<br />
apply on a corporate (or home) network. Once your PC is connected to a <br />
network that uses NAP, this NAP will check your machine for this: <br />
<br />
<strong>A)</strong> Does the PC have required software and network?<br />
<strong>B)</strong> Is the software up-to-date?<br />
<br />
As it is performing this check, you will be running under limitation (due to the data<br />
information collection about the computerâs identity) on the network. <br />
However, once everything is fine, you will get full network access.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>NO YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE NAP ENABLED AS A HOME USER.<br />

    <title>Can I watch a show that is currently recording in Windows Media Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwaynemk23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I watch a show that is currently recording in Windows Media Center from the beginning of that show&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows Media centre to record TV shows.&nbsp; Suppose I am recording a one hour show beginning at 6:00, and I decide at 6:10 I want to watch this show from the beginning. (while it is recording)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this in Windows Media Centre?&nbsp; The media file of the show recording is not accessible until it is 100% finished recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for a way to watch a show while it is recording but to do it from the beginning of the show (after the recording has started)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
