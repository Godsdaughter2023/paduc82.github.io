            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />
<br />7. Have you been attempting to install the Fall Creators Update manually or is it being offered via Windows Update?
<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The concept is called Least Privileged environment. This is the key that makes Windows 7 much more secure than previous versions of windows. Here is an article that describes the basics.</p>
<p><span><span><span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_user_access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Principle of least privilege</a><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>In Windows 7, even though you are using an Administrator account, you are still running as a Standard User until
 you elevate a process to use your Administrator privileges.</span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><br />
Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller connection issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelegendofmart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller connection issues.</h2>
                    
<p>Firstly I've read the 'Controller Issues? Start Here!' thread. I've contacted Xbox Support chat and have been chatting to them for like an hour and a half and still nothing resolved.</p>
<p>I did a full reset of the console removing all apps and games and it is still happening.</p>
<p>I use instant-on mode. When I'm done with the Xbox I hold the X button and select turn console off. When I want to use the console again I hold X on the controller and boot the console up, the controller light is on and shows as connected but will not respond.
 I have to hold X till controller turns off and turn it back on again and then it starts to work.</p>
<p>If I hold the X button on the console and do a full shut down and reboot it connects fine, I switch it off using controller and back on again and it works, when I do it a second time it connects but doesn't responds until I turn the controller off and on
 again.</p>
<p>I have tried with both the play and charge kit, regular batteries, no batteries using both wireless and USB but the problem persists.</p>
<p>This only started happening when I saw that there was an update for the controller and updated it. My problem is that it is out of warranty as of February.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do?</p>

            <p>Hey TheLegendOfMart -</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the controller frustrations. Are you able to try your controller on a friend's Xbox One console to see if the issue persists there? And are you able to try a different controller on your Xbox One?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I would suggest temporarily putting your console into Energy Saving Mode vs Instant-On Mode to see if that helps resolve the issue. To do that, from your Xbox One console dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to 'Settings'</li>
<li>Navigate to 'Power &amp; Startup'</li>
<li>Navigate to 'Power Mode and Startup'</li>
<li>Then go to 'Energy Saving Mode'</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this will turn off the setting called 'When Xbox is off, turn off storage'. This essentially turns off your USB ports. Once you have done that, please <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power Cycle your Xbox One</a> console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if that works! :)</p>

<p>I have been dealing with this for athe past couple of week now as well. Nothing works with my console, I havce tried EVERYTHING in the forums and EVERYTHING that Microsoft has up as well... Both my controllers work on my sisters console just fine though.
 I have also been trying to get somone on the phone or even in chat for the past 2 days now and i &nbsp;get NOTHING... when I call all I get is your device is not registered... Bull *** it was registered in November of 2015 when I bought it. and when I open a chat
 session it stays open for like 2 minutes and then just closes.... Not once have I actually talked to anyone... Some help would be nice.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store. How to change the apps storage location&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, where does Windows Store saves the apps I've downloaded from it? I'm assuming that it saves&nbsp;apps in the same drive where&nbsp;the&nbsp;OS is installed. I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to know exactly where Windows Store is saving the apps and how to modify, if possible,&nbsp;the
 save path directory.&nbsp;I have two drives and I'm trying to save all in a specific drive (the one used for storage only, not OS drive).

<h2>            Slow login problem it takes nearly around 30-40 seconds&#33; Please help.</h2>
                    <p>I am running <strong>Windows 10 Pro (x64)</strong>. The machine is capable enough to run the OS smooth (I used to run Win 8.1 pro).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>The</strong> <strong>initial boot</strong> (when the Windows 10 logo appears)
<strong>takes around 3 second</strong>s and then it takes me to the login in screen where I have to login to my local account with my password. Here
<strong>I type in my password it takes nearly 30-40 second</strong><strong>s for the desktop to come up</strong>( this used to take 2-3 seconds).<br />
</p>
<p>The <strong>OS boots from a S.S.D ( Intel 750), I know that my S.S.D is working fine</strong>.</p>
<p>The wait is irritating because it destroys the purpose of buying a good S.S.D.</p>
<p>I have tried</p>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Disabling&nbsp;</strong><strong>inessential </strong><strong>startup applications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Changing my boot </strong><strong>configuration.</strong></li><li><strong>Logging in to my local accoun</strong>t rather than the Microsoft online account.</li><li><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disabling&nbsp;IPv6&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">from my network card proper.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>Nothing helped me so far.</p>
<p>It is <strong>after the recent update&nbsp;</strong><strong>the problems are haunting me</strong>. All the
<strong>drivers </strong>on my machine<strong> are up to date</strong>.<br />

            <p>I did everything you mentioned but<strong> I ended up doing something I never wanted to i.e, clean installing the OS</strong>.
</p>
<p>The problem seems to be related to the recent November update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted down any decrease in the boot speed after every major change I made (like installing third party application or installing drivers for my keyboard, mouse, etc).</p>
<p>The login speed drastically reduced the moment I updated to the Build 10586.3. Then I restored to the previous build(Build 10240).</p>

<h3> bryanstairs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot upgrade windows 10 from 5011 to 1607</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade windows 10 to anniversary from 10586xxxx. I have done clean start. DISM checks. Deleted 3rd party AV and FW. Downloaded iso and mounted and ran from that and I always end up with some error code. Usually 0X80073BC3-0X20009.</p>
<p>Very important note is that the HD has a MBR setup and not a UEFI setup.</p>
<p>I am afraid that with all the stuff I have tried that I could end up breaking something. I know I could probably do a clean install, but I really do not look forward to spending the nest 2 weeks putting everything back together again. I would probably go
 the linux route before that happened.</p>

</p><p>Yes, I tried to do the updates immediately before trying this option.......&nbsp; they failed as they had numerous times before...</p>

            If you are finding that your Skype application is not working as expected you can use the following guide to troubleshoot most errors

<br />
<br />alternately I would recommend uninstalling your current skype app and installing classic skype from here

<p>I've already re-installed Skype and why should I go back to the Classic version when you are constantly urging me to upgrade to the NEW VERSION? It should be ready to use and not have this bug!

<p>

            Vernon. I am sorry to hear that this doesn't help. I am simply a fellow community member here to share the things I have learned and help my peers. I advised a return to classic Skype as many users have reported that they prefer it's functionality to the current version of Skype.

            Vernon, unfortunately not all options when trying to contact Skype or Microsoft support will lead you to a alive rep. Many will lead you back here to the community. If you choose the categories for " Account  &amp; My Account is Blocked" this will get you through to a live support agent
<br />
<br />As to the Microsoft support link being invalid I will have to reasearch that, they may have changed it.
<br />
<br />You can also provide feedback to Microsoft at any time via the feedback hub by pressing the Windows key + F on your keyboard

<h3> smorch  say:</h3>
<h2>            One of 3 computers fails to activate after upgrade to Windows 10 - error code 0xC004C003 &#40;activation blocked&#41;.</h2>
                    <p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I reserved my Windows 10 upgrades back at the beginning of June 2015 for free upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have 3 computers in my home. &nbsp;Their basic configuration was as follows prior to upgrade:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>System #1 - Homebuilt Desktop PC running retail version of Windows 7 Home Premium. &nbsp;Basic HW config: &nbsp;i7-4790k processor, Samsung 840 Evo SSD, 16 GB ram, ASUS Maximus Hero VII motherboard.</li><li>System #2 - Acer Aspire 7736Z laptop running OEM version of Windows 7 Home Premium. &nbsp;A few years ago I upgraded the CPU from original Intel T4400 to Intel P8700 and increased ram from 4GB to 8GB.</li><li>System #3 - Acer One netbook running OEM version of Windows 7 starter. &nbsp;A few years ago I increased ram from 1GB to 2GB.</li></ol>
<p>Prior to Windows 10 upgrade all systems had valid WIN 7 activation and had latest updates.<br />
</p>
<p>I did the following to upgrade all 3 systems to Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>August 3, 2015:</strong> &nbsp;I did Windows 10 upgrade on System #1 (Homebuilt desktop) successfully and Windows 10 automatically activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>August 4, 2015:</strong> &nbsp;I did Windows 10 upgrade on System #2 (Acer laptop) and when it completed,
</p>
<p><strong>I got the activation error 0xC004C003,&nbsp;</strong><strong>which indicated my laptop is being blocked from having Windows 10 activated.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>August 6, 2015:</strong> <strong>&nbsp;I contacted Microsoft Support via chat</strong><strong> and asked for help with my laptop (System #2) and the activation&nbsp;</strong><strong>error&nbsp;</strong><strong>0xc004c003.
</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After approximately 20 minutes it became clear that MS support had no resolution to my problem. &nbsp;They did however claim it's because I was upgrading from an OEM version of Windows 7, and then went on to say that OEM versions of Windows 7 won't get activated
 until at least October 2015 at the earliest. &nbsp;I found this hard to believe. &nbsp;They recommended I revert back to Windows 7 Home Premium and wait until October, and then try the Windows 10 upgrade again at that time. &nbsp;I asked the tech to email me a copy of an
 official Microsoft policy statement indicating that all OEM versions of Windows 7 that upgrade to Windows 10 will not be activated until at least October 2015. &nbsp;The tech said he could not provide a policy statement, but would send me URL's to several blogs
 that discuss it. &nbsp;The tech sent me "one" blog URL:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/windows-10-oem-or-should-i-upgrade/5acd300d-788d-4f05-b5b6-d6ff3d1334e1?auth=1">Windows 10 OEM or should i upgrade?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended my chat session and then read the above URL. &nbsp;The poster mentions "I was told on Microsoft's tech chat that the OEM of Windows 10 won't be out until October." &nbsp;It mentions nothing about what the MS tech claimed during our chat.<br />
</p>
<p>At this point I had yet to upgrade to Windows 10 on my Acer netbook (System #3), which like my problematic Acer laptop (System #2) also had an OEM version of Windows 7 pre-installed on it by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>August 7, 2015:</strong> &nbsp;I did Windows 10 upgrade on System #3 (Acer netbook) successfully and Windows 10 automatically activated. This result contradicted what the MS tech said about OEM versions of Windows 7 during our previous chat session. &nbsp;
 In other words, per the MS tech, because my Acer netbook (System #3) had an OEM version of Windows 7, it would not get activated until at least October 2015.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I felt it necessary to provide the above background before posing my question.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">QUESTION:</span> </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My laptop upgraded successfully from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10, but it failed to activate windows 10. &nbsp;The error code is 0xC004C003 (blocked). &nbsp;What can I do to fix this issue so I can activate Windows 10 on my laptop?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATES:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On, August 9, 2015, I found the following links, which cite the same problem with activation error 0xC004C003. &nbsp;Both OPs in the below links express the same frustration I am having regarding the same activation error and the lack of resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-error-code-0xc004c003/138cd700-62db-4983-bc8e-bf31316a6108">Windows 10 error code 0xC004C003</a></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>My guess is that there are many others, who upgraded to Windows 10, who are experiencing activation error code 0xC004C003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I surely hope Microsoft addresses this issue in a timely manner, rather than just letting customers struggle in an attempt to figure out their own resolution.</p>

            <p>I'm in the same situation as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my Windows 7 ultimate to Windows 10 on the 4th (6 days ago) and since then it has been 'unactivated'</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous windows WAS activated and had been for 2 years, so why is my 'free' upgrade not activated?</p>
<p>In the activation section of the settings window it shows the error code: 0xC004C003 and if I run slmgr.vbs /ato it says it my product key is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even rolled back to W7 and checked that it was activated, then did the upgrade again, but it is still not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hours on the Microsoft help chat and hours on the phone to customer support, technical support and the activation team and they are giving conflicting information.</p>
<p>Most of them seem to agree that this is a know issue and that they are working on it.</p>
<p>They have confirmed that my Windows 7 key is genuine but they wont say why I am having this problem or when it will be fixed.</p>
<p>All I have been told is to wait and it will "sort itself out", however I have not been able to establish a time-frame for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this upgrade hasn't been free due to the amount of time I've wasted chatting on-line or talking on the telephone to people who either haven't got a clue or who are withholding information (apart from the fact that they acknowledge that this
 is a known issue with some upgrades).</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I contacted my PC manufacturer and they told me to contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, stop hiding and let us know what is being done and when it will be resolved, is it days, weeks, months?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your input PK... I cited your original post in my updates section in my initial post above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I share your frustration. &nbsp;After reading your post I'm wary of rolling back from Windows 10 to my original version of Windows 7 Home Premium, and then re-attempting to upgrade to Windows 10 again. &nbsp;You, as well as other forum posters have tried this without
 success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the "slmgr.vbs /ato" command and again get the same error 0xC004C003 which indicates "The activation server determined the specified product key is blocked".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try the command "slmgr.vbs /dli", it does not give me the same error, but instead returns me error 0xC004F034. &nbsp;It seems inconsistent that I'm getting two different errors when using the "slmgr.vbs" command to "activate windows" versus "display
 license information".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not against the "slmgr.vbs" command returning error codes. &nbsp;However, in this day and age, wouldn't it be nice if error messages at least gave more information about the error and be proactive by providing contact information at Microsoft to help get
 a resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does a better job when verifying activation via the usual method (Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update and Security -&gt; Activation). &nbsp;If there is an activation issue, they at least make an attempt by telling us to&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/why-activate-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Learrn more about why you're seeing this issue</a>. &nbsp;This sends us to a Microsoft webpage titled "<strong>Why can't I activate Windows 10?</strong>" &nbsp;Unfortunately, the information on this page doesn't even mention error code 0xC004C003. &nbsp;So, the information
 provided proves rather useless in our case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your own post you mentioned "The trouble is that I cannot get any indication how long I should wait.</p>
<p>In 23 days I will no longer be able to 'roll back' - Then what?" &nbsp;Until I read your post I totally forgot that activation is a timed event (on Windows 7 I believe it was 30 days). &nbsp;Windows 7 clearly indicated the timeline and each day it would decrease the
 time you had. &nbsp;Unfortunately, in Windows 10 thus far they don't do this from what I can tell. &nbsp;So for all those customers having similar activation issues like ours... they are not being reminded by Windows 10 to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If indeed after 30 days of not activating Windows 10 one cannot 'roll back' to their previous version of Windows and still not be able to activate Windows 10, there will probably be a backlash by all the affected users against Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense if Microsoft just verified our previous version of Windows as valid, and if so, then do there modifications as necessary in the activation servers, so that we can get Windows 10 activated? &nbsp;But instead, they put the burden on
 the customer and have them spend hours attempting to 'roll back' and try upgrading to Windows 10 again only to find out this process doesn't fix the validation issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I may break down within the next week or so and attempt a "roll back" to Windows 7, that is &nbsp;if Microsoft doesn't weigh in with a solution before then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the situation improves... soon!</p>

            <p>Hi, yes frustration, that's an understatement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record I tried "slmgr.vbs /dli" and got the same result, as you say, a different code&nbsp;to the one I get when running "slmgr.vbs /ato"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember how I did it but even found a script online somewhere that forces the activation code that you enter in the online activation window to appear. This didn't work either,&nbsp;got another error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, today I spent quite some time on the telephone. What a waste of time that was.</p>
<p>After being on hold for 15 minutes the first&nbsp;operator said he would pass me to tech support, then I was cut off.</p>
<p>I tried again and after being on hold for a further 20 minutes the line went dead.</p>
<p>On the third attempt I tried some of the other menu numbers to try to get through a different way, this time the automated system said I would be connected to the next available tech support person.</p>
<p>So after 2 hours I had to hang up as I needed to pee.</p>
<p>After this I thought I would try Twitter using @Microsoft, @MicrosoftUK and @MicrosoftHelps.</p>
<p>To begin with I got the usual suggestions and links to pages I've read umpteen times before.</p>
<p>They even had the nerve to suggest that I ring them :-/</p>
<p>Then I got a tweet from @Microsoft asking&nbsp;me to DM&nbsp;my phone number and e-mail. Sure enough about 30 minutes later I got a call from what he described as "the highest level of tech support".</p>
<p>Unfortunately I was at work and not in front of my own&nbsp;PC, I explained this but also that I should be able to answer any questions he may have as I know all the relevant info from memory now. I even had my W7 licence key written down and in my wallet just
 in case.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;admitted&nbsp;there was a problem and that I was not the only one&nbsp;and&nbsp;that they would try resolve it but I needed to be at my PC. He said he would call back when it would be convenient so I said&nbsp;after 18:00. He said he would call back between 18:00 and 21:00.</p>
<p>It is now 19:30, nothing as yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow this up later, one way or the other.</p>
<p>If it's fixed and there is a solution I will let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If he doesn't call back, twitter will go into meltdown.</p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW, it is somewhat surprising, given all the testing by the Windows 10 Insiders, that this activation issue (error code 0xC004C003) hasn't already been seen and addressed by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Have just got off the phone, tech support did ring back&nbsp;as promised and spent over an hour looking into the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I didn't think it was going to be fixed but Arshad was persistent and we got to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I told him my original W7 product key he said that he could see that this had been blocked on their servers.</p>
<p>The reason he gave (I think I'm right in saying)&nbsp;was that it had been activated more than once.</p>
<p>However he was also able to tell from the activation code that the hardware was the same on each occasion, therefore it was clearly the same machine.</p>
<p>From this I assume that if you have re-installed your original version of windows, or installed it on a new machine, Microsoft's servers will recognise this and block it. Presumably thinking that the key was being used by multiple machines.</p>
<p>But he could see that in my case the hardware ID&nbsp;hadn't changed, therefore it was the same machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he did was provide me with a new Windows 10 product key and now I am activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it would seem that product keys are being blocked for simply having been used to do a clean&nbsp;re-installation, which doesn't make sense, so this is clearly something they need to look into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry there is no solution that I can pass on which you can do yourself, but at least there is an answer as to why this has happened, hopefully they will resolve this for everyone else who is having this issue.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the update PK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to hear you got your issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the 3 systems I've upgraded to Windows 10, 2 activated, one of which is a system I built and rebuilt several times. &nbsp;That particular system has been through 4 different mother boards, and 4 different processors, as well as 3 different system discs,
 the latest of which is a Samsung 840 EVO SSD. &nbsp;I used the same retail copy of Windows 7 Home Premium to reactivate after each hardware upgrade. &nbsp;Interestingly, this Desktop with the most hardware changes and Windows 7 Home Premium activations upgraded to Windows
 10 and automatically activated without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other system that upgraded to Windows 10 and activated automatically without issue is my lowly Acer netbook. The only hardware change it had was increasing ram from 1GB to 2GB (about 3 years ago I think). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The remaining system, which upgraded to Windows 10 but DID NOT activate (error code 0xC004C003), is my Acer Aspire laptop. &nbsp;As previously mentioned I made 2 hardware upgrades about 3 years or more ago. &nbsp;Those changes included upgrading the Intel T4400 processor
 to an Intel P8700 processor, and upgrading the ram from 4GB to 8GB. The processor upgrade, as I recall, did require a reactivation of Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure ALL 3 machines had valid Window 7 activations prior to upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of my 3 machines, it would be the desktop that I would have expected might have issues activating, since it had so many hardware changes. &nbsp;Yet my OEM laptop is the one having Windows 10 activation issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you can share with me which Microsoft number you called (the one that ultimately led to your solution).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, and again, glad you finally got Windows 10 activated.</p>

            <p>SOLUTION:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have updated this about 2 weeks ago, but got distracted by other pressing matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After filing 2 more service requests online, and having them disappear in the bit bucket, I called Microsoft support on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very clearly expressed my dis-satisfaction with Microsoft Support up to that point, and explained what I had done thus far to try and get Microsoft to help me resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, this time my frustration did NOT fall on deaf ears. &nbsp;They connected me to a support engineer who then went through the same procedure with me, that PK (an earlier poster), went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They accessed my system, and actually gave me a new Windows 10 product key. &nbsp;After that, no more errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally got this thing resolved before 30 days had lapsed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those with the same issue I had, I would recommend calling Microsoft support on their 800 number and insist on speaking to a Microsoft engineer who can assist you with you product key problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to any others who have run into the same problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The creation of a DVD is separate from the creation of a video. Movie Maker 2012 generates a video/audio file in .mp4 or .wmv format. It is then up to other software to transcode that video to the DVD standard for placing on a disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In earlier versions of Windows (Windows Vista and Windows 7) there was a program called Windows DVD Maker that could do that. It would take a .wmv file, let you choose a menu and other options and then it would create a video DVD that was playable in a standard
 DVD player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Windows 8.1 doesn't include Windows DVD Maker anymore so it is up to you to find a different solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The DVD standard is MPEG-2 video in a maximum SD quality. Since it came from the era of analog TVs, it doesn't have support for HD video (except to down-rez it to standard definition). That's probably why it isn't supported on the latest, modern operating
 system (Apple no longer supplies a DVD creation program either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are freeware options for making a legacy video DVD (e.g. Freemake Video Converter) but if you do choose anything like that, be sure to choose a custom install option and uncheck any add-ons that are offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These days, I would choose to stream from a PC to the HDTV, or I might put the .mp4 file on a USB stick and plug it into the TV. For sharing with others, I just load videos on a sharing site like YouTube or Vimeo. If I need it private, I set it as such or
 with a password.</p>

<h2>            Minoru 3d webcam setup does not work </h2>
                    
<p>Why Win7 pro 64bit. not allowing minoru 3d webcam setup wizard to work</p>
<p>Hi guys I have come here because I am not getting any reply from minoru and there is no forum there either. I have d/loaded the latest driver already. They install ok but when I try the setup wizard i get a message saying something like the device has stopped
 working. Then it ask me to close. I can use the camera like a normal one but that defeats the purpose of a 3d cam. Also in the properties it is listed as a Vimicro PC camera (Venus). Any help in solving this problem will be greatly appreciated.</p>

The program is garbage. It scans your system. Says it has all kinds of problems then wants you to pay to "fix it".<br />
<br />
Stay away from any program that says registry, cleaner, mechanic, tune-up, etc. They do nothing beneficial and could break things.<br />

            Hi Den242,<br />
<br />
<br />
We have a software that can create or modify keyboard layouts called <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339&amp;ppud=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4</a></strong>, however, the system
 requirements only goes up to Windows Vista. I have seen reports that this software worked for Windows 10, so you can go ahead and test it out yourself. You can run it in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compatibility mode</a></strong> if it fails to run. You can also search the internet for 3rd party softwares that performs
 the same function.<br />
<br />
Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<br /> UEFI  vs BIOS
<br />
<br />If this is a relatively new computer it may actually be using a newer form of "bios" called UEFI. This article talks about setting it up

<br />
<br />*****************************
<br />
<br />The OP might have a motherboard with separate IDE and SATA controllers, where the IDE controller can be enabled or disabled from the BIOS. If enabled, the IDE controller would then add quite a bit of time to the POST process if no IDE drives are attached to its ports.
<br />
<br />Note this has nothing to do with running the SATA controller in IDE vs. AHCI mode - I'm talking about an actual IDE controller that lives alongside the SATA controller. In this case, simply disabling the IDE side should bring the POST time back down to normal.
<br />
<br />(Of course, if the OP then notices the CD/DVD drive vanishing from sight then IDE will have to be re-enabled...) 
<br />
<br />***********
<br />
<br />Thank you all. I re-sited the DVD rom sata cable. BINGO running like it was before.

<br />The first place I'd look is boot disk device order. If you have too many other things in the boot order before the actual boot disk, that does slow things down.  You should probably limit it to one devcie, either dvd or usb before the actual boot drive.

<br />
<br />Messing with your BIOS is DANGEROUS!  You can make your system unusable if you accidentally make an incorrect setting.  
<br />
<br />If you don't feel comfortable making this change, DON'T.  
<br />It is OK to carefully go in and LOOK, but make sure to NOT save changes when you exit.

            You can replace the hard drive and reinstall Windows 7 (including the qualifying version if an upgrade), you don't need to buy another copy of Windows 7. If you want to keep all your installed programs and avoid reinstalling you can make an image of your
 hard drive - see below. The new hard drive would need to be the same size or larger to restore the image.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Create A System Image In Windows 7<br />
<br />
After you install and activate Windows 7 create a system image as a backup for your current computer in case you ever need to reinstall it. That will save you the trouble of having to reinstall Windows 7 and everything currently installed again, and it takes
 much less time to do.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Click the Start Menu and type "Back Up" then click on Back up your Files.&nbsp; <br />
2.&nbsp; In the Control Panel window that appears, Click the blue Create a system image link.<br />
3.&nbsp; The Create a system image window should pop-up.&nbsp; Select which hard disk, DVD, or network location you are going to save your system image to.&nbsp; Click Next to continue.<br />
4.&nbsp; On the next page check both your System and System Reserved drives.&nbsp; Once you have selected the drives Click Next to continue. Note: You can select as many drives as you want (if available), but the more you choose to include means the larger the image
 size will be.<br />
5.&nbsp; The next window is just a review, make sure everything is correct then Click Start backup to start the process.&nbsp; This can take 10 minutes or more so patience is required.<br />
6.&nbsp; After the backup completes, you’ll be prompted with the option to create a system repair disc.&nbsp; This is a good idea just in case your system has any problems in the future.&nbsp; Click Yes.<br />
7.&nbsp; Choose which Disc Recording drive you’ll be using to burn the disc.&nbsp; Insert a blank CD or DVD to the physical drive and then Click Create disc.<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>Z tylu opakowania gry nie mam zadnego kodu.</p>
<p>A pod kodem ktory mam jest informacja "Zachowaj ten, kod by móc tańczyć dalej..."</p>
<p>Jesli chodzi o instrukcje ktora podales tam jest informacja ze mam podac kod ktory dostalem razem z gra DC2 tylko jak juz mowilem DC2 dostalem jako dodatek do kinecta i ta gre pobralem przy pomocy wlasnie tego kodu na dysk.

<p>po pierwsze: <em>Uwaga Importowanie zawartości z gry Dance Central lub Dance Central 2 jest płatne. Ponadto musisz mieć token importu dołączony do wcześniejszej wersji gry.</em></p>
<p>po drugie: <em>Wprowadź 25-cyfrowy kod wydrukowany na tylnej okładce podręcznika do gry Dance Central 2.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Uwaga Pomiń ten krok, jeśli gra Dance Central 2 została pobrana z usługi Gry na żądanie.</em><br />
<br />
po trzecie musisz kupić Dance Central Export Pack, którą to możliwość powinieneś mieć właśnie podczas procesu importu piosenek. co jest napisane na Twoim kodzie który masz przy DC3?</p>
