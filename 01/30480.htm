<h2>            Transfer chat history from laptop to phone</h2>
                    Due to the recent issues with Skype, I lost my chat history on my phone, aside from last 30 days. Is it possible to transfer the complete chat history from my laptop to my phone? I know it's the main.db file but not sure if it can be transferred. Anyone
 know?

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know how important this is for you. However, there are certain features on the classic Skype app that isn't available yet on the New Skype app. The new Skype app is now using the cloud infrastructure for instant messaging, and we do not have a physical
 access to its content.</span></p>

<p>Original Title: Vista and XP network problem.</p>
<p>I have Vista Home Basic in my laptop and XP pro PC. My laptop is connected to XP pro by HP docking station with RJ-45 cable (red). The problem is that Vista cannot see XP and XP cannot see Vista. View full map error message is: Windows cannot start mapping
 on the adaptor. Please make sure the adaptor is connected and enabled. The adapter in the HP laptop (Vista) is Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet, and XP have Realtek RTL 8169/8110 Family Gigabit Ethernet NIC, both works well. Network connection diagnose:
 Windows did not find any problems with your internet connections and I can see the computers communicate with each others. I have installed LLTD to my XP and it is enabled but in my laptop (Vista) there is not LLTD appearing in the network connection properties.
 Should it be? Network map diagnose: Windows did not find any problems with your internet connections. I followed the instructions of troubleshoot problems with computers not appearing on the network map but I did not get any help. Firewalls are disabled. I'm
 starting to be desperate.</p>

Let’s follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong><br />
You may disable the security softwares temporarily on both the computers and check if you are able to establish the connection.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Later turn on the security softwares after the test.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong><br />
Additionally, check for the workgroup name on both the computers are same.<br />

<h2>            Problems with Windows 7 not being genuine</h2>
                    
<p>I have bought a laptop for my partner and after a week the pre-installed windows 7 is now saying that it is not genuine - even when doing the valisation test on the microsoft website. After calling Microsoft tech support a number of times and being cut off
 by them when they cannot fix the issue (and spending lots of money as we are travelling, we are still no further on. I've read lots of similar issues with this and we have tried them all - trying to activate through system properties (couldn't see where to
 activate), looking on the Microsoft website to check and validate (it says it's not a genuine copy even though it came pre-installed on the laptop), typing in the slui.exe 4 to activate by phone (this is where we've been passed around and around and then cut
 off three times now when they can't help). No one seems to be able to get us to the page to put in the information (product key). Now we're not sure what to do or how to get it resolved. We were told that we would need to pay 46 pounds to get assistance from
 a consultant - surely that's not right.&nbsp;Can anyone please help??</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Tskbar hides behind maximized desktop app &#40;with all corner options&#41;&#33;</h2>
                    When I maximize a windows application like Google Chrome, in Windows 8, the&nbsp;task-bar&nbsp;(that I placed at the top of the screen) becomes hidden. If I switch to a non maximized app the&nbsp;task-bar&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;available. A maximized app also hides the search charm
 the start screen and all the corner options. This really is very annoying and a serious bug for power users like myself.

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that when you maximize any Windows application, the task bar becomes hidden and the maximized application hides the charms bar and the start screen as well. We’ll help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to understand the issue better;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Does this happen only when you maximize certain programs or with all the programs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to first create a new user account and check if the issue persists in the new user account as well. Refer this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-user-account</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you face the same issue in the new user account as well, I would suggest you to perform a system restore to restore the computer settings to an earlier state. Refer the section “Restore your PC to an earlier point” in this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remain unresolved, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</p>

            This happened the moment I started using windows 8 and upgraded from windows 7. It's&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;across all maximized programs and even programs maximized by me sizing it manually (using the corners) not just hitting the maximize button.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It appears that the taskbar is treated as a "program" instead of an overlay. If I size the program a little less than then fullscreen and select the visible portion of the taskbar it comes back to normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Not to be offensive</b>&nbsp;but your solution is for me to <i>create a new user</i>&nbsp;that is not a viable option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. I'm also very upset about how the new Microsoft Accounts work and don't like that everything requires a Microsoft Live account to use. From a system administrator's point of view this is terrible. I wouldn't want the user hindered from using the Microsoft
 App's but if I have to choose Account Security and Stability over Microsoft App's, I'll do it.</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I also have the same problem, both my task bar and charms bar disappears behind some maximised applications. I have had this same issue with two different computers, and I have formatted both and to see IF I can fix the problem. I've had this problem for
 months now, but it is getting really annoying.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Both my pc's have nVidia graphics cards, and I have tried different drivers and different cards, at first I thought it was a layering problem, but I could not find anything to fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Either way, any help would be appreciated.</div>

            <p>I have tried re-installing Windows, unfortunately re-installing does not fix the problem. I now have a total of 4 pc's running Windows 8.1, and all of them have exactly this problem. But&nbsp;I've learned to live with it, and if I do need to access the taskbar
 when it's behind an app, I just press "Windows Key" + "T".<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here's a few other options you may want to explore and see if it works for you:<br />
If you're using a dual screen setup, you could try to enable the "Show taskbar on all displays" in the "Taskbar and Navigation properties". So when the taskbar is hidden on one screen, you may find it on the second screen.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third party app called Display Fusion gives you the option to keep the task bar always on top of the maximised applications - but I find the app to be a bit too pricey just to fix the taskbar.<br />
<br />
You may also want to look at Pokki or start8, both of these had the "Always on Top" as a feature request back in 2012, but I am uncertain if the feature was ever added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>You should be able to print the whole screen&gt;Press&gt;the Fn Key + prt sc Key at the same time. Then go for example to a word document and press Clt + V to paste the results in the document.</p>

            <p>Yo are going to have to take an intermediate operation of copying what you want to print to the Windows clipboard, pasting the Windows clipboard into another program that has a printing function and then printing the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also use the Windows Snipping tool to capture the part of the screen you want to print to the Windows clipboard and paste (Ctrl-V) that into another program that has a printing function and then printing the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you press the Print Scrn key that will copy the entire screen to the Windows clipboard where you can then paste (Ctrl-V) it into another program like MS Word, MS Paint, etc. that has a printing function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you press and hold the Alt key and <em>then </em>press Print Scrn that will copy just the active Window (not the whole screen) to the Windows clipboard where you can then paste (Ctrl-V) it into another program like MS Word, MS Paint, etc. that has a printing
 function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the clipboard has been copied into whatever program you are going to use, I like to perform a Print Preview first to see what it's going to look like then decide to print or make another shot of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a few practice runs until you get the hang of it.</p>

    <title>Change User Account name error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weseggins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change User Account name error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p><span><span>I changed my User Account name from ‘OLD’ to ‘NEW’ following the steps in Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Change your account name.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The problem is that the User folder has not been renamed - it is still C:\Users\OLD.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Explorer shows a User Icon for 'NEW' which takes me to of my User Files in C:\Users\OLD.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>So it seems the renaming process did not do its job fully – the User folder needs to be renamed ‘NEW’.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Can someone advise me how to do that?</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I'm on Windows 10 64-bit Home, ver 10.0.14393. I can activate the Windows built-in Administrator if required but am reluctant to rename a User folder without
 advice.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Wes, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you rename a user account in Windows 10, the user profile path will not change as it may cause some serious issue. The only way to achieve this, is to create a new local user and transfer the files manually in the user profile folder to the newly created
 user profile folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you send your suggestions or feature request through your Feedback Hub at let our engineers know on how we can improve your Windows 10 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance. </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a prompt response. I have these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please clarify "transfer the files manually in the user profile folder ...". Do you mean Copy ALL sub-folders (and therefore files) in C:\Users\OLD\*.*&nbsp;to C:\Users\NEW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?&nbsp; (ie Application Data, Contacts, Cookies, et etc)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once that is done successfully, I can I delete the OLD User Account and Files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I assume I would need to&nbsp;login as Administrator (Windows built-in Admin) to perform the operation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Wes</p>

    <title>I regret buying the Xbox one S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwsmoothshifter  say:</h3>
<h2>            I regret buying the Xbox one S</h2>
                    <p>I bought the xbox one s, primarily for the Forza series. The first few months, it's been a nice console, but lately it's been having unsolvable problems. I've owned it for only 12 Months so far and up until now I am unable to connect it to the Internet without having to reset my router everytime, the GameDVR video recordings are all stuttering, so there is no point in recording your gameplay, because the quality is pure rubbish and the console&nbsp;itself makes the most annoying sqeeucking noises, which there is also no solution for. There is also no proper contact method to get some support from Microsoft, as there is no email... Just a live agent which seems to never connect anyways. I never had any problems with my PlayStation 3, which really shows the difference in build quality between the consoles. Definitely not going to buy an xbox ever again in the future, as the problems never go away and microsoft makes no effort in finding solutions, hope this post will prevent other people

Simple (or complicated as the case may be) as that. If resetting the router fixes the problem, that should start one to thinking. Game DVR recordings are stored on the cloud, so if there's already a network issue going on it shouldn't come as a surprise that the video would be laggy.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
If needed check this&nbsp;-<br />
<br />
From the Desktop either use WINKEY + X - Run - type in RegEdit&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
OR&nbsp; put the cursor in the lower left corner of the Desktop - Right Click - Run - type in
<br />
RegEdit.<br />
<br />
Click on the plus signs (+) next to the following folders <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class<br />
\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right Click on the key in the Left Pane - Export it so you can reverse in case of a mistake.
<p>Save as Remove-Filters.reg&nbsp; (any name is ok with .reg as extension).</p>
<p>In the Right Pane look for any of these = UpperFilters&nbsp;- LowerFilters&nbsp;- UpperFilters.bak
<br />
- LowerFilters.bak&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any exist Right Click on them - Delete <br />
(There may not be any of those and if not this is not the fix.)</p>
<p><br />
Close&nbsp;RegEdit<br />
<br />
Reboot <br />
<br />
If you do not need the .reg file you saved then you can delete it.<br />
<br />

<h2>            SCREENSAVER STOPPED WORKING IN WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    My Screensaver has stopped working. I have changed the settings several times in the Control Panel but instead of screensaver coming on the screen just goes blank. Nothing seems to work to get it going again.

    <title>Caught in a Boot Cycle - Can&#39;t Start Windows XP Media Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> westlake oh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caught in a Boot Cycle - Can&#39;t Start Windows XP Media Edition after Windows Automatic Updates &#40;15&#41; were applied.</h2>
                    
<p>When restarting my system, I am offered an option of 1) Windows XP Media Edition or 2) MS Windows Recovery Console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I select XP Media Edition OS; the Windows Advanced Options Menu offers: 1) Safe Mode, 2) Safe Mode with Networking, 3) Safe Mode with command Prompt, 4) Enable Boot Logging, 5) Enable VGA Mode, 6) Last Know Good Configuration, 7) Directory Services
 Restore Mode, 8) Debugging Mode, 9) Disable automatic restart on system failure, and 10) Start Windows normally.</p>
<p>I've tried each option.&nbsp; Except for 6) Last known good configuration, all of them start the process, show the Windows splash screen, a blue screen for a micro-second flash, then goes blank, and then the boot process starts over.</p>
<p>The Last known good configuration option leads to a BSD that says to "Disable or ininstall any anti-virus, disk defrag or backup utilities.&nbsp; Check hard drive config and for updated drivers.&nbsp; Run CHKDSK /f to check for corruption and then restart your computer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of which I am able to do because of the loop and BSD.&nbsp; I have to turn off the computer to remove the blue screen.</p>
<p>I have an HP m7689n Media Center PC with XP Media Edition SP3.&nbsp; I keep it current with automatic updates.&nbsp; Using the System Recovery CD I created for my system, I ran the PC Tools Utility and all items passed.</p>
<p>Is there a way to access the System Restore Points to get a good boot?&nbsp; The System Recovery Option is not a good choice at this point because the risk of losing data on my hard drives is too great.</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thesupport line at the number you provided said there is no free support on my issue from them because the XP Media Edition was installed as OEM.&nbsp; They suggested 1) $60 for support, 2) Their website, or 3) HP.</p>
<p>HP said it was an update issue.&nbsp; The web site wasn't any help, and my experience with MS tech support makes me think it isn't worth $60.00.</p>

<div>If that is the case, perhaps PA Bear will add that info to his future replies about PCSAFETY - no free update support from Microsoft for OEM systems!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes, booting issues after MS updates are caused by a system problem (perhaps malicious software) that was already on the system and did not</div>
<div>manifest itself until the update was applied (like security updates).</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot,&nbsp;AVG, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD? &nbsp;This is not the same as any System Recovery type CDs that might have come with your system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you know you installed 15 updates, do you know which ones? &nbsp;You can uninstall most updates individually from the XP Recovery Console,&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;long enough to get running, fix the real problems and then reapply the update(s).</div>
<div><br />
<div>XP is configured to automatically start on a system failure like a BSOD, but you can tell it not to.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you can only boot in Safe Mode and are seeing a BSOD, from the Safe Mode options menu,&nbsp;choose the option that tells XP not to restart automatically on a system failure:</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Then you can see the BSOD when it happens again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide when you see one:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Streaming browser to TV&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streaming browser to TV&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I'd like to know if it's possible to stream my laptop when browsing the net, to my TV - I have a Samsung Smart TV and a Sony Vaio laptop running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I already use the laptop to stream videos/photos to my TV using the 'Play To' option but I don't know how to do the same if I'm streaming a video via a browser (typically Chrome). &nbsp;I've heard a few things about Miracast/WiDI etc so I'd like to know if my
 device is compatible before spending money on a Chromecast...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. </p>
<ul>
<li>Which wireless device are you using to connect with Micracast?</li></ul>
<p>Miracast does support Windows 8.1. In order to connect Miracast technology, you are required to use a wireless device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, you may refer to <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-display-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter</a></strong>. This is the device that you are required to use in order to use Miracast technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information explains more. I will be happy answer more queries if you have.</p>

<p>........ "</p>
<p>When you install the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, it will also install the .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and the .NET Framework 3.0 SP2 behind the scenes. You cannot use the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 unless you also have the .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2 installed.
 Therefore, you will not be allowed to uninstall the .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 or 3.0 SP2 if you have the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installed. If you try to uninstall those versions of the .NET Framework, their uninstall processes will block and tell you that they
 are needed by another application on your system.</p>
<p>The .NET Framework 1.0 and .NET Framework 1.1 can be installed side-by-side with the .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5. Most applications that were created for the .NET Framework 1.0 or 1.1 will automatically use the .NET Framework 2.0 instead if it is installed
 on the system. In most cases, that means you do not need to keep the .NET Framework 1.0 or 1.1 installed on your system if you already have the .NET Framework 2.0 installed.
</p>
<p>However, there are some applications that are configured to require a specific version of the .NET Framework, even if later versions of the .NET Framework are installed. ....."</p>

<p>There are currently five released versions of the .NET Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>The .NET Framework 4</li><li>The .NET Framework 3.5<br />
<br />
Service Pack 1 (SP1) is the latest service pack.</li><li>The .NET Framework 3.0<br />

Service Pack 1 (SP1) is the latest service pack.</li><li>The .NET Framework 1.0<br />
Service Pack 3 (SP3) is the latest service pack.</li></ul>
<p>You may have several versions of the .NET Framework installed on your computer. Each version of the .NET Framework can co-exist with the other versions on the computer.</p>

            <p>TaurArian:&nbsp; Thanks for your very comprehensive response.&nbsp; Little wonder your an MVP!!!</p>
<p>I'm making progress here but it's very frustrating, to say nothing about time consuming!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was able to remove a couple of the older .NET Frameworks thanks to the FIX IT tool, but I retained
</p>
<p>.NET Framework 3.5 SP1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As soon as I had done that, I was notified to download two others:&nbsp; as you say...they are
</p>
<p>.NET Framework 2.0 SP2</p>
<p>.NET Framework 3.0 SP2.</p>
<p>Then I received a rush of updates, ten in all.&nbsp; Of that ten, four would not install.&nbsp; which is better than what I've experienced over the last few months, but still very frustarting!&nbsp; The Error code is the
 all too familiar 0x645.</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm having problems installing some programs and also in removing programs, so there's some over-riding issue with my computer I feel!</p>
<p>Any further thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks, Derek S.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post dated May 2012 was on my desktop whcih I no longer use.&nbsp; My recent post(s) are on a laptop whcih I've seldom used but is over four years old.&nbsp; When I transferred my data, the problems apparently transferred also.&nbsp; At time of writing, there are three
 updates whcih won't instal.&nbsp; They are: </p>
<div><span>Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 SP2 on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP x86 (KB2604110)</span><br />
<span>Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 SP2 on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP x86 (KB2656407)</span><br />
<span>Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008 x86 (KB2604111)</span><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: that this is much better in as much as it's fewer than I have had problems with.&nbsp; (At the height, there were ten that wouldn't install)&nbsp; So...we're making progress!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply,
<strong>preferably <em>without</em> quoting&nbsp;my post</strong>: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the laptop-in-question?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Was it brand-new computer or a used computer when you got it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. Was the WinXP Desktop fully-patched at Windows Update when you stopped using it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. When (approx. date) did you transfer the data from the WinXP Desktop to the laptop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2c. Did you transfer the data to the laptop via a flash drive, a CD/DVD, or a local network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2d. Did you scan the data with at least two (2) reputable online scanners (e.g., ESET; Kaspersky; BitDefender; Housecall; etc.)
<em>before </em>you transferred the data to the laptop's HDD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3a. When (exact date, preferably) did you run the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
.NET Framework Cleanup Tool</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3b. Which .NET Framework versions did you remove using the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3c. After you ran the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool, were .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and.NET Framework 3.0 SP2 offered via Windows Update as Optional (non-security) updates? [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When (exact date, preferably) did you first install AVG Free? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. When (exact date, preferably) did you first install <em>Microsoft Security Essentials</em> (MSE)? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. When (exact date, preferably) did you remove MSE using the removal tool mention in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">
this thread</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8a. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8b. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the brand-new (I assume)&nbsp;laptop when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following

            <p>In reply to your list of questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a:&nbsp; June 2007.</p>
<p>1b:&nbsp; Brand new.&nbsp; Came with Vista OS.&nbsp; I changed it to WinXP Pro.</p>
<p>2a:&nbsp; It was fully patched when I stopped using it.</p>
<p>2b:&nbsp; Approximately mid-October 2012.</p>
<p>2c:&nbsp; Via flash-drive.</p>
<p>2d:&nbsp; No...I did not.&nbsp; I did scan the computer with AVG.</p>
<p>3a:&nbsp; Very recently.&nbsp; Like three days ago January 1st.&nbsp; I didn't know about it prior to that.</p>
<p>3b:&nbsp; Sorry cannot recall.&nbsp; It MAY have been 1.1 SP1, but not sure.</p>
<p>3c:&nbsp; Not as Optional Updates.&nbsp; Just updates to be installed.&nbsp; I knew that they were essential to 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p>4:&nbsp; Cannot recall exact date, but it must ahve been mid-November.&nbsp; I had been having problems with MSE and dedcided to remove it, but then started to have problms removing it.&nbsp; It is now removed.</p>
<p>5:&nbsp; First installed MSE in July 2009.</p>
<p>6:&nbsp; Don't recall exact date but emoved MSE in late November 2012.</p>
<p>7: AVG Free.&nbsp; I uninstalled it but it wouldn't uninstall completely!&nbsp; Until recently, that is.</p>
<p>8a:&nbsp; I think Macafee was, but I uninstalled it as it was slowing my computer down too much.</p>
<p>8b: Macafee.</p>
<p>9: MOST of these updates are installed, but not all.&nbsp; The updates which DON'T appear are: KB2661254, KB2749655, KB2724197, KB2705219, KB2712808.</p>
<p>10a:&nbsp; No...Java (TM) 6 Update 33 is installed.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; when I use the Java Verification tool, it doesn't read anything, indicating pehaps that ther's a problem there too.</p>
<p>10b:&nbsp; Yes...I have this version of Adobe installed.</p>
<p>11 I installed Chrome yesterday to help me resolve another issue I'm having with a WordPress plu-in.&nbsp; The WP people say that I'm having IE issues.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; No I don't use Registry Cleaners, but perhaps I have used AVG PC Tune up once.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I haven't done a repair install on my WinXP on the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope these answers help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In #3c of my previous reply, I was <em>not</em> referring to KB2604110, KB2656407 or KB2604111.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IN RE your answer #6 ("Don't recall exact date but removed MSE in late November 2012"), one notes that you found out about the MSE removal tool earlier this week (i.e., 01 January 2013); cf.
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_scanning/my-mse-doesnt-work-and-i-cannot-remove-it/9b7e4e60-3f1d-430d-b04f-081e618d9841">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. Were AVG Free <em>and MSE</em> both installed &amp; loading at boot?</p>

<p>3. What, if any, anti-virus application is installed now and <em>when (exact date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any) <em>expire? </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a. Had your McAfee subscription (or&nbsp;the free-trial period) <em>already expired</em> by the time you replaced it with AVG Free, MSE&nbsp;or any other anti-virus application?</p>

<p>7b. The WordPress plugin issue notwithstanding, is&nbsp;IE8 working OK otherwise?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Can you successfully access <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> via IE8 (<em>only!</em>)? ...and run a CUSTOM scan?&nbsp;...and if so, is KB2798897 offered &amp; successfully installed?</p>

<h2>            Sending an employees Skype details to schedule meeting</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an executive assistant, and when I schedule Skype meetings for my boss, I would like to send his Skype details using Outlook, so the other attendees can join meeting through the link. When I try to schedule Skype Meeting, a notification pops up reading
 that I don't have the required permission to schedule Skype meetings on his behalf. I've been copying and pasting his details from previous meetings, but when he/others join the meeting, the top of the Skype window labels the meeting incorrectly (using the
 name of the meeting that I copied and pasted the Skype details from).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how I can schedule Skype meetings on his behalf without changing any settings. Or, where can I find his standard Skype details to join a meeting through the link that will yield an untitled meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kathryn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the person you’re scheduling the meeting for needs to add you as a delegate in their Outlook calendar and in Skype for Business. Then you can set up Skype for Business Meetings. For more details, you can follow the link below:</p>

<h2>            What does the out of warranty exchange accomplish exactly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my only option on the service menu is an out of warranty exchange. I was wondering, does this mean they'll just take my faulty console, switch it out, and call it a day, or will there also be repairs involved? I have enough to exchange it if the first scenario is the case, but I'm kind of tight on funds at the moment and if it means they'll only&nbsp;temporarily exchange for $115 and charge me for repairs as well, I'm kind of out of luck.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p><p>KhaosBryant</p>

    <title>Solitare Game Sometimes Locks Up After Watching Ads - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Solitare Game Sometimes Locks Up After Watching Ads</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the new Microsoft Solitaire Collection in Windows 10.&nbsp; But rarely what happens is that after watching an ad (With the prompt afterwards to get a Wild Card or a Free Deal) the Action Center displays a message that will say "Graphics Driver has stopped
 working, but has recovered. about two or three times.&nbsp; I was playing the Pyramid version of Solitaire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the computer does not totally freeze all the Start Menu tiles do freeze and you have to reboot to get the tiles to work again.&nbsp; This is a brand new Dell PC with the bare-bones on it.&nbsp; Nothing that would conflict.&nbsp; This is the first time it happened.&nbsp;
 And it happened when I requested a Wild Card.&nbsp; Yesterday, I requested Wild Cards and Free Deals and the only ad was a KFC ad, which played fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I cannot remember the ad that caused the graphics driver hiccup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, Microsoft will be able to fix this with their commitment to keeping Windows 10 updated.&nbsp; Also, I do not have a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; I am an Administrator, with a local account on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack </p>

    <title>Xbox 1 VS Xbox 360 downloadable content and free games or system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwaynemartin40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 1 VS Xbox 360 downloadable content and free games or system link&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>I have an xbox 360 and an xbox 1.&nbsp; Why don’t the system link so I can play against other family members in the house using both systems?&nbsp; You would think that as much as it coast it would be able to do this.&nbsp; Will there be some type of software patch to
 make this happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will all the downloadable content that’s available for the 360 be available for xbox 1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A POST FROM BELOW I AGREE WITH</p>
<p>Maac N Cheese</p>
<p>First off it's a great machine, however a lot of the functionality seems to have taken a step backwards.&nbsp; I should be able to have ALL the options my xbox 360 had and then some.&nbsp; Right now I feel that I've just bought a machine that was soley made to bridge
 the gap between my cable box and my TV.&nbsp; My Xbox 360 is a better machine overall at this point as far as menus and their clarity / functionality etc.&nbsp; Here's what I feel is missing or what needs to be fixed.&nbsp; FWIW</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Party Chat's functionality - sometimes it works, majority of the time it doesn't even work.&nbsp; Also when a party is setup or I'm joining a party i should start in party chat mode.&nbsp; That's why i joined the party.&nbsp; Force me to turn OFF party chat if that
 wasn't my intention.&nbsp; From the get go it should be on and i shouldn't have to click yet another button to get into party chat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Ability to adjust chat volume / game volume -- where did that go!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Show me when friends log on - or at least an option to turn that feature on or off</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Friends list - want to be able to permanently sort by online only - without having to dig through 3-4 menus and click 3-4 buttons before seeing who's actually online, etc.&nbsp; Also i want to keep the settings i chose, ie. show online only, or only show favorites.&nbsp;
 I have to change this every time i start my machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Followers - want to be able to remove followers so I don't HAVE to see them in my 'feed' - maybe i only want to see what 1 or 2 or 5 people have going on - not all 100+</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Feed customization - i don't care what achievements anyone gets, give me some options so i can turn on or off what i see in my feed.&nbsp; See also followers, i don't want to see all my followers in my 'feed'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Headsets.&nbsp; Right now 3rd party headsets are great for sound, but they're un-usable when it comes to chatting with friends in game.&nbsp; The kinect doesn't cut it and is impractical to use as a mic.&nbsp; Fix that pronto!&nbsp; It's a real mood killer playing any games
 right now with the lack of 'chatting with friends / party' with the clear connectivity the xbox 360 already has.&nbsp; Baffled how many small things like this were overlooked or removed (step backwards) for a 'next generation' console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Pins / Customized Home page.&nbsp; Right now i can customize my 'pins' but I'd rather 'pin' those things to my home page so it's more customized when i initially log on.&nbsp; I don't want to have to scroll left or right to get to my 'customized' home page so
 to speak.&nbsp; (hope that makes sense).&nbsp; Maybe pinned apps / games should ALWAYS stay on the front page someplace, like where my 'history' of games / apps lives instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Not sure how this is fixable but man it's just dumb.&nbsp; Why does my XBOX ONE HAVE to lay flat.&nbsp; It's a space hog.&nbsp; My xbox 360 works standing upright, however my XBOX ONE will NOT work if it's upright.&nbsp; This is a horrible design if that's the case.&nbsp; Again,
 a step backwards IMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's all i can think of off the top of my head but i'm sure more will come to me.&nbsp; The XBOX ONE should be everything the xbox 360 already is AND more.&nbsp; Right now it's just....something else, like some designer got a chance to make their mark and made it
 a bit more complicated with less functionality.&nbsp; I hope these things get resolved fairly quickly.&nbsp; I also realize this is all new, I just hope MS listens and makes the appropriate changes ASAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 million % agree with every thing you say,&nbsp; and i think every one will agree.</p>

<p>@OP your very first complaint is being tested by the community Preview Squad as we speak! Myself and others have pushed very hard for that option to return!</p>
<p>The dev team Listened and this option will be available amongst you and the general public sometime in April.</p>
<p>As 24 said most of those other issues have been fixed! And system linking a 360 and a One? Sounds like a play on words for backwards compatibility!</p>
<p>My opinion on BC. If it happens and they take time out of new game production to bring me old games i will simply throw my consoles off a cliff and record it so they know how disappointed i was!</p>

            <p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Hi,</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>You may hear feedback from your PC speakers when one or more of the following conditions are true:</font></font></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><font color="#000000"><font>You increase the Microphone Boost option.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><font>The speakers are too close to the microphone.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><font>The speaker volume is turned up so as the microphone hears the speakers.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><font>You have a very sensitive microphone.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li></ul>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Here are various steps listed to resolve the issue. Hopefully one of these helps you in removing the echo.<br />
<br />
</font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Step 1:<br />
</b>The first check you may perform here is whether there is any loose connection as this can very much induce echo.<br />
<br />
</font></font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Step 2:<br />
</b>Do you have microphone connected? If so mute the mic and test. It could be a feedback.<br />
1. Right-click on sound icon in the taskbar and select “<b>Recording Devices</b>”.<br />
2. Highlight the microphone and select “<b>Properties</b>”.<br />
3. Go to Levels tab and drag the slider to the extreme left.<br />
4. This mutes the microphone. <br />
By dragging the slider towards right, you may turn on the microphone volume and adjust accordingly.<br />
</font></font><b><br />
<font color="#000000">Step 3:</font></b><br />
<font><font color="#000000">Test the sound from Control Panel.<br />
1. Here’s how: Right-click on sound icon in the taskbar and select “<b>Playback Devices</b>”.<br />
2. Highlight on the Speaker and select “<b>Properties</b>”.<br />
3. Go to “<b>Advanced</b>” Tab and click on Test. Is there any echo?</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000">Step 4:<br />
</font></span></b><span><font color="#000000">You may try disabling audio enhancements if that improves anything.<br />
Here’s how:<br />
1. Open Sound by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type sound, and then click Sound.<br />
2. On the <b>Playback tab</b>, click Speakers, and then click Properties.<br />
3. Click the <b>Enhancements </b>tab, and then select the <b>Disable all enhancements</b> check box.<br />
If you don't see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.<br />
</font><b><br />
<font color="#000000">Step 5:<br />
</font></b><font color="#000000">If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated.<br />
If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, check to see if an updated driver is available for your computer.<br />
<br />
Do one of these:<br />
• Visit the Web site of the computer manufacturer if the device came with the computer.<br />
• Visit the Web site of the device manufacturer if the device was installed after you purchased your computer.<br />
• Visit the Web site of the device manufacturer if the device was preinstalled on your computer and the computer manufacturer does not have an updated driver.<br />

<p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By design Windows 10 can set photos as background computer. The Active Desktop has long been discontinued that enables user to insert url of Google calendar to be the screen background.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check Microsoft Store to possibly get similar application&nbsp; that will suite your needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you send us feedback regarding that feature. Please follow the following steps in sending us feedback:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in <span style="font-weight: bold">
Cortana search</span>, then launch the app</p>
<p>2. Navigate to <span style="font-weight: bold">Feedback</span> in the left menu, then press
<p>3. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold">Problem</span>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory</p>
<p>4. <span style="font-style: italic">Important:</span> If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking
Start capture</span>) near the end of the form; <span style="font-weight: bold">Stop monitoring</span> when you’re done</p>
<p>5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Submit</span></p>
<p>6. Click <span style="font-weight: bold">Continue using Feedback Hub</span></p>
<p>7. Click <span style="font-weight: bold">My feedback</span> at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear)</p>

<h2>            win 10, dual lan setup&#63; force specific app traffic through eth2&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've never tried this before but I figured there has got to be a way to do this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two lan ports on my computer.&nbsp;Lan1 is connected to a 192.168 network with high bandwidth but a data cap. lan2 is connected to a 10.1 with another data connection that's slower but NO data cap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like all my normal surfing to go thorough the lan1 and have a slow but high data hog (torrent) running through lan2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be done? I've tried searching and found some information about making routes, but I'm beyond stumped on the right way to do that or if that'll work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even thought about using hyper-v (first time loading it today) and tie the VM into the lan2. looks the most promising. though I'd like to make sure the main environment isn't trying to send data over lan2.</p>
