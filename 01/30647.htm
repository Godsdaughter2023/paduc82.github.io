<p>I had the same problem this week.&nbsp; It did an update and everything is gone -p like a new PC.&nbsp; Over 10 years of documents, pics, programs all gone. &nbsp; I haven't tried restoring backups or recovery yet.&nbsp; Now searching online it appear Microsoft was aware of
 this problem.&nbsp; "Where is the earning - the support??????</p>
<p>I've lost trust for Microsoft.&nbsp; It will be a long time before I feel my data is safe, if ever.</p>

            Hi Diane
<br />
<br />1
<br />Most likely, you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!
<br />
<br />
<br />2
<br />If none of the above works for you:
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
        </p>

<p>I'm working with Microsoft phone support now.&nbsp; They had me try 5 restarts which did not help in my case.&nbsp; They had me look at the C: drive for a Windows old file which I did not have.&nbsp; At that point they escalated my case to Level 2.&nbsp; They will call me back
 tomorrow.&nbsp; No charges.&nbsp; You might want to try them first before paying the Geeks.</p>

<p>Wait ... there's something a little ...&nbsp;<em>odd</em> here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who told you that you would "lose support" if you didn't update your computer? No one from Microsoft would say that, because it makes no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else that's odd:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A genuine update that comes from Microsoft would not "erase EVERYTHING on my computer." That also makes no sense, because updates do not have that ability. If an update&nbsp;<em>did</em> routinely erase computers, we would all know about that by now and Microsoft
 would have quickly withdrawn the update. It's withdrawn updates before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leaves two possibilities:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- You've been hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- You setup your computer in such a way that 'everything' would be erased by an update. But that's
<em>very</em> unlikely, no matter how inexperienced you are. A person has to <em>
deliberately</em> operate their computer in such a way that it&nbsp;would get erased by an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you would have to deliberately continue to operate your computer in a temporary profile after being advised that you were signed in to one, and by chance never had an opportunity to restart your computer since that time (or simply avoided doing
 so.) In that case, the restart needed to finish installing an update would erase everything you've done on the computer
<em>since the time you were switched to a temporary profile.</em> But even then, that wouldn't erase 'everything' because you still have all that you did on the computer
<em>before</em> you were switched to a temporary profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you would have to deliberately, ever since you received the computer, store all your files in folders that are likely (but not
<em>guaranteed</em>) to be erased by installing an update. But who does that? It makes no sense to do that, no matter how little someone knows about computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful if you define what you mean by "EVERYTHING." Does that mean there's&nbsp;<em>nothing</em> left on your hard drive? An update simply cannot do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, based on what you've told us, my guess is that you were hacked.</p>

            It did the same on my wife's computer. I went back to a previous version of Windows 10 and everything was there like it was before this absurd update.

    <title>External Hard Drive Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjnagy  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Hard Drive Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am just curious I have been reading about people seeing shorten load times, better performance, etc. Has anyone seen issues with externals. I have a 2TB Seagate Freeagent USB 3.0 drive attached and what I am actually seeing is issues with the game
 momentarily freezing and then picking backup. Originally tried installing Tomb Raider DE and was seeing the freezing during cutscenes. I have since moved Watch Dogs over to the external and I am seeing the issue also during gameplay. I am not sure if it is
 with the One's HD support, cache or my external. I was going to try and delete the game then reinstall. Does anyone know if I do delete are the save games on the external and if I delete the game will I also lose my saves</p>

<p>Any thoughts, comments, etc are welcome</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am experiencing an external hard drive issue. Just purchased a WD 2TB hard drive, formatted and installed one game on it so far - Batman Arkham Knight. My issue: When I first turn on my xbox and sign into my account, I have the option of starting my game,
 so I select the tile with the disc emblem - The initial load picture of batman shows up on the screen for about 20 sec, then I get kicked back to my home page with an error code saying that it "took too long to load". If I "quit" the batman game, and select
 to reload it, I get the same initial load picture of batman, but only for about 5 seconds. I get kicked back to the home screen quickly like the game doesn't even want to try and load. No error code is given this time. Is this a known issue with some external
 HDs? - note all of my other games on my internal drive have never given me this issue. This is the only time I have seen it is with loading a game from the external drive. Thanks for your assistance :)
</p>

<p>thanks ron, sorry that doesn't answer my question which was probably put forth in error.&nbsp; I upgraded my computer to raise my experience index.&nbsp; I received these high marks in processor subscore, graphics subscore and gaming graphics subscore. but my harddrive
 subscore was 59 using a 500 GB harddrive installed with 8 GB of Ram.&nbsp; I installed 16 GB or Ram and a 2 TB harddrive with a 6 Gb/s transfer spec, but my subscore stayed at 59.&nbsp; I&nbsp; assumed it would go up in the upper range of the 7.9 limit.&nbsp; I was curious as
 to why that change did not take place.&nbsp; I wasn't looking for averages.&nbsp; I just don't understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi James</p>
<p>Please understand that the problem is the hard drive on that computer.</p>
<p>In the previous version of Windows (Vista) the possible maximum WEI score was 5.9 which is what you are seeing for the hard drive.</p>
<p>In Windows 7 the maximum score was increased to accomodate the newer technology that is available, such as Solid State hard drives (SSD).</p>
<p>You are still using a hard drive based on the older technology (spinning platter). Using a larger hard drive, increasing the RAM, processor speed, or newer, faster&nbsp;graphics device, will not do anything to increase that score.</p>
<p>The only way that you will see a higher hard drive score is to upgrade the hard drive to the newer SSD technology.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Yes, I tried Fixit too, no luck, anyway after 3 days of googling and trying everything I figured it out that .NET Framework Config files are all corrupted for some reason and I copied all the config files from \windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\config&nbsp;of
 a fresh Windows 7 32bit machine and all set.&nbsp;After this everything went back to normal and working fine. Prior to this fix I have also noticed that Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 as well broke and can't able to connect to any db and now all works fine! What
 a relief without reinstalling the whole OS!!!

<h2>            Why are Windows Updates so slow to download&#63;</h2>
                    Windows Updates download speed is very inconsistent.&nbsp; I just downloaded and installed a 29mb Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer; the process was fast, taking less than 5 minutes.&nbsp; But when I tried to download and install 5 Security Updates
 for Vista, 10mb total or less, the download ran for nearly 2 HOURS and the progress meter never got over 0%.&nbsp; I cancelled the download before it finished because I don't have time to wait.&nbsp; My internet connection is not the problem.&nbsp; I think the problem is
 with Microsoft's servers.&nbsp; Date/Time of failed Update:&nbsp; Wednesday, 06/22/16, 5:30am (Eastern Daylight Savings Time).

            Hi SteveJagers:<br />
<br />
Many Vista SP2 and Win 7 SP1 users are currently having the same problem.&nbsp; A large number of Vista users first encountered these slow Windows Updates during their August 2015 Patch Tuesday updates (the month after Windows 10 was officially released on 29-Jul-2015).&nbsp;
 Like you, most observe that <strong>Windows Update only runs slowly if there are multiple updates available for download</strong> - see my screenshots in post # 90 of ScousaJAY's VistaForums thread
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/windows-updates/303992-windows-update-just-seems-hang-while-checking-post1406137.html#post1406137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>windows update just seems to hang while checking</em></a> under the username lmacri.&nbsp; I've also posted about this problem in my thread
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/august-2015-windows-update-for-vista-requires-one/1016829d-50d2-4a2b-91bc-5e1591f47c1b">
<em>August 2015 Windows Update for Vista Requires One Hour to Run to Completion</em></a> here in the MS Answers forum.<br />
<br />
If you run into the same problem next month after after Microsoft releases the July 2016 Patch Tuesday updates on 12-Jul-2016, just let your Windows Update run for
<strong>several hours</strong> to see if "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" eventually runs to completion.<br />
<br />
Alternately, you can try the <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong> posted on 16-Jun-2016 in m#l's thread
<em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3">Updates not working, it has been searching for updates for hours</a></em>.&nbsp; Most affected
 users find that this workaround decreases "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" from several hours to
<strong>~ 20 min</strong> when there are a large batch of updates available for download.
<br />
<br />
Those instructions are based on the how-to on Dalai's webpage <strong>Search for Windows Updates takes forever? - A possible solution
</strong>at <a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wu.krelay.de/en/</a> and take you through the process of finding any Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32K.sys) updates currently missing from your system, downloading the standalone
 update packages (.msu files) from the Microsoft Download Center, and pre-installing those missing updates (in order, from oldest to newest) before running Windows Update to install any remaining updates.<br />

</p><blockquote>Hi SteveJagers:<br />
<br />
Many Vista SP2 and Win 7 SP1 users are currently having the same problem.&nbsp; A large number of Vista users first encountered these slow Windows Updates during their August 2015 Patch Tuesday updates (the month after Windows 10 was officially released on 29-Jul-2015).&nbsp;
 Like you, most observe that <strong>Windows Update only runs slowly if there are multiple updates available for download</strong> - see my screenshots in post # 90 of ScousaJAY's VistaForums thread
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/windows-updates/303992-windows-update-just-seems-hang-while-checking-post1406137.html#post1406137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>windows update just seems to hang while checking</em></a> under the username lmacri.&nbsp; I've also posted about this problem in my thread
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/august-2015-windows-update-for-vista-requires-one/1016829d-50d2-4a2b-91bc-5e1591f47c1b">
<em>August 2015 Windows Update for Vista Requires One Hour to Run to Completion</em></a> here in the MS Answers forum.<br />
<br />
If you run into the same problem next month after after Microsoft releases the July 2016 Patch Tuesday updates on 12-Jul-2016, just let your Windows Update run for
<strong>several hours</strong> to see if "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" eventually runs to completion.<br />
<br />
Alternately, you can try the <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong> posted on 16-Jun-2016 in m#l's thread
<em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3">Updates not working, it has been searching for updates for hours</a></em>.&nbsp; Most affected
 users find that this workaround decreases "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" from several hours to
<strong>~ 20 min</strong> when there are a large batch of updates available for download.
<br />
<br />
Those instructions are based on the how-to on Dalai's webpage <strong>Search for Windows Updates takes forever? - A possible solution
</strong>at <a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wu.krelay.de/en/</a> and take you through the process of finding any Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32K.sys) updates currently missing from your system, downloading the standalone
 update packages (.msu files) from the Microsoft Download Center, and pre-installing those missing updates (in order, from oldest to newest) before running Windows Update to install any remaining updates.<br />
<br />
Note that this is only a <strong>temporary workaround</strong>.&nbsp; If Windows Update currently reports that no further updates are available for download you will have to check at
<a href="http://wu.krelay.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wu.krelay.de/en/</a> after

<p>
</p><p>Yes it's a temporary workaround BUT <strong>only Win7 SP1</strong> users have a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3161608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB3161608</a></strong> or
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3172605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB3172605</a></strong>, which contain
<strong>Windows Update Agent</strong> dated <strong>5/13/2016</strong>.&nbsp; V7.6.7601.23453 of the Windows Update Agent/Client contains "optimizations" that resolves the slow Windows Update scanning problems mentioned in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3161647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft KB article 3161647</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So only Vista SP2 users will have to keep on installing new <strong>WIN32K.SYS</strong> fixes on their PCs unless Microsoft figures out a way to offer a new
<strong>Windows Update Agent app</strong> that will permanently fix the problem.&nbsp; Currently the latest WUA for Vista SP2 is

            Im sick of the wait to be honest. &nbsp;There is no reason whatsoever for 2 sec. updates to take as long as they do. &nbsp;Im on here, I have things i want to do, and I cant control when updates happen, or turn them off so I can do what I need to do, then turn them
 on again when Im off my laptop. &nbsp;I understand sec updates are crucial, but the time it takes and the disk space that is used, i cant do anything until they finish.. WHY?

<p>Hi Jennie:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Extended support for Vista SP2 ended on 11-Apr-2017, but many Vista SP2 users have recently discovered that automatic Windows Updates have been hanging on the initial "<em>Checking for updates...</em>"&nbsp; phase and have failed to install available updates
 for several months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Vista SP2 operating system please see the step-by-step instructions on page 1 of m#l's thread
<strong><em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3">Updates not working, it has been searching for updates for hours</a></em></strong>
 for a possible workaround. There are five security updates listed in STEP # 2 of those instructions [<strong>KB3205638</strong> (rel. 13-Dec-2016);
<strong>KB4012583</strong> (rel. 14-Mar-2017); <strong>KB4015195, KB4015380 and KB4014661</strong> (rel. 11-Apr-2017)] and if any of those five updates are currently missing from your system they will have to be manually installed before Windows Update can
 run to completion and patch your Vista SP2 OS and IE9 browser as of April 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those instructions note that additional speed up patches will have to be pre-installed if you have
<strong>MS Office 2007, MS Office 2010 and/or the MS Office Compatibility Pack SP3</strong> installed.<br />

<h2>            How to find the cause and fix WHEA-UNCORRECTABLE-ERROR</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I recently purchased and assembled a computer for the first time with some friends. Recently, I've been experiencing multiple blue screens, all with the WHEA-UNCORRECTABLE-ERROR code.<br />
<br />
Before I go any further, let me list my parts (let me know if there's something necessary I left out):<br />
OS ~ Windows 10 Home 64-bit<br />
MOBO ~ ASUS Z87-PRO<br />
CPU ~ Intel i5 4690K @ 3.5GHz<br />
GPU ~ GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 970 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Driver version: 358.50<br />
RAM ~ 8GB x 2 Kingston HyperX Fury<br />
PSU ~ Corsair 650M<br />
Storage ~ SanDisk Ultra II SSD 480GB<br />
<br />
During the two days of using this computer, I've typically crashed while playing The Witcher 2 at various settings. I haven't checked what temperature my CPU was running at while playing as I haven't found a monitoring program yet, but I was using GPU-Z.0.8.5
 and my GPU was no higher than 45C when the latest crash occurred. I've also been playing Dota 2 and have experienced no crash, however, I crashed once while idle at the desktop, so I don't believe it's a temperature related issue.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I've ran mdsched at least 4 times with no issues reported. I have not checked my SSD for issues yet. Looking around, I've seen many recommend using chkdsk to look for any hard disk errors, but some have said that there's little point to checking
 an SSD with something like that. I've also double checked that everything is properly seated in the case as I remember having a little difficulty slotting the RAM and mounting the CPU fan &amp; heat sink.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm waiting to hear back from ASUS about some other questions around the motherboard, potential updates, and compatibility. I've never updated a BIOS or anything else motherboard related, so I don't even know if that's something that's done.<br />
<br />
Here is also all the minidumps that I have collected before writing this:<br />
https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D10DDDF2E161488B!121&amp;authkey=!AFHeAclmF5Vfcdw&amp;ithint=folder%2czip<br />
Again, please let me know if I need to add or edit anything.<br />
<br />
For whoever reads all of this and makes it here, thanks. I'm really looking forward to getting to the bottom of this.<br />
&nbsp;- Adrian<br />

            Thanks for the reply Kiran Kishore,<br />
<br />
I left my computer on for 8 hours while I was at work. Seeing as how one of my crashes was while it was idle at desktop, I thought that I could leave it alone and see if another blue screen occurred. Fortunately, or unfortunately, it was as I left it earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm
 not sure if I can actually run any games during safe mode to actually test all circumstances leading up to the crashes, so I could only try to recreate the idle incident.<br />
Does this mean that the default settings and drivers aren't an issue? If not, I'll continue to attempt to update my chipset drivers. With this, I need some guidance. Using the above asus support link (http://support.asus.com/download/options.aspx?SLanguage=en),
 I've come to here&nbsp;<br />
http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=Z87-PRO&amp;p=1&amp;s=45<br />
and after choosing Windows 10 64-bit, I'm not sure what I should be downloading. For example, on the expandable list, let's say I'm looking at the Chipset section. Should I be downloading version&nbsp;11.0.0.1155? I'm assuming this is the most &nbsp;recent version and,
 much like downloading drivers for a GPU, I only need the latest version. Am I correct? Additionally, are the Global (DLM), Global, and P2P simply options for how to obtain the files? Now, is there any particular order I should be downloading and installing
 these? Should I be ignoring the Qualified Vendor List? To me, it doesn't seem like a critical thing to update, but perhaps I'm wrong. This certainly isn't my area of expertise.<br />
<br />
I also took a look at the now all too familiar article about troubleshooting blue screen errors. I read further into&nbsp;<em>Blue screen error while using your PC</em> and I checked for updates using Windows Update. According to it, everything is up to date. As
 for removing new hardware, I'm not sure where to begin as all of the hardware is new. If it worked in safe mode for 8 hours, is it fair to think it all works?<br />
<br />
I've been reading what ZigZag3134 has suggested. Currently, I'm looking into getting Memtest68+ to work.

            As with Kiran Kishore, thank you for replying so fast.<br />
<br />
I'm currently working to get my USB ready to boot off of. I have concerns however.<br />
<br />
I've used the media creation tools from here<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10<br />
to get a 64-bit version of Windows 10 ready to boot from my USB.<br />
<br />
Memtest86+, the recommended one from JMH3143, the author of the article you sent to me does not explicitly list itself for use on Windows 10. In particular, I'm looking at the Download - Auto-installer for USB Key (Win 9x/2k/xp/7) *NEW!* at memtest.org/#downiso<br />
Should I go ahead and use it anyway. I imagine it would be safe to use.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I've read that some have used MemTest86 from www.memtest86.com/download.htm<br />
While it does not specify any version of Windows, the same people who led me to it recommended it because they thought it was easier to use.<br />
<br />
Which would you recommend?

            Memtest86+ is run outside the windows environment so it does not care what OS is installed.&nbsp; My partner's wiki does mention that,&nbsp; I would use memtest86+

    <title>C drive crashed, programs installed on D - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williammcgowen  say:</h3>
<h2>            C drive crashed, programs installed on D</h2>
                    <p>I had a crash I couldn't recover from, so I had to reinstall Windows onto my C drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My C drive was a 250 Gig SSD, but I had issues with room, so I pretty much started installing programs to my D drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't recover from the crash by any means other than doing a clean install of Windows. (Wasted days trying to avoid it.) Side note, I decided that if I was going to do a clean install I would just upgrade to a 1 TB SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I now have a clean install, updated with the most recent updates, and it seems to be running fine. But now I am looking at the task of reinstalling a bunch of programs, some of them quite large. I am simply looking for some way to shortcut the process.
 The programs all exist, my computer is just not aware of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did start up Battle.net, and after an update it now is installed on my system. I just need to put a link on my desktop. But I tested out Starcraft II, and it does run, but takes forever to start up. And my system still doesn't recognize it. This is a massive
 enough program that I really don't want to do a full install, and then I still have Diablo III, and Warcraft II. My other giant project is an older Adobe suite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does anyone know a way of short-cutting the reinstallation process, or making my system recognize the programs?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When your C: drive went, the registry went with it, which means that programs will have to be reinstalled.</p>

            <p><span>Hi saeed h,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Disable the </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>security software</span></a><span>
 temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and
 other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during
 the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Put the computer in </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Clean Boot</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<b>Step 7</b> from the link to return the computer to <b>Normal startup mode</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span>
</span><span>You can also install the updates (KB number) manually by downloading from Microsoft download center.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vista was never part of the free upgrade to 10 offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 does not come for free; you have to buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Windows 7 Upgrade Option is available through participating PC manufacturers on selected PCs and through Microsoft on qualifying purchases of the Windows Vista packaged product. The Windows 7 Upgrade Option applies to Windows
 Vista Home Premium, Business, and Ultimate editions. Your Windows 7 upgrade will be to the comparable version: so you'll get either Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional (the upgrade to Windows Vista Business), or Windows 7 Ultimate, respectively.
 The Windows 7 Upgrade Option program runs from June 26, 2009 <strong>through January 31, 2010.</strong> Some Manufacturers may choose to shorten the Upgrade Option time frame.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>

</p><p>After turning on my computer (Windows 10) my link speed says 1Gbps then changes to 100mbps. The internet speed on my computer is 56mbps. My computer is connect with a Cat 5e internet cable directly into the router. Does anyone know why this is happening?
 Some games that use internet have connectivity issues that are worse then when I was on ADSL. After talking to my dad and the IT people at his work the said that it could be that the in built Network card of the mother board might not handle speeds above 100mbps.
 Therefor i bought an TP-Link TG-3269. I still get the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wiped my&nbsp; SSD (Has the OS) and reinstalled windows, the problem still occurs. I thought it might be a program throttling the speed, but that doesn't seem to be the case. This is not related to my ISP as i have already had lengthy inquiries into this issue
 without solving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions please don't hesitate to offer your help.</p>

<p>I attempted the first method which resulted with "Troubleshooter could not identify the problem". When I went to try the second method, there was no files that had compatibility tabs in properties.&nbsp; The driver is meant for windows 8. The driver is meant
 to be installed through the task managers "Update Driver" function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included a screenshot of the files the driver came with.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e46c2d49-3257-4731-865f-4c000efc8364" /></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after performing clean boot issue persists, try to enable wireless service from the list and then&nbsp;check the status of your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) </span><span>Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab, and then click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Then put a check mark in front &nbsp;of <strong>wireless service, </strong>
which means wireless service is running.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now check the status of your issue and see if it brings any difference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do keep us updated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - &#34;Link your Android phone&#34; not working</h2>
                    I followed the instructions in the settings menu on windows 10, and it sent me a link to download Microsoft Launcher, NOT Microsoft Apps, as some places I've seen have said it would be. Well I get the share option Continue on PC in my phone, but my PC
 never shows up in the window.&nbsp; Nor does my phone show up in the "Your Phone"section of the Windows 10 settings.

<p>Is your console directly wired into the Asus RT AC66U?</p>
<p>Before we get started, could you detailing out any troubleshooting steps you have tried so far, so we don't provide you with steps that may only echo back.</p>

<h2>            All Browsers slow, computer slow. Windows 10 is a platform for Malware and Spyware.</h2>
                    <p>All my browsers are slow. Chrome, Firefox and Edge. They crash. They fail to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I spend money on virus protection programs, spyware removal programs, and a heck of a lot of time fighting the onslaught of cookies, trackers and programs that install themselves on my computer without my knowing through my browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't pay for Windows 10, but I've spent a ton of time and money trying to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's effort to become this cloud based share everywhere tool has yielded one result. It has become a malware, tracking and unwanted program platform for thousands of companies that seek to make a buck on my time, my resources, and my browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, we get slow browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every Mac user I meet says "Yeah I spent a lot of money on my mac, but I don't get viruses".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'd think that Microsoft would address that its system is a honey pot for attackers and people who want to make money exploiting it and its users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we never hear anything from Microsoft about it. Windows Defender is a poor excuse for protection. In some ways I feel that Microsoft has turned a blind eye to the fact that its operating system&nbsp;has become a global distribution center for its users private
 data, resources and money. But we're stuck because we have no other option than a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a poor and shameful state of affairs.&nbsp;Fix it&nbsp;now.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Excel 2016 wont save files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter_037  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Excel 2016 wont save files</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer with Windows 10 and MS Office 365.&nbsp; When I initially started the computer up it asked for a Microsoft&nbsp; Account login.&nbsp; As I thought this was for warranty purposes I logged in.&nbsp; I then found that every time the computer was turned on
 it wanted that login.&nbsp; I found a way around that so that the login was a simple password and that seemed to work until today.</p>
<p>Today I created an Excel file and went to save as and when I selected the documents folder it said I didn't have permission and to contact the administrator.&nbsp; I created a folder (interesting that I could do that).&nbsp; I could not however save files into this
 new folder.&nbsp; I added everyone to security on the folder but to no avail.</p>
<p>I have read countless articles on the forum regarding this problem.&nbsp; It seems to me that Microsoft created another mess with permissions.&nbsp; In short this is what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I want to log on to my computer with a local password.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I do not want to save to the cloud as the default.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I want to be able to create folders under the documents, pictures, music,&nbsp;or users directory.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I want to be able to save files to these folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't do these simple tasks with Windows 10 then I do not know what I will do as I have already invested over 100 hours in trying to get this OS to perform.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Peter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to save other files? What happens when you try to save any images from internet explorer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand that you are trying to use local account instead of Microsoft account and you don’t have permissions to save the files in any folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key and type Settings.</li><li>Select Account.</li><li>Select your Account. </li><li>Click on Sign in with local account instead of Microsoft Account. </li><li>It will prompt for Microsoft Account Password. </li><li>Enter the password then you will be able to use Local account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using local account then you will not be able to use many apps and cortana which requires Microsoft account to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>As you have mentioned that you don’t want to save the files in the cloud, when you save the file option you can browse it to the any location on the computer and save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For file permission issue follow the below command to provide the permission and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>takeown /f folder_name /r /d y<br />
icacls folder_name /grant username_or_usergroup:F /t /q</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

            <p>Thankyou, I was able to save an image to a folder.</p>
<p>I am logged on as a local user.</p>
<p>I cannot save excel files anywhere.</p>
<p>I assume the takedown line was to be entered in the run command box.&nbsp; When I do this it says takedown was not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am halfway there.&nbsp; Do I need to be logged on as the administrator to change permissions, or run takedown?&nbsp; I am assuming the my Microsoft Account login is the administrator account.</p>

<p>I changed my login to the administrator (Microsoft Account login) and I was able to save an excel file, after logging in a second time and picking a PIN (?).</p>
<p>I still cannot get rid of the cloud, and I still cannot create and save a file using my local login account.</p>

</p><p>After reading the description which you have provided, I come to conclude that you have downloaded the Deezer app from the Store using your friends account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that after uninstalling the app and reinstalling it still you are unable to login with your own account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you logged in with your own Microsoft account/local account or your friends account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>As you are facing issue while updating store app I would suggest you to try the troubleshooting methods given below.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong>
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the app troubleshooter provided in the below mentioned article and if it doesn't help try other steps mentioned in the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<br />
</strong>Press the Windows key and from the Start screen type "UAC" and on the right, select Settings.<br />
Select Change User Account Control settings and verify here.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Check the Date &amp; Time Zone is correct:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to change the time.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Double Click on the current time on the bottom right hand corner of your screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then click Change date and time settings, then click the Change time zone button</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select your time zone and tick automatically adjust clock for daylight saving time and press OK</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Then press Apply, and OK.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using<strong>
</strong>a<strong> proxy connection, </strong>then try <strong>disabling proxy</strong> and then check if the issue persist. Proxy server also restrict Store app to get updated.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps to disable proxy:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click the <strong>Tools button</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong></p>
</li><li>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 - Does it have 2 batteries, and if it does, how long will it take for both batteries to charge&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I am asking a question about the Surface Book 2. Does it have 2 batteries, and if it does, how long will it take for both batteries to charge? Last question, is the a way I can make it automatically switch and start charging the second battery when
 battery 1 is done?

<p>Hi Alex, </p>
<p>

<p>Yes, there is a battery that powers the device while in Tablet mode and another in the base when it is used in Laptop mode. In Laptop mode these batteries work together to provide the longest battery life and, when charging, will automatically switch from
 one to the other. You can check on the battery charge progress by clicking the battery icon in the taskbar. For more info on charging your devices, please view
