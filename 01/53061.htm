<p>Before installing Windows 7, I upgraded my physical memory to 2 GB.</p>
<p>I've actually resolved the Windows Update error on my own, after noticing that other installations failed (Office 2010, manual Windows Updates, etc.), I researched error 0x800736FD and found this forum that includes the solution by<strong>wholawho</strong>
 :</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/f4dd5033-9bcb-4788-b100-5e98bd80f6bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/f4dd5033-9bcb-4788-b100-5e98bd80f6bf</a></p>
<p>And following the instructions in this video:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BQwnmK88Oo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BQwnmK88Oo</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/7BQwnmK88Oo?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/7BQwnmK88Oo?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>This completely solved my Windows Update problem (I had 37 additional "hidden" updates waiting to be installed) and my other program installation issues.</p>

<h2>            My Windows Live Mail keeps reverting to an old unused account.</h2>
                    I am using Windows Live Mail in conjunction with Windows 7.&nbsp; I am using it to check my email on GMail.&nbsp; The original email address with GMail was changed to another email address. (I deleted the first one with GMail.)&nbsp; I modified the properties of the
 email account so that it matches the properties of the new email address. (This includes the address and password and user name)&nbsp; I made the changes and hit the "Apply" button.&nbsp; However, the changes don't stay and will revert to the old account after I turn
 the computer off and then back on, or even if I am using the computer for a length of time and attempt to check the email after this time.&nbsp; What is the solution to this so that the changes I make are permanent and don't change?

            Do you have any program running that could prevent unexpected changes taking place? This would include any sort of security suite or programs claiming to carry out system care.<br />
<br />
Set Windows Live Mail to <em>Work offline</em>, then move all messages from the account folders to user-created folders under Storage folders. When you're sure that there are no messages in folders under the account that you want to keep, right-click on the
 account name in the folder pane and select <em>Remove account</em>.<br />
<br />
Close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes while the program does its housekeeping, indexing the messages you just moved. Open Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Escape) and wait until
<strong>wlmail.exe</strong> no longer appears in the list on the <em>Processes</em> tab.<br />
<br />
Re-launch Windows Live Mail and check that you're still working offline (the button on the Home tab of the ribbon should read
<em>Go online</em>). Then press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the <em>Add your email accounts</em> wizard and add the account back again. To be on the safe side, before going online to test the account, right-click on its name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. Give it a name different from the one you just removed. <br />
<br />
Go online and if necessary click <em>Send/receive</em> to initiate a download. If you used the default settings, the account folders should be downloaded and eventually populated with the messages present on the server.<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
EricLaw's IEInternals - A look at Internet Explorer from the inside out. - Understanding DEP/NX<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/10/10/Understanding-Data-Execution-Prevention-Crashes-in-IE8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/10/10/Understanding-Data-Execution-Prevention-Crashes-in-IE8.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
The problem might actually be an addon or other program causing the problem and you
<br />
should check that 1st.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have
<br />
EVER had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which
<br />
can cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Reset all Zones to default level - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
Close&nbsp;IE and then try IE and/or IE with no Addons<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but
<br />
Java still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.)
<br />
Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look
<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a
<br />
program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and
<br />
run - not all are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />
<br />

<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would
<br />
be unusual with Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it
<br />
and then run it as a scanner. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
I would add prevx as well.<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security
<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here
<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
If nothing else works you can try this however I would use as last resort.<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Options - Security Section - uncheck Enable Memory<br />
Protection to Mitigate OnLine Attacks - APPLY - OK&nbsp;&nbsp; Close and Restart IE<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Try going to the C:\Users folder and setting permissions (and ownership if absolutely necessary) &nbsp;from there (since I think the Downloads folder is inheriting permissions from this folder as the username folder has no Properties button so it probably isn't
 a factor).&nbsp; Before trying that try changing ownership on the documents folder and/or those sub-folders again and ignore the fact that it can't display the current owner. Click on Edit anyway and see if you are able to get in to make the changes.&nbsp; Then in permissions,
 check Advanced to make sure you're listed with full control (and change or add &nbsp;it if necessary) and the Everyone user is not listed with Deny access.&nbsp; I have ful rights access (and ownership) of the Downloads folder on my system so I know it is possible.&nbsp;
 Also first review the following information before attempting to change the Users folder.</p>
<p>Here are some articles on permissions and ownership that may help you in case you're missing a step or something:</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:

<h2>            user account show as administrator but are set as standard - with no way to set back to Administrator</h2>
                    Have recently re-installed 7 Pro using an image created with the built in image creator, both user account's show as administrator but are set as standard (both are set to Admin as have software that would only run under Admin accounts).&nbsp; Whenever I try
 and change the accounts back to Administrator the&nbsp; "change account type" box grey's out and am unable to save the change.&nbsp; Have tried re-starting in safe mode but the same thing happens.

            Regardless of your password policy, you cannot afford to ignore the facts. From your reports I gather that they are as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>Using imaging techniques, you reset Windows to its condition of x months ago.</li><li>Restoring an old image will reset the machine to that old date, warts and all, including passwords.</li><li>You are no longer able to log on. </li></ul>
<p>The inescapable conclusion is that the password you now use (whether it is blank or not) is not the same as the password you used x months ago (whether it was blank or not). I have used the imaging technique for many years - first with third-party products
 and more recently with the native Windows image creation tool. I have never seen an exception to the rule that an image restoration performs a full reset.</p>
<p>Instead of arguing about what happened, you should now do this to put your operation back on a stable basis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reset the one of your admin passwords, using the complex process outlined below.</li><li>Make sure you have two fully tested admin accounts. </li><li>Keep a paper record of these admin accounts. </li><li>Set a password for the Administrator account. Keeping it at a blank is an open invitation to hackers.</li><li>Create a new image. </li></ol>
You can reset any password by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tap the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

<h2>            Surprise - this is for Teams - PURPLE - obnoxious - is there any way to change it other than the Themes, which also make my teeth hurt&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Teams colors, and also Office, are really restricted in color modification. This would not bother me if I liked the colors, but both the brightness and the primitive, coarse, blocky graphics make my current Microsoft apps and overall Windows experience actually
 jarring, almost painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to use bold colors, fine, but for the majority (who cannot read black text over OneNote's extra-purple purple in Teams, for example), give us a way to dial it back.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; When I unplug the hub and plug printer or ext hard drive direct into the USB port they will work just fine, so I believe the problem lies with the hub.&nbsp; I can't find drivers for it anywhere online. Was hoping someone here could
 help with that since I'm dealing with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Thank you again for your help</p>

<h2>            Games not loading  - no obvious reason why</h2>
                    
<p>I have two games that were working perfectly fine at the beginning of the week. I made no changes to the xbox but FIFA 16 and Destiny (both discs) no longer load&nbsp;thoroughly, they are no longer playable. Although, they did stop working the same time as I
 had a connectivity issue with my internet and xbox live. I fixed this by unplugging external storages, hard resetting, reseting router etc. I also have tried uninstalling and re downloading each game but it did not work. **These are the only 2 discs in my
 collection that don't work. ** &nbsp;I've checked for scratches, smudges etc. Could the file be corrupt or something in my setting became wrong during the update? Also, I have tried changing my mode to energy-saving and then resetting, quitting the game, and also
 switching where the game is stored (Internal and External). All of my other games work and I do not see what the problem is. My newly downloaded black ops 3 is experiencing no alike issues and it was downloaded after the problem occurred. Please help, thanks!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Tomb Raider Cloud Save Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hammerfellchick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tomb Raider Cloud Save Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a ton of trouble getting Tomb Raider to sync to the Cloud. I've spoken to Xbox support and wonder if this is a Tomb Raider issue as none of my other games have issues.<br />
<br />
What's happening is that the save game will not sync to the Cloud. The first time this happened it took over a day for it to sync. The syncing bar will go up a little then stop, or reverse, it will keep doing this for hours, never syncing and then it will look
 like it's done but when I look at the Cloud in Storage it still says Pending. This prevents me from playing Tomb Raider on my other console.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Saving to Hard Drive and then moving it to the Cloud doesn't seem to work because the save is always pending. And even the save game date is wrong; the date I first saved not the updated current date.</p>

                    I went to log in to Windows Vista as usual, after I typed in my password a window came up that said the product key I entered was invalid and it gave me three options: to proceed with minimum functionality to get help (which is what I am doing, it directed
 me to this website, to try a different product key, or to contact gateway for help. I got my paperwork and entered my original product key but it says its invalid. so now I am asking to see if anyone knows anything about this. Thanks.

    <title>Transformers&#58; Age of Extinction Grimlock Avatar Prop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asskickermaniac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transformers&#58; Age of Extinction Grimlock Avatar Prop</h2>
                    
<p>Toward the end of June I came across some posts regarding a free <strong>"Grimlock Avatar Prop"</strong> that was being given away as part of a dashboard promotion for Transformers: Age of Extinction. You got the prop if you watched the trailer that appeared
 on the Xbox dashboard all the way through. After continually refreshing my dashboard and never seeing the ad, I began to wonder if it had already expired. A few calls to Xbox Support, and I was being told that the prop would be brought back to the dashboard
 sometime in the near future, but that they were not sure when. After being referred to sales, I was again told that the ad would be brought back. Does anyone know if the ad is going to be brought back to the dashboard, or at least if the Grimlock Avatar Prop
 will be released in the Avatar Marketplace sometime soon? Any information would really be appreciated!</p>
<p>Here's some links with pictures of the promotion and the prop itself:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is totally bogus. These DVDs play on all my other machines, but Microsoft wants me to believe they have a manufacturing error? If that's true, why can all my other DVD and Blu Ray players handle the error, while the XBox One just chokes on it?</p>
<p>the forum has informed you of this for years. If it's fixable why don't you fix it? And if it isn't fixable why can't you explain why?

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;Poppalopp!</p>
<p>As I state above, some DVD's experience an issue that will prevent them from playing properly on the Xbox One console. For further assistance, you will need to reach out to phone or chat support. In the future, please go ahead and create a new thread. This way you can receive support specifically tailored to you. Be sure to include the details of the issue as well as any troubleshooting steps that you have tried. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Logitech HD PRO Webcam C910 install fails </h2>
                    I received a Logitech Pro C910 for xmas and it installed smoothly. The camera worked for about 2 weeks and gave fantastic clear pictures complete with the stereo sound just as promised. Around January 19 there was a group of updates that came through as
 automatic updates.&nbsp; The camera ceased to be recognized as a logitech both by the pc and as well from the logitech website.&nbsp; I formatted my drive manually then did a clean install of Windows 7 but the problem persisted.&nbsp; There are UVC drivers preventing the
 install of the logitech drivers.

            I finally resolved the situation with the driver problems and software saying is was incompatible.&nbsp; I downloaded only the drivers&nbsp;manually and installed them into windows\system32\drivers. I then went an uninstalled the usb video and audio device in Device
 manager. I unplugged the camera and then did a install of the software from the cd, being careful to not plug the camera in until just before clicking next for detection.&nbsp; To my suprise it went in without a hitch!!!!

    <title>The curse of the terrible plum. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zandrae  say:</h3>
<h2>            The curse of the terrible plum.</h2>
                    <p>I have Irlen syndrome, in particularly blue light sensitivity which include Windows' retina burning white even on the dark skin so I'm forced to use high contrast mode. The colors I see best are warm, and I read best on purple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this new machine I decided I'd use red instead of people, because red is also easy on my eyes. What I have discovered is that there is a terrible plum purple window color by default in windows 10 accessibility mode that you cannot change. There's also
 a retina burning white border around the windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see it in this screenshot.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>How do I fix it?</p>
<p>The obvious settings do not help.</p>
<p>Is there something in the registry?</p>

<p>Hi Zandrae,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The slim white border that appears on every window when in high contrast mode is set by design. That is to distinguish the contents of each specific window from the main screen. To lessen the brightness of the white border, you can enable the
<strong>Night Light</strong> feature which displays warmer colors. Just navigate to
<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</strong>. Under <strong>Color</strong>, toggle it
<strong>On</strong>. Just click the <em>Night light settings</em> option to adjust the color temperature according to your preference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to have the ability to change its color, I suggest that you submit it as a suggestion through our Feedback Hub. This way our software engineers will be able to look into your suggestion to check if its feasible in the future updates. For the
 detailed instruction in sending your feedback, please check out <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
