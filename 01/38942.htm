            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know which anti-virus program are you using?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in Clean boot state and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would recommend you to do a system repair using media creation tool. Download and create Windows 10 ISO from the below link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you complete creating media. Insert the Windows installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After you boot the computer using Windows DVD, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".</strong> Press any key<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </p>

<h3> david tucson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install Windows 7 after new hard drive installation</h2>
                    I installed a new hard drive in my HD Pavilion a6642p after the original crashed. &nbsp;The new hard drive is a WD Blue 1.0 TB WD10EZEX. &nbsp;Bios seems to recognize the drive. &nbsp;I am installing Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit software from an upgrade disk. &nbsp;I do
 not have the original HP driver or recovery disks. &nbsp;The Windows 7 installation seem to go fine until the end. &nbsp;I get the message "Windows setup could not configure Windows to run on this computer's hardware". &nbsp;How can I fix this and get the OS to run? &nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox and unsupported regions</h2>
                    So i am thinking about buying xbox one in next year but i realized that i cant buy games because my country is in unsupported list. So then i thinked about Russia but microsoft stop selling prepaid cards there. Ok then maybe i could try Finland because
 it is nearest country but if i choose Finland i will not been able to use english language. So i just wanted to know do you have plans on this in the future?

<p>Hey there Dexxyx, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you have run into this problem. Unfortunately this is information that is not necessarily released. As stated on the
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Supported Countries</a> list, If your country is not listed just keep checking back on the list as Xbox expands services frequently and may be coming to your country/region in the
 near future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>
<p>

<p>I moved my Xbox from US to Thailand over a year ago. I had the same response from MS, but there has been no significant movement on supported countries and no announcement of plans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly the XBox is simpy too much of a pain to use in an unsupported countries. Its like having an iPhone without access to the app store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony are doing much better, so I don't think MS can continue to uses the excuse that it's not there fault its the licensing. If Sony can do it then MS is clearly failing (has failed) in the license negotiations. And by the way, even if there is a problem
 why can't restrictions be applied on a game by game basis?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If you are in an unsupported country&nbsp;<strong>do not by an Xbox!</strong></p>
<p>2) If you are in a supported country, but think you may need to travel,&nbsp;<strong>do not buy an Xbox!</strong></p>
<p>3) If you have already moved and Xbox from a supported country to an unsupported country,&nbsp;<strong>sell your Xbox!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For everyone else ... enjoy and think of the rest of us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish someone had given me this advice before I bought mine!</p>

<p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Are you using a wired or a wireless connection?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The RAS PPPoE
</span><span><a href="http://www.windowsreference.com/windows-7/error-651-with-pppoe-connections-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>driver</span><span><span>
</span></span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>file “<strong><em>raspppoe.sys</em></strong>” found under
<strong><em>c:windowssystem32drivers</em></strong> folder seems to be the root cause of the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to rename raspppoe.sys to raspppoe.old and then copy a working file from the vista computer again and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>I would also suggest you to try and re - register the file and then check. To re- register the file follow
 the below steps as –</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>1. Click Start. <br />
2. In search window type 'cmd' and ENTER. Right click and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
3. In the command window that opens type <strong><span>regsvr32
</span></strong></span></span><span><strong><span>raspppoe.sys</span></strong><span> and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also
<span>&nbsp;</span>power cycling your Modem and Router might resolve the problem, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Save all your current work, close all open applications, then shut down your computer. Wait for a minute.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>First, turn your Router off and wait for a couple of minutes.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Turn off your modem.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Disconnect all the Ethernet cables that are connected to the router and modem and the PC.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Reconnect them and ensure that there are no loose connections in between them.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Now, switch on your PC and let it boot.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Switch on the modem first and after it gets initialized, switch on the router.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try disabling Firewall/Security Software if any, and check if it helps:<br />

<h2>            Err1err3 Boot failure Insert system disk and press enter</h2>
                    &nbsp;Ok lets see if you can crack this for me,, It started about a week ago for me. If I would leave my computer on like normal it would go to sleep mode , duh. BUT now it wouldnt start back up instead I get an all black screen and rebooting I go to the blue
 HP screen with the four options. Well I tried for a while and managed to get Vista back up..<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Well after this It started getting really slow, and started freezing up during my desktop loadup. So , after many hours of scanning and searching and reading help, After a sweep for viruses and even a system restore I could not figure out the problem and I
 did what for me was the unthinkable...<br />
<br />
A FULL FACTORY RESTORE... I wiped my computer with the option to go back to factory install settings. And for a while that was good, it worked fine again.. TIL yesterday I let it go to screensaver and then to sleep mode while i was away and what do I see but
 once again<br />
<br />
&nbsp;ERR1ERR3 Boot failure Insert system disk and press enter<br />
<br />
so any clues about why this is happening ,<br />
<br />
PS as we speak YES i am downloading the bittorrent of the vista repair that had been suggested in another thread Praying that it will work but til it is done, I wanted to share this and ask for anyone who might have an idea what caused this .

<h3> alanferg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Asus UX305CA UHM4T touch version- screen flickering issue</h2>
                    <p>I just bought this Asus Zenbook from Microsoft store in Vancouver. I thought it was the UX305 Non touch but turns out to be a very troublesome UHM4T touch version. The display goes into lapses of uncontrolled flashing even after I updated the display driver.
 I have to reboot to get it stabilized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish Microsoft had been more honest about the long trail of complaints about this model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix for this problem. If not, I'm taking it back and buying elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing display issues on your new laptop. Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Few more details would help us to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. "The display goes into lapses of uncontrolled flashing even after I updated the display driver", is this issue specific to a particular application/game?</p>
<p>2. Did the issue start after installing few third party applications?</p>
<p>3. Did you update the display drivers from the manufacturer's website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, please visit the manufacturers website and install the latest display drivers to check&nbsp;if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the below methods and check.</p>
<p>Method 1:&nbsp;<span>I suggest you to boot the system in Clean Boot and check if you face this same issue in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

    <title>Movie Maker is eating my C drive space. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauldaniels2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker is eating my C drive space.</h2>
                    <p>I have started using Movie maker for the first time on 2 PC's at home, one running 8.1 and the other 10.</p>
<p>I am using it to make a series of movies from avi files taken from my home security system cameras, these files are large in their original format (5 to 7GB) and much larger once converted to mp4.
</p>
<p>Also the files are all stored on a separate HDD and are being edited on this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding that the program is filling up my C drives on both computers at an alarming rate, even after the movies are done and the HDD removed, the memory used by MM remains used and consequently I am having problems using my desktop in particular as
 it has a solid state C drive and has only 20GB of free space. this is now full and I am unable to process any more movies.</p>
<p>I have continued with my laptop (running Win 10) but I am noticing the same issue and have ceased for the time being until I can find a solution here.</p>
<p>Where can I find the temporary cache location for the program in order to empty it?</p>
<p>How can I force the program to store the data created during the working process onto the separate HDD or onto another drive within the PC?
</p>
<p>(On my desktop I have also a 3TB drive, but all my programs are using the smaller solid state C drive by default and I don't know how to change that)</p>
<p>Any help with this would be appreciated</p>

            <p>Hello Amanda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running a multiboot system with Windows&nbsp;7 installed on a computer that is also running an earlier version of Windows, such as Windows Vista, you might be able to safely remove Windows&nbsp;Vista from the computer, depending on how the computer is set
 up. </p>
<p>To do this, you need to format the partition containing Windows&nbsp;Vista, or delete it entirely. This allows the earlier operating system to reclaim the disk space.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Before you begin, you should back up your programs, files, and settings. Formatting or deleting a partition deletes all of the data on the partition. For more information about backing up data, search Help and Support for "back
 up." </p>
<p>
</p><p>To format or delete the Windows&nbsp;7 partition, you need to start (boot) your computer using the earlier version of Windows.</p>
<p>Formatting a partition deletes the data on the partition but keeps the partition on your computer's hard disk. Deleting a partition results in
<span>unallocated disk space </span>on the hard disk. You can create additional partitions from this space, or expand an existing partition so that it can make use of the space.

                    <p>my " and @ buttons are reversed on my keyboard and its driving me nuts. Forums say to switch to US keyboard. I have changed my region format to English (united states) and my windows display language to English (united states). When I go to advanced keyboard
 settings and click on the dropdown list for languages I have the following options:</p>
<p>English (united states) - united kingdom</p>
<p>English (united kingdom) - united kingdom</p>
<p>English (south Africa) - US</p>
<p>they seem jumbled up to me? why no English (united states) - united states option?</p>
<p>when I try to change between them my @ and " buttons are still jumbled. is this more than a language setting problem?</p>

<h2>            Problem with changing location of desktop folder &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    Hi everyone, &nbsp;I have windows 7 Home Premium and changed my desktop location from c:\users\(user)\desktop to my d: drive since my c: drive was getting full (to do this I right clicked on my desktop folder and changed location). &nbsp;However, the system has
 simply dumped all of my desktop folders and files into the d:\ root directory, without creating a new desktop folder, which is what I thought would happen.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To fix this I want to transfer all my desktop folders+files to a dedicated d:\desktop folder but find that I can't since now there is now no desktop folder as such! (catch-22). &nbsp;I have gone into c:\users\(user)\links folder and changed the desktop target
 to d:\desktop instead of d:\, but it has no effect! My desktop target is still the root directory. How do I change this? &nbsp;Hope you can help! &nbsp;David

<h2>            &#34;officebackgroundtaskhandler.exe&#34; occasionally opens and closes the command prompt</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I have noticed a command prompt window open and quickly close itself before I could read it. This is really bugging me as it keeps on happening, making me worried about my computer and distracting me from whatever I'm doing. Today, I finally managed
 to react fast enough to take a screenshot of it, and the title of the window reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\officebackgroundhandler.exe</p>

I'm using Windows 10, and I think I have an Office365 installation that I got from my highschool last year.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the system before the issue occurred<strong>?</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since the audio output was working fine yesterday you can try system restore which will restore your system to the time when everything was working fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform system restore on your system refer to the link provided below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The issue may be related to corrupted drivers thus I would suggest you toOpen Device Manger and check for the status of the device. To open
 device manager refer to the link provided below.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access my Hyper-V virtual machine outside the hostPla</h2>
                    Ok, so what I have is a virtual machine with Windows Server 2012 R2 (DNS, DHCP, IIS, Active Directory). DHCP works perfectly. All of the computers outside the host gets their IP addresses. But IIS is the problem. Only the host and the VM can access the
 websites. Any solutions?

<p>I think the host and the VM are in a separated network. If the VM doesn't use the external link to access internet, you cannot access the website because it is not in the right network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which IP adresses get the hosts and which one the VM?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please have a look&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831823(v=ws.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;about the network virtualization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if you use the Windows Server itself in a VM, it may occur that you cannot start the machine anymore. This is caused by a system setting I discovered in my apprenticeship. It is recommended that you use the Windows Server on a physical machine
 (only the server with AD on it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the technet is the better forum for this kind of problem. There are much more professional engineers and others.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> mattcaniglia  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY error windows 8 BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I just got an iBUYPOWER desktop about 3 days ago and everything has been running fine until now. When I turn on my computer it just keeps having an error that says "ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXEUTE MEMORY" I have tried all the troubleshoots including the advanced
 ones, no matter what it goes back to the BSOD and the error pops up again. It just keeps restarting my computer I have tried to get Into safe mode and when I do the error pops up preventing me from accessing the desktop. None of the advanced repair options
 have worked either. I don't know what caused this my computer was working great the first few days. I've contacted tech support for windows and they said i would have to pay $200 to get it fixed but I know there is ways out there with out paying! SOMEONE PLEASE
 HELP!!!!</p>

<p>Thank you very much for posting the results. I was curious whether it was because the device was bad or for some reason windows 8 doesnt like having it plugged in until drivers were loaded. this was an ibuypower PC as well. and i started moving the clump
 of cables around inside and noticed the little usb wifi adapter. lol. i wish i had found this sooner.</p>

<h3> alex_2008  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One with A&#47;V receiver.</h2>
                    
<p>This is a minor issue, but turning on/waking up the XBox One via the Remote control does not auto-turn on and switch INPUT on the A/V reciever like it does when I turn on Apple TV. Is the XB1 not sending a signal through it's HDMI output that the A/V reciever
 needs to auto-switch INPUT that other devices do? I think MS should really update the firmware to support this as it's a hassle switching INPUT on the A/V every time.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>CygnusOrion,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Kinect is actually what is sending commands to your TV and Receiver via IR blasting. So basically when the Xbox turns on, it uses the Kinect to power on whatever devices you have setup. After it's turned on your can control the volume, inputs, and other
 things, but from power on it won't switch inputs on your receiver. If this is a feature you would like added I would suggest going to the
<a href="http://feedback.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback site here</a>, and searching to see if there is already a topic on this. If there is then up-vote it, and add your comments in. If it's not there, then create a new one. The Xbox team watches those pretty closely
 and tries to add the ideas we have into the console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hydro Skillet - I understand that's how Kinect works. However, a thing called 'separation of concerns' would say that you don't design your system so that an optional component(Kinect) drives system things like A/V receiver. If Apple can do INPUT and volume
 through their little box, than MS can too. </p>

<p>Hi There. I'm not sure why Microsoft didn't add that feature in their system, and I don't know if it's possible for them to add controls via HDMI. Maybe they can do it via firmware update. That said, it's not something that's built in, and the Kinect is
 the only option. <a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251650-console-hardware-accessories/suggestions/6033181-add-hdmi-cec-support-to-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The main cause of this Bug_Check 10E is the Video driver so update it and if no <br />
newer&nbsp;are available then re-install the current one. Use the method in the Driver
<br />
Update Section in the next message.<br />

<strong>Bug Check 0x10E: VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL<br />
</strong><br />
Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers lately - check in Control Panel -<br />
Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below<br />
and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can<br />
cause this error. If needed thoroughly check the computer memory with the methods in the next<br />
message.<br />
<br />
Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's&nbsp;Support as there could be known<br />
issues -&nbsp;also check in their forums.<br />

Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

                    Howdy ho! My head is getting sore from banging it on my desk. Here's where I'm at, for some time now, my computer has been BSOD'ing when entering sleep mode, or possibly during sleep mode. Usually the end result is a restart with no problems. This last
 one was a doozie. After the restart, none of my applications would start (i mean NONE...) After further thought of the problem, none of the 32-bit applications would start (Firefox, Media Player, Norton, Wireless adapter utility...) After inspection of the
 logs I keep seeing an entry for SideBySide, Event ID 33:<br />

(I am aware that it's listing wab.exe, but it's there for every 32-bit program)<br />
<br />
Tried to use that sxstrace.exe program, but wasn't quite sure how to get at the root cause of the problem, and/or how to utilize that program.<br />
After trying to wrestle with that, tried to use SFC to fix any underlying OS files, with no avail... :( When running SFC /SCANNOW it finishes, but with errors. I've parsed out the CBS.log to see what errors that came up with:<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2009-09-28 19:29:53, Info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000023e [SR] Cannot repair member file [l:22{11}]"C_20004.NLS" of Microsoft-Windows-International-CodePage-20004, Version = 6.0.6000.16386, pA = PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_INTEL

<br />
<br />
That was a small sample of the error logs that were amounted from the SFC process. As for now I'm a sitting duck, waiting for that golden answer, opposed to just nuking the thing and starting from scratch. I have the complete logs if anyone (Microsoft...) cares
 to analyze. System is custom built using ASUS M3N-HT Dlx mobo, Phenom X4, Corsair DDR2 1066, WD SATAII HD, Nvidia GTX260. Windows Home Premium x64

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Windows Vista Community site!</span></p>
<p><span>Some malware/spyware/virus that is out on the Internet, will also change system settings, corrupt data, and log invalid registries
 that will also make annoying errors, as like the ones you are encountering.&nbsp; You can try a virus scan. Just keep in mind that if your system does contains a virus, the active virus can try to keep the system from installing/using the virus scan correctly.
 Online Virus scans (sometimes) will not have that problem.</span></p>

<p>I would like text I copy from an external source - such as the internet - to use the same text formatting as the destination file.</p>
<p>So if I past some text from a web page which is in a bold times font I would like it to be normal font weight and in arial (or whatever I happen to be using in Word). I have tried everything that you suggest on your support pages.</p>
<p>Please can you help.</p>

<p>Hi Sarah</p>
<p>It does not give me this option before I paste the text. Once I've pasted the text I can get this option by right clicking the pasted text. However, clicking the 'Merge formatting (M) button does not change the formatting.</p>
<p>Also, I do not want to do this every time I copy and paste text into Word. I would like the default to be for the text to change to that of the destination document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every setting I have tried has failed to make this my default preference.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            If you do a paste a window shoudl come up and ask you to Merge Formatting.
<br />
<br />But I get you want this to happen all the time without asking it do that.
<br />If you go to file - Options - Advanced.
<br />And go to cut, copy, paste you can set defaults.
<br />Does that not help?

<h2>            A lot of RAM used for nothing &#40;maybe hidden processes&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello people, I need your help. I have 8GB of ram installed and sometimes even if I don´t have any program opened I have 50% of RAM used. I looked at task manager and I found this- (look at the pic)&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cd510d-8b20-4e5e-8468-36185a6f414b" /></p>
<p>So it uses 1398MB of ram but 54% is used? (I repeat, I have 8GB of ram)</p>
<p>I don´t know what to do... o.O</p>
<p>(Don´t mind 55% processor usage I was running something)</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Matej,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, the percentage (70% as you mentioned) does not only account for the processes run by your particular user account. It consists of other background processes including the processes run by your user account out of the total RAM installed in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain you the complete configuration of the total RAM installed in your system with the help of Resource Monitor image displayed below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f3327a3-f94d-455e-be3c-28c94f31aad0" /></p>
<p><em>Image 1: Resource Monitor</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfdf9c9e-98a2-49cd-a558-028e1d23a215" /></p>
<p><em>Image 2: Task Manager (</em><strong><em>Users</em></strong><em> tab)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Image&nbsp;1</em> shows&nbsp;a snap of&nbsp;Resource Monitor (<em>Task Manager &gt; Performance &gt; Open Resource Monitor</em>) that gives you the complete configuration of the total physical memory (4 GB RAM, in this case) including its usage and free memory available.
 The RAM is ideally divided into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware Reserved</strong> Memory</li><li><strong>In Use</strong> Memory</li><li><strong>Modified</strong> Memory</li><li><strong>Standby</strong> Memory</li><li><strong>Free</strong> Memory</li></ul>
<p>If you hover the mouse over these&nbsp;sections in the Resource Monitor, you will get to know the information about each of these items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as highlighted in <em>Image 1</em>, the <strong>In Use</strong> memory is given as 1921 MB and the total RAM installed is equal to 4096 MB (4GB RAM). If you calculate the percentage, it comes out be 47% approximately(~46.8%).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as described in <em>Image 2</em>, the Task Manager shows only 710.9 MB of data being used by the user account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, a question arises, <em>where is the rest of data being used when it displays 1921 MB of the
</em><strong><em>In Use</em></strong><em> section?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of the data is being used by the background Windows processes to run the complete Operating System and to operate various services required&nbsp;to run different hardware components connected to the system and other miscellaneous reserved processes.
 If you closely observe the Resource Monitor (<em>Image 1</em>), it will display the list of all the processes including those that are not mentioned in
<em>Image 2 </em>and serve as background processes to operate the computer system completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>How do I stop Windows Update from restarting my computer in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikewest82  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows Update from restarting my computer in Windows 7 Home Premium&#63;</h2>
                    While I do not mind Windows Update automatically updating my PC, hacing it force a reboot when I am logged in is causing a problem.&nbsp; I currently have WU set to perform the updates at 3am, and when it finished, if there needs to be a reboot, I am not there
 to tell it to wait.&nbsp; I would prefer to leave the time settings as they are, and simply disable the automatic reboot, instead opting for WU to let me know it needs to reboot the PC.&nbsp; I found ways of doing this in XP and Vista, including registry edits and group
 policy modifications.&nbsp; However, The registry is obviously slightly different so the keys do not exist compared to what I found, and since I am running Home Premium I do not have gpedit.<br />
<br />
Where in the registry can I make a change so I don't have lost data when WU resets my computer at night?

            Another way to do it without hacking the registry, which can be scary for some users), is to follow the instructions on the following website:<br />
<br />
http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/02/11/438009.aspx<br />
<br />
I've pasted in the main parts of it, in case the link goes dead (but no nice pictures though):<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Go to Start -&gt; Run(or in Vista and 7 simply press the windows orb) </li><li>Type: gpedit.msc </li><li>Expand Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates&nbsp;/ Windows Components&nbsp;/ Windows Update
</li><li>Double-click&nbsp;"No auto-restart for scheduled Automatic Updates installations" </li><li>Select "Enabled", then OK. Close the Group Policy configuration program. </li></ol>
That should stop it autorestarting.

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had done an sfc check but have now&nbsp;done another which produced the result 'Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violation'.</p>
<p>When I select the microphone sign on the taskbar it changes colour very slightly and briefly but nothing else happens and there is no response to either a voice or any other command.&nbsp;&nbsp; It all worked perfectly until a week or so ago and the only changes since
 then have been the automatic updates - which are, it says, completely up to date.</p>
<p>I am using a laptop with an Intel i3 plus 4Gb RAM and have a Windows 10 Professional 64 system now showing as (10.0.10240.16463).</p>
<p>I am not sure if it is relevant but I noticed that the admin command prompt came up as 'c:windows\system32' and on the command prompt with no admin authority it is 'c:\users\landj&gt;'.&nbsp;&nbsp; No mention of 64 on either.</p>

<p>cortana is working but no more listening me, starting from last days of september.</p>
<p>microphome works perfectly, and cortana react to the "Hey, Cortana" speech command, showing "ti stò ascoltando" (I'm listening you) but following words have no effect, no reaction (speech is not seen as text in the cortana box).</p>
<p>also using the mic icon, cortana stay in listening mode but is "deaf"... </p>
<p>using the "learn my voice" option, cortana stay in listening mode but nothing happen.</p>
<p>other functions of cortana -suggestions, memo, etc- are working well but not using voice.</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow returns all is ok</p>

            <p>thanks Kalpana, but I have already tried the suggested solutions. I tried again wit no result.</p>
<p>It is not a microphone issue, being that "Hey Cortana" speech is successfull (cortana goes in listening mode) but subsequent&nbsp; words are not recognized.</p>
<p>Same situation as in my october 1st post, no changes.</p>
<p>I have no recorded events in event register that seems related to this issue; I only suffer of "ev id 10010 DistributedCOM" error,&nbsp; but this seems another story, not related to cortana.</p>

            Hello Santosh,&nbsp; No joy with any of the suggestions which have been made.&nbsp;&nbsp; My microphone side is ok - been checked using skype and I have run out of ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see (using file explorer) that there some 1033 files concerning Cortana on my laptop, of which
 the great majority arrived with the initial upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cortana worked perfectly then but both&nbsp;it and the search facility suddenly stopped&nbsp;working&nbsp;on some uncertain date a month or two later.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see that some of the later Cortana files amend/update
 the original files and I suspect that one or more of those has corrupted the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any way I can safely remove the later files and re-install them&nbsp;- and would that be likely to bring the facility back ?&nbsp; Regards,&nbsp; LW

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Extender</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Guys.</p>

<p>Just upgraded from my 360 to the XBONE, however I have all my multimedia setup in the office upstairs and then distributed via CAT6 HDMI. &nbsp;No problem with the 360 however the XBONE has a major controller range issue, even when luckily the Lounge is directly
 below the office, so only 2 No. walls and floors to go through and 3metres direct line to line, however I am still getting disconnects etc etc.</p>
<p>So I have been trying everything but still getting some disconnects, so I was wondering if it was possible to buy the USB adapter and then plug this into the XBONE one via a USB cable to extend the range to the lounge? this would be done via a USB - CAT6
 - USB.</p>
<p>Is this supported?</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Matutu,</p>
<p>By USB adapter, you're talking about the one designed for Windows, right? The little USB dongle that plugs into a PC and allows controllers to connect wirelessly.</p>
<p>I don't *think* this works on the console itself, but I cannot be sure. I would advise against spending money on that as a solution in the way you describe.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple alternatives:</p>
<p>-- If you don't mind using the controller as a wired controller, you can run a USB from console to where you play and plug the controller in.</p>
<p>-- Alternatively, using a Windows 10 PC in the location you actually play, you can stream the Xbox One's video output to the PC, but, more importantly for you, you can stream controller inputs back from PC to Xbox One.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the Windows 10 example, even if you plan to play on a TV (directly connected via HDMI to the console, or however the setup is currently), you can have a Windows 10 PC in the room to which you stream the video output across the local network (PC can be connected by wire to router for minimal latency), and to the PC you can either connect the controller by USB cable OR use the Wireless Adapter and have the controller connected to the PC wirelessly. In both cases, controller inputs go from Windows 10 PC back to console, and for video you could be looking at either your existing monitor or Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>With the Windows 10 setup, with controller inputs and video output now being transmitted across the local network, you may introduce some latency to your gaming, but there's not really any good way to know before you try. If the PC is wired to the router, the latency should be minimal, but I cannot say for certain. What I do know is that I have streamed the Xbox One video output to my own PC (both connected wirelessly to router) on the highest settings, with a controller connected via USB to console, and I have not had any significant performance issues.</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>For setting up Windows 10 game streaming, and details on system requirements, read this article here: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/gaming-on-windows/how-to-use-game-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../how-to-use-game-streaming</a></p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on, or if you have further questions. I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Have you had any luck? &nbsp;My experience with the xbox one controller is they're absolute garbage, you're lucky to get a stable connection at 15' with line of sight, if there's a physical barrier between you and the console (cabinet etc) you're not going to get a stable signal. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to acknowledge that they&nbsp;dropped the ball on these controllers and release some kind of range extender so people can actually play their consoles without interruption. &nbsp;Also for the record my home theatre setup as a 360, ps3, ps4 and xbone in it and the XbOne is the only one that has EVER&nbsp;dropped the controller signal.</p>
