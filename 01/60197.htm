</p><p>I am trying to update since weeks. In the end it always states: Remove Nero Burning Rom manually -- not compatible! I have for hours tried to remove any trace of Nero and can't find anything any more. Searching through the computer search system gives me
 no results either. I have serious problems with my computer, which worked great before trying to upgrade to Windows 10. How can I uninstall all traces of Windows 10? I am sick and tired of wasting my time getting the run-around! If I would have known that
 Nero Burning Rom isn't compatible with Windows 10 I would have never tried to upgrade!</p>

<h2>            suspend mode too quickly</h2>
                    <p>my Toshiba S855 running Win10 home (10586.122) goes into suspend mode after a very short (~60 - 90 seconds) period of inactivity. I have all of the user set power options&nbsp;to "never".&nbsp;This problem only started happening after I upgraded from Win8 to Win10.</p>

    <title>Cannot manage payment options, account stuck in unusable state, cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tharaxis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot manage payment options, account stuck in unusable state, cannot fix at all, MS support couldn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t fix either&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Ever since I started being informed that my Gold account was going to be suspended due to my payment option having expired, I have had NOTHING but hassles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Informed that account is to be suspended as previous CC has expired. </li><li>Add new CC details and assign them to the Gold service. </li><li>System continues to inform me that it will be suspending my service as it cannot bill old CC (even though new CC is the one assigned to the service).
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BILL THE OLD CC AS IT HAS EXPIRED!</span>
</li><li>Then attempt to remove the old CC details to ensure that it tries billing new CC, get informed that it cannot remove the old CC as there is an outstanding amount that must be settled (there is no option anywhere that says "settle amount").
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO BUT IT WON'T LET ME! I CANNOT PAY USING THAT OPTION SINCE IT HAS EXPIRED!</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hold out hope that the Live billing system will come to its senses and bill the new card. Service gets suspended, new card is never billed.
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IT DOESN'T EVEN DOWNGRADE ME TO SILVER! NOW EVEN FREE TO PLAY ONLINE GAMES (SUCH AS AOE ONLINE) REFUSE TO WORK.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<div>So now at this point I'm sitting with an account I can't use whatsoever, I can't play any free to play online games because they say the service has no LIVE service associated with it (since it's suspended). I'm tempted to just create a new LIVE account,
 but then realise that I have a ton of PC games using GFWL that I would need to repurchase to be able to register them with the new LIVE details, so that's a no go. So now begins my attempt to fix the account (with no success):</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Logging into the XBOX Live page, and clicking on Manage Payment Options produces an error (at the bottom of this post).
</li><li>Clicking on Contact Preferences, Privacy and Online Settings, and XBOX 360 Profile Protection produces similar errors.
</li></ol>
<div><strong>ERROR MESSAGE:</strong></div>
<div>It appears you've found a glitch in the system.</div>

</table>
</div>

<div>At this point I'm stuck, I have no way of actually trying to resolve this myself since the XBOX page does not work whatsoever. So I decide I have to contact XBOX Support and get them to resolve it:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Contact online support, wait 20 minutes in queue, eventually get the friendly Natalie.
</li><li>Natalie tries to resolve the problem, but she cannot seem to validate my login details despite the fact that I'm logged into that account.
</li><li>Repeated attempts to login to the account (on various pages - all successful) still do not show to her for the purposes of validation.
</li><li>At this point she's stuck, unable to validate the account so she can fix it. I offer to possibly provide her some info, answering security questions or whatever to facilitate with the validation, she says they don't take any account info for security purposes.
 Fair enough, but still leaves me in a bind. She believes the system may be down.
</li><li>I leave support without having had the issue resolved. </li></ol>
<div>Now I am beyond frustrated. How is it that playing games in the past was such an easy exercise and these days in the realm of modern technology it has become such an unbelievable MISSION just to have a service that works smoothly and easily. I cannot understand
 these customer-hostile policies sometimes. So I try one last-ditch effort to get the service up and running. This all seems to be caused by the service being suspended and there being an outstanding balance that needs to be resolved:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Buy a 12 month XBOX Live card. </li><li>Go to the XBOX website, log in and click on Redeem Code. <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
YAY A PAGE ON THE XBOX SITE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!?!</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Enter in the code and click the Redeem Code button.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A message appears:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 153, 102, 1)">An error has occurred during the transaction. Please try again later.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So at this point I am flat out of options. I have tried EVERY avenue possible to give Microsoft my money and have been thwarted at every turn by non-working systems and unintelligent and customer-hostile business rules. Can
 someone please just FIX my XBOX Live account so I can actually make use of it again without having to resort to voodoo spells or ritual sacrifice? Would that be too much to ask?</span></div>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue, I haven't tried to contact Xbox support yet though because I don't want to sit on the phone for 45 minutes. I was able to update my payment info to a new CC, and it says that there will be a "short delay" on billing the account.
 It's been a week, nothing billed to my credit card, and it appears my old expired card is still tied to the account. I don't understand why MS makes this so f'ing difficult.

<p>So I just called support and talked to a guy named Brian, he said the issue was that the system didn't transfer the outstanding balance to the new card, so even though it took my new card's info, it was kind of stuck in limbo. He was able to move the balance
 and charge my card immediately, I'm back on Live. I would recommend trying to call support again and if let them know that was how it was resolved for me. Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi Rupen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finding your product key will depend on how you got your copy of Windows. If you got Windows from an authorized retailer, the product key is on a label or card inside the box that Windows came in. If you are running Windows in a new PC, the product key is
 preinstalled on your PC, included with the packaging of the PC, or included on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) attached to the PC. With that note, may we know how you have obtained your copy of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Microsoft does not keep a record of purchased product software keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            SmartSwitch for Samsung S6  Smartphone doesn&#39;t work with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello together,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean installation with Windows 10. Unfortunately the Samsung SmartSwitch software comes back with the error code like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc82fbb0-dcd1-4e4b-a58e-8380687b6bd1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The SmartSwitch was running well in the Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade before the clean Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First step I did&nbsp;was&nbsp;contacting Samsung in order to resolve the problem but they told me that the SmarSwitch must run on Windows 10 - they tested it! They recommended to go to Microsoft ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any helpful suggestions from the forum team?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Manfred&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Manfred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall and install the application in compatibility mode by following the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the ‘Setup’ icon for the application and click on properties.</li><li>Under Compatibility tab, check the option for Run in Compatibility mode.</li><li>Select Windows 8 from the drop down list.</li><li>Click on Apply and then OK.</li><li>Install the application software.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to <span>write to us </span>for any other assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hello Eeshwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks for your quick reply.</p>
<p>I followed your suggested steps but unfortunately this could not resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But one thing has happened after applying your proposal. The system went automatically to the "Program Compatibility Trouble Shooter" and gave me lots of choices. I tried Windows 8.x and Windows 7x mode under many conditions. The system worked but the result
 was not sufficient.</p>
<p>I believe anyway if the system works with the trouble shooter we are on the right way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have another idea how I can get access to the damned Samsung&nbsp;SmartSwitch?</p>
<p>It is really important to me to be able to make a backup of my smartphone.</p>
<p>&gt;It's exactly so important like a Windows update&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and best regards,</p>
<p>Manfred</p>

</p><p>Restart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to PAR</p>
<p>Advanced Options&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many possibilities but all eventually return to PAR, including the attempt to start in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: I cannot get into my computer (this message is from my laptop). I am currently thinking of writing off some data &amp; reinstalling Windows 7 - where at least you can get into safe mode &amp; have some chance of sorting things out. Is Windows 10 too clever
 by half?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I have a couple of questions relating to your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it have to be a flash drive rather than an ordinary USB stick? And how much memory is required?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I did not seem to be able to get into the BIOS when my problem occurred, which seemed to me to be half of the problem. How do I get in?</p>

            <p>A "USB stick" is a colloquial expression for a flash disk. When creating it you will be told its minimum size (about 500 MBytes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting into the BIOS depends on your machine. You may need to press Esc, F1, F2 or Del at boot time. Why not ask Google?</p>

            <p>Sorry for keeping coming back with questions but I still cannot get into my desktop.</p>
<p>I have made a USB System Repair drive as you instructed &amp; I can get into the BIOS (I was being stupid - I had been there before but did not recognise it!!). I changed the boot to the USB drive (which was correctly identified by the make of the USB drive),
 the drive appears to be accessed, &amp; I chose a keyboard from the displayed list (UK English).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a screen or two (which I had not seen before) I chose Reset PC keeping my data files &amp; got the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "The drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this several times, always with the same result.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Presumably the message refers to the USB drive &amp; not the hard drive. In either case I do not know how to unlock the drive. I have checked the USB drive on this laptop &amp; it seems OK &amp; it contains boot files.</p>

            <p>I have not experienced the problem myself but it appears to be caused by a live hibernation file. Here is way to deal with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set your BIOS so that it uses the USB flash drive as its primary boot device.</li><li>Boot the machine with your System Repair flash disk.</li><li>Open a Command Prompt.</li><li>Type these commands until you find the hibernation file:<br />
<em>dir&nbsp; /a&nbsp; C:\hiber*.*</em><br />
<em>dir&nbsp; /a&nbsp; D:\hiber*.*</em><br />
<em>dir&nbsp; /a&nbsp; E:\hiber*.*</em><br />
Make a note of the drive letter where the file was found. I shall call it Q:.</li><li>Type the following commands <strong>exactly</strong> and press Enter after each:<br />
<em>takeown&nbsp; /f&nbsp; Q:\hiber*.*</em><br />
<em>cacls&nbsp; Q:\hiber*.*&nbsp; /g&nbsp; everyone:F</em><br />
<em>attrib&nbsp; -h -r -s Q:\hiber*.*</em><br />
<em>del&nbsp; Q:\hiber*.*</em><br />

<p>
</p><p>Try reinstalling Windows https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>Note you will need two Computers</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF that wont work turn on your PC and press ESC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then press F11</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then look for system restore</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all fails try sending it back to dell,hp etc</p>

<p><em>attrib&nbsp; -h -r -s Q:\hiber*.*</em><br />
<em>del&nbsp; Q:\hiber*.*</em></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, since I have never seen the "locked drive" problem I am guessing about its actual cause. Feel free to do some of your own Google search on this error message!</p>

<p>I have a problem with few achievements locked. They are: <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a196361/tropical-treasure-achievement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Tropical Treasure</a>, <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a196365/gotta-smash-em-all-achievement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Island Explorer</a> I contacted Xbox support and did all steps suggested. I did hard reset, uninstalled game and downloaded it again, deleted my profile and downloaded it again and cleared alternative MAC address. My road achievements is stuck at 90%, the rest
 are at 0%. Of course I met all requirements in game, I can provide screenshots later. What additional steps can I make to unlock those locked achievements?</p>

<p>Hello there! </p>
<p>They is a post at the top of this forum room explaining what to do for this but ill tell you :)
</p>
<p>Okay so firstly i would advise you to check TrueAchievements.com. Achievements can be tricky buggers and these guys have an excellent collection on what to do to earn each one.</p>
<p>After that you can try this:</p>
<p>1. It may sounds obvious but make sure you are connected to Xbox Live and attempt to unlock it again</p>
<p>2.Go to the Achievement detail view on Xbox.com or in your Xbox One Console to double check whether it is still locked</p>
<p>3. If they are still locked then wait 72 hours and then check Xbox.com or the console to see if it has unlocked, it may unlock whilst you are away from the device</p>
<p>4. If nothing seems to be helping then try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remove your account from your Xbox One Console</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Cycle your Xbox One Console</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Download your account back onto your console</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Attempt to unlock the achievement again</p>
<p>Now i know you've already stated you were asked to do this but just give it another go, you never know it might work this time</p>
<p>If none of that has not helped and you still don't have your achievements it would be best to take the survey as this would mean the proper teams would be aware of whats happening and can improve the achievement process, now you wont get an individual response
 but rest assured you will of been heard. </p>
<p>Survey: <a href="https://twtpoll.com/bxzvi17gcq3mw6m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">twtpoll.com/bxzvi17gcq3mw6m</a></p>
<p>I hope this helps! Happy Gaming! </p>

<p>Thanks for response. I'm a regular at TA and I use the site a lot to help me know what exactly have to be done to unlock tricky achievement. However, those aren't tricky, they are really obvious. I have to smash every reward board, drive every road, find
 car in a barn and I did it. Stats show correct numbers. I remember that when I played it I hade some problems with other achievements from Storm Island too, I tried to get 5 wins and it unlocked only recently after my... 9th victory. Another, with buying 'Storm
 Island's equipment' didn't unlock at first time too, it did few days later when I did it again. Unfortunately, I cannot drive every road again if I have already done it, I cannot discover barn find if it is done and barn is empty (I even got an achievement
 for winning a race with this car from that barn). Honestly, not meeting the requirements is not the case.</p>
<p>1. I was connected to Xlive at that time, trying to redo it is impossible.</p>
<p>2. Yes, roads stuck at 90%, the rest at 0%.</p>
<p>3. I unlocked them one month ago. I'm launching the game every day so I can check if it unlocks or not.</p>
<p>4. Ok, I can give it another go but I don't think that doing it over and over again with prayers is the solution. Anyway, nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I also filled the survey, I'm not sure when exactly but it was shortly after the achievements glitched, so probably over 3 weeks ago.</p>

    <title>Cannot delete 2nd Windows folders on a different partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> constantin zorile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete 2nd Windows folders on a different partition</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm under Win 7 Ultimate x64 as administrator account<br />
<br />
I installed Windows 8 on another partition just to see what it's like.<br />
Then I switched back to Windows 7. Removed Windows 8 from: msconfig - boot, and rebooted the machine.<br />
<br />
I tried deleting Win 8 related folders (windows, program files, etc)m but it said I need permission from Trusted installer. So I took steps.<br />
<br />
I changed all folders (and their sub-folders) permissions to my user and when I try to delete them I'm still getting permission-from-administrator error.<br />
<br />
I even tried the same after activating&nbsp; net user administrator /active:yes command, to no avail.<br />
<br />
I could simply move the rest of my folders to another partition then format this one, but alas I have no space left.<br />
<br />
It's getting way past annoying.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            <div>I think you need to format/delete the partition where Windows 8 is installed.</div>
<div>try the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Take backup of both the Windows 7 &amp; 8 partition, before performing the backup.</div>
<div>Press Windows key + X</div>
<div>Click Disk Management</div>
<div>Select the partition where Windows 8 is installed</div>
<div>Right click it, click 'Format'</div>
<div>You will receive a Warning dialog, click OK to continue.</div>
<div>The next step is to select your file system option, in this case, go with the default which is NTFS.</div>
<div>The formatting process will now begin.</div>
<div>Once complete, the drive will be displayed as a ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management.</div>
<div>Right click the ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management, on the contextual menu, click the ‘Delete Volume’ option. Click ‘Yes’ when the warning dialog appears.</div>
<div>The Volume you deleted will now appear as ‘Free space’, you will also notice that the disk icon no longer appears in the list of volumes.</div>
<div>Right click the Free space partition, and click Delete, click Yes on the Disk Management warning that appears.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The volume will now appear as Unallocated. (good stuff). Our next step is to merge back that unallocated free space with the system partition. Right click the System volume and click the ‘Extend Volume’ option on the contextual menu, click ‘Yes’ when the
 warning appears.</div>
<div>A wizard will now begin that will guide through the steps to merge back the unallocated space with your system partition.</div>
<div>The wizard provides a simple procedure to merge back the unallocated space with the system drive. Once you have selected the space, click Next, at the end of the wizard, you will see the amount allocated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers.</div>

            Thank you for your time and answer.<br />
<br />
As I said, I cannot format the partition due to several reasons. I did however manage to get the problem solved using a third party kit, called TakeOwnership, or such and mingle with it.<br />
<br />

<p>the only way to do that is to keep the profile on there and try to recover it on your console. however, i gotta warn you...dont try to have both of them online at the same time or it will look a little hinky to the xblpet crew</p>

<p>[quote user="mjmb60"]Y<span>ou can copy</span>&nbsp;the gamer<span>&nbsp;profile on</span>&nbsp;<span>a</span>&nbsp;<span>USB[/quote]No
 you cannot. You may <b>Move</b> a profile onto a USB Memory Unit, but you cannot Copy it. That's a distinct difference.[quote]When I go to friend's house an play with him, I don't get any reward or something because I don't play with my profile. So I thought

<b>Move</b> the profile onto a USB Memory Unit. Once at your friend's house, you'll need to select your profile for your player so that the game applies the correct updates to your profile for achievement tracking.</span></p>
<p><br />
The master record of your gamertag is stored on XBOX Live servers. The local copy you have is just a copy. When in doubt, Live will use the information stored on the Live servers over your local copy. If you play offline with your friend using your profile,
 remember to log into Live when you get home using your USB Memory Unit copy. If you recover your gamertag before syncing, you will lose any achievements gained.</p>

<h2>            IBM Thinkpad SL410 has a webcam, but no software to run it.</h2>
                    
<p>I have an IBM Thinkpad SL410 with Windows 7. It has a built in webcam, but I can't find any software to run the webcam. I was wondering if there is a general program like the scanner and camera wizard that was on Windows XP so that I could easily take pictures
 with my webcam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Complaint</h2>
                    <p>I would like to file a complaint, I have been getting an error when I attempt to purchase Xbox live gold through the console and the web browser. I would get an error saying "something happened our end please try again later" for the past 2 months. I would
 try again every day wasting my time trying to fix this by resetting my settings and removing and adding cards back with no luck. After 2 months of trying again I finally went to a store to purchase a Xbox life card to use, but when I input this I get the same
 error. I finally had enough of waiting yet more time and contacted live chat. On the live chat I was told that this was a rare error on their end and asked me to produce documents to help this and I would get this done within 48 hours, every danni would check
 on the status and provide any documentation needed. Over 72 hours later still no response or resolution so I contacted live chat once again. I was told this was a rare error and that they didn't know how to fix it. After spending 2 and a half hours on live
 support they decided that I needed to make a new account and added the 3 months code to that account. &nbsp;But still my o xRL o account does not work and I have to use a 2nd account to give my main account Xbox live. After spending 8 - 10 hours this &nbsp;week on this
 issue and many many hours over the past 2 months resolving this I was given 1 month free Xbox live! The equivalent to £5!!! I have wasted my own valuable time on trying to fix it myself, contacting customer support, dealing with uploading documents, traveling
 expenses goint to a store to purchase a Xbox live code that woudldnt work, travel time and then contacting live support again. I am so angry and disappointed to the point where I may stop using Xbox. I have been a customer for around 14 years and spending
 £1000s (check my purchases). I then ring up to make a complaint and told I cannot over the phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Rhys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with purchasing gold, and redeeming codes. There could be a few reasons why you getting the error and yes it is very odd that you have encountered this for&nbsp; so long. First thing is make sure your billing address is up to date. After that
 we suggest you request a call back, there could be something going on with the profile and may need to be looked into further by higher tier. When you go to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us">
Contact Us</a> to get it to request a callback follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</li><li>Step 2 ----select no
 then select category system update</span></li><li>Step 3-----gives some troubleshooting or help tips<br />
</li><li>Step 4 ----select request a call from support</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help you. I will continue to watch the thread see if you get resolved.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated it and this isn't causing the error they told me this on the live chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told it was being looked into as stated on my complaint and was told inwould hear back within 48 hours and that was on Sunday. Like I said I'm a customer and I pay for a service I have not had the problem before and this is a problem with your
 system and not nothing on my end. I refuse to waste any more of my time on this issue. Can i get a formal notification for my complain so I can see that it has been logged.</p>

    <title>How do I delete images off of file explorer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I delete images off of file explorer&#63;</h2>
                    I'll download an image off of Bing, and it will end up in the file explorer, but I can't delete it in anyway. I've tried right clicking and even going back to downloads via Bing, but it just brings me back to file explorer.

<h2>            No Wish list in Movies &#38; TV</h2>
                    I am surprised that there is no Wish list in Microsoft's Movies &amp; TV.&nbsp; When you browse around the movies and collect the titles what you want to watch and store in Wish list for future's purchase.&nbsp; They have none in Movies &amp; TV, this results that they
 "force" you to buy them immediately.&nbsp; I think that they should add "Wish List" feature to the moves &amp; TV like Amazon and Apple's itune.&nbsp;

            Just adding another request that this feature should be implemented.&nbsp; It is one reason I don't use the MS Store much&nbsp;for movies because I want to be able to keep a list of stuff I want to watch eventually as I come across them when browsing. Like Amazon's
 "watchlist".

            <p>Hey Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you never use Winlocker then you don't need to worry about it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open start menu &amp; click control panel</li><li>Open Programs/Features</li><li>Scroll down and Find Winlocker, right click and "Uninstall".</li><li>Once this is finished, it'll prompt you to restart your PC.</li><li>Restart your PC and try copy/paste to see if functionality is restored.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, Ewan &nbsp;</p>
