<h2>            surfacepro docking station network cable unplugged</h2>
                    I just got my new surface pro 4 with a docking station in the bundle.&nbsp; I want to use a wired Ethernet connection at work instead of the wireless.&nbsp; The wired network will not work.&nbsp; It says the cable is unplugged.&nbsp; I have tried it with different cables,
 different cable locations that work.&nbsp; I switched docking stations with a coworking and this docking station works with his surface pro 3 but not my surface pro 4.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the driver and reinstalled.&nbsp; nothing I have tried seems to work.&nbsp; does anyone
 have a solution?&nbsp; it seems to be in the surface pro 4 and not the docking station

            Sometimes a network adapter has problems when the lan speed is set to autodetect.&nbsp; Try setting the network adapter
<strong>speed</strong> to 100(choices usually are 10 100 1000 autodetect).&nbsp; This setting can be found under Network Adapters in device manager in the Advanced tab.

<h2>            This App Can&#39;t Print Right Now</h2>
                    <p>I have inadvertently chosen Fresh Paint to open a PNG document. Now I can't get my document to open with any other program/App. So I tried printing. There is no Print button/Icon to choose from. So I swiped from the right side of the screen to open Devices.
 Tried to Print from here and I get the Message "This App Can't Print Right Now". Why am I getting this message. How can I print. OR how can I keep Fresh Paint from running this document each time I &nbsp;open it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sounds like your on board microphone has been disabled in some way. You might want to call Gateway to see if there is a key combination to re-enable it, or some way to re-enable it in control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is to hook up a USB microphone, or a USB Webcam with built in microphone..</p>

            Hi Mike,
<br />
<br />First I would check the level of Cyan in your ink cartridges, generally if printing looks red/pink it means there is not enough blue (cyan) ink getting through
<br />
<br />Also clean the heads on your Printer 3 maybe 4 times

            Thank you for your comment, these basics have been well covered in my trouble shooting.&nbsp; In the end, I finally found how I could get into directly tune the color correction for the printer.<br />

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; This printer with Win 10 does not have a calibration per the user manual.&nbsp; I did however finally find the color calibration inside windows 10 for the printer and was able through a combination of adjustment in the printer configuration
 and the photo editing software, achieve good color results that very closely match reality.<br />

<h2>            No Auto Rotate Feature After Reseting a Linx8 Tablet</h2>
                    <p>After resetting my Linx8 tablet I lost my auto rotate feature. There is nothing in settings to turn the auto rotate on. It looks like I might need to download a driver or something. What do you guys reckon? Is it repairable? I had Windows 8.1 in it when
 I bought the tablet, but there is no option to return back to windows 8.1.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kaivey,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concerned. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, try the simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display adapter driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>
uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display adapter driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the display adapter driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest display adapter driver. If the display driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, go to the tablet manufacturer website and try installing all the updated driver for each devices. If that does not help to fix the issue please contact tablet manufacturer they would be able to help you with these kind of
 issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Keep posting us with the status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

    <title>Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6200 AGN code 43 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ipurgepeople  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6200 AGN code 43</h2>
                    I'm having a similar problem as a guy in another thread <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/wireless-connection-diconnects-intermittently/0181195f-e952-4b1d-a0f5-29d4ce5e5129">
here</a>. However, those generic answers received have not helped, I tried them all multiple times over a period of weeks.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem still persists. This hardware is installed in my Toshiba Satellite A665, running Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit. Here is my report of the problem:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This adapter creates two "Microsoft WiFi Miniport Adapters" without which the adapter fails to work properly. Occasionally, if using the laptop for an extended period of time (4+ hours generally), the miniport adapters get the yellow exclamation point,
 and upon inspection they spit out a code 43, and i lost connection to the internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've found a way to get around this, to fix it without having to reboot the laptop: Open the device manager, click on "Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6200 AGN and disable-enable it. It usually takes 3-4 rounds of this manual reset to fix the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Running the wireless troubleshooter does the same thing: resets the adapter, but doesn't fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I have run windows update, everything is up to date.&nbsp;</li><li>I've searched for drivers, everything is up to date.</li><li>Running windows wireless troubleshooter has no effect.</li><li>I've uninstalled and reinstalled the device a dozen times, to no avail.</li><li>I've disabled network adapter power management settings.</li><li>I moved, and switched ISPs, switched internet SPEED, modem, router, etc., and it STILL happens. Firmware is all up to date.</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nothing has worked. From looking around on here, and on Intel's site, it seems there's quite a few issues with this adapter and windows 7 64bit. I'm not sure where the problem lies, but the problem exists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So any help other than what i've mentioned I've already done here would be appreciated, and if unable to help, pointing me in the right direction would help as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
                </div>

            I found that my neighbors had the same router channel as I did. &nbsp;After changing my router channel and the channel on the adapter, speedtest.net showed immediate fix.

<h2>            007 Legends Backwards Compatability please&#63; Because there isn&#39;t any 007 games in the Xbox one store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to make 007 Legends from the Xbox 360&nbsp;backwards compatiable for&nbsp;the Xbox One? 007 legends on the Xbox One now that sounds like a nice game to have back on the&nbsp;Xbox One&nbsp;console? Think about this: There haven't been&nbsp;any 007 games on the Xbox One consoles online store&nbsp;or the microsoft store yet. Thanks for helping I&nbsp;won't be able to reply on time, so just let me know for now. Thanks.</p>

            <p>It would be nice to have the 007 games on the Xbox one, but it may not be possible due to the licenses for James Bond &amp; the 007 logo, trademarks &amp; the game being owned by&nbsp;different companies such as Danjaq, MGM, 20th Century Fox, United Artists &amp; Columbia Pictures, &amp; Activision. The licenses have to be renewed to be able to play the game on the Xbox One, and I would say it would be a lot more complicated to do for these games. But never say never, you never know it might happen. Keep an eye on the back compat list <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-one/backward-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp; and vote for the games to become backward compatible on here <a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.uservoice.com</a><br /></p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Laptop overheating after Windows 10 upgrade. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victorb7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop overheating after Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>I read many threads about this topic. &nbsp;Most answers will mention cleaning the fan or closing some programs, but I'm sure many people tried that without results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running under Windows 7 and upgraded to 10. The fan was running like hell non-stop, and my laptop was reaching temperatures above 200 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure there was no dust or obstruction on the fan</p>
<p>I &nbsp;checked all my drivers and they were up to date.</p>
<p>I closed all apps and unused services.</p>
<p>I uninstalled my antivirus.</p>
<p>I tried every suggestion I could find in discussion forums on this topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop is an HP Pavilion G6, Intel M370 and 4GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I restored my laptop back to Windows 7. &nbsp;The temperature stays under 120 degrees, even with 10 heavy applications running simultaneously. &nbsp;I intend to postpone my upgrade until Microsoft fixes the bug because, honestly, I can't see what else is
 causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else tried everything and still experiencing overheating?</p>

            I have this issue too, I am 99% certain it is the secondary discrete graphics card playing up and running under full frequency/ voltage due to bad drivers.

    <title>No mouse is working in Windows 8. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No mouse is working in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Everything was fine, however, this morning, neither the PS2 nor the USB mouse is working. No pointer at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem - the mice stopped working in Win 8, since today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Both of the mice get their lights on when connected.</p>
<p>2) Both of them working fine in Ubuntu, but not in Windows 8, on the same desktop, with the same ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried - </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Updated the mouse driver from Device Manger --&gt; No use.</p>
<p>2) Uninstalled the driver, reinstalled, reconnected, restarted, reconnected --&gt; No use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do now?</p>

<p>Nope. It was working fine during the last run. I have checked multiple times. When I uninstall the driver and plug-in the mouse again, the driver got installed automatically.&nbsp;</p>

                    I cannot believe what a joke Microsoft support is. &nbsp;Yes, it is free, but didn't I buy their product? &nbsp;"We are here to help you." &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;I spent most of the day in on-line chats. &nbsp;As soon as the tech realized that helping me was going to take too much
 of their time, they terminated the chat. &nbsp;One person told me to re-start my computer, but don't fear -- here is your work order number and link to continue this chat. &nbsp;That was just a way to get rid of me. &nbsp;When re-starting didn't work, I clicked on the link
 to re-start the chat "with the same technician," and I got someone entirely different who asked me my name and what the problem was and then discontinued the chat when I pointed out that I was re-joining for an already existing chat. &nbsp;Finally, I googled the
 problem (for the 10th time) and I found a solution that worked. &nbsp;Randomly googling something produces better results than chatting with Microsoft? &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;If I was as b

            Same exact BS I experienced. Their techs do not know the product and are incapable of resolving issues. They read/type off a script and cannot think like a human being. The extent of their troubleshooting involves endless questioning until you get fed
 up and realize the issue is never even going to be addressed. Googling answers turns out to be better support than contacting the manufacturer of their own Product for real help; pathetic. I've been a victim and held hostage by using MSFT products for far
 too long and am now finally aware of the longest running scam in the tech world and am converting my business technology away from Microsoft as fast as possible.&nbsp;

            <p>I have spent over 8 and a half hours (so far, I am on hold right now) chatting and on the phone with Microsoft support about a problem with my new Lumia 950. Well, it was just one problem this morning when I started talking to them. Now my phone has multiple
 problems after trying their "fixes" and the original problem has not been fixed either. I spent over $560.00 on this phone and all I can do is make calls or send and receive texts. The original problem that I called about this morning is that all the pictures
 I take or download disappear within 48 hours. I've tried saving them to my SD card, the device and One Drive but they all disappear within 48 hours. Now after having me do a complete reset six hours ago, my apps won't reinstall on the phone. Next they told
 me to download an app onto my desktop computer and connect the phone so that it could fix all my problems but after two and a half hours it did not work either. Now they want me to mail in the phone and they will get it back to me in 10 to 14 days but no phone
 to use in the meantime. I have chatted with or spoken to 9 different people and not one problem has been fixed. When I asked to speak to a supervisor the tech person refused. When I asked if I could have my case escalated to a a higher tech group I was told
 that they would call me back in 96 hours. By then the 14 day warranty will have expired. How convenient. I never had these problems with any of the Nokia products that I have owned. Microsoft apparently doesn't know how to make or support phones and they certainly
 don't know how to provide quality customer service. We got "disconnected" a few minutes ago and now they keep calling me back and hanging up as soon as I answer. They are too stupid to even try to change their number. Do they not know about caller ID? This
 is harassment. I wish I knew how to report it to someone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Virtual agent don't work either if you have to use a Mac because Windows 10 can't even detect a hardwired device, let alone a network, cable,ethernet, or wireless. Windows is a bunch of SCREENSHOTS and nothing is supported by ones and zeros.&nbsp;</p>

 I take or download disappear within 48 hours. I've tried saving them to my SD card, the device and One Drive but they all disappear within 48 hours. Now after having me do a complete reset six hours ago, my apps won't reinstall on the phone. Next they told
 me to download an app onto my desktop computer and connect the phone so that it could fix all my problems but after two and a half hours it did not work either. Now they want me to mail in the phone and they will get it back to me in 10 to 14 days but no phone
 to use in the meantime. I have chatted with or spoken to 9 different people and not one problem has been fixed. When I asked to speak to a supervisor the tech person refused. When I asked if I could have my case escalated to a a higher tech group I was told
 that they would call me back in 96 hours. By then the 14 day warranty will have expired. How convenient. I never had these problems with any of the Nokia products that I have owned. Microsoft apparently doesn't know how to make or support phones and they certainly
 don't know how to provide quality customer service. We got "disconnected" a few minutes ago and now they keep calling me back and hanging up as soon as I answer. They are too stupid to even try to change their number. Do they not know about caller ID? This
 is harassment. I wish I knew how to report it to someone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1st problem is onedrive. 2nd problem is cloud-any cloud. Next problem will be getting your pictures from the two company's that stole them. And trying to get around the ransom they are attempting to embezzle out of you by them literally threaten to delete
 your pics unless you agree to one of their payments plans, they have setup for your money, in their future, by default. They helped themselves to your pics in settings. If you think you turned them all off THINK AGAIN. They turn them back on by default, upgrade,
 downgrade, On switch, Off switch, low battery, and soon as you plug your charger in, unplug your charger, and Power on. They stole your property.</p>

Why not? Widows 10 is canned Screenshots with little if any ones and zeros supporting even the OS, can't detect even an ethernet device hardwired to the motherboard. Network Adapter Ha -A literal picture of a icon as if it's anything but, and the settings?
 Nothing but a embellished screenshot of specs but a functioning circuit controller? Not. You can click on these loops until you're blue in the face. Troubleshooter: didn't work in 95 98 xp 7 8vista10 and it is still a stall tactic to keep you from calling
 and telling them what they already know. Virtual Agent: A BROWSER that is designed not to run. What a concept.....Make sure it doesn't run if your microsoft acounts have to use a mac safari google firefox internet explorer....... to research why Widows 10
 does nothing except loop screenshots from no adaptors, to reset, that connects you to some location of a Network and supply's a Date???, that asks you for a group. "Whats your Network location sir?" Oh 11/26/1965 at 2:05:32 PM. We'll send a time machine right
 soon as we get our crayons out and finish scribbling outside the lines.

<p>My connection was with Lark. The issue took approximately an hour. Brand new 1X. Had connected to internet for a couple of days. It wont now. They suggest Sky is the issue (provider) they, Sky suggest Microsoft as I have laptop and iphone connection to the
 web. I then waited 45 mins for a reply from Lark...Nothing! </p>
<p>I reconnected with William. William cannot liaise with Lark, so I'm stuck in limbo. The Xbox goes back to Argos tomorrow. What a complete utter waste of time, **** service!!</p>

    <title>Click Bios II not working&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toaorka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Click Bios II not working&#33;</h2>
                    Okay, so I recently acquired Windows 8 in a new PC that I ordered from NewEgg. The application Click Bios II came with a disk that came with the motherboard, as well as a slew of completely superfluous programs that my father deemed required (Google Chrome
 and Google toolbar for IE, really?)<br />
<br />
The program was working like it should have, but after my father reset the PC for some reason, the program now gives an error message stating that something had stopped working and the program just sat there afterwards loading endlessly until I opened the Task
 Manager and manually closed out of it. After messing around with the compatibility settings, now it simply says "CLICK BIOS II has been running," and then exits out of everything.<br />
<br />
Is this program even required at all, or can I delete this piece of garbage? <br />

            Hi, Toa.
<div><br />
<div>The program is not required at all, but it is an effective way to control overclocking and which drive you want to boot from. As an alternative, you can also use the Click BIOS II interface by pressing F11 (I belive?) before your computer has launched
 Windows, when your computer has been turned on.</div>

=====================================================<br />
The info I posted for you is for Vista....try again because the info is correct.<br />
<br />
Here's another way to access the contents of your SD card:<br />
<br />
Apparently you have an internal or external USB Media Reader?<br />
<br />
Insert your SD card in the correct slot on the Media Reader...<br />
if any windows open...close them.<br />
<br />
When the card is inserted...if you go to...Start / Computer...is<br />
the card reader listed as one or more Removable Disks?<br />
<br />
Removable Disk (E:)<br />
Removable Disk (F:)<br />
Removable Disk (G:)<br />
<br />
If_Yes_you can download the files from there. Left clicking<br />
the drive letter that corresponds to the SD Card slot should<br />
display the directory of the card and you can copy/paste or<br />
drag/drop the files of your choice to a folder on your hard <br />
drive. <br />
<br />
Just right click a selected group of files and choose...Copy...<br />
then navigate to the folder you want them in and right click the <br />
folder and choose Paste.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
You may try the steps as below and check if the issue gets fixed.<br />
1. Open Windows Media Player 12<br />
2. Click Organize, click Options and then click the Library tab<br />
3. In the Automatic media information updates for files area, make sure that 'Retrieve additional information from the Internet' is not checked.<br />
4. This should prevent Media Player from overwriting what you have added.<br />

<h3> silv3rac3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Download Speed Really Slow</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I purchased an Xbox One today and hooked it up to my U-verse wifi network, which gets about 10mbps download speed. I bought the Assassin's Creed Unity bundle and tried to download the game from the store. The connection speed I'm getting is only around 300kbps
 and sometimes it goes down to 1-5kbps. I was looking around YouTube and found a video that told me I could get detailed network setting by testing my multiplayer connection in the network settings and then holding down LB+RB+LT+RT once the checking was completed.
 I did that and it said my download speed was 5mbps. That is actually what I get on my PC when I download things from steam but I'm not sure why it's so low on my Xbox when I try to download a game. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I imagine many of the download times will be slower due to the increased traffic of new consoles going online after Christmas and downloading new games for those systems. The Assassin's Creed Unity and Black Flag may be particularly slow since this was the
 most common pack-in game and a lot of demand on those store servers. Then there was the DDOS attacks against Live over Christmas which also affected many Live services. The download times should improve with time, unfortunately I don't think there would be
 anything you could do on your end to help improve your speed. The only thing you might do to improve your download speed is to hard wire the One to your network as opposed to using WiFi as wired connections are always faster, but the ultimate bottleneck will
 be the servers to which you are connected. </p>

<p>I've also been trying some other games, specifically ones that are fairly old in order to make sure that there isn't a whole lot of traffic, and it hasn't improved whatsoever. I tried to download the Dead Rising 3 demo just to see if it would improve and
 it didn't do anything.</p>

<h2>            Key Not Valid For Use in Specified State</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered a strange issue involving the attempt to install one particular PC utility - Slim Drivers. It is a freeware product that handles driver updates and seems to do a fine job on another of my systems. No problems installing or using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However that is not the case with the ASUS All-in-One PC/Tablet (model# P1801) that I am currently attempting to install Slim Drivers onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I begin installation (I install as Administrator) the install proceeds to about two-thirds finished approximately but stops and then gives me the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Key Not Valid for Installation In Specified State</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and the installation says that it has encountered an error and must stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used System Restore to roll back a week but the problem still continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated earlier I have never had this problem with any of my other systems - just this one.</p>
                </div>

<h2>            Ordering an AZERTY keyboard in the US - Surface laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can order a Microsoft Surface laptop with an AZERTY keyboard? I don't want to have to switch our keys or add stickers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like in 2018 this has to be an option somehow, right? I can't seem to find any vendor (via their website at least) that allows for this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? Thanks</p>

<h2>            after creating new user account the app store doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have tried this several times with the same result:</p>
<p>create a new user account with local log-in</p>
<p>when returning to my own user account a number of my store apps will not run</p>
<p>none of the suggested fixes&nbsp;help:</p>
<ul>
<li>wsreset.exe fails [remote procedure failed]</li><li>entering several command lines at a system prompt fails [the entered location cannot be found]</li><li>deleting the newly created user account</li></ul>
<p>the only way I have found to fix this is to restore the computer to a previous time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please don't suggest I try a bunch of the usual procedures to fix the store</p>
<p>this is something specifically to do with opening the new user account. is this an known issue?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Lorne,</p>
<p><br />
Please answer the below to assist you better.<br />
1.&nbsp;Did you get any error message when trying to access&nbsp;the apps?<br />
2.&nbsp;When you say “my own user account”, Is it Microsoft account or <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local account?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you to Run <strong>App troubleshooter </strong>and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>App Troubleshooter</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The app troubleshooter will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />
This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the <br />
Store.<br />

            <p>1. No error message when trying to access apps. App tries to open and&nbsp;then immediately closes.&nbsp;Photos and Groove Music are examples of this app behaviour.&nbsp;Mail, People, Calendar work fine.</p>
<p>2. Yes. when I said "my own user account" it&nbsp;is in fact my Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just created a new user account [local] again. During the process I got messages that OneDrive was updating to the newest version and an app default was reset. The new users windows 10 account appears to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Upon return to my own Microsoft account I experienced the say problems as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the App troubleshooter and it reset the temp internet file location to default. Otherwise detected no problems.</p>

<div>Since the new user account is working fine,&nbsp;the issue might&nbsp;be with your&nbsp;Microsoft account.</div>

            <p>Unfortunately I am not going to be able to test your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few more attempts at trying to resolve the above issue, I had a password lock-out to the entire machine, not just my Microsoft &nbsp;account. This required a windows 10 reinstall according to Dell tech support.The hardware is a Dell Inspiron 7000 series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The password lock-out may have been caused by the deletion of the users folder "useruser" (where "user" is my user name). In order to delete the new local user account, i created a local account for myself as administrator and removed the unwanted user account.
 I could then not figure out how to delete my own local user account. I assumed it was useruser and deleted the folder.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows App troubleshooter and it told me that there was nothing wrong. This is totally incorrect as I have told you that I cannot access the App Store or use the Windows icon in the left hand corner, so something must be wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have now decided to restore my computer back to its factory settings and start again from scratch to see if I can resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
