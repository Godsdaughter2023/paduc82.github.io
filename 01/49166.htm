<h2>            The app for portable Adobe illustrator CS5 does not work on Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
I have the app of portable Adobe illustrator CS5 , portabolized by Xenocode Virtual Desktop.<br />
The app works correctly on Windows7 (32-bit), but when I have upgraded my OS to Windows8 (32-bit) the app can't run (whereas it works correctly in normal setup mode), also after applying the all compatibility issues,&nbsp;it always display the following error message
 "The app was unable to load a required virtual machine. Please contact the publisher ..."<br />
Please provide me with the solution.<br />
Thank you...<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. You seem to be facing an issue with the

<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you receive any error code?</p>
<p>I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1 –</p>
<p><span>I would have you run the </span><span>Modern UI App troubleshooter.</span></p>

Nirmal S</a>&nbsp;for helpful aid and quick reply&nbsp;&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>As the answer for your questions:</p>
<p>a. This issue repeated in similar apps packaged with the same software (Xenocode Virtual&nbsp;Desktop), but all of my apps&nbsp;are working correctly on Win7.</p>
<p>b. There is&nbsp;NO ERROR MESSAGE, instead, When double click the app EXE, it appears the sign of "Working in background", then after while, the sign disappear and NOTHING occur!.</p>
<p>When I have run the Compatibility troubleshooter, and choose the "Try recommended sittings", then "Test program", it asks the Administrator permission, and when I click OK it&nbsp;gives me the message "The app was unable to load a required virtual machine. Please
 contact the publisher of this application for more information"</p>
<p>After applying&nbsp;all of the troubleshooting adjustments, the SAME ERROR still occur!</p>
<p>c. there is no any error code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had contacted the app's publisher, but it till me that they can't diagnose the problem! so I contacted you as the OS manufacturers.</p>
<p><span>The issue persists, and</span> hope you find the issue</p>
<p>I need further assistance, and so sorry for tolerance :)</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

</p><p>Hey Ravinath,</p>
<p>I appreciate your help with Adobe Illustrator Requirements. If its not working on windows 8 then its pretty clear that this version of windows does not support most of adobe products. Infact, not only adobe products but a lots of other softwares. What i
 need to know is that you are giving us the compatibility mode in windows 8. If i run any program using compatibility mode, i got this error "The app was unable to load a required virtual machine. Please contact the publisher of this application for more information".
 I believe there is some component missing which is why my windows 8 is unable to run the program is compatibility mode. Let us know what component is it? Is it VMware&nbsp; or any other like it? Also provide us any link if possible.<br />

</p><p>As I read about this problem, it means that is caused by some hotfix from Microsoft, mainly KB3022345, KB3045999 and KB3068708, that can be uninstalled and then, that kind of encapsulated program normally returns to function. But it appears to be a new policy
 of microsoft to stop piracy, because this fixes blocks the portable programs to work, because it's a piracy copy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think that it's fine since users has been notified. Some people don't understand it and the microsoft support don't explain it for us as clear as possible, and it make me upset.<br />
<br />
I Hope that I have helped someone to not spend time looking for a solution that will never comes from Microsoft.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>P.S. The Update KB3020370 can't be uninstalled and it blocks &nbsp;portable programs</p>

    <title>Why does Bungie punish us for leaving games&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tj21717  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Bungie punish us for leaving games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have only left 3 games. That's all. I have left the first two because my two teammates bailed out and it was just me and some other guy against the other team of 4 players. We both bailed. I had to do this for 2 games!</p>
<p>The third game took place on a map called Utopie. I'm sure most of you have heard of it and know how this map gives the red team a major headache when it comes to spawn killing. The ridge above the
<b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">RED </span></b>team's spawn point is where the <b>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">BLUE </span></b>team camps and snipes. There is NO way you can complete objective games on a map such as this! The map is way too big and it would take way too long for you to capture the objective!</p>
<p>So the question I have is, why does Bungie punish us for leaving games? Whether you lose connection to Xbox Live, your entire team bails out on you, or there is a design flaw in the map that BUNGIE designed, not us!</p>
<p>I think it's a stupid idea that people get punished because they leave games!</p>
<p>If they do it excessively, I understand. It's annoying that people rage-quit the game. I think the players should just stick with it and maybe we can turn the game to our advantage if we just go a different route or change our tactics!</p>
<p>Besides, if my entire team bails out on me, I don't want to stick around and be the only player being killed while the players on the other team get a major boost in their K/D ratio because my team decided to abandon me.</p>
<p>Also, I was wondering how many games do I have to quit out of to be banned for 10 minutes? I have only quit out of 3 so I should be fine.</p>

<p>Well, I just got banned for the first time because I lost connection to a game before it even started! This is a great system you have here Bungie. Now lets see how many gamers get infuriated enough and demand that you get rid of this feature!</p>

<p>It's been complained and complained about. But one thing has stayed true. For every person who hates the system, there are 10 who support it. This is one of the only games that makes you think twice before you *** your team mates over. You didn't like it
 when you were abandoned, which is exactly why the ban is in effect. Yeah, it sucks being a 1 man show where your only hope is to hide the match away or quit. But those matches don't happen often enough for you to be banned. Yes, quitting 4 games in a row might
 trigger a response. But the ban is only like 15 minutes anyway unless you choose to ignore the bans and keep quitting. Perfect time for a little break.</p>

<p>I'm a supporter of the system. If other games where to implement this feature into there games. In my honest opinion I think the online gaming community would benefit. Yes it has its bugs/problems but you have to think. This is the first game that does this
 and it can get better with time with the proper development </p>

<p>I just lost connection again and I've been banned, again. So, you tell me, does it sound like this is a great system for banning quitters? I'm not a quitter unless my entire team quits and leaves me to ROT! The system they setup basically says, it doesn't
 matter if you have lost connection mid-game, you're banned!</p>

<p>This system does not work. I have been in games where 2 people leave the opposite team and 1 person leaves my team. It happens quite frequently. The people who quit obviously don't care about this system and will quit anyway.</p>
<p>But, the problem comes with people like me who DON'T quit. I like seeing the game end unless I'm alone getting killed repeatedly by 4 opponents.</p>
<p>There are also gamers out there who lose connection sometimes. Maybe somebody else is using the computer without their knowledge and they get disconnected a 4th time and get banned.</p>
<p>If I were Bungie, I would set the quit limit to around 10 or 15. I don't think I could lose my connection 10 or 15 times in one day.</p>

<p>Sounds like you have a connection issue. I don't think it's Bungies fault you can't keep a connection for a full game. Go ahead and reset your router, open NAT, get a static IP, run a wired connection, and maybe do a speed test before you complain next time.
 Happy gaming!</p>

<p>...and to think, you wouldn't even be having this problem if you hadn't left those two games in the beginning of your evening simply because you were the last guy on your team. &nbsp;Funny how that works... you quit those two games, yet... somehow, they shuldn't
 count against you because you were short handed. &nbsp;Quitting is quitting, doesn't matter what the odds of the match are... you quit.. nuff said....</p>

<h2>            Default gateway is not available</h2>
                    <p>When ever I'm browsing the web, or watching a video on YouTube, I would get a yellow triangle next to the Wi-Fi icon. When I use the troubleshooter to fix the problem, it will say the default gateway is not available and it says its fixed. This will happen
 throughout the day, maybe an hour or so apart. I have been googling the problem, and I have tried every fix that had been offered, but nothing worked. Everyone is saying the problem could be linked to one of the cumulative updates for 1511, some started having
 problems when they updated to 1511. Do you guys have any other ideas on how to fix this, or are you guys working on it with your next cumulative update? I would appreciate if anyone would reply this with ideas on how to fix this, or someone from Microsoft.</p>

            I have tried that fix, and it didn't work. I just came across another thread, and someone suggested that it could be the power saving setting for the adapter, so I have tried that and keeping my fingers crossed.

            I am still having issues with the default gateway is not available. I was hoping the problem would be fixed with the cumulative update that come out Tuesday, but it wasn't. Do you guys have any other suggestions, or can you guys please fix it with your
 next patch please? This is very frustrating, especially when I'm trying to do homework for my college courses.

 device, but will not detect the TV as a remote display for projection or mirroring.&nbsp; I've updated my networking adapter, my graphics driver, the TV firmware, run the latest Windows updates, and still nothing.&nbsp; I'm not sure what else to try.

As I mentioned, the TV isn't being detected as a wireless display, so I can't "fix" the connection with those troubleshooting steps.&nbsp; The TV is recognized as a media device and can received cast media files, but is not recognized as a wireless display so that
 I can project my desktop.&nbsp; I need to know how to fix the issue with the TV not being recognized as a display.

</p><p>So I'm wondering... what causes this? And how do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer shipped with a copy of Windows 8.1 on it, so I have no install disc to boot from.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated, as my computer has been doing this for well over a month now. I've searched all throughout the web, but can't seem to find any solutions to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<div>Hi <strong>Leonilde</strong>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to enable and disable .NET Framework from Windows Features On or Off and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Here are the steps: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b. Uncheck .Net Framework, and hit ok.<br />
c. Restart the computer, follow the same procedure, and check .Net Framework.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Turn Windows features on or off<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your
 first troubleshooting steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong><br />

    <title>Constant graphics problems every time Windows decides to update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thardy95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant graphics problems every time Windows decides to update</h2>
                    <p>A couple years ago I had Windows 7. It worked great. Later I had Windows 8. It was not great. Then I eventually upgraded to Windows 10 and it was better but not as good as Windows 7. But it was good enough. A few months ago, however, after a forced update
 that I put off for far too long as I always had a dozen open tabs in my Google Chrome browser, there was a slight and I mean major problem. A game that I play consistently and have put 1,400 hours in since 2014, Defense of the Ancients 2, stopped functioning
 correctly as far as graphics were concerned. There was a constant screen flicker and tear that had a jagged wave of black of only the rendered objects and menus. Like an electric wave of darkness rippling through the screen, rendering the game virtually unplayable
 to anybody with even the most mild case of epilepsy, and giving a major headache to anyone else. Luckily I have good vision and was able to grin and bear it for the longest time. It was a small price to pay. The loading screens would rupture and reveal the
 rendering underneath, but the environments would be fine. The objects and sprites and menus were constantly flickering in and out of view, and when bringing up the Steam menu (as I played through Valve's Steampowered client) it still did the same thing, to
 the point that it would automatically close the steam menu at random intervals. This was very inconvenient as I used the in-game web browser to access a notepad where I would write down information I needed because I'm a giant nerd like that. Anywho, I eventually
 purchased some other games (Half Life 2 Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and a lot of mods and standalone games using the engine) and decided to begin playing Half Life 2 as I had played it on The Orange Box on the Xbox 360 but never beat it. I got pretty far in until it got
 to a rough slog, and I took a break to play StarCraft 2. More on that later. A few Windows Updates later I went back only to realize that it was doing the same to Dota2 that it was doing to HL2. Curious, I booted up Dota to see that the graphics error was
 no longer occurring. I thought, maybe Windows just has some incompatibilities with Valve software??? I waited a few days to see if anybody was having the same issue and had any easy fixes. The only thing I could find was information about rolling back Windows
 updates. I did so, to a build of Windows 10 before the issue had come up. I did so and the problem was fixed! All of my games were working properly! Until the next Update, which ruined several of my games YET AGAIN, including Dota and Star Wars Battlefront
 2 (2005) [another game I've put a lot of hours into but not quite as many]. But weirdly enough, THAT update fixed a lighting glitch in Cry Of Fear, which was an issue back in Windows 8, where your light sources simply didn't work (which renders the game unplayable
 as you NEED to use the light sources to navigate a few mazes), and while the audio for gunshots and developer commentary hasn't worked through two cycles of updates, that's fine because I don't need to hear my shots to play the game. The next update fixed
 the graphics issues and all of my games worked perfectly fine. For a while. Fast forward to two days ago when I load up StarCraft 2 again because I still have yet to beat the campaigns, so I wanted to do so. Yesterday I got pretty far in, but was constantly
 bothered by the warning that I needed to update Windows. I thought, no! I don't want to! As soon as I get to a good stopping point I'm going to find out what driver I need to delete [or whatever system 32 tweakage you needed to do to make these infernal updates
 leave you alone, as I know there's a trick to it that you can't ask about on microsoft dot com] to make this stop happening. Alas my stopping point was becoming so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open. Today when I woke up, I opened the computer and got to working
 on a personal project. Eventually my sister came to my house to visit, so like a complete idiot I left the computer on for a little bit because I trusted that it wouldn't do something like FORCE RESTART WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT OR SOMETHING, HAHA HAHA!
<span>So it did that. </span>And it deleted all of my open tabs and progress. I thought, oh well, whatever, no big deal, it was only a couple of hours of work, what's the worst that could happen? Once I was finished fixing it, I played a little bit of Cry Of
<span>So it did that. </span>And it deleted all of my open tabs and progress. I thought, oh well, whatever, no big deal, it was only a couple of hours of work, what's the worst that could happen? Once I was finished fixing it, I played a little bit of Cry Of
 Fear again (to see that it was still working; I was going to check on all of them), and then I open StarCraft because I want to get back into the thick of it after a long and exhausting day. Only to see that the expletive-ing graphics bug was back and in full
 force. It was like my screen was a protoss-powered strobe light. Black stripes, game menu, black stripes, game menu, black stripes, game menu, switching back and forth at probably 10-15 frames per second. So I immediately Google how to get rid of recently
 installed updates. I do so and uninstall 3 of the 4, because the fourth one simply was not able to be right clicked on, and upon selecting it, the option to uninstall it via left clicking on the bar in the control panel itself didn't show up. I thought, okay
 so WITH MY LUCK it's THIS SPECIFIC UPDATE that messed it up. So I restart my computer to put the changes into effect, and to be safe, I find out how to go into safe mode anyway. Turns out that's another dumb thing Windows 10 does, where you have to hold in
 shift and/or f8 and hope and pray. Anyways, it didn't work, it didn't open in safe mode, StarCraft STILL had the problem, I still can't delete update KB4078408, I'm tired and cranky, AND I JUST WANT TO PLAY MY GAME WITHOUT HAVING A SEIZURE. So will somebody
 pretty please tell me how to go into the C drive itself and manually get rid of&nbsp;<span>KB4078408 without completely destroying Windows, or at least how to reinstall the drivers for my video card, or whatever black magic voodoo trickery I need to bippity-boppity-boo
 into my computer for it to actually work properly the way it did literally 8 hours ago as of writing this? Or at least tell me that I'm an idiot who messed with the Windows updates too much and permanently wrecked it and I have to do a full factory reset.
 I can do that since all of my personal files are all backed up onto three separate external hard drives and/or the cloud. I just want to sit back and relax and kill some zerglings in peace without having to ever worry about this crap happening ever again,
 because no way in Hades am I switching to Apple.</span></p>

<p>Hi thardy95,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you are experiencing might be due to an outdated/incompatible device driver.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we suggest that you run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>, and then select
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also troubleshoot screen flickering in Windows 10 by checking if Task Manager flickers. To do this, open
<strong>Task Manager</strong> by pressing the <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> keys on the keyboard at the same time. If that doesn't work, right-click the Start button in the lower-left corner of your screen and then select Task Manager. If Task Manager
 doesn't flicker, an app is probably causing the problem. If Task Manager does flicker, a display driver is probably causing the problem.<br />
<br />
For more troubleshooting steps, refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12374/windows-10-troubleshoot-screen-flickering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />

                    <p>Was having trouble syncing settings between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.&nbsp; I removed my Microsoft account from my Windows 10 profile, and now am unable to re-add it.&nbsp; I also unlinked the onedrive app in Windows 10, but this also did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first screenshot below,&nbsp;the input box appears to be a password box, as the characters are replaced with dots, entering my password does nothing.&nbsp; Clicking next just takes me back to my account properties page, and shows no Microsoft accounts added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the second screenshot, you will see the screen it takes me back to whether I enter a password or not into the box in the first screenshot.</p>

            I was able to solve this problem. * If you are comfortable working with the Windows Registry *,&nbsp;search for the following: HKEY_USERS - .DEFAULT - Software - Microsoft - IdentityCLR - StoredIdentities . Under this folder, you will see another one named
 after your Microsoft Account. Remove it, and then you can add your Microsoft account again to the domain one. I hope this helps.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
With the drive plugged in and working : (do on both Vista machines)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Disk Drives - double click on the drive - Policies tab -<br />
<br />
Optimize for Quick Removal - OK&nbsp;&nbsp; (if set that way change and OK the setting and then change it back and OK)<br />
<br />
Also if you have any applications open that are monitor folders and files on that drive there can be issues<br />
such as Music folders and WMP as one example.<br />
<br />
Some antivirus/antispyware/security products also have settings that can affect the ability to remove a<br />
removable drive.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

    <title>UEFI booted Windows 10 installation stuck at blue Windows Logo screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nfsking  say:</h3>
<h2>            UEFI booted Windows 10 installation stuck at blue Windows Logo screen</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a set of Intel X79 platform (ASRock X79 Extreme 3)&nbsp; from my friend, and decided to perform a clean install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a USB stick which contained Windows 10 x64 installer, made by official Windows 10 Media Creation Tool 1803, and it worked well on any other of my PCs with UEFI mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I set the bootup device to this USB drive in UEFI mode, it only showed a blue Windows logo, and just stuck there. The indicator LED of USB drive blinked a few seconds and went off, then nothing was going on as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if I change the bootup settings to CSM mode (or so called Legacy mode on some of the MB), then everything works fine, Windows can be installed correctly. But I just want to install and boot Windows in UEFI mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone know what makes installation stuck at the Logo screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi there nsfsking! Are yu sure your BIOS supports UEFI booting? As far as I know your motherboard has to specifically be able to support UEFI.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>You see, if a BIOS offers a CSM enable or disable and secure boot option, then there is no doubt that this motherboard support UEFI bootup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I could find the boot device listed as "UEFI: Sandisk Extreme USB Stick" in boot device popup menu, so yes, I'm pretty sure what I was doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But hey, thanks for helping.</p>

<p>Hi slance310, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could confirm that Windows Setup was booting into UEFI mode, this was not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that in UEFI mode, the setup process would hang up at blue Windows Logo with the dot circle spinning about a second and then everything was dead, all I could do is hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CSM or Legacy Mode works without any problem.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that the motherboard is not detecting your Flash Drive as a UEFI Type properly for some reason...
</p>
<p>It should be "Initialized" as a "GPT (GUID)" type drive, and formatted "FAT32" for best UEFI Results..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create one this way from a ISO using a free tool called RUFUS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also may be that the HDD you are installing Windows to is not Initialized properly... It also needs to be a "GPT (GUID)" type drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not switch your Bios from UEFI to Legacy, and vice\versa, without changing the type of drive... GPT for UEFI and MBR for Legacy..</p>

                    <p>I have been unable to download any updates including security ones since the beginning of July. &nbsp;I am using Windows 7 Home Premium and have been trying to solve this problem for three days now - I just can't get past the virtual assistant. &nbsp;It has always
 been the case with security that Microsoft will help free of charge - what has gone wrong - all I keep getting is error messages and going round and round in circles. &nbsp;The error codes (some of them) 80080008 &nbsp;80073712 &nbsp;KB3161102 &nbsp;KB4022168 &nbsp;KB4025341 and the
 list goes on. &nbsp;Always the &nbsp;system crashes &nbsp;mostly with scripted diagnostics native host has stopped working and Windows will close the programe and let you &nbsp;know how to fix (or words to that effect). &nbsp;Today I upgraded to Office 365 Pro Plus x 64 bit hoping
 it would solve the problestem but I am no further forward than I was with my old system - still the same problems. &nbsp; It always seems that the updates are a problem - mine are set to automatic update.</p>

<p>thank you so much for replying. &nbsp;I am going mad here. &nbsp;No I don't think it is the same problem as updates have been installed with no problems since. &nbsp;Stopped working at the start of July. &nbsp;I have done so many things Microsoft say to do and have run diagcab
 also sfc/scannow but don't understand the jargon. &nbsp;I have lost count of the things Microsoft told me to do - so sorry. &nbsp; Oh I have also stopped and started services to no avail. &nbsp;Since yesterday upgraded to Office 365 but no improvement and I can't get in
 touch with aelpny technician to help me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be so grateful for any help but I am not an expert. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Yes it is the same pc - it is a Toshiba laptop and using windows 7 home premium and also Office 365 - installed yesterday as I said</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just looked at my previous problems and want to clarify things -</p>
<p>Most of the previous items relate to my pc at home - however, I did have a problem with the laptop which related to Windows trying to install Windows 10 - it played havoc and I then had to get Microsoft to sort it out - they downloaded a load of stuff and
 it appeared to sort it out. &nbsp;I had quite forgotten about the problems I had had with the pc but since then it has worked fine (just hope I am not tempting fate!) &nbsp; Hope this clarifies things a bit &nbsp;This laptop has never had Vista - it was preinstalled when
 we bought it with Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>Thanks - really looking forward to hearing from you</p>

<p>Hi PA Bear/Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. &nbsp;Since I last wrote to you I have run the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network diagnostics</p>
<p>System Update Readiness - message said not for this pc when tried to dowload</p>
<p>Ran clean boot (sfc./scannow) several times - couldn't see anything</p>
<p>Kept digging and then ran CMD as admin - Chkdsk/r/f - originally said can't run because the volume is in use by another processor - rebooted and now it is running, albeit it slow - it is at stage 4 pf 5 and so far (all afternoon) &nbsp;121180 of 288496 - goodness
 only knows how long or if it will do any good. &nbsp;Should I let it continue or stop it. &nbsp;It is running and I am typing to you on the home pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can answer some of the questions -</p>
<p>1a &nbsp;About 8 years ago</p>
<p>1b &amp; 1c &nbsp;No Windows 10 is not installed - I had awful problems when it kept trying and after a lot of time Microsoft technician repaired it - probably did a clean install - I just don't know - he took possession of machine and did the alterations and it
 has been fine up until now.</p>
<p>1d &nbsp;Haven't done anything on Office 365 so far except for opening and checking that they all work - been too busy with laptop.</p>
<p>1e &nbsp;Office 2013 pro plus was installed by me two days ago but it was a 32 bit one and this laptop is 64 bit (although I checked it should be ok) - didn't make any difference to the problem so I deleted it. &nbsp;Before that it was only Windows 7.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp; Since I had the problem last time I have only used Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>3 &nbsp; McAfee was installed on this machine as a trial for a year when I bought the laptop- I deleted it when it ended</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;I never ran either of these</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;All the KB's I mentioned I accessed from update history and they consistently tried to install and consistently failed &nbsp;- there are loads of failures. &nbsp;Thanks for the tip I will check</p>
<p>Sorry, can't do 6 or 7 - laptop still running</p>
<p>8 - oops - would you believe I can't remember which IE I am running and again can't check</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I have maybe unravelled a bit of the problem and not caused you more. &nbsp;I bought from Currys a proper Windows 7 Home Premium disc as this was pre-installed - never had cause to use it and although I have searched over the years I cannot find it. &nbsp;However
 Microsoft have checked and my Windows 7 is a genuine one (thank goodness) - thing is if I had the disc I could ask it to repair itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to hearing from you as to which way I should go now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again - I do appreciate it - I can't begin to say how much it means to have someone trying to help. &nbsp;I can't book a call to support/can't arrange a call/can't have a chat - all is says is oops something has gone wrong try later - been like that all
 day.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; You can tell from the threads - it was the one that I said that I couldn't stop Windows 10 from downloading - in fact both my home computer and my laptop ended up with the same problem within about 6 months of each other about 2 years ago give or take.
 &nbsp;Sorry can't access laptop at the moment or I would be able to tell you, but again both pc and laptop would not download security updates.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;That is a touchy subject - I spoke to about 5-6 technicians over a period of a week - downloaded so many things that I went over my broadband allowance and it was quite a lot of money I had to pay. &nbsp; To get to the nitty gritty - all of them (mostly from
 the phillipines) were lovely but could not help and said I had to get transferred to a more senior technician to solve the problem. &nbsp;One of those was not very nice - he sounded Canadian - said he would not help me unless I paid him around £150 (not sure if
 exact figure) so we had words and he was horrible. &nbsp;All the rest of the people did what they had to do on the pc/laptop and called me back - he kept me hanging on the phone for hours and only spoke to me a couple of times to say are you still there, don't
 hang up.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I contacted the technician through contact us - it was much easier then than it is now. &nbsp;Sorry but your virtual assistant is not the person to talk to when you have a real problem - we kept going round in circles.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Sorry I don't know about that - in fact after 4 hours watching one of them - by this time is was 1.00am in the morning he told me to go to bed and the pc would switch off and not to worry - of course it did not and it had been running all night as well
 as me on it all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get to your No. 6 &nbsp;- I typed in the http No. 2 on internet explorer which I have just updated to IE11 (hoping that might fix it) down on left hand side there is an error message but again it seems to have stuck- Java did not recognise that but did come
 up with update with new files so I agreed. &nbsp; The laptop seems to be stuck on deleting Java with the little circle going round and round. &nbsp; I seem to have two stuck - I will give it another 15 minutes then pull the plug - has this helped or hindered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest regards and I am sorry to be a big problem and just to make matters worse I am so tired that I am going to sit down and unwind or I will be up all night fretting. &nbsp;Talk to you tomorrow maybe if I haven't driven you crazy</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>Well here I am back at the problem again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that there was a sign on IE 8 that said done but error on page - &nbsp;it was then that I decided to upgrade to IE11 hoping it would solve the problem -it didn't - I upgraded Thursday evening 27th July. &nbsp; Last night I tried to diagnose the problem using
 F12 developer tools in IE11 &nbsp;to try and solve the problem - it didn't &nbsp;still have the same problem). came up with</p>
<p>'mediaWiki'is undefined and then in the console section it says IEFixes.jsline 6 character 1</p>
<p>Wikibits.js line 4. &nbsp;I pressed debugging but straight away it stuck. &nbsp;I cannot use IE unless I tick script debugging if this is unticked I get another js string of error messages in a box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step I took was to try to turn windows features off to hide/disable IE but that doesn't work either. &nbsp;It just seems one problem after another, but I reasoned if IE was turned off it might stop the script bugging interfering and stopping any updates
 - or is this another problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers to previous questions</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;All the KB downloads have not been downloaded and I checked as you asked.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;I can find no trace of Java in any of the programmes and even when I did a search for Java it came up with nothing.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Adobe Flash Player is installed but not the one you list - this one is Adobe Flash Player 26.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Cannot find IE11 under installed updates - it is in a file on C: &nbsp;Programme Files iexplore</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry it has taken so long but half way through an elderly neighbours wife called to say her husband had fallen - so my husband and I have been rather tied up - nice to say he is just a little shook up and no lasting damage apart from scrapes which are now
 covered with a "plaster" but he is 94. &nbsp;Lovely gentleman!</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Christine</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>Answers to your questions</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;I was running IE8 on my laptop</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;No I was not offered IE11 - I went onto Microsoft.com and asked for upgrade from IE8 to IE11 thinking this would rectify the error</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;Microsoft Security Client is dated 08/10/2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I was in C; prog files I right clicked IE and it says created 14/07/2009 - is this correct or should it not be 27/07/2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noted that I now have &nbsp;programme files dated 29/07/17 and programme files (x86) dated 28/07/17 - can't explain how I got those - I am sure I only had 1 c:programme file - should I worry?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, quite agree it being messy, but I had the same problem with the pc and the laptop as had many other people when Microsoft started downloading Windows 10. &nbsp; I think it was 2013 that the problems with the laptop took place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way my laptop is a Toshiba &nbsp;4.00GB and still has 3.75GB usable so it is not really overworked.</p>
<p>Hope all this info helps. &nbsp;Kindest Regards, Christine</p>
<p><br />

<p>Did the Microsoft/Answer Desk technicians "take possession" of you computer to "repair" it&nbsp;on or before 08 October 2016 (i.e., roughly 10 months ago)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISCUSSION: Support (and updates) for IE8 (as well as IE9 &amp; IE10) ended on 12 January 2016. The fact that you were running IE8 until just recently and the fact that MSE's&nbsp;program folder has a Created date of 08 October 2016&nbsp;very much suggests that the "Microsoft
 technian(s)" either did a Repair Install or possibly a clean install of Windows&nbsp;in early October 2016 or earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since IE11 was never offered via Windows Update, one assumes NO updates have been installed in the past year (or more).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not bode well, my friend.</p>

No, it's not that, I also have this problem and looking on the internet, so do a lot of other people. &nbsp;The minute Windows 8 encounters any kind of software problem or virus, it locks the hard disk drive down completely so that you can't auto repair, reset,
 refresh or reinstall because the system thinks it hasn't got a hard disk drive (because it has locked it down).
<div><br />
<div>I phoned Microsoft about this and they wanted £109 to try to fix the problem, a bit rich of them when you consider it's a fault in their own design and loads of people are encountering this problem of a locked hard drive. &nbsp;To make it even more insulting,
 nowhere on their site does Microsoft tell you how to unlock the drive and the posts and forums which say stupid things like type in UNLOCK C: at a command prompt don't work, because the machine doesn't recognise that command at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm having to send mine back under warranty to fix this problem because the machine is completely unusable without a hard disk drive, and I'm now getting errors that say the hard disk is about to fail (the machine is 4 months old, for goodness sake).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft aren't helping with this at all, and the best thing to do once your machine is eventually fixed is TAKE WINDOWS 8 OFF IT and AVOID THIS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM AT ALL COSTS until Microsoft have had a couple of years to add updates and make this
 horrific new software actually work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To manufacture an Operating System that robs you of your Hard Drive and then try to charge you £109 to try to fix a fault that is inherent in the OS that they made and which will occur repeatedly as long as Windows 8 is on your machine is scandalous of
 them.</div>

            <p>
</p><p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span>

            Hi JMCVE
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it isn't possible to transfer account balances to other accounts. If the gift card was for your children, then you wanted to redeem the code to their account. Make sure to sign in with their account, and then redeem the code. That would then add the funds to their account....Since you have redeemed the code already what I would advise on doing is purchasing a game with has a gift from your account

<h2>            Controlling &#47; Limiting CPU Usage</h2>
                    <p>Operating system is Windows XP PRO w/ SP3 installed; specific computer is HP 8100 Elite w/ Intel I5 VPRO processor; 4 GB RAM.</p>
<p>Are there options within Windows XP PRO where the user can specify 'how much' CPU usage is allowed, either by individual program or total usage??</p>
<p>If so, where are they set??</p>
<p>I've looked in various logical places; and can&nbsp;not find any way to do this.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for suggestions/comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This computer's CPU usage never seems to be 'maximized' (rarely exceeds 30-50%) and I'm wondering if some setting somewhere is preventing this usage.</p>
<p>I've run MalwareBytes, SuperAntiSpyware, and ESET; and no malicious software is present.</p>

            <p>Another thing to consider is that if you have a quad or dual-core CPU, a single task tends to run on a single core only.&nbsp; Therefore, if it takes 100% of the CPU on one of four cores, the CPU meter will result with a reading of 25% assuming the other cores

Instead of Windows Task Manager, you might want to try [freeware]&nbsp;Process Explorer.&nbsp; It gives you a lot more information about what is going on in your computer.&nbsp; Once you use it, you'll never go back to Task Manager.<br />
