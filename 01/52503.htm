    <title>Windows Explorer crashes when I try to open screen resolution - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes when I try to open screen resolution</h2>
                    I was playing a game, when I closed it, my screen resolution had been made smaller. Now, when I try to open screen resolution to change it, Windows Explorer crashes and restarts. I can't open screen resolution from right clicking or from clicking into
 it from Display in the control panel. I have reset the computer, I ran a sfc that did not find any integrity violations, and ran a virus scan that found no problems, so I'm not sure what to do anymore. I didn't receive a Windows disk from my school when I
 bought my computer, so I have been unable to try a system restore, and I am outside of my school's 2-year warranty so they won't help me. I don't know what to try next, but the resolution is really bugging me, and is preventing me from playing other games,
 so I'd really like to find some fix. Any help is really appreciated.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Nayela,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue usually occurs when you perform some operations that are related to the taskbar or to the Address bar such as pinning or unpinning icons or dragging links to the taskbar.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Follow the suggestion provided from this article and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Explorer may crash in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2515325?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2515325?wa=wsignin1.0</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot."
 A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section<strong> “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong>
 to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer to the following thread which talks about the similar issue:</span></p>

            <div>Is this a pop3 account? Create a new Outbox, and Sent Items folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do the following for the Outbox, and Sent Items after you move any messages 
you wish to save to a local folder you create.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of 
your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in 
Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In WinXP, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. 
To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and 
Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows 
Explorer | Tools | Folder Options | View.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With OE closed, find the Outbox.dbx and Sent Items.dbx file and delete 
them. New files will be created automatically when you open OE.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To help prevent this in the future:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user 
defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted 
Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I 
recommend about a 300MB max for less chance of corruption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by 
Outlook Express:<br /><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while 
working *offline* and do it often.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are 
open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status 
Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the 
compacting is completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant 
layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as 
time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue 
to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br /><a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Download and install IObit's Game Booster from http://www.iobit.com/gamebooster.html<br />
<br />
After installing, run the program, switch to gaming mode, check the programs you want to close temporarily to save more CPU and RAM and it will do the rest(temporarily closing all unnecessary processes). After playing, just switch back to normal mode. That's
 it.<br />

<p>There was an interrupt in the internet connection while the download was 84% complete. After the internet connection resumed, the media creation tool is running, but it stopped downloading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to resume the download without losing the progress??&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I miss a free weekend? Or can Silver accounts play Live now? Also you shouldn't complain so much. If they were using a FAMAS instead of a Galil w/ Supressor they would have gone 30-0. At least you killed him once. Be thankful for that.

<h2>            Skype 8 was forced on me&#59; any way to make it work right&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I was using Skype 7 on my system for a long time, worked excellently.&nbsp; I had to format and rebuild my PC recently.&nbsp; When it came to Skype, I installed 7 and when I logged in it kicked me off saying I cannot log in with an outdated client.&nbsp; So I installed
 the latest Skype.&nbsp; My GOD what was Microsoft thinking??!?&nbsp; They neutered Skype.&nbsp; It no longer ties into Outlook to show me my Outlook contacts (where I keep all my contacts unfortunately), I can no longer hit numbers using the numeric pad when on a call, the
 user interface is huge and I can't make it smaller, I don't even see online/offline status of Skype contacts, it's an all around horrorshow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did they gut it like this?&nbsp; Anyway, what I want most of all is for it to see my Outlook contacts and let me search / call them easily.&nbsp; Is there a way to make that work, or is Outlook contact functionality totally removed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even better, is there any way to "hack" my system to allow Skype 7 to work?</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no option to view your outlook contacts on the new version of Skype app as this feature has not yet been migrated from 7. If you have used Skype 7 before, outlook contacts will only appear in Skype on the computer where your Outlook address book
 is stored. So if you sign in to Skype on another computer or reformat the device,&nbsp;you won’t see your Outlook contacts in Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would be taking this as your feedback to our developers for them to add this feature in the next update. Rest assured that adding&nbsp;your contacts on the new&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;should sync up with our servers to prevent any data loss on your future updates.
<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern with needing to use the dial pad when in a call, you just need to click on the plus icon while on a call and choose on Add People. From the pop-up, click the dial pad to dial new numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to reduce the font size on your Skype app, you can follow the steps on this FAQ: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34825/accessibility-features-in-skype-for-windows-mac-and-linux?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Accessibility features

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; They should really hurry up with the Outlook functionality, that's such a vital thing I'm surprised they didn't port it from the get go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also thanks for the dial pad suggestion, but my problem isn't that I cannot dial numbers.&nbsp; I'm aware of how to bring it up.&nbsp; My gripe is that I can no longer use the numeric keypad to dial.&nbsp; I have to use the top row keys or click the numbers.&nbsp; Annoying,
 why would they change that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also annoying is that one can no longer right click a contact in the main Skype view and choose call.&nbsp; I have to view profile, then hit start call.&nbsp; I really wish they wouldn't create extra steps for us.&nbsp; Also in the old Skype 7 when a call was placed, I
 got a large window with call status and the smaller "thumbnail" window.&nbsp; In Skype 7, I could X that large window and just leave the little one to control the call.&nbsp; Now if I X the large one, it wants to end the call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the font size, I clicked the link and in the section for adjusting font size it says:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>Ctrl&nbsp;</span>+&nbsp;<span>Shift&nbsp;</span>+&nbsp;<span>=&nbsp;</span>for
 zoom in</li><li>
<span>Ctrl&nbsp;</span>+&nbsp;<span>-&nbsp;</span>for
 zoom out</li><li>
<span>Ctrl&nbsp;</span>+<span>&nbsp;0</span>&nbsp;for
 actual size</li></ul>
<p>However, hitting Alt-V does nothing.&nbsp; I tried in the main Skype window and I tried on the active call screen, and in both places neither alt-v nor the control options work.&nbsp; What screen is that meant to be used on?<br />

<h3> tresaedmunds  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update, my laptop won&#39;t recognize any peripherals</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed the latest Windows 10 update. Since then, my Lenovo Yoga 3 laptop will not recognize ANY external peripherals. It won't connect to a printer (it says the printer is turned off when it's not). It won't let me install any new peripherals
 via USB or Bluetooth. It won't even recognize anything or allow me to reinstall drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this issue, it was already running Windows 10. After trying everything I could think of, the only "fix" I've found is to reset the entire machine to factory settings (which took the better part of a day) and avoid installing the OS updates. . .
 &nbsp;Which seems like a really bad long term solution. Unfortunately, it automatically ran the update the last time I restarted the machine and I'm back to square one.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Tresa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the info, I suggest that you visit the computer's manufacturer website, uninstall and re-install the latest chipset drivers available for your PC and check if the issue replicates.</p>

<p>Been having the problem of blank posts, maybe it's IE9...this is probably a silly question, but can't find a way to save the game. &nbsp;The START BUTTON-&gt;GAME menu has items for loading/deleting games and creating a new game, but nothing about saving. &nbsp;Looked
 through the controller map and didn't see any other relevant buttons.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Piece of cake this one. There's save points dotted around the map (can't remember the icon but it should be in the map legend). Some of these save points are unlocked by default (CJ's house for example) while others you unlock by purchasing houses in each
 city. All you need to do is go to the save point on the map and walk into the circle of light you should see.</p>

<h2>            Stop Program from Auto-Installing</h2>
                    <p>How can I stop a program from auto-installing? I am specifically referring to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.&nbsp; I have two computers, one at home and one at the office.&nbsp; I have Acrobat X installed on one, and Acrobat XI installed on the other.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am perfectly fine
 with those versions.&nbsp; What happens is that Reader DC auto-installs itself periodically.&nbsp; The problem is that if I try and save a file with X or XI, Reader DC takes over and prompts me to subscribe for $X per month to be able to continue.&nbsp; ****?&nbsp; I paid for
 X and XI and don't have a problem using these old programs to write Acrobat files.&nbsp; This is a continuing battle, and I have to uninstall Reader DC once a week or so on both machines. How do I disable Reader DC from automatically installing on my computers?</p>

<p>Hello, Killer BIGxyz</p>
<p>I Would Very Much Like To Help You Out Dear Chap!.</p>
<p>I Would Like To Suggest The Following Steps To You, (Step One) Remove All "USB Flash Drives" &amp; "Memory Sticks" From Your Console (Step 2) &nbsp;Head To Your Xbox 360 Hard Drive And Delete The Downloadable Content From Your Hard Drive And Then "Clear Your System
 Cache!". (Step 3) Reinstall The Downloadable Content To Your Hard Drive And When The Downloadable Content Is Completed Attempt To "Clear Your System Cache!" And Start Up The Game. This Should Fix The Current Issue. Please Tell Me If This Worked My Dear Chap!</p>

<p>I suggest just copy your save onto another save slot and just play through it by pushing yes at the start. Eventually they will fix it and you can go back to your normal save and play it on there so that it all links up to season 2 when it comes out.</p>
<p>At least you can get your moneys worth</p>

<p>I chose New Game and had the same problem. I tried deleting a bunch of stuff and reinstalling and it didn't work. &nbsp;I then thought maybe if I continue my last save game it will "update" the file somehow and 400 Days would recognize it. &nbsp;That wasn't the problem,
 but it did lead to the solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You actually want to continue the game save that has your story decisions in it. &nbsp;If you completed the first five episodes, one of your prompts when you select your old save is to continue. Choose that and it will bring up 400 Days.</p>
<p>The trick is that you are actually continuing your last game save, it would be like selecting New Game and then choosing Episode Three. &nbsp;The game would naturally ask if you want it to generate story decisions for you. &nbsp;They should have had a prompt asking
 you, or directing you, with instructions if you wanted to do a new game from a different save slot for 400 Days, but I guess they never thought of it.</p>

<p>No, sorry, I misread your original post. I thought you were having this problem when choosing a New Game and then selecting 400 Days.</p>
<p>In my experimenting with deleting &amp; restoring files, I know the game will create a new 11MB saved game file just by launching the game if there is no saved game present. You don't actually have to start a new game and play it. This game save will not even
 list in the game slots within the game, they'll all show New Game. I would check your System Storage and see what the creation date of the save game is. If it was created in the last few days, then you probably have the "empty" save game file there.</p>

<p>I have a slightly different issue and haven;t been able to find help anywhere online. I've installed the 400 Days add on, its registered in my harddrive, my acheivements list is updated but I actually can't access the content anywhere. It doesn''t seem to
 be in the Walking Dead game at all, but to be honest I've heard of so many problems I'm actually hesitant to play it.......</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to update to the latest version of Skype or use the pre-installed Skype on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason for this issue was your contacts are using the updated Skype version on their end.</p>

    <title>NEW ASUS e406MA notebook - flashing black screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            NEW ASUS e406MA notebook - flashing black screen</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community!<br />
<br />
I just bought a new ASUS e406MA laptop with a pre-installed Windows 10 Home OS and I had serious issues with the display. The notebook is flashing randomly time-to-time with a black screen. Sometimes this error turns to a blue death. I tried everything what
 I found about the problem in the web including the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run all pending windows updates,</li><li>Delete and refresh the graphics driver (Intel UHD Graphics 605),</li><li>Disable 'Windows Error Reporting Service' and 'Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel'</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Norton AV, IDT or iCloud. Do you guys have any further idea how to resolve the problem? I am quite sure that is not a hardware based issue because I took back the notebook to the retail store first and they replaced it with a new one, but I
 still experience the problem.<br />
<br />
Your efforts are much appreciated in adance!<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Csaba</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult it is, when the device won't work in the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be due to the connection problem with your display, display adapter driver update, or issues with recent updates or installation. For us to isolate the issue, we'd like to know more information on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which build version of Windows 10 are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can try the below steps and check if we can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Update the VGA driver from ASUS website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to download and install the <a href="https://www.asus.com/sg/Laptops/ASUS-Laptop-E406MA/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VGA driver from the system manufacturer site</a>, and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Troubleshoot black screen errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to refer this article on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-or-blank-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot black screen or blank screen errors</a>, and try all the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>Music Player library loading unwanted sound files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> contex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music Player library loading unwanted sound files</h2>
                    On Windows 7 64 the media player is being loaded with sound files&nbsp;(without my permission or request)&nbsp;&nbsp;that are protected by trustedinstaller. I don't want them there. How do I delete them from the Music Player library? I've tried changing permissions but
 that seems to be about deleting the files - an operation which is disallowed anyway. I don't wish to delete, simply to move them from the music player library.
<div>File location: Windows/Media/winsxs</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The files in the library are:ir_begin, ir_end, ir_inter</div>
<div>And: winsxs/amd64_microsoft-windows-musicsamples_lots of numbers</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            Thanks for the suggestion but you didn't read (or understand) my question. I have not played these files. They come from the Windows/Media/ winsxs directory and are music samples and windows shell sounds. They do not belong in the media player library.
 Because they're protected by trustedinstaller I can't delete them from the library.
<div><br />
<div>Please do better.</div>

<h2>            C Drive keeps filling up.</h2>
                    My C Drive has 29 GB of space. However, it has been filled near to the brin and now I have less than 2 GB of space. I have run multiple virus scans, disk cleaners, removed system restore points, deleted browsing history, ect. but it just keeps filling
 back up and I don't know why.

            Your computer is just to connect to the Internet and use a browser to access video,tv, email. The tiny hard drive is not big enough to download anything or install programs. Use a regular laptop or desktop for installing anything.&nbsp;

<p>There are various things you can do to save some space (for example, see seahawks65's reply), but they are all temporary. 29GB is a *tiny* amount of space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that 28GB C: drive a physical drive or a partition on your only hard drive?&nbsp; If it's just a partition, how big is the whole drive and how much space is free on the other partitions(s)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have substantial free space on other partitions, you should probably make the C: drive bigger (I recommend at least 200GB). If you don't, you should&nbsp; buy and install another larger drive.</p>

<p>well 30GB SSD is absurd and ridiculous&nbsp;to begin with from&nbsp;these OEMs. It is full. You have to buy a drive, and I would get at least a 250-500GB drive. Maybe you can move your personal files to external drive like docs, pics, vids, and music. But that is
 barely enough to install windows on. And then for updates, upgrades or creators packs, there is not enough room to back up all your files and install a second OS, which is what is happening on CP and UG. It makes no sense to me.

<h2>            technical issue.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I cannot connect my Microsoft email account with my Skype. I keep pushing where you click on add your Microsoft account but it does nothing. &nbsp;I want to hook up a VPN so that I can use Skype? I've had Skype for three years and have not used it. It has been
 a useless &nbsp;media app for me. &nbsp;I'm not very tech no literate. Is it me or this continual loop to come back to the community so that customer service doesn't have to be bothered with us. Stink! &nbsp;While writing this I realize why I have not even tried to use my
 Skype for this long. Does anybody have an answer?</p>
<p>of course not it's a technical issue! That only customer service can solve for me!</p>

<p>&nbsp; I don't know how good the mobile app is? &nbsp;I've been trying to get Skype to work for me for two years? I have no faith in Skype as a social media platform. I don't have a PC. And when I did have a PC I couldn't get Skype to work on that either?</p>

            MS catalog is for newer system. Most XP stuff has been deprecated or never transfered to the catalog. Only way to get it is to have XP support from MS. This is an option for big businesses only that have big pockets to pay for this support. Many businesses
 are paying this since many programs do not work with newer Windows systems. This is how they keep getting support from MS well everyone does not.<br />

<p>Explanation for this is simple enough (&amp; unless you can prove otherwise) - Microsoft didn't issue any updates for WinXP 64-bit in 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They issued one in 2016 (KB890830), which is what the original query is for (hence not mentioned yet again in the list).</p>

<p>No, Microsoft didn't release any Consumer updates for WinXP SP3 after 08 April 2014. That being said...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the prevalence&nbsp;of WannaCrypt/WannaCry "infections," Microsoft <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
did</span> release suitable "patches" for WinXP SP3 (32-bit), WinXP 64-bit and various flavors of WinXP Embedded in Mar-17 and May-17.</p>

<p>No, not me.Government and business are paying for it since their programs do not work with newer systems. Let see some try to hack into a computer running COBOL. Many are still running and only a few old timers know them. Navy was suppose get our of Xp in
 2016 but still use it since can not find system that will running many of their programs.<br />

<h2>            display adapter .</h2>
                    <p>I need help directing a display adapter to my laptop monitor directly</p>
<p>i mean like the input to the monitor directly</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i cant get input then is there any software that can enable video input??</p>
<p>
</p><p>i also have another thing to say:</p>
<p>i have come to understand from a couple of my other threads that almost no laptops have video input capability</p>
<p>that is why i am asking this question</p>
<p>does anyone know any software that can allow video input?</p>
<p>i know what your thinking..."oh he's an idiot he thinks that software is hardware"</p>
<p>no i don't</p>
<p>the software that i'm looking for is software that can go in manually and give the computer video input capabilities (e.g. kind of like what windows updates do)</p>
<p>i would really appreciate if somebody could give a link or something to software that can do this\</p>
<p>thanks</p>
