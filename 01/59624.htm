    <title>The Security Service automatically disables itself - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The Security Service automatically disables itself</h2>
                    Recently&nbsp;I saw that my security service is disabled. So&nbsp;i went to services.msc and found also, that the following services are disabled,
<ol>
<li>Internet Connection Sharing(ICS). </li><li>Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN </li><li>Microsoft Antimalware Service </li><li>Net.Tcp Port Sharing Service </li><li>Routing and Remote Access </li><li>Security Center </li><li>Windows Defender </li><li>Windows Live Mesh remote connections service </li></ol>
<p>I tried starting the Security Service by making start type: automatic and clicked start.</p>
<p>It started and i could see the pop ups from taskbar saying start MSE, start windows defender.when i start it is again flashes for a second and gets vanished and also the security center is automatically disabled. I tried doing this many time but no use.</p>
<p>Sometimes when i try starting Security Center it displays Error Dialog with the following Message:
<br />
</p>
<hr />
<span>Windows could not start Security Center service on local computer
<span>Windows could not start Security Center service on local computer
<br />
Error 1079: The account specified for this service is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process.</span><br />
<hr />

<p>But believe me that i am not getting this message all the time. Security Center starts most of the time and automatically gets disabled within&nbsp;a minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a windows repair option in boot and disk error check but again no use.</p>
<p>I thought of a System Restore so when i clicked System Restore, i got the system restore dialog opened with the following error Message:<br />
</p>
<hr />
<span>System Protection is turned off. To turn it back on so you can use system restore, see Turn System Restore on or off.</span>
<span>System Protection is turned off. To turn it back on so you can use system restore, see Turn System Restore on or off.</span>
<hr />
<br />
Which again guides me how to start Security service,and now the problem becomes cyclic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I am not sure why this is happened to my system&nbsp;as i am not using any suspiciouis softwares. If in case my system has got some virus which made this damage,well then&nbsp;my question is why MSE didnt recognize this virus and save my system.</p>
<p>I seriously need help to have my security system back on so that i will have my MSE working back.</p>
<p><span>Note: I had my MSE updated with latest virus defenitions with out fail.</span></p>

            Hi Ritalandia,
<div><br />
<div>Some malware usually attack Security Center, System Restore and other important tools in the system.&nbsp;Without ruling out the possibility of Malware, try running an offline virus scan. You can give
<span><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Standalone System Sweeper</a> a try.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Here is a How-To with Screenshots on creating the boot media and running and offline scan.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/standalone-system-sweeper-offline-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Standalone System Sweeper Offline Virus
 Scanner</a>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is every chance that these offline scanners find something that your real-time AV doesn't, in an malware-infested system.<br />

Having the same issue after reinstalling win 8 because of the scorpion virus that I was unable to remove. Now I don't recognize SD cards from my camera. Not sure that the drivers are right for the device but I haven't figured out what they should be. Does anyone
 know where I would find the SD reader in device manager?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Diane,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for reporting this issue in Microsoft Community. Try inserting the card in a Micro SD to SD adapter and seeing if the machine will recognize it. This issue can be caused due to corrupted chipset drivers.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>-What is the make and model number of the computer?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try finding the card in Disk Management (press Windows key + R, type
<strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong>) and assigning it a letter and path. It may require being reinitialized, which will result in all data on the card being lost.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try these steps and check if that helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Run the Hardware troubleshooter.</strong></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press Windows key + C on your keyboard to show the Charms bar</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type Troubleshooting and click Troubleshooting under Settings</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now type Hardware Troubleshooter in the search option</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Hardware troubleshooter to run the troubleshooter</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Install latest drivers for the USB device</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Download the Windows 7 drivers from the Manufacturer’s website and install them in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the driver setup file and select “Properties”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select “Compatibility” Tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Make a check mark next to Run this program in “Compatibility mode” and select previous version of Windows supported by the software, from the drop down list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then click on “Apply” and “Ok” option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then install the driver.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then restart your computer and check how it works.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Install optional updates</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>At the Start screen, type Windows Update</span></li><li><span>Click or tap Settings on the right side of the screen, and then select Install optional updates from the left results</span></li><li><span>When the Windows Update control panel opens, click on “Check for Updates” on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After having tried the above method, can you confirm that your SD card is now being recognized in Windows 8 or you are still facing problems? If not, then here’s another solution that you could try if you are having problems with your SD Card
 reader:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Go to ‘Computer Management’ then ‘Disk Management’</span></span></li><li><span><span>You will find the Card Reader there.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Go to Control Panel &gt;System and Security &gt;Administrative Tools.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on “Administrative Tools”, then click on &gt;Computer Management.</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the left panel under storage click &gt;Disk Management.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Your SD card reader should show up there.</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right Click on it.</span></span><span>
</span></li><li><span><span>From the pop-up menu choose ‘Change Drive Letter and Paths…’ or ‘Add Drive Letter’.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Assign it a drive letter.</span></span><span> </span></li><li><span><span>Your SD card reader should show up when you double click the computer icon.</span></span><span>
</span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: You may lose data from the SD card.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know the status of the issue. If you need further assistance, please post back. We will be glad to help you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Does Intel GMA 900 work with Windows 7 Aero&#63;  Is there a WDDM driver for it now&#63;</h2>
                    I have seen this similar question on a previous post but the answer said wait till Windows 7 is actually released so I wanted to know if Intel GMA 900 910GL/915GL can run aero.&nbsp; It is theoretically possible because it has DirectX 9 and Pixel Shader 2.0
 support.&nbsp; Intel is just not honoring that it is compatible.&nbsp; I was wondering if a WDDM driver has come out for it now.&nbsp; Can Microsoft create a driver for GMA 900 since it is compatible yet no driver is allowing it to work.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; If anyone has tried
 GMA 900 on Windows 7, tell me if Aero works.&nbsp; If anyone has a WDDM driver for it please post a link.<br />

            The computer manufacturer is dell and the chipset that has the integrated graphics is intel.&nbsp; As I said before, Intel refuses to make a WDDM driver for GMA 900.&nbsp; When Windows Vista came out, they said they would release one "shortly" and then they decided
 to delete that post all together and decided not to make one.

    <title>Windows 10 speech recognition problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andream_aust  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 speech recognition problems</h2>
                    Firstly - I do <strong>NOT </strong>think this problem relates to Cortana because Cortana is working fine and that tells me that my system can hear my commands
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span>However, when I&nbsp;try to configure&nbsp;</span>speech recognition, I cannot because there is no sign of sound registering in the audio recordings. &nbsp;Same microphone - no sound registered ... not even a 'next' option to select
 (it is grayed out) I can only select 'cancel' out of setting up the microphone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used speech recognition before on this computer and have had several updates since ... initially, it worked without a problem and cannot for the life of me work out why suddenly it does not work. I am using Surface Pro 4 ... would love some help to
 remedy please...</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Andrea,<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can refer to the steps provided in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028149/windows-fix-the-problem-with-cortana-and-windows-speech-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to

<p>Thank you for responding :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot recall exactly when I started to have this problem with speech recognition - but it would have been some weeks ago while trying to get an assignment done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then moved to do that work on my desktop instead (also windows 10) and may have forgotten about the problem until I attempted again a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may have been over a month ago ... I know there have been updates since then ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. As for changes to the Surface pro? I don't believe so.&nbsp; I do have a regular problem here my surface pro pen stops working and the only fix I have for that is to go into devices and disable and then re-enable one of the drivers ... beyond that? I don't
 believe so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Troubleshooting so far - to enable and disable my different microphones to see if either of these are the problem.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to matter - SpR does not seem to recognise any sound - but I know the microphone works because I have tested both.&nbsp; I did
 this by right clicking my speaker icon in the taskbar and then going to 'recording devices' and then going in to check that they are working as they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had problems trying to find help with SpR that is not related to Cortana ... it seems most of the help has been relevant to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned - both Cortana and SpR worked well on the Surface a few months ago but I really don't know why that changed beyond the possibility of an update conflict or ...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards Andrea</p>

<p>This did not work.&nbsp; Windows tells me the driver was up to date and I am already using the best / most suitable driver for the device</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see any issues with the settings in Speech Recognition - it would be helpful if you could suggest what I should look for.&nbsp; I don't recall making any changes to these settings</p>

            In order for you to be able to "Share" things using apps, apps themselves need to provide that functionality. Currently, I know of no Win32 apps that support it, so you should search the Windows Store for applications that you want to "share" to.

<p>
</p><p>We also need to make sure that the file is saved in <strong>Unicode</strong> format, not the default one,
<strong>ANSI</strong>.</p>

<p>I own a new Dell XPS,i7 chip machine. While in Windows Live Mail , every day, I&nbsp;have the screen blank out and get the message "AMD driver stopped and recovered". It also is occurring with Windows Explorer. I have ready online many articles about the concern
 with the i7 chips and everyone seems to be blaming everyone else for the problem. I just would like to find a "cure" for the problem.</p>
<p>Anyone who could shed light on this...it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is that the exact error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error message may occur when the Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) feature available in Windows Vista and Windows 7 detects that the GPU is no longer responding.
 It then disables the GPU and reinitializes it with the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) without the need to reboot. For additional information, refer to<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/wddm_timeout.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft’s
 Timeout Detection and Recovery of GPUs through WDDM</span></a> page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It''s a bit odd as&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a brand-new machine with a default Windows 7 factory &nbsp;install.&nbsp; Disks mostly empty.&nbsp; A quick check in Disk Management and it's telling me there's a hidden 100 MB partition that's only got 38MB free.&nbsp; I've also used the machine
 to boot FreeBSD unix.&nbsp; Oddly&nbsp;a quick look of this volume from that perspecive tells me there's 75MB free.&nbsp; I've checked the disk and defragged and still no joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kashi.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type Services in Start search, open Services control panel.  Scroll down to Remote Access Connection Manager to Stop and then Start the service, set to Automatic.  
<br />
<br />Check also on the Dependencies tab that other services needed are started.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hey Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service is already set to automatic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked dependencies but cannot stop Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an Error: 1061.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recall getting this “stopping” issue before and the solution had something to do with dependencies - I just don’t remember whether &nbsp;I had to start or stop a service to get the remote access connection manager to get unstuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I am facing the same issue now with my Boss's computer doing the same thing. RasMan is getting hung. It just started yesterday. I am pretty sure it was an update from windows that caused the issue. Is there anyway to fix this. I am tired of getting yelled
 out. I have him restart the service but it getting hung and wont restart. Since he is remote in another state, its harder for me to fix. He wont let me have control of his PC in order to remote login and fix it. Has anyone found a solution?

If not, please let us know the model no. of the windows phone you are using, and make sure that you have not selected 5 ghz as the wireless band and are using 2.4 ghz instead as most of the windows phone doesnt uses 5 ghz band yet.

            Hi AmandaSargent 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.

            Hi Amanda
<br />
<br />Rest assured, this file is absolutely nothing to worry about, that is a log file, created by a Windows Defender Scan, the user account mentioned in that file - WDAGUtilityAccount  is a default hidden account, used by Windows Defender to perform maintenance tasks on your PC
<br />
<br />This is really all very normal and not something to be concerned about, no-one has been messing with your PC at all . . .

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<span><br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community!<br />
</span><span>From the problem description I understand that, you cannot get function discovery resource publication started.<br />
Provide the following information:<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Which anti-virus is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
<span>We will </span><span>guide you through this issue.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may <span>temporarily disable the antivirus and firewall on the computer and check.<br />
</span></span>
<div><strong><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a><span><br />
<strong><span>NOTE</span></strong>: Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.<br />
You may refer the following link to disable Antivirus software installed on your computer.</span></div>
<div><strong><span>Disable antivirus software</span></strong><b><span><br />

<strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks<br />
<br />
</span><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<span>Make sure that the following services are enabled on the computer.</span>
<div><span>a) Click start, type "services.msc" in the search and click on services. Check if these services are enabled:</span></div>
<div><span>- TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service</span></div>
<div><span>- DNS Client</span></div>
<div><span>- Function Discovery Resource Publication</span></div>
<div><span>- SSDP Discovery</span></div>
<div><span>- UPnP Device Host</span></div>
<div><span>To start the service and set it to automatic, follow these steps:</span></div>
<div><span>b) Right-click each of the services listed above and click on Properties.</span></div>
<div><span>c) Click the General tab, and then, next to Startup type, select Automatic.</span></div>
<div><span>d) Click Apply, and then click Start.<br />

    <title>Problem updating email on Xbox Live account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgt7212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem updating email on Xbox Live account</h2>
                    
<p>When my son first got an Xbox live account, he was not using email.&nbsp; I created an email account for him that was basically only ever used to log in to Xbox live.&nbsp; Now he is older and has an email account that is different from the one associated with his
 Xbox live account.&nbsp; In fact, we no longer have access to the old email account.</p>
<p>He has an Xbox 360 and I just purchased an Xbox One.&nbsp; I noticed the email was incorrect when I added his profile to my Xbox One.&nbsp; I then went into his billing info and updated the email and phone number associated with his Xbox live account.&nbsp; However, it
 still requires his old email to log in and to manage his account on a PC.&nbsp; ALL I WANT TO DO IS REMOVE THE OLD EMAIL ADDRESS FROM HIS XBOX LIVE ACCOUNT AND MAKE HIS NEW EMAIL ADDRESS HIS PRIMARY ALIAS AND THE ONLY EMAIL ASSOCIATED WITH HIS ACCOUNT. After 2
 days and several hours on chat and phone with support, nobody can seem to help me.&nbsp; This is beyond the point of ridiculousness.&nbsp; I don't have this issue with credit card and bank accounts when changing an email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To top it off, if I try to go in to his account and try to update the alias, it says that for security reasons, it needs to send a verification code.&nbsp; It then gives me 2 options in the pull down menu.&nbsp; 1) shows the old email address. Again, that won't work
 because we can't access that email anymore.&nbsp; 2) says "I don't have these accounts anymore"&nbsp; When I click option 2 it tells me it can send the verification code to another email address.&nbsp; Ok fine...&nbsp; The catch is that it has to be an email that is NOT associated
 with his account in any way.&nbsp; Maybe it's just me but that seems excessively stupid and insecure.&nbsp; Why would it require any random email address that is not already associated with the account?&nbsp; So if someone gets into my account they can send the verification
 code to their email address and then gain access to everything in my account?</p>
<p>Talking in chat and on the phone with Xbox live support gets me nowhere.&nbsp; None of them are able to manually change the email address and update the account.&nbsp; Their best answer was "We can submit the issue to the customer advocacy review team.&nbsp; That process
 takes about 2 days and they will email a verification code to the new email in my son's billing info.&nbsp; Then once verified, he needs to create a new Xbox live account so they can migrate his information from the existing account to the new one."</p>
<p>Really?!?!?!?!&nbsp; I have to go through all that to change an email address? Are you kidding me?&nbsp; If I have to do that much work, I'm seriously considering returning my Xbox One and going PS4.&nbsp; I kept apologizing to the rep on the phone support line because
 he was trying to be helpful and I told him I know it's not his fault, but I am beyond frustrated right now.&nbsp; Is it really that difficult to change an email address or can anyone help me?</p>

<p>I'm going through the same thing. been about six months of back and forth. &nbsp;One of the crazy rules is when you create a new email address, there is a 30 day waiting period before that email is "ready to be used". &nbsp;So I suggest you setup as many "temp" emails
 as you can so the clock can start ticking on those. Keep it simple, like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, etc. I created seven so if something went wrong I had others in my list to go to. &nbsp;It's crazy, I don't think the waiting period on guns
 is this long. &nbsp;Changing emails with my banks or credit card companies is easier and quick. &nbsp;I just finished another chat, and was given the same answer as you, The Advocacy Team will contact you in 2 business days. &nbsp;That's the 1st time I've ever heard on that
 team, why didn't someone else push it to them from the start. &nbsp;They have a great product, just lousy service protocols. &nbsp;I would keep your unit, don't switch quality. &nbsp;If you just got it, ask about resetting the whole unit back to factory and deleting the
 email account linked to it or creating a new Microsoft Account end in @live.com or @outlook,com. &nbsp;They are eventually going to migrate to @outlook.com so it's a good idea to secure your email with that extension anyway. &nbsp;Hang in there, I'm just as frustrated.
 &nbsp;I'm a repair tech, so it really gets under my skin. &nbsp; Mark.</p>

<p>i am going through the same fiasco as well. what constitutes "changes to the account" that resets the clock on the email? purchases for XBL? or changes in billing info? I really don't want to have to not touch my xbox for 30 days but I am seriously considering
 it after the hassle I ( and many others ) have put up with. BTW I created this account today on xbox.com thinking the "new email" had to be linking with xbox.com before the account can be switched (just trying anything and everything at this point). but alas
 it didn't work. looks like i set the clock back on myself again. lol</p>

<p>I have the same issue as well. &nbsp;I do not have access to my original email address I used when I signed up for Xbox live. &nbsp;I have gone through all the steps with Microsoft, even having my issue "escalated" which ended up being a complete waste of time as
 well. &nbsp;I don't understand why this has to be so difficult. &nbsp;I can give Microsoft my gamertag, name, credit card number, original email address and any other information attached to that gamertag, but apparently changing your e-mail address associated with
 your account will cause Microsoft's entire network to crash and bankrupt them. &nbsp;I have been very disappointed with this entire experience. &nbsp;All I have been able to do is create a new account which resets everything back to "zero" so to speak. &nbsp;I have considered
 buying an Xbox One, but I am not so sure at this point.</p>

<p>Hello, and so sorry for the inconvenience! </p>
<p>Have you tried setting up a new Microsoft Account with your son's new email and switching his gamertag to this account online? Here's a link to a guide showing how to do this step-by-step:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>WonderSquid - I have not tried that. &nbsp;I couldn't find that page in my researching and over the multiple hours in chat and on the phone with support, no one has recommended that. &nbsp;Am I correct in understanding that if I go through the process outlined in
 the link you posted, that by creating a new account, I can instantly "merge" or bring over his gamertag and Gamerscore and friends and he won't lose anything? &nbsp;If that is correct, I may eventually go that route, but I don't want to mess with it or do anything
 until I hear from this customer advocacy review team. &nbsp;I don't want to screw anything up until I know if/what actions they take. &nbsp;Still seems like a lot of excessive work to change an email address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One phone rep did recommend creating a new account, but had told me that was in conjunction with getting the customer advocacy review team involved and they would need a new account to merge my son's gamertag and other info into, after they reviewed the
 issue for a couple days. &nbsp;It was not presented as something I could do fairly easily myself. &nbsp;Have you actually done this process? &nbsp;If so, how did it work? &nbsp;I don't want the 30 day wait time thing to kick in at all because a phone rep told me that during that
 30 day wait my son would not be able to use his account on his Xbox 360 OR on my Xbox One. &nbsp;That is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I actually have done this, and I did not lose &nbsp;my gamertag, gamerscore, etc. This process should not involve you losing any info, and should be a seamless joining of a new Microsoft account and your current Xbox Live profile. Although I completely agree
 it seems like am arbitrary process, it is a relatively simple affair. So, once you hear back from this advocacy team and if they are unable to help you (which I sincerely hope is not the case, but it seems like the norm for you haha) I would advise giving
 this a try. Please let me know what happens!</p>

<p>Ok, my son finally got an email from this "customer advocacy review team" instructing us to to go verify.microsoft.com and then follow the steps from there. &nbsp;The problem is once you enter the information on the first step to verify, it gives you a code.
 &nbsp;Nowhere in the emailed instructions does it say where to enter the code AND once you get the code, NOWHERE on the page does it have anything even slightly resembling the instructions in the next step of the emailed directions. &nbsp;COMPLETE FAIL!!! AND to top
 it off, my son can't sign into live anymore on his 360. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So against my better judgement, I called back to the support line. &nbsp;The woman, who to be fair was really trying to help, said she has run into this several times and the only way she could figure to fix it was to have my son create another Microsoft account
 and then migrate the gamertag over. &nbsp;I REALLY did NOT want to do this. &nbsp;Why create yet another email address that my son will never use? &nbsp;That is how we got into this problem to begin with. &nbsp;But I did. However, that will not work either. &nbsp;The new outlook email
 address is not receiving the verification code that live supposedly emailed to it. &nbsp;It will not allow me to add his correct email as the primary alias either, even though it sends a verification code to that email. &nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS IS LITERALLY THE STUPIDEST, MOST RIDICULOUS HASSLE. &nbsp;I CAN'T EVEN CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF HOURS I HAVE WASTED TRYING TO GET THIS SEEMINGLY SIMPLE TASK RESOLVED. &nbsp;APPARENTLY, CHANGING YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS IS TANTAMOUNT TO PUTTING SOMEONE ON THE MOON.</p>
<p>NOTE TO MICROSOFT: &nbsp;THE PRIMARY ALIAS EMAIL ACCOUNT THAT IS ATTACHED TO HIS XBOX LIVE ACCOUNT IS NO LONGER HIS EMAIL. &nbsp;I DON'T WANT THAT EMAIL ATTACHED TO HIS ACCOUNT ANYMORE. &nbsp;HOW EFFING HARD CAN IT BE??????</p>
<p>Wondersquid - I'm going to try the link you sent me and see if I can get that to work. &nbsp;I should have probably tried that before calling support again. &nbsp;We'll see how that goes.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi ferrojohnson,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. By any chance is your computer is on a network of computers?<br />
2. Are you the administrator of the computer?<br />
3. Are you trying to access my pictures folder present under c:\ users?<br />
4. Are you accessing the folder under your user account itself?<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span><span>If you are having issues accessing folder under your own user account then you may take the ownership of the folder and then use the steps to grant permission to
 everyone and then check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Before taking ownership I would suggest you to create a new restore point so that the system may be reverted back in case of
 any loss of data or irregular behavior. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Follow the steps in the below link to create a restore point -</span></span></strong><span><span>
 The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the problem. To restore back you need to have a restore
 point available so I would suggest you to create a new restore point before taking ownership of the folder –<br />
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point</span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>You may take the ownership of the folder and then use the steps to grant permission to everyone
<span>–</span></span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Right click on file or folder and select
<strong>“Properties”</strong> from Context Menu</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Click on
<strong>Security tab</strong></span></span> </li><li><span><span>Click on
<strong>“Advance” </strong></span></span></li><li><span><span>Now click on
<strong>Owner tab in Advance Security Settings</strong> for User windows</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Click on
<strong>Edit Button and select user</strong> from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then, click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Now select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace owner on sub containers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected
 folder)</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Now Owner name must have changed.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Now click
<strong>Ok to exist from Properties</strong> windows</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Once you have
<strong>taken the ownership of file or folder</strong> </span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Grant Permissions to everyone-</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Go to C: and then click
<strong>right click</strong> on folder and choose <strong>properties.</strong></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Then go to
<strong>security</strong> tab and click <strong>Edit</strong> then click <strong>
Add</strong> =&gt; <strong>Advanced.</strong></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>If you click on advanced now click on
<strong>Find Now</strong> and choose <strong>everyone</strong> and click <strong>
Ok.</strong></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Then again click
<strong>Ok </strong><span>a</span>nd now click on <strong>Allow</strong> =&gt;
<strong>Full control</strong> =&gt; <strong>Ok</strong></span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>DISCLAIMER:</span></strong><span> Affecting system settings incorrectly can cause serious
 problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly or may result in loss of data. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuration of ownership settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Sleep Mode &#47; Screen Turn off Settings</h2>
                    I upgraded my Surface to Windows 10 and now my when I set my sleep mode it also changes the time &nbsp;to Turn off My Display to the same thing. &nbsp;Similarly if I change my Turn off my Display it changes my Sleep settings. &nbsp;For example if I set Sleep Mode to
 Never my Turn Off Display After becomes Never. &nbsp;If I then set my Turn off Display After to 10 minutes my Sleep Mode Changes to 10 minutes. &nbsp;Ultimately the problem Is I can't set my screen to turn off while having the computer never to to sleep. &nbsp;How can I
 fix this?

            <p>I have a Surface 2, Windows 10. &nbsp;No third party power software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running Windows 8 with the Sleep set to Never and Turn off Display set to 5 minutes. &nbsp;Everything worked as expected. &nbsp;I finally did a Windows 10 upgrade and while that happened there was a firmware update that was performed. &nbsp;Now when I set Sleep to
 never turn off display is set to Never. &nbsp;If I then set the turn off display to 5 minutes the Sleep setting changes to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the power trouble shooter and it says there are no problems.</p>

            Sorry I also forgot to mention I restored Windows to factory settings and that didn't fix the problem either. &nbsp;I did notice that when that during the restore process a number of personal settings like my desktop background did not restore to factory.
