<p>Hi Julie_S1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, but unfortunately it did not help.</p>
<p>I tried everything in the old Skype and in the new one, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>I'm using a Dell desktop window 10 and Skype 7.40.</p>
<p>Do you have a link for a 'Skype with translator' which I can download?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need Skype for conversations with my Oldies, because this is the only way they know, how to communicate with, since we're living in different countries. Also I have friends with which I communicate abroad in different languages.</p>
<p>As for me I could try to find another app with translator, but you'll have to inform all your friends which app you're going to use than or loose all friends, which will not make me happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, I need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glenn.</p>

<p>Windows 10 have a pre-installed Skype app, which is called Skype for Windows 10. Skype Translator is available in this version of Skype. If you will not see it on the pre-installed application on your computer, you may download it from the Microsoft Store.</p>

            I have exactly the same problem with the translator (I am talking to a Ukrainian lady). The new version of the translator is a typical Microsoft mess and they won't even allow you to use the previous version - obviously, because nobody would be using the&nbsp;new
 version and as you know Microsoft can do whatever they want............................

<p>Morning Julie,</p>
<p>Nope. it did not help me. I looked for the tranlstor in the new version and could not find it, so I looked in the store and did not see it and ask for it in the store, on which I received only one translator, who does not look atall like Skype and you need
 a code to use it and this all without knowing if the other party is or can use it too.</p>
<p>Now I decide to use the old version till my oldies aint here no more and I have my Oekraínian woman with me.</p>
<p>As for the Phone calls I make, I'm going to use whats app. and my own Phone with a cheap card for calling abroad.</p>
<p>I don't know why they change a good working Skype for one that people doesnot not like. If it is for the better and it works better, it will be another story.</p>
<p>I can't say that I'm closing Skype, but I will be using it less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you very much for your reply,</p>
<p>

<p>You need to search for the pre-installed Skype on your device, not the Skype Translator. Once you signed in to the pre-installed Skype application, you will be able to use the Skype Translator. Or you may download the new Skype from our website, the Skype
 Translator is also available in the new Skype. Please utilize this link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34542/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-skype-translator?q=skype+translator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I've found the translator, but didn't use it yet, but when I go for translating I can't see the chats I had before with the that person. Is this correct?</p>

<h2>            Any 4k monitors that work at 50&#47;60hz with Surface Pro 3 &#40;win 10&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the market for a 4k monitor for my Surface Pro 3. I read that the Dell&nbsp;p2715q did work with a workaround in Windows 8 to get full resolution with 50hz - via an intel driver with custom settings, but it no longer works in Windows 10 :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>see here:&nbsp;<a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/77777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://communities.intel.com/thread/77777</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a 4k monitor working with their surface pro 3 at an acceptable refresh rate, 50/60hz ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all seem to be stuck at 30hz with the default surface driver despite Microsoft claiming otherwise.</p>
<p><br />

            I have never been able to get anything but 30 HZ to work with the Dell P2715Q.&nbsp; The DP to mini-DP cable does not work for me.&nbsp; I use an HDMI to mini-DP cable directly to the SP3.&nbsp; I just purchased a Surface Pro 3/4 Docking Station ("Brick").&nbsp; If the HDMI
 to mini-DP cable is plugged into the Docking Station, the Dell P2715Q becomes very unstable and eventually blacks out.

            If you install Intel drivers instead of microsoft ones it will work at 50hz by manually entering settings into intel program.

            <p>Just beware that even the i7 variant of the Surface Pro 3 (<a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/75114/Intel-Core-i7-4650U-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3_30-GHz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel Core i7-4650U</a>) is
 only capable of supporting 3200x2000@60Hz which is not 4K. By forcing 4K@50Hz through some non-Microsoft published drivers you may be compromising the stability of your system.</p>

            <p>Late to the party, but after struggling mightily with 4k @ 60hz, I thought I'd share my final solution. The only "easy" way to get 4k @ 60hz is thru a DisplayPort cable. On that note, I wanted a large monitor (40"+) to effectively have 4 monitors in one.
 Tried just about every combination of HDMI 2.0 TVs on the market to no success. Finally found large monitors in a Korean company called Wasabi Mango. It has so many inputs, it's criminal, including a DisplayPort. I bought the 43" version from Amazon, and it
 arrived from South Korea in 3 days. I have it running thru the Surface Dock, with my Surface Book and it's glorious to finally get this working properly. Thought I'd share, end of weeks worth of headaches. Probably going to post this elsewhere.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>my Xbox one (day one edition) controller is already coming apart down the left hand side ... I can handle poor build quality to some extent on the box itself - it doesn't move about too much - but the controller ... needs to be like a tank.</p>
<p>Any one else having problems ?</p>
<p>Can I get a replacement / repair ?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>You should be able to get a free repair, considering it's still under warranty and anything that came in the box is under warranty. This reminds me when I got my Xbox 360 slim. My mic died within a month and my controller started having problems around a
 couple months. I of course didn't think about getting a repair on it, so I missed out on that. I'm pretty sure Microsoft will repair controllers for free as long as they're under warranty. It should be covered with the warranty on it from the Xbox One itself.
 And I notice build quality of Xbox products have since went down. My current Xbox 360 controller, with the new style changing D pad, well the paint has pealed off of it big time, never had that problem with other 360 controllers.

<p>Bit hard to explain though, both our controllers had the left analogue stick start to have a rough grind when you swiveled the stick in a circular motion (around the edges). That was only a weeks worth of gameplay.
</p>
<p>The other issue was the light bumper (LB) was not "clicky" like the right one.
</p>
<p>Both controllers were sent back to our retailer and they were happy to swap them over. For such an awesome controller, I hope MS havent gone "cheap" on the quality of the materials to save money. We are happy to buy quality products guys!

<p>Yeah im not sure if we just pushed too hard on the analog stick when we play though with our previously 360 controllers, we played with them for many years with no issues at all. Other than your normal wear and tear, the 360 controllers were rock solid.
</p>
<p>What's weird in my case was the "second" controller which had the rough grind with the analog stick was hardly used as i was using my day one. It was only on the weekend when my mate came round for a few games of fifa that he noticed it.</p>

<p>My Day One controller feels like there is a bit of movement in the casing for it. If I squeeze it too hard during game play I can feel it flexing ever so slightly. I went through the process of requesting a repair but I have to pay to send it back to the
 Czech Republic. I'm a bit reluctant to do that at the moment to be honest as its not going to be cheap. I'm also unsure whether or not the replacement would be a Day One or just a standard controller?! It states during the repair request that they will just
 send out a replacement when they receive my one.</p>

<p>The casing on my day one controller is coming apart on the left hand side as well. Was ok for a few days, but now seems to be getting worse. Having to send off for a repair is a real pain though - Plus I only have the one controller at the moment. After
 forking out £430 for a day one release, I'm not overly impressed by the build quality.</p>

<p>Ok, so I have waited two weeks to get my Xbox One (Day One Edition) and my controller won't turn on... Grrrr!
</p>
<p>Being active duty US military stationed overseas, I am not sure if it worth it to send it back, wait four weeks just to get a standard controller... &nbsp;Is Microsoft replacing these controllers with standard controllers?

<p>So it not just me...</p>
<p>I have to say i thought the build quality of the controller was poor when i got my day one edition (compared to 360), all the reviews was praising how sturdy it was, mine didn't seem like it.</p>
<p>then my brother turned up with my early christmas present an extra controller,
</p>
<p>well it wasn't till he left i used that controller, and wow, what a difference in the quality,its how it should be, solid and sturdy.</p>
<p>My day one buttons clicks are loud, and the bumper buttons rattle, and the plastic feels to bow and shift slightly from gripping, and as above, on the left hand side gap, i can almost see into it, i know immediately i should be using the new one.</p>
<p>So, ill see what more people on here have to say then, Im concerned it won't come back "day one edition" as really that and the box is about the only difference.</p>

<p>On mine the sticks seem a little dead around center points, real hard to play Forza when try to have smooth control around corners and shooter games I'm just all over the place. Thinking of buying another one just to compare. I was a little let down after
 all the videos I watched of people talking about how much better it was. Right now i have to say i do like the 360 controller better. Some other little things i dont like but for now the sticks are my big issue.</p>

<h2>            Unable to playback MIDI&#59; Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth missing from audio devices</h2>

                    <span>
<p><strong>I had posted a question concerning this about a month ago, but it still has not been solved.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Late last year, my system crashed and I used a full system recovery for my Gateway MT6919 Notebook to get it working properly again. Ever since that time, there is no recognition of MIDI files. Neither Windows Media
 Player, nor programs such as Guitar Pro 5 are able to playback MIDI information. In Windows Media Player, a timeline appears, but no sound is played. In Guitar Pro, it gives an error message. All standard digital audio files play back fine, so I don't think
 it's a hardware problem.</span></strong></p>
<p>I have the latest Service pack, all current automatic updates, and all drivers are current as well (confirmed through Gateway's website).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, this link did not help:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home 32 bit and 64 bit installed on the same laptop - Activation issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop came with a 64 bit processor but last year when I upgraded to Windows 10, I was not really aware of the difference between the two versions and I installed (and activated) the 32 bit one. Some days ago I needed to install more RAM in my laptop
 and this is how I came across the necessity to have the 64 bit version (the 32 bit version allows RAM up to 4GB while the 64 bit up to 128GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the 64 bit from MS web page and installed it in a separate partition in the same laptop (in dual boot mode)&nbsp;in order to be able to work (with the 32 bit) until the set up (of the 64 bit)&nbsp;is complete (drivers, apps and software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem now is that the 64 bit installation is not activated! Despite that the motherboard of the laptop is the same, it does not activate. Also, If and when&nbsp;I uninstall the 32 bit version, will I be able to "free" my Windows 10 license?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite desperate here as I need to stick with the 64 bit version,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know of any questions you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I've never tried installing the same exact version twice on same computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do dual boot right now enterprise and pro and have dual booted&nbsp;regular public Pro and Pro Insider no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually each install is supposed to have its own key, but it doesn't seem enforced, at least not&nbsp;for short term use anyhow.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed the wrong version&nbsp; like Home v/s Pro&nbsp; &nbsp;your key in only rated for one or the other.&nbsp; I'm guessing at that - as that is a popular problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once activated -- it stays activated unless you seriously change hardware, mainly motherboard&nbsp;serial is&nbsp;the key component of the digital activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Key finder that works to find embedded key&nbsp;.. might try it on your 32bit activated install</p>

<h2>            How to move Users and Program Files to another drive</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm Hassen Boufateh, 17 years old Windows 8.1 Pro user from Tunisia.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, I have formatted my PC and performed a clean install of Windows 8.1 Pro on my machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wanted to keep it as tidy as I can so I made a partition of 50GBs where my goal was to only install Windows on it and left the 550GBs left as another partition to install my files and everything that I wanted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By default, everything was on the A: Drive (Which is the 50GBs partition where I wanted to install only the Windows). I could change some of the default directories from the Register (Such as, Program Files, Program Files (X86), Downloads, Desktop, etc).
 But I'm still finding some difficulties in moving AppData, Users, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I want is to leave the Windows folder on the A: Drive and move everything to the C: Drive. How can I perform this please?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers</div>
                </div>

            <p>This is completely contrary to the recommendations from Microsoft and would be unsupported. What are you trying to achieve by this?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the 1st instance your operating system drive (C?) needs to be much larger and you should not attempt to move Program Files or the User Profile folder itself (C:\Users, C:\Users\<em>username</em>). It can be done is but far from simple and certainly not
 from choice. About the only scenario where it MIGHT be appropriate is where you have a physical limitation to the operating system drive such as trying to use a small SSD. Using a non standard layout without in depth knowledge for no good reason is asking
 for trouble.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Otherwise increase the size of the O/S drive and reinstate the standard configuration for the folders.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then if you want to split the files up use the approved options and tools to move those folders which are safe to be used. Create a secondary profile folder on the alternative drive, switch to desktop mode and select Libraries. In the left pane at the top
 is the Desktop under Favourites, click on that one (not any other Desktop link). In the right pane look for a folder for the user profile name and double click that. This then shows all the folders that make up the User Profile set. Right click each one and
 those that can be moved will have a location tab. Use the Move function to relocate the folder to your new User Profile folder but make sure you create the container, so if the Documents folder make a new Documents folder as the utility moves the contents
 not the folder itself.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As far as programs are concerned when you run the setup utility for each look for a custom install option to define an alternative location or when it shows the install path it may show a Browse button as well to allow you to change the location. Programs
 which offer neither of these will be looking to be installed in the system Program Files folder and should not be changed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you had to reinstall Windows the fact that programs, system folders etc. are on a different drive would not benefit recovery. Everything would still have to be reinstalled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Traditionally A: and B: are reserved for floppy drives and although less used again unless there is a specific need should not be used to avoid confusion.</p>

            I agree wholeheartedly with Hairy, 50GB is nothing and doesn't take into account the space needed for future Service Packs, security updates and hotfixes, optional updates, .NET framework installations, drivers, etc.,&nbsp; etc.<br />
<br />
My advice is to reinstall again, but leave at least 200GB available for the operating system.
<br />
<br />
Your best bet will be to use the whole drive to install the OS to C:\ and then shrink the partition afterwards:

            <p>Your problem starts with a partition which is way too small. The C drive should be at least 100gb, and more if space allows. Use a 3rd party partition manager to resize C drive to around 150gb, which will give you enough space for future expansion.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do NOT attempt to move system files to another partition or drive unless you have an overwhelming desire to screw up the entire installation..

            <p>To be honest even the fact that it is labelled as the A drive shows fundamental errors in the installation which I am not sure how you have achieved it. Therefore it would be difficult to advise how to prevent having to do a reinstall.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have to concur with Xircal, back up any data files you have re run setup and clear off all partitions and start again. I have no doubt it will be a pain but ultimately what you would be left with would be more stable and reliable. Although
 they are not perfect by any means trying to second guess the system designers by not building the architecture as intended would be a risky option.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Given the age you are I would be the last to stifle the desire to experiment and learn but in the 1st instance keep that to something that you won't mind goes wrong so cannot become that "pain in the a**". Look at virtualisation to build test systems because
 it comes with the undo option, not always possible with a live, working computer.</p>

<h2>            Downloaded file not saved</h2>
                    Vista Home Basic, only one user June (administrator).<br />
Had problem with Norton Internet Security - instead of processing a renewal, June downloaded &amp; installed a trial version of Norton 360 which then had an expiry date.&nbsp; To resolve Windows recovery was used to revert to the previous state.&nbsp; Still not right so
 tried to download the program anew from Symantec.&nbsp; Their usual process first downloads a "downloader" which runs to download the real program.&nbsp; The downloader would download but then nothing would happen.&nbsp; Saved the downloader to a folder but then it wasn't
 there.&nbsp; Found the entire .exe to download (not using&nbsp;Symantec's downloader), the download process appeared to run normally but the target file was not&nbsp;saved to&nbsp;the target folder.&nbsp; Tried different folder with same result.&nbsp; The user can save other files to the
 folder without problem.&nbsp; A search of the computer did not find the downloaded Norton file - it was not saved anywhere.<br />
I have since downloaded the program on another computer without any problem, so it's not the source giving the problem.<br />
Why are the downloaded files not being saved?&nbsp; No error message - it's as though the program is immediately deleted after download.

<br />
Good luck.&nbsp; Hope this helps - let us know one way or the other.

<br />
Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Compaq CQ62 laptop with Windows 7 64bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It has a Mobile Intel 4 series video card</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Direct X 11 installed on it</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However Direct X seems to be giving me problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All of my video playing programs including games crash upon launch.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went to Dxdiag to figure out the issue but when I launch Dxdiag it gives me the following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"DxDiag has detected that there might have been a problem accessing Direct3D the&nbsp;</div>
<div>last time this program was used. Would you like to bypass Direct3D this time?"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I hit "NO" DxDiag crashes if I hit "YES" &nbsp;Direct 3D and AGP Texture become "Not Available"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it was to no avail. Can anyone help please?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            game freezes up&#47;locks up xbox</h2>
                    
<p>has anyone else had a problem with the game just freezing up during gameplay and locking up the xbox? its happened to me twice in the past 2 days. i wasn't able to return to any menus or go to the dashboard. only solution was to power off the console from
 the unit itself. i don't really think its from the dashboard update because i've had it for well over a month with the beta and haven't had this happen. i'm just curious if this has happened or is happening to anyone else...</p>

<p>I experienced a period consisting of a few days where the game would freeze up on me. It was a month ago. Hasn't happened since. This game isn't meant for consoles so it can strain the xbox at times. Don't panic is all I can really adivce to you; just give
 your xbox some rest.</p>

<p>Today i played one game then it froze up and would freeze my party too, then when i tried joining games everytime i would join the game it would freeze instantly, tried about 6 times before i gave up on it. Today i'm wondering if it's because of the updates.</p>

<p>hopefully its just from some kinda server maintenance on ea/dices end. i've been booted a few times from&nbsp;servers the past&nbsp;two days also, kinda like what happened when the game first&nbsp;came out.&nbsp;i'm already on my 4th xbox. however its kind of weird that anything
 they are doing would freeze the entire xbox, but then again sometimes when ms had issues in the past it would cause weird lockups for some people.</p>

<p>When my xbox froze it was after the BF update. So maybe there is a link between freezing at around the time when a patch comes out.</p>

 please?

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>I would suggest you to check your laptop sound card in the device manager.</div>
To make sure that your computer has a sound card
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<div><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the <span>
Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>System and Security</span>, and then, under
<span>System</span>, clicking <span>Device Manager</span>.</span>‌<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />
 If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>Double-click <span>Sound, video and game controllers</span> to expand that category. If a sound card is listed, you have one installed. If no sound card is listed, check the information that came with your computer to see if there's supposed
 to be a sound card installed. If there should be a sound card installed, you'll need to install one.</div>
</li></ol>

            Hi,<br />
<div>This may apply to all other brands of motherboards and computers having driver installation issues:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> </div>
<div>Make sure your installation Windows&nbsp;vista has been updated to service pack&nbsp;2 before continuing.
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-update</a></div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> </div>
<div>Perform the steps below to install the Audio drivers in Windows Vista .<br />
<br />
Before installing High Definition Audio Driver you need to install Microsoft UAA Bus Driver.<br />
<div><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01456295&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=499849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01456295&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=499849</a></div>
<div><br />
<br />
You can download the Microsoft UAA Bus Driver from the link below:<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/leavinghp?url=ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp32501-33000/sp32646.exe&amp;desc=ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp32501-33000/sp32646.exe&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/leavinghp?url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.compaq.com%2Fpub%2Fsoftpaq%2Fsp32501-33000%2Fsp32646.exe&amp;desc=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.compaq.com%2Fpub%2Fsoftpaq%2Fsp32501-33000%2Fsp32646.exe&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>If the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio” is working properly, there may be an “Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus” or "Realtek High Definition Audio" behind “Sound, video and game controllers” or an “Unknown device” behind “Other
 devices”. Please disable any of these devices. You can skip this step if device mentioned earlier does not exist in “Device Manager”.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong></div>
<div>Disable the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio” under "System Devices" in device manager.</div>
<div><strong>Step 5:</strong></div>
<div>After that, uninstall the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio" by right-clicking the device and select uninstall.<br />
<div><strong>Step 6:</strong></div>
<div>Restart your computer. It will automatically install the audio drivers. <br />

            I have a Lifecam too, and cannot find and launch the recording application. The cam has been updated, both firmware and software for windows 8, but no recording application: where can I find it? Why isn't available in the app start screen?<br />

Please, I need it asap.

            On windows 8 you should find a Windows 8 Store App called "Camera" that does everything that the old desktop LifeCam app did and more.&nbsp; If you have the "LifeCam Dashboard" Store App as well which you should get automatically shortly after you plug in the
 device, you will have the dashboard available.&nbsp; Press the wrench button in the tool bar at the bottom of the "Camera" app.&nbsp; This will brig up a popup.&nbsp; Press the "More" link at the bottom of that window and you will be able to access the new dashboard.&nbsp; Similar
 to the old LifeCam desktop dashboard.

            there's only the settings windws (with effects and true color and so on...) but there's no button for choose video quality nor, expecially, button to record.<br />
The point is: I cannot record videos to the hard disk. I can just use the webcam in videochat. This is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Any solution?<br />

            When I open the dashboard app there is a preview window and instructions, but there is no way to open the dashboard proper, and there are no record or capture buttons available. In otherwords the windows 8 lifecam dashboard app simply does not work!!!!!!!!!
 The dashboard controls do open for use with skype, but there is no way to use the dashboard directly for capturing pictures or video.<br />
<br />
I am convinced now that the dashboard app was never designed to work as a standalone app. I can get the options to come up by right clicking and then clicking on the wrench icon. Those options affect the view in the preview window, but I can't do anything other
 than watch the preview. It looks like I will need to get third party software if I want to actually accomplish something with my new webcam. It does work with Skype.<br />
<br />
Now I figured out how to use the Camera app to capture pictures and video. You just left click anywhere to capture an image or to start/stop a video capture (when the video setting is turned on. Options appear in the bottom bar when you right click. Unfortunately
 the effects that are available in dashboard are not available in camera, and dashboard cannot capture pics or video (at least not in any way I tried)<br />

            <p>Use the "Camera" app that comes with Windows or is available for free in the Windows Store.&nbsp; The LifeCam Dashboard app is not intended to be used to capture.&nbsp; The Camera app&nbsp;in the operating system serves this purpose well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Press the Start button on your keyboard to get to the Start screen</li><li>Type "Camera"; as you type the list of apps on the left side of the screen will get smaller until there is only one app: the Camera app.&nbsp; It should be Violet in color and have a metro style camera like icon.&nbsp; If the Camera app does not appear it may not
 be installed on your system.&nbsp; Go to the Store app and search for Camera app and install it and start these instructions over.</li><li>Click or tap this icon to launch the Camera app.&nbsp; You should see a preview from your camera.&nbsp; If not try clicking the Change Camera button if it is there to preview form different cameras attached to your system.&nbsp; If preview still does not work, try rebooting.&nbsp;
 Still not working, search this forum for trouble shooting tips.</li></ol>
<p>Assuming you got preview, below are some "how-tos"</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking or tapping on the screen will either start/stop recording if you are in video mode or capture a photo if you are in photo mode.</li><li>Click or tap the Video mode button in the bottom right corner of the screen to toggle modes.</li><li>Click or tap the left "&lt;" button on the left side of the screen to view captured content.&nbsp; Right "&gt;" button on the right side of the screen will take you back the other way</li><li>Click or tap the Camera options button to change resolution or microphone device.</li><li>Click or tap the "More" link at the bottom of the options popup to access vendor options.&nbsp; The resulting popup is in fact the same app as the LifeCam Dashboard app discussed above.&nbsp; The app is running under a different contract; the device companion app
 contract.</li></ul>
<p>Note: The term "contract" is a fancy developer name for "mode."&nbsp; The LifeCam Dashboard app can run under two contracts: device companion app and tile experience.&nbsp; The "device companion app" contract is what you see when you launch the app from the "More"
 link from the options popup.&nbsp; The "tile experience"&nbsp;contract is what you see when starting the app by clicking on the LifeCam Dashboard tile on the Start screen.&nbsp; Windows 8 has this concept they call contracts that apps can offer.&nbsp; For example, if you capture
 a photo, click the "&lt;" button to preview it, click the share charm, then click mail; you are looking at the Mail app running using the share contract.&nbsp; It's the same app as the Mail app just running under a different contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you uninstall the app from the start screen, then the "More" popup will also be uninstalled; as mentioned before, they are the same app.&nbsp; In fact all store apps need a tile experience otherwise how would they be uninstalled.&nbsp; Looks like LifeCam
 is in a situation where they need a tile experience in order to have the device companion experience but the tile experience may not make much sense as the camera app provides the functionality that the LifeCam Dashboard tile experience might offer.&nbsp; Why have
 two apps that do the same thing?</p>

            If you want the standalone program just install the windows 7 software instead of the windows 8. You can go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/lifecam-studio#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/lifecam-studio#support</a>&nbsp;and
 download the software there. Just click the support tab and then select Windows 7 and then download the exe.

            Hi Eric,
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Personalize
<br />
<br />On the left click Themes
<br />
<br />On the right click 'Desktop Icon Settings'
<br />
<br />From there you can turn on the Recycle Bin icon
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Right click your desktop and select New folder. 
<br />
<br />In the name field, copy-paste the following and hit Enter: 
<br />Recycle bin.{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E} 
<br />
<br />The folder will automatically convert into the Recycle Bin!

<p>Hi Mrowka64,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I notice that your Skype for Business version is not latest, please try to upgrade your Office to latest version (Open any office application, such as Outlook, go to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Update Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Now</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For just getting a white background, please try to upgrade your driver (search
<strong>Device Manager</strong> in your computer &gt; <strong>Display adapters</strong> &gt; right click your graphics driver &gt;
<strong>Update driver</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after you tried as above, please provide us following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please try to sign in your account in an non-problematic machine (such as your colleague's computer) to check if the issue happens.</p>
<p>2. A screenshot about "getting a white background".</p>
<p>3. May I know if the issue happens to every Skype meeting that someone shares screen to you?</p>
<p>4. Can you share screen to others?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h2>            Help me change from DSL to wireless</h2>
                    <p>I have att&amp;t u-verse wireless, I have a windows 7, I call the office back and told them I wanted
</p>
<p>DSL. She said well your modem will go back and forth to put in the ethercable ,</p>
<p>I did this and I got DSL fine, a week later I put it back to wireless&nbsp;fine...</p>
<p>well when I tried to go back to DSL a few days later the machine will not do it</p>
<p>I used the trouble shooter and it said my something local 2 is disabled and that my ethernet cable is broken</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>I dont think so it is brand new...sooo</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my question I called tech support 5 times... they told me the fourth time I needed to buy tech support plus</p>
<p>&nbsp;for 15 .00 a month for a year. then the Tech could access my computer put in software and make some changes....no I said</p>
<p>Next I called the 5th time this time uverse tech support and she said to click discounnect of wireless, turn off machine, put in
</p>
<p>cables, turn back on......I did this and for 2 sconds the DSl icon appeared on the bottom of the screen....then flepped back to
</p>
<p>wireless....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I get it to flip to DSL and stay&nbsp; now I know wireless is convenient... but I need this computer to be a dedicated
</p>
<p>computer for trainning with Customer&nbsp; Mobility...and I must have DSL to work in Pvn and Citix</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So thank you&nbsp; for what you can tell me...I have lost trust for my tech support....and I do not want to buy tech support plus if this
</p>
<p>is an easy fix by me.</p>

<h2>            How do I delete duplicate photos in a single photo gallery album</h2>
                    I have duplicate and triplicate pictures in a photo gallery album. I can not find a method to eliminate all the extra copies of the same picture in a titled album. Therefore I have a massive number that I am trying to pick the best photo to edit.

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand you are unable to delete duplicate photos in single photo gallery album.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate if you could answer a few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> What is the version of Windows Essentials?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>What version of Windows are you using on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Photo Gallery is a feature that is included on computers that have the Windows Vista operating system. People whose computers have Windows 7 can download the software from Microsoft. You can use Windows Photo Gallery to view and organize your photos.
 You can also use it to edit a photo; for example, you can fix red eyes or crop a photo. If you notice a duplicate photo in Windows Photo Gallery, you can easily delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to delete duplicate photos. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong>You can browse through the location where you have all the pictures saved. The pictures would ideally be saved in the location ‘Documents\Pictures’.&nbsp;You can also right click on the picture click on properties; this will show the
 location where the pictures are saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you open the location in the windows explorer, right click and click on sort by name.&nbsp;Select the pictures that you would like to delete.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;</strong>If this does not work, you can also check if you have multiple thumbnails for each photo. The images you see in Windows Photo Gallery are thumbnails of the actual photo. Sometimes the thumbnail database gets messed up. You can
 force a rebuild, by renaming it.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>a.</strong> Make changes to&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">show hidden
 files</a>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(Make sure you hide files once you are done.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>b.</strong> Now, close Windows Photo Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>c.</strong> Navigate to C:\Users\ (your account)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Photo Gallery</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>d.</strong> Rename “Pictures.pd4” to “Pictures.pd4.old” (without quotes) and reopen Windows Photo Gallery.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know if you need any more assistance.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Harry,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums where you can find answers to all your Windows related queries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From this description of this issue, it seems that when you login to the desktop a page open stating that
</span><span>Logitech Desktop Messenger is incompatible with this version of Windows</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue could be caused if Desktop Manager used to program my Logitech Harmony Remote might not have installed properly on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What exactly are you getting this message that says”<strong>
</strong>Bucket ID: 518009991”?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. I would suggest you to
 perform a clean boot procedure to find out which service is causing this issue. Refer this link to perform a clean boot:
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer step 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <span>uninstall the Logitech Desktop Manager using the programs and features in control panel. Refer the following link.</span></p>
<strong><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></strong>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Logitech Desktop Messenger is used to give customers notice of software updates. However, this can be done manually by periodically checking on the Logitech website:
<a href="http://www.logitech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.logitech.com</a></span></p>
<p><span>In other words, Logitech hasn't figured out how to get their Desktop Messenger to play nice with Windows 7, so uninstall it and periodically check for updates on the Logitech website will help you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry it took so long to get back but I read your reply just didn't have time to reply back. I didn't get your question:"&nbsp;
<span>What exactly are you getting this message that says”<strong> </strong>Bucket ID: 518009991”?"?? Next I
</span></p>
<p><span>don't have a Logitech Harmony Remote , and I must have missed not saying I did an msconfig and a clean boot! As I said this popup came out of the Blue on Win.7 Ultimate which ran fine for over 2 years with the Logitech. I contacted Logitech First before
 coming to Microsoft Forums to ask ,Logitech stated nothing had changed or had been updated in the version of Software I was running on&nbsp;their end and suggested the Error had to do with Microsoft Updates + Changes.So about a month later around 03/01/2013 I logged
 on and&nbsp;everything loaded and I noticed no extra window and in fact it has left town.I did nothing ,didn't uninstall ,reinstall or change one darn thing, So what happened, Glitch ,something not loading right, could be. When I searched the Registry for Logitech
 I must have got 60 pages and a lot of code so who knows.It is just un believable what is loaded on a drive just to run a keyboard and mouse, it's like 1/2 of Windows 95!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply!</span></p>
