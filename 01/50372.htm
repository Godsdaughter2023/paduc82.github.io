<h2>            USB drive not recognized by media player app</h2>
                    
<p>I have a WD my book Essential 3tb usb3.0 powered external drive with videos and audio files, when I connect it to the Xbox One after a few seconds it tells me the device is ready, but when I turn on the media player app the drive is nowhere to be found.
 I go into the settings menu and manage storage sub-menu and the drive is correctly identified, I use the view content option, loads the media player app, but the drive is not found. Any ideas on how to fix this, seems like an app problem.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. I thought it was my hard drive, so I bought a new one. But this is still happening. I can't find any solutions online!

<p>I tried everything to fix this, checked the formatting settings one the hard drive etc. But for some reason (after several attempts before) I tried a full reboot on the Xbox -by holding the On button for 10 seconds and restarting- and it worked. However
 my old hard drive still isn't showing up. Hopefully this helps anyone else with the same issue. &nbsp;</p>

The Xbox One seems to have&nbsp;some issues with hot-plugging external media drives.</p><p>The best way is to fully turn the device off!

<h2>            Does unlinking Microsoft Account on my Windows 10 PC will remove all files saved in the User folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently using a Microsoft Account when logging in to my PC, I want to switch back again to a local account. Does switching back/reverting to a local account will remove all the files saved in the User folder? Just like when you remove another account
 (local or MSA), it will also delete the User folder.</p>

            Hi  RedRailgun,
<br />
<br />When you switch a user account from a Microsoft Account to a Local account, it will not affect local files stored in the users folder, you are just changing the way you sign into that account, not creating or deleting a new account in the background . . .

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have already tried most of the troubleshooting steps, I suspect that system file might be corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. It's recommended for advanced users. To run it:
</p>
<p>

            <p>That's such a typical MS cop-out response. Why not actually try to solve the problem instead of blaming the user and/or his system? The "system" is Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried multiple SD cards. &nbsp;Autorun never automatically kicks in. &nbsp;Cards are NOT corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the lastest MS suggestion, and as usual, it's garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put the command in, first in C:\user\(xxx), and when that failed, it went up to the root (C:\) and got the same nonsense:</p>

<p>elevated permissions are required to run DSIM</p>

<p>Insert an SD card in Windows XP, Windows 7, and it opens right up. &nbsp;Windows 10, nothing, got to do it manually, open up FE, scroll down through all the useless nonsense (that's another complaint, for another thread). &nbsp;Microsoft, these stupid changes you

<h2>            NEED HELP _ Laptop Shutdown &#38; Restarts when power supply connected only_ Happy New Year to all_</h2>
                    Hello to all &amp; thanks in advance for any help...<br />
<br />
I have a Laptop,Toshiba Satelite,L305 series,yr 2008-09 I have Vista as OS. Recently, 6mos ago-when the power supply is conncted, the laptop shuts down and restarts automtaically numerous times, at least 3-4 times in one hour. No-one has been able to fix it.I
 changed the power cord, power connecter and laptop base. No change. The laptop works fine on battery normal mode -no issues- and seems to work fine on Safe Mode Net working WITH power supply connected. One PC shop did a test run on Linux and told me it works
 fine (?)..so, I have re loaded the laptop to original mfg Vista -out of box. Same problems!!&nbsp; It runs fine on battery normal mode, runs fine on Safe Mode Net Working (power Supply on). I am not sure what to do here. I have lost files and battery life is only
 1 hour..new batteries not best option either. Safe mode does not run Norton 360 so, I am open when surfing. Any ideas?solutions?&nbsp; greatly appreciated. Happy New year.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Please clarify the <b>bolded</b> part:<br />
"I changed the power cord, power connecter and <b>laptop base</b>."<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Is that the motherboard?&nbsp; It very well could be defective.<br />
What about the system memory?&nbsp; Tested it?<br />
Why is a new battery not a good option?&nbsp; Or is that something you did try already?<br />
( Unfortunately - I don't believe Windows Vista had the "PowerCFG -energy" command line option...&nbsp; :-( )<br />
&nbsp; <br />
And it sounds like it is not "shutting down" but more "instantly powering off without warning or even a BSOD (blue screen of death)"?&nbsp; If so - the latter that is - then sounds like a hardware issue - or a driver/application that is causing it to trip (which
 would be why it would not fail in Safe Mode, assuming you tested for several hours.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Have you tried from a Windows 7 Live CD (so it is not a clean install) or something similar?&nbsp; That way it is a full OS and not one that did not load all the drivers or the same drivers and applications you would in normal mode.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You said you did a clean install of Windows Vista at one point - did you test for a few hours before upgrading everything else (drivers, applications, etc.) to be sure that the BASE install worked as expected before adding more variables back into the mix?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Norton should always be removed, in my opinion.&nbsp; Especially if it is a Norton Suite like 360. Norton/McAfee - resource hogs that don't want to get removed when the user requests them to.&nbsp; Suites (security suites in particular) is just some company that was
 good at firewalls, antivirus, antimalware, etc. trying to put together a bunch of other products in a package (usually not ones they are good at/known for combined with the one they are known for being good at) so they can sell more software to people - not
 to mention that it is overkill for most people and usually causes troubleshooting problems to be more difficult.<br />

<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font><strong>Dump Files</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<blockquote>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>
<hr />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skydrive is Microsoft's Windows Live file upload site at 
<font color="#9b4f96">https://skydrive.live.com/</font>.&nbsp; Read about it at 
<font color="#0072c6">http://explore.live.com/skydrive</font>.<br />
<br />
If you have downloaded any of the Live applications or have a web based Live mail account you already have access to your Skydrive.<br />
<br />
Put your&nbsp;event list in the <em>Public</em> folder and copy the link from the address bar.<br />

<div><font><strong>Dump Files</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<blockquote>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>
<hr />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skydrive is Microsoft's Windows Live file upload site at 
<font color="#9b4f96">https://skydrive.live.com/</font>.&nbsp; Read about it at 
<font color="#0072c6">http://explore.live.com/skydrive</font>.<br />
<br />
If you have downloaded any of the Live applications or have a web based Live mail account you already have access to your Skydrive.<br />
<br />
Put your&nbsp;event list in the <em>Public</em> folder and copy the link from the address bar.<br />

--Thanks for the answer, will give it a try...by the way: I never get "blue" screen, it just shuts down and restarts. It does not do it now in Safe Mode w/networking-which means the issue is somewhere between Normal &amp; Safe mode file loads...should I follow
 your directions given the new information? Thanks again!<br />

<font>Thanks for the answer,&nbsp; I can not try Win 7- no money!out of work. New batteries are expensive and will give me only extra 1 -2 hours of work. I could work in Safe Mode but no virus protection in Safe Mode while internet browsing. ...by the way: I never

            David..I have started few of your suggestions but unable to do others since it either would not work on battery power or not enough power/time on my battery..as soon I connect power supply it shuts and restarts even when i do Checkdisk.!&nbsp; It works fine
 in Safe mode..I wonder if there is a way to to Start in Safe mode, isolate which programs starts in safe mode and normal mode..then add each one to safe mode from normal mode to know which one cause this?...I have done scan many times via Norton/Avast..but
 no virus..I think this is a virus to force me to work in safe mode!..I will continue with your suggestions and will report back..Thanks a million!<br />

            Heat: The fan has been thoroughly cleaned/opened/cleaned. I have one inch clearance between laptop/table. No effect.!<br />
<br />
I ran what I can in Safe mode: I ran the SFC, there are corrupt files and Windows was unable to fix. I did the "<em>findstr /c:"[SR] Cannot" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log|more" ....</em>and there are list of information...not able to copy.paste for u. For certain
 results are "Found corrupt files but unable to fix some of them".<br />

I will report back as I run other steps..Thanks again!<br />

<h2>            Game not downloading</h2>
                    <p>So I purchased a Xbox One game using the Xbox app on Windows 10. The purchase went through fine and when I look at my account via web browser it show the game there. But it is not showing up in my games list in the app and there is no indication that it is even downloading at all. I have one other Xbox one game install on this computer that I installed about 8 months ago. I think when I purchased that one it started downloading automatically and I could check status in the Windows store.</p><p><br /></p><p>Are there certain Xbox one games that can only be streamed through an actual console? If so that would be nice to know before purchasing. I thought that the "Xbox one app" on Windows 10 was the same as having an actual Xbox one console?</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyway I would really like to get this to work and any advice would be appreciated.<br /></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>This issue might occur due to following reasons:<br />
•&nbsp;The currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt.<br />
•&nbsp;Your PC requires an update for issues that may conflict with a USB external hard drive and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to perform the methods given below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to install all the updates on your computer.<br />
To install all the Windows Updates, follow the steps below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
1.&nbsp; Click on search bar, type <strong>Windows Update</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp; Select <strong>Check for Update</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp; <strong>Download and Install </strong>the latest Windows Updates. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>I suggest you to run the <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter
</strong>and check if it helps.<br />
1. Click on search bar.<br />
2. Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
3. Click on <strong>View All </strong>on the left panel of the screen.<br />
4. Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.<br />
5. Click on <strong>Next </strong>and follow the <strong>on-screen </strong>instructions to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>If the issue still persists, try method 3.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 3: Uninstall and re-install USB drivers:</strong><br />
1. Press <strong>Windows Key +R</strong> and type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>to open Device manager.<br />
2. Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers </strong>at the left bottom.<br />
3. Right-click the first USB controller under Universal Serial Bus controllers, and then click on
<strong>Uninstall </strong>to remove it. <br />
4. Repeat these steps for the entire USB controller under Universal Serial Bus controllers.<br />
5. <strong>Restart </strong>the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like you need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox<br />
stores) or the System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Here are methods to try though you have done many :<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER
<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause
<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong></p>
<p>Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow</p>

TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Refer to this thread for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

<h2>            After a botched Win 10 auto install my VERY EXPENSIVE PC is &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I WAS SENT HERE - THIRD PLACE WHERE I AM SENT ... DO NOT DARE SENDING ME SOMEPLACE ELSE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having authorization problems in several areas.</p>
<p>OneDrive</p>
<p>AutoLogin</p>
<p>Live Messenger</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was never even aware of "Credential Manager" in 7.1 until since 2 months ago (after an "update)&nbsp; This is a BRAND new</p>
<p>security issue and I repeat it began after an un-authorized update, during the "free" Widows 10 upgrade which crashed. Since then I get these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--- OneDrive :</p>
<p>It may work fine for a few days. then &nbsp;When I check credential manager, the name &nbsp;"OneDrive"&nbsp; has turned into a random number . I delete the whole certificate . Add a new certificate the info ( "Internet or Network Access is: OneDrive</p>
<p>Enter Username</p>
<p>Enter Password</p>
<p>Save it.</p>
<p>The "Persistence" entry shows as "Enterprise" (automatically)</p>
<p>This may last for 3-5 days</p>
<p>---Autologin</p>
<p>My credential is Administrator (and I am the only user on the machine)</p>
<p>I am set up for NO LOGIN </p>
<p>Randomly I receive a login prompt on reboot or after sleep</p>
<p>When this happens it lasts several days and then it goes back to my "no login" mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---"Live Messenger"</p>
<p>We have known for two years that Live Messenger is "Skype"</p>
<p>Suddenly I started reciving "A new version of Live Messenger is available" at random times</p>
<p>I can refuse the update by clicking "NO"</p>
<p>If I click&nbsp;"YES" I am shown "You already have the latest version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides Microsoft products, I had a 2 month issue with "CARBONITE" where local mirror installation threw a credential error</p>
<p>Carbonite did a 2 month investigation on this and they came up with a DOS script file that corrected the problem.</p>
<p>The script file came from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So.... This ALL started after a Windows 10 attempt to install . Now the message I get when I try to force an install is that "My version of windows 10 is NOT ready"</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - Alienware replaced all my hardware . Did a reinstall of 7.1 . restored all the data (2 days work) and we are still at it.</p>
<p>Clearly ALL the answers we are getting here are from users and Microsoft is&nbsp;not being bothered with this.</p>
<p>I have the strange suspicion that Winfows 10 is being betta tested on OUR machines</p>

            <p>This WINDOWS 10 problem will be like&nbsp; VISTA&nbsp; a total fiasco . because Microsft WANTS to force itself into Social Media, SmartPhones, Home automation even CARS! And Microsoft was NEVER EVER good at anything that covered too much ground.&nbsp; I am younger than
 you but I recall talking to Bill gates almost daily when he was selling DOS. AND it was always the same **** . OVER promise under deliver and what are OUR OPTIONS?</p>
<p>As far as YOU ..</p>
<p>If your notebook came with the WORD &amp; EXCELL &nbsp;applications installed... YOU MUST (BY LAW) get a certificate. If you have a certificate . Microsoft has to get you a copy of Office that is NOT linked to any certificate so you enter YOUR certificate and it
 will work.</p>
<p>Any PC tech that is asking $250 to reinstall WORD &amp; EXCELL must be licensed at the level of a DELL or ACER. If he's doing it on the side you are getting cracked (bootlegs) copies and MS is (AND I KNOW THEY ARE) spying on your PC because they are SO BAD at
 it they leave TONS of crumbs behind what they do.&nbsp; So if your WORD or EXCELL shoots a serial to MS that is a bootleg) MS will just wipe out your installs or worse yet they will corrupt your system&nbsp;just bad enough that you think it is reparable &nbsp;and WILL make
 you suffer.</p>
<p>So here is MY PROFESSIONAL advise:</p>
<p>CALL MICROSOFT - if anyone with an Idian accent answers .. you want to escalate and don't be afraid to talk legal action. Tell MS that your system was SOLD with WORD &amp; EXCELL installed but you did NOT get the certificate.</p>
<p>It is NOT YOUR responsibility to check who is selling "stolen" goods" it is MICROSOFT. If some jerk cracked the certification then MS left themselves open.</p>
<p>I know $250 may not be a lot considering the fight , BUT position yourself that you will pay to install a cracked copy and then SUE MICROSOFT - MS WILL LOOSE. Windows 10 is a mess , shares will sink&nbsp; MS will have a LOT bigger problems than sending you a
 set of MS Office. </p>
<p>so </p>
<p>SCREAM</p>
<p>SCREAM</p>
<p>SCREAM</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck</p>

    <title>my Windows 10 notification banner sound is not working anymore. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            my Windows 10 notification banner sound is not working anymore.</h2>
                    <p>hello.</p>
<p>I have a bad problem with Windows sound.<br />
First of all, the sound of Windows comes out clearly and expressively. Video and music are played and there is no problem in sound.<br />
but My problem is with Windows autoplay sound (when I plug a USB or new hardware) and also windows notification banner sound (my main problem).<br />
Unfortunately, I see the notification banner but I have no sound of them and also I do not have a connection sound when I plug in the USB flash or new hardware to my computer.<br />
I checked the sound setting (in control panel) and all the settings were on.<br />
Once I shut them all off and restarted the windows when I logged back, I turned them on, did not change, and my problem did not resolve.<br />
Once I did the same with Windows Notification for app system but still did not fix it. I tried to reinstall the all sound driver and the problem still not fix.<br />
I used troubleshot in Windows, but I did not find a problem and says everything is right. What should I do?</p>
<p>my Windows is 10 version 1803<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Shayrin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue due to some changes made on your computer or the sound driver might not be compatible with the current version of Windows. To know effectively the reason behind this, I would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes prior experiencing this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to fix the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, <span>I suggest that you roll back the device driver and check if it resolves the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes so we can further assist you.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 said File Corruption please restart in notification now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uh.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 said File Corruption please restart in notification now won&#39;t boot at all.</h2>
                    <p>Soo I have an OCZ RevoDrive 3 x2 240GB PCI-E SSD. </p>
<p>I did the upgrade from windows 8.1 than I did a fresh install and installed the correct PCI-E Drivers for my SSD to show up in the initial installation screen for formatting your drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was fine for a long time. Today I had a power outage while my PC was idle. its on an APC UPS but that died while it was still idle mind you. I booted the system up with no issues I later put it to sleep and went out. I came home woke my PC up
 and there was a notification saying that C: drive had corrupt files and needed a system restart to repair them. so I accepted and it looked like everything was fine..... Untill the second reboot where it went back in to the automatic repairs. I have no options
 to reboot just turn off or advance options / refresh. Unacceptable sfc /scannow says a repair is in progress and must be finished before it can run and for me to reboot to finish the repair. so I contacted (and am currently connected to Answer Desk Live Agent
 "John A." whom for the last 50 minutes has not replied back to me with any help its been a one sided conversation. UNACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do a </p>
<p>bootrec /fixMBR (Successful)</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot (element not found)</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildBCD (Total identified Windows Installations: 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>AH HA so aparently M$ decided to delete my PCI-E SSD's drivers... or at the very least is to incompetent to not load them in the repair tool I would imagine they are not that incompetent but then again they keep updating my laptops touchpad to an incompatible
 driver even when I have the driver updates set to DO NOT UPDATE. "Never install driver software from Windows Update" but it still decides to uninstall my proper drivers with the incompatible ones even AFTER windows 10 is final and released... UNACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so please anyone on these forums I really need to get my production machine back up and running with out a fresh install I require not losing any of my data and seeing as this specific PCI-E SSD OCZ decided to make Windows Only I cant toss it in my ClearOS
 Gateway to recover the data off of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>well its been over 50 minutes still no response from John A. Microsoft Answer Desk Representative. last message he sent was 9:24PM Sept 19th 2015. it is now 10:15pm Sept 19th 2015. wow just wow unacceptable.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So my experience so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I'm doing a clean install, as Rafael has done his best to help troubleshooting as he suggested a repair but it was saying the drive is locked because it is unable to see the drive. so I tried going threw the setup process and proceeding with an upgrade...
 well apparently that button is just for show and it just tells you to go inside your current OS and do the upgrade that way (because some how it can't do it without another OS running I guess)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I would try and load the driver from the custom install method which then showed the drive in the format window so instead of formatting I clicked the red X to go back to the start of the install and I click that almost invisible "repair" link
 and sure enough this time it reconized my drive and gave me more options to toy with but ultimately the repairs were unsuccessful. so I tried again but then time I just went to command prompt. I then proceeded to use</p>
<p>diskpart</p>
<p>sel disk 3</p>
<p>sel part 3 (for the boot partition 'EFI' since it is a UEFI install)</p>
<p>assign</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I took a guess at which drive letter it assigned eventually figured out it was drive F:</p>
<p>so I then went and deleted f:/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/BCD</p>
<p>then I did </p>
<p>bootrec /fixMBR (Successful)</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot (Successful)</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildBCD (Total identified Windows Installations: 1)</p>
<p>Yes to add to the boot list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>exit reboot annnnnnnn Preparing Automatic Repairs. so I give up my data is lost thank you M$ as soon as SSD size increases and price decreases I'm jumping ship. this PCI-E card is a nightmare fast... but wow I never thought that Windows would remove the
 driver just because its EoL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OH and John A. never did respond at 2AM the chat just ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to Rafael for the help though as I opened up a second browser and started a new chat in a different browser he was a lot more helpful and I thank him.</p>

            Hi Anthony
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            also, starting windows in safe mode seems to avoid the BSOD, as when i booted my PC today out of safe mode, it would BSOD after a couple of minutes, but in safe mode, it hasnt happened yet. seems like it has nothing to do with workload.

            Hi Anthony
<br />
<br />The minidump files indicate your ATI graphics card device driver is causing your system crashes, that also makes sense, because your video card is not loaded in Safe Mode, that is why your system does not crash in Safe Mode...
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your device and form there download the ATI graphics card device driver they recommend
<br />
<br />Use DDU to totally remove your Current driver
<br />

<br />
<br />Then install that video driver your downloaded . . .

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from the screenshot, it appears that you have created an account using your phone number and is linked to your email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to delete an account linked to your email without affecting the other one.</p>
<p>Since Skype account is also your Microsoft account, all services and products including accounts linked to it will also be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't any option to unlink those that is under a single Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For our reference: <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12060/can-i-merge-or-unlink-my-skype-and-microsoft-accounts?platform=uwp?q=unlink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can I merge or unlink my Skype and Microsoft accounts?</a></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are using the <strong>new Skype version 8.xx,</strong> you can share a link to your friends for them to be routed directly to your account. Refer to the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click your <strong>Profile picture.</strong></li><li>Under your <strong>status </strong><em>(Active, Invisible or Do not disturb),
</em>click <strong>"Share profile".</strong></li><li>It will provide you a link starts with <strong>https://join.skype....."</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you are referring to the account with a profile picture, you can
<strong>link or merge</strong> it to a new Microsoft account that is created during the process of merging. By that, you can provide the newly created email address to your friends to give them your correct Skype account as a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To merge, sign in to <strong><a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/</a></strong>&nbsp;using your
<strong>Skype name/username</strong> then follow the prompt steps.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>To further check it, please provide the screenshot of your profile where the "share my profile" option is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for removing the other account associated with your email address, as what Mark mentioned, since the two accounts are linked to one email address, it will not be possible to delete the second account without affecting the connected Skype and Microsoft
 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, whenever someone search your account in Skype using your email address, they will also search the other account. Unfortunately, there's no option to hide or unlink the second account so it won't appear from the search&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;In this case,
 we can only suggest to provide the exact Skype name of the account you're using or your profile link to the people who wants to add you as a contact.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I'll wait for your reply.</p>

            Yes I just searched it too and it says not available yet. It could be a region thing and it may just be delayed because of that. Hopefully its available soon&nbsp;

    <title>Internet Checkers&#58; Restore INTRODUCTION screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> modern nem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Checkers&#58; Restore INTRODUCTION screen</h2>
                    
<p>In Windows XP, there are "Internet Games": checkers, backgammon, hearts, reversi, and spades. Whenever you launch&nbsp;one of these&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;games, an introductory screen first appears, with the words:</p>
<p>"The game matches you with players from all around the world" ...&nbsp;etc, etc.</p>
<p>You can uncheck the&nbsp;<span><strong>CHECKMARK </strong></span>for
<strong>"Show this every time"</strong>. When you do this, the introductory screen will no longer appear.</p>
<p>But I want to restore this screen to the Internet Checkers application before I give the computer to someone else. And I don't know how to restore the checkmark.&nbsp;(The other four Internet games continue to display the Introduction screen).</p>
<p>I've tried copying the MSN Zone files from another hard drive, no difference. I even uninstalled the games in the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel, rebooted the PC a few times, and then reinstalled them. Would you believe? No difference. I can't figure
 out what to change in RegEdit.</p>
<p>How do I restore this checkmark?</p>

<p>A contributor to Annoyances.org provided the answer. The keys in the Registry can be found as follows:</p>
<p>HKEY CURRENT USER; Software; Microsoft; zone.com; Free Games 1.0; Preferences; Windows User</p>
<p>There is a folder for the Checkers application. Since this part of the registry is reserved for a user's own trivial&nbsp;preferences&nbsp;and&nbsp;doesn't change&nbsp;the computer's operation,&nbsp;I just deleted the folder.</p>
<p>I rebooted, and Internet Checkers has reverted to its original state with the Introductory Screen. The application continues to work normally, of course.</p>

<p>Ideas:I am getting error code 0x80073AFC when I try to use system restore so how do I find and replace this missing MUI File?</p>
<ul>
<li><span>
<p>I am running Windows 7 so the SP 1 or SP 2 packs will NOT solve my problem since neither one works with Windows 7.&nbsp; Is there any way to search for this missing MUI (Multiple User Interface) File? The blamed thing must have installed itself in the
 first place. I did put both my Mama (she passed away in June) and my brother on this PC as users so even though they don't use it this PC does support multiple users. Maybe if I removed both as extra users and reboot it will solve my problems. My updates install
 OK but I cannot run system restore at all. It creates a restore point OK but when I try to sr back to an earlier restore point I get the 0x80073AFC error message about a missing MUI File. Then when I run SR it says that it failed and no files were changed
 because of error message 0x8000FFFF unspecified error, catastrophic failure and unable to extract file at various times when System restore is attempted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion with Firefox 3.6.8 browser, Opera 10.60 browser, IE8 browser and Google Chrome 5.0.375.125 browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell me what I try next? Thnks a lot and sayonara for now guys- Jack McElwee/keimanzero the Scion of Anime in Brookhaven PA-USA</p>
</span>OK I have tried everything and nothing works! The only newbies added are browser updates to Opera 10.63; IE9 (Beta); Firefox 3.6.12 and Google Chrome&nbsp;7.0.517.41 and Java 22. Of course like everyone else in the world I've had to uninstall/enable and disable/download
 again and reinstall again and again Adobe Flash 10 and Shockwave 11 and they keep crashing too! Allo 4 browsers keep screwing up and now I keep getting network connection problems. I've run Comcast Doctor and done all it said to do but nothing works. Oh and
 I added 7-Zip and WinZip too. Even they won't work! HELP!!Thanks- K&amp;K</li></ul>

<p>A Clean boot is not the same as a 'system recovery'. From the KB article - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></p>
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p>keimanzero,</p>
<p>Is Comcast's version of Norton's Security Suite&nbsp;installed ? If so, that and&nbsp;<em>maybe</em>&nbsp;malware is the most likely cause of all of the issues that you posted,&nbsp;<strong>especially</strong> the failure of System Restore.<br />
First, configure the system to Clean boot - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a><br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> In the Clean boot state <strong>all</strong> 3rd party firewalls will be&nbsp;<strong>Disabled</strong>. Open Control Panel &gt; Windows Firewall to ensure that the native Windows 7 firewall is now&nbsp;<strong>On</strong>.</p>
<p>Download and <strong>save</strong> the System Update Readiness Tool ( CheckSUR) . You'll need to download the&nbsp;<strong>specific</strong> Version of CheckSUR that matches the&nbsp;<em>system's architecture for Windows 7</em>. If you do not know the system's architecture,
 then click the link that states "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Click here to view or hide step-by-step instructions with pictures</span> " under&nbsp;<strong>Method 2: Download the System Update Readiness Tool directly from Microsoft Download Center</strong>
 -<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for Windows 7, and for Windows Server 2008 R2</a></p>
<p>Once the download has completed close all open programs and browsers. Now run CheckSUR with the system connected to the internet as it will download .cab files to the system. Restart once CheckSUR has finished running.<br />
<br />
Second, suggest you&nbsp;now run the System File Checker while in the same Clean boot state&nbsp;.<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> , and then type <strong>cmd</strong> in the <em>
Search programs and files</em> field. </li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> cmd.exe in the <strong>Programs</strong> list, and&nbsp;choose '<strong>Run as administrator'</strong>.<br />
<div>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,&nbsp;enter your password or click Continue .</div>
</li><li>At the command prompt, enter the following line exactly as written <strong>including</strong> the space between the<strong>c</strong> and the<strong>/</strong>, and then press ENTER:
<div><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></div>
</li></ol>
<p>When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issues that the system has experienced have been&nbsp;resolved.</p>
<p>If they are not, then you'll need to either contact <a href="http://us.norton.com/support/comcast.jsp?pvid=nsce_1&amp;entsrc=Comcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            I keep getting low disk space messages</h2>
                    For several days now I get "low disk space" messages. I ran Disk Cleanup several times&nbsp;a day, deleted programs and files, emptied the Recycle Bin, I gain some free space, then minutes later the low disk space pops up and the amount of free space changes
 again. Today it has gone from 963MB to 4.5MB, the amount changes for no apparent reason. Norton scanned my computer but could not find anything.&nbsp; In addition to the low disk space, now the
<br />
Recycle Bin does not show the programs and files I deleted when I tried to empty it today. I tried saving my most important files to a CD and couldn't because I did not have enough disk space to copy the files. In the time I have been typing the free space
 available went down to 3.9MB. Any idea what could be causing this?

<h2>            The Dumbest Feature Known to Man</h2>
                    I just updated Windows and now I'm trying to delete the "Old Windows" folder. Yet, here I am... With precious moments of my life literally passing away never to return, being prevented from deleting it by this ridiculous permissions rule. Why in the world
 do I need to permission to delete a folder from my own computer?&nbsp; I understand the information about how to change this is available. The list is long and the process is time consuming. This is STUPID that I have to go through this process just to delete a
 folder from my own computer, because I, the very owner, the very builder of this machine, have not been granted "permission"... For crying out loud!!!!!!!!!!!

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />In certain cases when the update is not successful the Windows.old folder might contain Documents not migrated to the newest feature update. Windows.old can be handy in these cases.
<br /> 
<br />Nevermind, here are all the methods to delete Windows.old

            Hi Michael, usually the quickest process for deleting that folder is:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />In the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select everything in the list and choose Delete
