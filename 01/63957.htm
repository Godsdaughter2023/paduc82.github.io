<h2>            Windows Hello coming to desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When or is Microsoft going to release a camera USB attachment for Windows Hello for the desktop models?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love using the Windows Hello for the Surface Book, and I think this is a great way to secure your stuff. But, I think it sucks to not have it on the desktop. It's a complete pain to have to lock your computer each and every time you get up, and there is
 so much of a hassle that it become not worth securing the desktop.</p>
<p>Because of how easy it is to use Windows Hello (camera). I am asking the question on the first line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe after Microsoft releases a USB model for the camera, companies will start adding it into monitors when they see how much people like it.</p>

            <p>Anil - this is not correct. To use Windows Hello you must use a USB camera that actually has two cameras - one is a regular webcam and the other is an IR webcam which can see through makeup and beards for example. Do you have any further clarity to Craig's
 question?</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this computer on a domain network? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hosts file is a read only, hidden system file. It is just a text file that you can manipulate with WordPad, Notepad or any text moeditor. Before difying the hosts file, make a copy of the current one in case you need to restore the original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more information,&nbsp;refer this article: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>How can I reset the Hosts file back to the default? </strong>

<h2>            Excel Add-In missing from tabs after Office 2016 upgrade</h2>
                    I have been using a third-party program with Excel 2016 and a tab is added to the Excel toolbar. Yesterday, there were updates applied to my computer automatically and now the tab won't save. I select it from Add-ins, but if I close Excel and reopen it,
 the tab is missing. This is happening on my Windows 8.1 computer. I have uninstalled and reinstalled both applications and nothing changes. This is not happening on my Windows 10 computer. How can I fix this/

            <p>From the document you sited:</p>
<p>"Note:<br />
Windows* 2008 and newer would not normally be misaligned, unless the system was a
<br />
standing upgrade from an earlier version or a clone. In this case, reinstallation is also the best
<br />
practice."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically if you are doing an upgrade and it is currently aligned it should stay aligned.</p>
<p>If they aren't aligned properly then Windows isn't going to automatically fix it for you.</p>
<p>If you are installing with a clean install Windows will use the proper alignment.</p>
<p>I checked mine using this and they are properly aligned (again from the document you sited):</p>
<p>"Windows* OS using msinfo32.exe<br />
Hit the START button and type <br />
msinfo32.exe&lt;ENTER&gt;<br />
<br />
Navigate to <br />
Components &gt; Storage &gt; Disks<br />
Identify and select the appropriate drive<br />
Locate Partition Starting Offset<br />
Divide the offset number by 4096<br />
If the result is a whole number (no decimal), the partition is correctly aligned <br />
Repeat for each partition"</p>

    <title>Disc tray randomly opens - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxdavisleexx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc tray randomly opens</h2>
                    
<p>I have the the new Xbox 360 S. The issue is that the disc tray randomly opens and its not any particular game. Sometimes it opens and closes and other times it would just stay open. It even happens when the Xbox is off and sometimes there isn't any disc
 in the tray. I've tried wiping the eject button thinking it was from dust and finger smudges. I've turned off the Kinect to see if its from the sensor detecting movements or sounds. But neither of these attempts worked, it still opens randomly. I thought it
 could be when the Xbox was getting too hot, but its happened before when I've only been playing for a few minutes and sometimes the Xbox hasn't even been on that day and it would randomly open the tray (I would hear the ding sound and come into the room and
 to see the tray open and close).</p>

            <p>Hey there Davis! Thank you for your post! One thing you can try is to unplug your console from the wall power outlet for several hours. Then, hold your finger on the disc eject button for a few seconds. This should fully discharge the capacitors in the system - a sort of "reset" of the touch buttons, if you will. After this, try powering the system back on and see if the issue is resolved. :) If you are still having this issue after this step, then the console is likely in need of repair. Let me know how this works out! :)</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi jamesblonde,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>By log off do you mean that the computer restarts or the computer logs you off from the user account?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you able to login in any other existing user accounts? If yes, you may check if the issue exists in those user accounts.
<br />
</span><strong><br />
<span>Method 1: <br />
</span></strong><span>You may even check in safe mode – In Safe mode; you have access to only basic files and drivers. Refer to the link to start the computer in safe mode –

<p>I have a few thoughts for you.&nbsp; First, it sounds like a virus.&nbsp; You should probably do a full hard drive scan with your virus scanner.&nbsp; This will take quite a bit of time, but it'll be worth it.</p>
<p>I'd also try running Microsoft's System File Checker which scans for missing or corrupted system files and attempts to repair them.&nbsp; To run this tool click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All</strong> <strong>Programs</strong> -&gt; <strong>
Accessories</strong>.&nbsp; Right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.&nbsp; Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> in the black box and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>How long does it take for for the automatic logoff to happen?&nbsp; If it's not too long, you can try is logging in using Safe Mode.&nbsp; Start the system in safe mode by pressing
<strong>F8</strong> repeatedly during the start-up process.&nbsp; Choose <strong>Safe Mode</strong> or
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> from the list of advanced start-up options. This runs the system with a minimal set of device drivers and services to start Windows.&nbsp; You can work in Safe Mode for a while to see if it still happens.&nbsp; This can help
 narrow down what's causing your problem.</p>
<p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

            If you have never successfully read a memory card larger than 1 GB (or perhaps 2 GB), the odds are very high that the problem is that your computer has a memory card reader that is too old to read the newer SDHC cards (4 GB and up).&nbsp; In this case, you
 will have to buy an external card reader.&nbsp; They are not very expensive.&nbsp; For example --&gt;

<br />
If you have Windows XP service pack 3 (which you should have installed long ago), you already have the necessary software.&nbsp; However, if you only have XP service pack 2, see --&gt;

 and welcome to the Skype Community!</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Call drops are usually because of connection issues. So we can further troubleshoot the issue, please try the following steps below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Make sure you are using a strong and stable connection. Try changing connection before you initiate a call. You may check
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417/how-much-bandwidth-does-skype-need?q=bandwidth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this FAQ</a></strong> for the suggested upload and download speeds for optimal Skype experience.
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Set up <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?q=caller+id" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">caller ID</a></strong>. Make sure to set this up so that your family, friends and business
 contacts know you're calling them.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Uninstall and re-install the Skype application. Go to your device's Settings then to your Application Management. Locate Skype and Force Stop the application. Tap on Clear Data and then uninstall. After uninstalling the app, make sure to reboot your device
 so that changes will take effect then download from PlayStore.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the above suggestions did not work, let us know so we can check further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            This exact thing is happening to me too. As long as I am on the automated menu it works. As soon as it connects me to a human the call drops before they pick up. It must be something about how they are answering the call, it feels like they must be disconnecting
 it instead of connecting the call when it transfers. It is VERY FRUSTRATING.

<h2>            Surface RT keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>My newly-purchased Surface 64GB appears to have a problem with a driver that prevents it from shutting down properly. Whenever I shut down, the system tells me that there is a problem which caused the machine to re-start, and often indicates a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE
 error. I can't seem to find out which driver is causing the problem, and it's a nuisance that the machine won't power down and stay powered down.</p>

            <p>Hi Gary, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have been experiencing this issue for the last 2 months with my 64GB Dell XPS 10 tablet with Windows RT.&nbsp; I have seen this happen almost every time my tablet goes to screen lock, and then eventually the screen will fade out like it's going to sleep.
 Except it shuts down, starts up, and wants to send error to microsoft with DRIVER_POWER _STATE_FAILURE&nbsp;error. I have also noticed that it now will not connect to my home Wi-Fi.&nbsp; I have to bluetooth into my iPhone, connect to the hotspot, then drop the hotspot
 for the devicee to connect to Wi-Fi. As a developer, I am very upset with this light-windows version and the inability to fix these issues as you can with full blown Windows 8.

                    <p>I already asked an ambassador about this but he was rude and completely unhelpful, so this is all I can think to do now.</p><p><br /></p><p>The controller in question is one I normally use for playing PC games, so I don't know when it might have happened, but when I try connecting it to my console, the home button flashes 8-10 times a second like a strobe light and wont connect to the console. There is nothing wrong with the batteries, as when left alone the controller flashes normally as it searches for it's linked console before timing out and turning off automatically. When connected to the console via a USB cable, it functions normally, so it might be the wireless transmitter that has broken or something along those lines.<br /></p>

    <title>System Repair&#47;Restore required repeatedly after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jnewman67  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Repair&#47;Restore required repeatedly after Windows Update &#40;Win7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've been noticing this problem since the fall of 2015 - on multiple machines (40+ at least).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I routinely have to reinstall or build Windows 7 (pro or home) machines&nbsp;from scratch - unfortunately, they are rarely the same brand let alone the same family of machines, so I end up having to install them from scratch.&nbsp; There are currently over 200 updates
 for a fresh build of Windows 7 SP1.&nbsp; I used to be able to just select all the "found" updates in each round of updates, and install them all at one time - long and tedious, but at least I wasn't having to do each one individually!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've been finding for the last 6 months or so is that I can get about 75% of them installed now, then randomly, a round of them will cause some type of corruption and during the next reboot, the system(s) will require booting up into System Repair,
 where they will require a System Restore back to some previous round of updates (not necessarily the last round), which may or may not finish successfully.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 2 full days rebuilding 6 identical laptops 4 different ways, and each time they all crapped out at the same round of updates.&nbsp; After the 3rd attempt, I went through each update&nbsp;of that failing round one&nbsp;at a time, rebooting after each update, and
 all the machines got corrupted, BUT AFTER DIFFERENT UPDATES!&nbsp; I have not been able to find one update that would constistantly cause the corruption of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that time, as a rule, I've taken up turning off Windows Update completely (do not check) on rebuilt machines, then manually&nbsp;checking for updates and installing them at times when I can deal with any corruption that might occur.&nbsp; I've resorted to using
 3rd party update utilities to get my machines updated - WUOffline,&nbsp;PortUpdate and AutoPatcher were the 3 I fiddled with the most.&nbsp; WUO does a nice job, but doesn't cover all the updates.&nbsp; AutoPatcher just didn't give the desired results I was looking for,
 but PortUpdate seemed to work the best, and be relatively easy to use, though just as slow as WU, as it somehow gets the update information from WU directly.&nbsp; PU still requires multiple rounds of updates (search, download, search, install, repeat), but it
 has worked without fail, and got all the available updates installed without any corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until yesterday.&nbsp; I started having the same problem again yesterday, using only PortUpdate to bring a machine up to date.&nbsp; It installed 55 updates the first round (this machine had been previously updated, then sat turned off for about a month or two).&nbsp;
 Round 2 had about 20 updates, and was corrupted when it rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've repeated this process 3 times on this particular machine, and it does the same thing each time - making me restore to before the 55 updates were installed.&nbsp; The 3rd time through, I actually rebooted the machine twice between updates, and did some registry
 and temp file cleaning in between - each reboot was normal between updates, no issues until after updates were installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My rebuilt machines run&nbsp;MSSE for antivirus (with scanning disabled), with no other av/malware utilities installed or active - plain, base installs - and this one corrupts repeatedly like I'd been seeing previously.&nbsp; All known Windows 10&nbsp;GWX updates get uninstalled
 and blocked from reinstall as well - GWX is not active during these updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come to the conclusion that the updating that's getting done during the reboot process is probably the cause - the machine will run fine after the updates finish installing, and up until the reboot is done (if it's not done right away - I tested that).&nbsp;
 I believe that there's something that's occurring during the update/reboot process that isn't finishing correctly and leaving the drive in an unstable state, or is corrupting the registry (or both), leaving the machine in an unbootable condition.&nbsp; I've done
 manual CHKDSK's on the drives after the corruption and while here might be unreported free space found and fixed, that's not enough of a fix to get the machine booting again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting it through the Startup Repair process doesn't fix it either - only the
 System Restore will get it booting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to know if anyone else is seeing this happen consistently as well.&nbsp; It takes nearly 2 days to get all the updates installed on a machine without having to do repeated rebuilds because of system corruption.&nbsp; I'd really like to find the cause
 of this, and find a way around it.&nbsp; It's very frustrating to perform and update and essentially be playing Russian Roulette with your system and data - will it reboot and run, or won't it?&nbsp; There's a good chance it won't, and that's disturbing.</p>

            <p>Have you picked up on this tip currently circulating.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Download two updates before starting the installation process, KB3083710 and KB3102810, and copy them to a USB flash drive. Install Windows 7 with SP1 and leave the network cable disconnected.
 Install those two updates from the flash drive before connecting to the network and running Windows Update for the first time, and you can cut that horrendous checking for update delay down to a matter of a few minutes.</span></span></p>

            <p>Nice tip, but completely unrelated to my posting (sorry, but it's true).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My post was about the corruption that repeatedly occurs during the Windows Update process - not about how long it takes to get&nbsp;the list of possible updates available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd gladly wait&nbsp;6 hours or more for a list of updates if I knew that they'd install without requiring me to rebuild the system again right after they got done installing!&nbsp; I'd still be ahead of the game, sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, but not an answer to the problem.</p>

            <p>No offense, but I can't do that as I've already started rebuilding the current machine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question wasn't necessarily about this specific machine or instance anyway - it was about finding out if I'm the only person having this problem (repeatedly, with over 40 machines of different brands and models).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recognize your copy/pasted answers from other posts (I'm not a first time user here - actually happen to have been Microsoft Certified, when that actually meant something), and realize you are somehow benefitting from posting as much as you do - but I'm
 looking for a conversation on whether my repeated (and repeatable) experiences over the past 6 months are unique to me or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During this rebuild (again), if I can't manage to get it past a corruption point, I'll upload an event log - maybe it'll hit on something, but not likely anything I can fix, and probably nothing Microsoft is willing to fix.&nbsp; But I'd still like to know.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Gerry's recommendation is correct.&nbsp; Follow it.</strong></em>&nbsp; If you are starting with Win7 SP1 install disk, do it with no internet connection.&nbsp; Apply the two updates offline, restart, then make the Internet connection and start WU.&nbsp; Works flawlessly
 for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look after 150 client Win7 machines.&nbsp; I do what you describe quite routinely and never have the problems you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one thing I do you probably are not doing that I would recommend as well.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there has not been a single NON-security Windows update for Win7 since before January 2015, I hide and do not allow any of them dated in the time frame since then.&nbsp; I also set the WU setting at NEVER and recommend that to you as well.&nbsp; Also, do not
 install anything, not even Antivirus until Windows Updating is completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p><strong><em>The following procedure applies in the case of install (re-install) of Windows 7.&nbsp; It does not apply to usual, normal updating.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid you are going have to do the re-install again.&nbsp; Not a terrible penalty to pay.&nbsp; Usually takes way less than an hour.&nbsp; Then, immediately proceed with the following procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is strange, but it really does work and a lot of people have proven
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>

            <p>okay, so I'd like some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do these two updates actually fix?&nbsp; Gary's original post only mentioned the delay in getting the update list -&nbsp;his post&nbsp;clearly does not mention any address to my originally posed question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, with the current machine, I got done installing a round of 55 updates, rebooted, uninstalled a list of known GWX updates, rebooted again, and was forced to do a system restore.&nbsp; I had gotten past that step safely last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to assume I'm not the only person seeing this on a regular basis - I just got two calls from clients who had shutdown/restarted their systems yesterday (which installed a set of updates), and both machines had corrupted file systems (one recoverable,
 the other has an account with a corrupted profile now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that it was happening with 3rd party installers (outside the realm of Windows Update) would imply that there's something going on with the updates themselves, or something running in the background that isn't shutting down/completing correctly during
 shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating to say the least - and I wouldn't mind being proven wrong or at fault, if it meant that the problem were solved!&nbsp; Like you, I have over 100 clients (small businesses) and routinely repair/maintain/clean their machines from the usual OE's
 - and this has been happening across the board since October.&nbsp; It used to be Select All, Install, Reboot, Repeat without a hitch.&nbsp; Then this started with a vengeance!</p>

            <p>I do not know the details of why this works.&nbsp; Possibly Ken Morely does.&nbsp; It has been somewhat published in tech mags.&nbsp; I just know it works.&nbsp; I do not know if this particular fix has anything to do with the specific problems you report.&nbsp; I can tell you for
 certain that I follow the procedure I described and have not experienced what you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been going on since last July when MS shifted Win10 into high gear and shifted Win7 into low-low gear.&nbsp; Win7 had been getting very low priority treatment since then.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, MS has been literally attacking Win7 installations converting them to Win10 without even asking and making a real mess of them.&nbsp; I have put a defensive system in place which I can share with you.&nbsp; This works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.&nbsp; I have done this on 150 client computers and it works flawlessly, and has continued to that since Spring,
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>

<p>Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10&nbsp;installation promises to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and sometimes requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition
 on their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically labeled Security.&nbsp;
 In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; </p>

 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”&nbsp; Woody’s advice is that if you have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove all of Microsoft’s spyware that is&nbsp;already installed&nbsp;on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time. You need to wait till you see the number at the bottom of the search window exceed a few hundred.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed (the number at the bottom again exceeds several hundred), enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p><em>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>

            <p>Thanks for the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I instructed all my clients to switch to NEVER back in October, after I realized late one night that the "optional" Win10 update was getting checked automatically and going to get installed, like it or not (not).&nbsp; That's been the rule for
 all machines I've built since then as well - and it's worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my post:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-10-pro-optional-update-no-longer-optional/5dd67760-653a-4a37-b3e4-d94351682e8e</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have been using GWX Control to remove it off machines as well, and a script that uinstalls the related KB's that put the **** there initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this has been working since that post - now it's not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll give your method a try (booting to DVD right now), and see where it gets me.&nbsp; Glad you're hopeful - I'm losing faith in MS by the day.</p>

            <p>I'm not going to say it's "fixed", but I did get it to completely install and update during this particular machine's rebuild.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reformatted the drive during a fresh install from Win7 Pro SP1 DVD&nbsp;while network was disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed KB3083710 and KB3102810&nbsp; updates, rebooting after each one, then reconnected to network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Windows Update, installed only the "security" related updates until there were no more in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hid any updates that were listed and in the list of KBs above (as well as some more recent GWX/Telemetry updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then installed all other found updates (against the recommendations above, but I was testing old method against new method)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again checked to see if undesireable KBs had been installed or were available to hide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeated until the only thing left in the update list were MSSE and Skype</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, I have a machine that's fully installed and updated, and it now has other MS products on it, and those updated through Microsoft Update as well.&nbsp; I don't know what the fix was, but this order of installation did seem to work, and I'll stick with that
 until it no longer does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One note:&nbsp; this worked for a fresh rebuild.&nbsp; The case where an existing machine (in whatever state of update) is still unknown, and I'll test that as it occurs.&nbsp; My likely approach will be to first uninstall any crapware found on the machine, uninstall AV,
 clear the WU cache, install the two updates (with no network attached), then all the security updates, and finally the remainder of the updates (minus the crapware again).&nbsp; Hopefully I'll remember to post my findings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all that responded.&nbsp; I'm still not happy with how one can't just Select All and Update, but at least this method doesn't have any backtracking to it, and is pretty straightforward.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.

    <title>Cannot Change Save Apps Location to Specific Storage Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Change Save Apps Location to Specific Storage Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a weird issue. In Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage, I'm trying to change the option "New apps will save to:" to my largest HDD as that's where I put most of my stuff rather than storing things in my SSD which I use to boot and is rather small as well
 as my older, much smaller HDD which is the slowest of all three (in terms of read/write speed). All the other options work fine, it's just the "New apps" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is, when I click on the bit to change, select my D: drive (largest HDD) and click apply, it goes back to C: drive, yet when I set it to E: drive (smaller and slowest HDD) and click apply, it works fine, why is this and what can I do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I don't know if this is anything to do with it, but I recently transferred my Windows install to the SSD to improve boot times (I've seen a large improvement because of this) but I'm still using the original HDD since it has been formatted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>

</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the default storage location for app installation changes automatically in Windows. In this case, the issue lies with a particular drive, i.e. D:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check for the latest updates in Windows 10 which helps the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities as well as fixing&nbsp;any missing&nbsp;links in performance of the operating system.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To check for updates now, go to <strong><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update,</span></strong> and select

<p>
</p><p>If it still does not help, try to change drive letter of the affected drive volume&nbsp;and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Disk Management in Windows (Start <strong>"RUN"</strong> in Windows with keys
<strong>[Win-Logo]+[R]</strong> and type in diskmgmt.msc)</li><li>Right-click a hard drive and choose <strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong> in the context menu.<br />

<p>
</p><p>When I try and change the drive letter I get the following error, "The parameter is incorrect.".</p>
<p>It works fine for the older HDD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would suggest that you check the drive health with the instructions of the SSD manufacturer first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN I would check to see that the drive has administrative privileges for you, the user. Owning the account is not the same as having the priveleges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process is much the same as in other Windows versions. You need to check the drive's PROPERTIES (right click on the drive icon or see Device Manager and establish that both the drive is working correctly AND that you have the rights to fully use it.
 If it's not available to your user account you will have to change this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reply back with your results and you can either&nbsp; find out more here or be directed to other solved questions or information to help.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;believe THAT is what you are looking for.</p>

<div>Hi <strong>Jimazona</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. From when are you facing this issue?</div>
<div>2. Any recent software or hardware changes on your computer?&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></div>
<div><strong>First I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices one by one except keyboard and mouse and try booting your computer and check.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would also suggest you to perform a Startup Repair and check if that fixes the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow the steps below:</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
a. Please insert the Windows Vista DVD and reboot the computer.<br />
b. When we are prompted to press a key to boot from the DVD, please press Enter or the space bar.<br />
c. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.<br />
d. Click Repair your computer.<br />
e. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
f. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Margery,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When changing the icon size of your desktop icons, it could be that you went to Color &amp; high contrast option and accidentally enabled the color filter that resulted the screen to turn to black &amp; white color. Now, in order for you to revert it back to its
 normal screen color, just simply click on the <strong>Windows icon</strong> located at the bottom left corner of the screen, then click the<strong> gear icon</strong> to open the
<strong>Settings menu</strong>. Now, on the Settings menu, click <strong>Ease of Access</strong>, select
<strong>Color &amp; high contrast</strong>, then click to switch <strong>On</strong> or
<strong>Off</strong> the <strong>Apply color filter</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance regarding this concern.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware or updated drivers recently? Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see<br />
if any drivers have been updated there just before this started happening.<br />
<br />
For 7f - this could be a hardware issue such as poorly seated cards or memory, though there are other causes.<br />
Weak powersupply could also lead to this. Use the troubleshooter below and when you get to the drivers and<br />
memory sections refer to my next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
Cause
<p>Bug check 0x7F typically occurs after you install a faulty or mismatched hardware (especially memory) or if installed hardware fails.</p>
<p>A double fault can occur when the kernel stack overflows. This overflow occurs if multiple drivers are attached to the same stack. For example, if two file system filter drivers are attached to the same stack and then the file system recurses back in, the
 stack overflows.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Troubleshooting: </em>If you recently added hardware to the computer, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies to determine
 which hardware component failed.</p>
<p>The memory scanner is especially important. Faulty or mismatched memory can cause this bug check. For more informaiton about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Check that all adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use
 an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>If the error appears on a newly installed system, check the availability of updates for the BIOS, the SCSI controller, or network cards. These kind of updates are typically available on the Web site or BBS of the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>Confirm that all hard disk drives, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p>If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, you should remove or replace the driver. If, under this circumstance, the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS, you might
 be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console in order to access the file.</p>
<p>Also restart your computer, and then press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when you add only one driver or service at a time.</p>
<p>Overclocking (setting the CPU to run at speeds above the rated specification) can cause this error. If you have overclocked the computer that is experiencing the error, return the CPU to the default clock speed setting.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If you encountered this error while upgrading to a new version of the Windows operating system, the error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version. If possible, remove
 all third-party device drivers and system services and disable any virus scanners before you upgrade. Contact the software manufacturer to obtain updates of these tools. Also make sure that you have installed the latest Windows Service Pack.</p>
<p>Finally, if all the above steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can also cause this error.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those reboots.<br />

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your

system has that installed by the maker.<br />

    <title>Unlist device name from Safely Remove Hardware List - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omi azad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unlist device name from Safely Remove Hardware List</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Whenever I connect something to my USB-C port I see a "USB Root Hub (USB 3.0)" device on the Eject list:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9738ae99-166c-4a13-bbb7-24d64a18fb95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9738ae99-166c-4a13-bbb7-24d64a18fb95" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the above scenario I have connected a USB network adaptor and as you can see the&nbsp;"USB Root Hub (USB 3.0)" is listed but the network adaptor is not. When I connect a flash drive, it shows both. I do not have any reason to eject this hardware, and this
 is annoying for me on the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me to learn how to un-list/remove this "USB Root Hub (USB 3.0)"&nbsp;from Safely remove hardware list?</p>

            <p>Hi Omi,<br />
<br />
Just a heads up, no current option to remove a device name from Safely Remove Hardware List. However, to make sure that our developers will be able to roll this out for future updates, you can provide your Feedback using the Feedback Hub that is built in on
 your Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can provide a feedback using Windows Feedback app to help us in improving our products. If you are using Windows 10, you can find the Feedback app by typing Windows Feedback on the Start menu. This feedback is collated and reviewed by our product
 specialists and can be a candidate for future release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>

            <p>It's not a feature Martin, it's a registry hack. As a feature it is not available (should not be), and will never come. If you search more you will see people has done such hacks in the past. Even in this forum I can show you more than 2 registry hacks similar
 to my query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a former MVP and Macrosoftee I request you not to get involved in topics you do not have any clue of. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
