    <title>Windows 10 Family Safety email request for more time doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottmayhew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Family Safety email request for more time doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I have two boys with identical computers. &nbsp;I set Family Safety up on both. &nbsp;Both run Windows 10. &nbsp;However, while one can prompt me for more time by way of an email request through the Family Safety interface, the other never gets this prompt. &nbsp;His time
 just ends. &nbsp;How can I set up the ability for my other child to request more time (more screen time, temporarily) by way of email request? &nbsp;Seems broken, but there must be a way to fix it.

            In my case, my kid's account does popup a dialog box to let him request time. However, the quest is never received so I don't get a chance to give him more time. I've verified that his internet connection works fine.

            <p>This is the usual inadequate answer; it should also show the request on the family safety site and it does not appear there or as an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also once I have extended the time on the family safety site it would allow you to login again on Windows 8 but not Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now they are logged out until tomorrow morning and as they are in the middle of working I can't do a clean boot either.</p>

            I think you are out of your mind if you think a clean boot will solve this problem? &nbsp;what next, re initialize the hard drive? &nbsp;reinstall windows 10? &nbsp;buy a new computer? &nbsp;Your answer would be a colossal waste of time. &nbsp;No, there aren't any 3rd party problems.
 &nbsp;It's something else entirely and I thought maybe others had come across this problem as well, where on two identical computers, one allowed email to be sent to the parent to grant more screen time whereas the other never prompts for such an email to be sent,
 but rather, just locks out the user when time is up.

            Also, I would recommend that you open the Xbox Avatar Editor on one console at a time. Never attempt to try to open the app on Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at the same time. Because only one of the system can login that person at a time.

<h2>            Chave inv&#38;&#35;225&#59;lida GTA IV</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Olá, comprei GTA IV pela steam e ontem terminou de baixar, instalei normalmente e pediu uma conta do Social Club... Fiz a conta e entrei no jogo, a "Games For PC Live" abriu automaticamente e pediu que eu entrasse com minha conta da Live ID (Xbox
 Live). Conectei na minha conta e apareceu para eu digitar o CD Key (Já estava digitada), a steam estava informando a chave do lado inferior direito e dizendo que possivelmente eu iria ter que inseri-lá, verifiquei a chave com a que estava no Games For PC e
 estava correta... Aceitei os termos de uso e aguardei a liberação do jogo, mas aparece o seguinte erro: "Não é possível entrar porque a chave do produto é inválida. Digite uma chave de produto válida.". Como assim não é válida?? Se eu comprei e paguei pela
 steam, tem que ser válida!! Não consigo jogar online e nem se quer SALVAR O JOGO! ¬¬
</strong><strong>Já fiz um processo para verificar a integridade do jogo pela steam (Propriedades do jogo &gt;&gt; Ficheiros Locais &gt;&gt; Verificar Integridade do Cache do Jogo) e ainda assim continua dizendo que é inválida.</strong>
<strong>Espero que corrijam isso o quanto antes, pois comprei o jogo com a intenção de jogá-lo, não acham?? Nem ao menos salvar o jogo eu consigo, eu passo uma fase e quando "deito na cama" pra salvar pede para entrar na live, quando digito a minha conta da
 live aparece esse erro que citei acima.</strong> <strong>O dia que terminei de baixar e instalar foi ontem (12/11/2012) Por volta das 19:30 horário da Bahia (Não tem horário de verão).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Espero que possam me ajudar, pois comprei e quero jogar!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Att</strong></p>

<p>Consegui resolver meu problema... Eu formatei meu PC e reinstalei a Steam, depois reinstalei o GTA IV e quando pediu a conta entrei normalmente. Aí apareceu pedindo para atualizar a "Games For Windows Live", atualizei e quando voltou estava funcionando o
 jogo... Estou conseguindo salvar e jogar online =D</p>

<h2>            Why so serious&#63;  It&#39;s just a game&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've encountered an interesting phenomenon when playing Halo Reach MP.&nbsp; In many instances, an opposing player will take the time to kneel next to my body and pray&nbsp;after they've killed me.&nbsp; Sometimes they even kneel directly over me.&nbsp; If it's a team game,
 sometimes another player of the opposing team will also join their teammember in kneeling next to or over me.&nbsp; They'll often stand&nbsp;and&nbsp;kneel several times in a row.</p>
<p>It's just a game!&nbsp; There is no need to do this.&nbsp; You haven't really killed me, just my avatar.&nbsp; Besides, in a few seconds my avatar comes back to life as if nothing happened.&nbsp; Really, I don't mind if you don't kneel when you kill me.</p>
<p>Also, this is dangerous for my opposing team.&nbsp; Often times, members of my own team will not give opposing teammembers the courtesy to let you finish what you are doing.&nbsp; They have no qualms of killing opposing teammembers in a kneeling position, even&nbsp;though
 the opposition is&nbsp;trying to be polite after a kill.</p>
<p>What puzzles me however is that none of my own teammembers have ever had the courtesy to&nbsp;engage in this polite behavior&nbsp;after they have betrayed me.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's just a game.&nbsp; There is no need to kneel after every kill.</p>

<p>Wow.................................... Ummm..... just wow.</p>
<p>Is the first post supposed to be sarcastic? I cant tell......... Hmmmm.........</p>
<p>Well If it isn't, they are "teabagging" you. This is supposed to show disrespect and dislike. Most do it to anger you. Obviously it's not working. Though you know, kneeling and doing a little prayer for the guy you just owned does sound like a better use
 of time. I might try that once, then take a bullet in the head for standing in place for 2 seconds.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>I would too. Some of us do not like immature idiots who betray people who once considered them friends. You betray me, I inform you of how serious I take it. A 'hissy fit' is hardly my style but I can guarantee you'd be out of my game and possibly off my
 Friends List.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You betray me again, I definitely remove you and send you on your way with some charming words.</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p>Major Luck, just out of curiosity, have you ever met a player who would bow their heads and pray (or whatever they're supposed to be doing) for a departed character?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I would doubt many soldiers would bother or feel compelled to do so, too. How is a soldier supposed to regret or empathise with someone who's trying to kill them? I do understand that religious soldiers may be more likely to do so, though I don't know much
 about religion, but otherwise it seems incredibly unlikely.</p>

<p>Can you imagine if they had given the AI the ability to teabag and it was featured in the campaign? That should be a skull for Halo 4. The Teabag Skull. When activated, enemy and friendly AI teabags excessively.</p>

<h2>            Gold not working, get error msg when I try to log into my Account online</h2>
                    
<p>For the past 2 weeks my Gold membership has not been working on our xbox. &nbsp;It prompts me to make a payment and then won't accept my payment information (though it is all correct and money is available). &nbsp;When I went to log in online I got an "Oops" error
 message when I hit "My Account" so I couldn't make a payment from there either. &nbsp;I chalked it up to a glitch in the system and we have been using my husband's account on another machine, however, 2 weeks later it is still happening. &nbsp;Not only that, but my
 Gold membership payment went through on the 29th and it still won't work! &nbsp;I am still getting the "Oops" error message when I try to log into my account and it is still insisting (from my machine) that I need to make a payment but won't accept any of my information.
 &nbsp;When I tried to log in on my iTouch it made me sign a new Terms of Service, which I did, but it made no difference. &nbsp;We have another account on the same machine that is experiencing the same issues as mine (error message when trying to log in on the computer,
 etc).</p>
<p>My husband's Gold membership is up and we can log into his account fine via computer (his profile is on another xbox, if that makes any difference) however he is unable to connect live when he goes to play Hand of Kul--it gives him a connecting screen that
 goes on forever and never resolves.</p>
<p>What the heck is going on here? &nbsp;I pay money for these accounts and can't use them!</p>

    <title>HDD access after Windows10 -&#62; Windows7 reversal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tbadshah  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDD access after Windows10 -&#62; Windows7 reversal</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows7 Professional on my computer. HDD1 (partition 1) has my OS install, HDD1 (partition 2) has data, and HDD2 is another data disk. HDD3 is another data disk. All are SATA if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going for the free Windows 10 upgrade, my computer was an eye-sore, with Win10 not detecting the correct display drivers and providing no option to upgrade the driver, and auto-upgrade effectively made me download win10 4 times before proceeding to install.
 (All in all it was a painful experience and I have used all versions from Win3.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reverted back to Win7 through the Windows 10 option. However now I cannot locate my data partitions anymore. Yes - they are detected in the Disk Management as separate disks and partitions. Yes - they dont have a drive letter assigned to them. Looking
 into these forums, I found that i have to assign a drive letter to these partitions/disks and then windows will display them in File Explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem, In Disk Management - i right click and select "Change Drive Letter", and assign a drive letter same as my previous configuration. The disk is now available in Explorer but needs formatting!! I lost 100G of data by selecting to format
 my smallest drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I not lose data on my other hard drives through Windows 7?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The "reversion" process in Win10 frequently leaves a Win7 install that is wrong in a lot of ways.&nbsp; I recommend you re-install Win7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Win10 back to Win7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7, or your system is not right after you did that “reversion.”&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process,
 it is called a “Custom” install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not install anything <em><strong>but</strong> </em>Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates.&nbsp; This is the setting you will keep.&nbsp; Restart.&nbsp; Set Windows Update service to Stop.&nbsp; Start globe, type services in text boxt that pops up, select services from the list.&nbsp; Find Windows Update in the
 list, right-click and choose stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and install the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Now proceed to Windows Update and begin the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get the list of proposed updates (some 200 plus), look for the Windows Section in the Recommended update section.&nbsp; Find the updates in that section that are NOT labeled security.&nbsp; Click once on each.&nbsp; Right click and hide any and every update who’s
 date is after 2014.&nbsp; FYI, all updates after 2014 are to grease the skids to Windows 10 or install Microsoft spyware on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check Device manager to find out if any drivers are missing.&nbsp; Start globe, type device into the text box that pops up, click on Device manager.&nbsp; If you find any item in the list with a yellow exclamation point, that driver is missing.&nbsp; Install them from
 the USB stick you stored them on earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>Something you have starting with Windows is failing. To find out what that is, first ensure that the computer is completely virus/malware-free:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a></p>
<p>If the computer is clean and the problem persists:</p>
<p><span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. Then see what is on the Startup tab.&nbsp;You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility.
 Usually this will be blocked by Windows Defender and you'll need to allow it to run so you can then tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Use Services instead and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.<br />
<br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            DNS &#40;Server&#41; Error - Resolving Host Problem with Intel 5100 WLAN Adapter&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I tried to fix this problems in private but I came to no working solution.</p>
<p>Using: Win7 Professional, Intel 5100 WLAN Adapter (latest MyWiFi driver), all kinds of browsers</p>
<p><strong>The Problem: In every browser I use persists for a few weeks a problem in the DNS - Host Resolving Procedure or something that belongs to it.</strong><br />
When I try to reach a Website for the first time of the day, the connection holds and for example Firefox tries to resolve the Host's IP Address. I can try any website - the problem ist the same. When FF got the IP it loads normally for the 16MBit connection,
 but the getting of the IP takes approximately 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Things I've done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Done the Reset of the Network Connection: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</li><li>Read similar Posts here </li><li>(Re-) Installed the Intel MyWiFi driver/software to the latest version - no change</li></ul>
<p>An interesting thing I've discovered:<br />
In the time the system tries to catch the IP of the Host in the internet, no Entry (belonging to the Website) appears here:<em><strong>netsh int ipv4 show destinationcache</strong>
</em><br />
Before I've done that, I tried that: <strong><em>nslookup www.microsoft.com</em> </strong>
and the answer came fast with the IP Address, but the entry in <strong><em>destinationcache</em></strong>doesn't appear as far as it comes with nslookup.</p>
<p>What could be the Problem? Which ERROR-Reports do you need?</p>
<p>Could it also be, that the <strong>MyWiFi </strong>of INTEL software changes system settings so in deep that something is damaged in the<strong>registry</strong> /files? It creates an private WLAN around my PC but isn't working properly at everytime...<br />
Belonging to that - could it be that <strong>IPv6 </strong>causes the Problem? In Firefox I disabled that in the config.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thanks a lot!</em> </strong></p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p>Markus from Germany</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it seems that the WLAN connection is running now a little bit better with sometimes fast Host Resolving. I resettet the adapter(s) again with<strong>netsh</strong> but on some Websites it takes much longer (as described ~30s for Host resolving
 only).</p>
<p>What could be the problem?</p>

<p>The last post was just a status quo at that time. <strong>NOW </strong>it's again very<strong>slowly
</strong>in resolving Host IPs from URLs.</p>
<p>But today, after I got home from work where I used Internet Tethering via my WindowsPhone the Websites were loaded very fast - the resolving of the Host IPs was running<strong>trouble-free</strong> .</p>
<p>An interesting notice: When I turn on the <strong>Intel MyWiFi Technology </strong>
the connection is<strong> trouble-free</strong> too! I guess that that software could be the problem...</p>

<p><em><strong>Good day Adam!</strong> </em></p>
<p>I'm glad that I got an answer from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I tried the &nbsp;clean boot and the problem still occurs. But now I'm approximately 100% sure that the problem is triggered by the<strong>My WiFi Technology from INTEL</strong> .</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Because</strong> </span><strong>:</strong><br />
When I turn <strong>ON </strong>that technology with the Intel My WiFi Utility (to create my private Wireless LAN around me), after disabling and enabling my network device to get that Utilty working on my Intel 5100 AGN, the "surfing-speed" and reaction time
 of the Websites is <strong>fast</strong> . After a few minutes (unregulary) something seems to block/slow down the Host Resolving again and I have to turn<strong>OFF</strong> my private WLAN. Now the surfing-speed is again
<strong>fast</strong> . But after a few minutes that problems comes up again. And that procedure I have to do again and again...</p>
<p>I could not imagine what the problem could be exactly.</p>
<p>But could it be helpful to <strong>display </strong>how and where the <strong>
request </strong>of the <strong>Host-IP</strong> is be<strong> routed/tracked</strong> ? Maybe the request is going "through" the Utility of INTEL which isn't running at that moment and in the<strong> other case</strong> &nbsp; the routing is going straight forward
 the systems services but the Utility is blocking the request accidentally.</p>
<p>( A few days ago I tried to deinstall that utility but the problem persits - perhaps, because I couldn't turn on the private WLAN ^^. )</p>
<p>It's complicated...</p>

                    I've been trying to get my microphone working for my computer. it was working before and now it stopped working. and not just this microphone. but any other microphones as well. in every app I've tried to talk to others with. it stats that I need to change
 my privacy settings on my computer. so I did just that and allowed everything I could. but the apps I want to allow my microphone don't show up and the ones that do show up IE: Skype and Xbox app. still say that I need to change my privacy settings, even though
 they are already turned on. I've restarted my computer twice and it still wont fix my problem. please help! I've been trying to fix this for weeks now!

            Hi Chaos.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible fixes to try in sequence.  Even if you've already tried one I'd do it in this order as one step may affect the next.
<br />
<br /> Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br /><a href="https://win10faq.com/fix-microphone-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://win10faq.com/fix-microphone-settings/</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/395296/fix-my-microphone-doesnt-work-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/395296/fix-my-microph...</a>
<br /><a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microphone-problems-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microphone-pr...</a>
<br />
<br />Some report that what worked is turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings.  Restart and then disable Hibernate file to clear it, restart PC again and enable Hibernate again:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hiberna...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My advice is first off go to your recent players and file a complaint on everybody in the lobby.</p>
<p>Second is Clear you Cache in system settings. Try getting back into a game and if that doesn't work then there is no other way.</p>
<p>I am sorry that you have Unfortunately stumbled upon a "Hacker" Lobby but you can't undo what happened to you on your gamertag.</p>

<h2>            .exe files will not open</h2>
                    There was a vrus on my computer, which i dealt with already. But after i scanned and quarantined the virus all my programs stopped running. Anything that was on my taskbar or desktop opens with the run as or run with screen. And when i choose to use windows
 explorer to run it then it opens an error screen saying that the program cant be found. Some help would be greatly appreciated. I am not very computer literate so Im not sure what program is supposed to run these. And my computer cannot find or open the command
 prompt so it cant be used to fix this.

            Are you quite sure you've dealt with the malware completely - it sounds like some parts of it are still active (or its more malware or the malware has corrupted your system files&nbsp;- which ones I'm not sure but we can find out if it's a protected system
 file - there's no one program that covers the symptoms you're experiencing).&nbsp; Do your programs open if you click on the shortcuts in All Programs?<br />
<br />
First, let's make sure your system really is malware-free.&nbsp; What AV program and version are you running on your system?&nbsp;

Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).&nbsp; I realize this is a lot of programs, but you've already been infected and one infection usually means more than one infection
 and no one program checks for everything.<br />
<br />
Normally I would consider a System Restore, but considering the virus I don't want to bring back any part of it that you were actually successful in deleting.&nbsp; Let's check your startup files.&nbsp; D<span>o
 a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
</span>Then let's check your system files.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator
 (you can skip this step if using the disk which you may need to do if your system cannot access the Command Prompt).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a></span><span>.
 Please post them so we can see the details and it may help us with the diagnosis.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span>

    <title>Computer keeps restarting while installing windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laynewoodruff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer keeps restarting while installing windows 10</h2>
                    I've been trying to install windows 10 onto 2 PCs. One being an old dell workstation and the other being an older home computer. I've installed new hard drives and when installing windows 10 from a USB it goes as normal (I've installed windows 10 seven
 or eight times) until the very end, when it finishes installing a prompt comes up saying that the computer needs to restart to continue. When it does restart the whole process restarts (downloading windows 10 that is) and I can't get into windows. I thought
 redoing the download would fix the issue but it persists. I've wiped the hard drives again as well as tried a new USB and the problem still continues. Is there a solution that I'm not seeing? The USB is highest on the boot order as I saw on other threads of
 this so that shouldn't be the issue. Thanks!<br />

            Please check the link below to see if your PCs are compatible with Windows 10.
<br />There is a lot of hardware out there that is not.

            Hi Layne.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The problem there is you're using the old method of setting the boot device in the BIOS Boot Priority list which is not how to install with a flash stick.  It needs to have the proper boot order restored of the hard drive first for a Legacy BIOS, or the WIndows Boot Manager for the modern UEFI firmware which replaced BIOS.
<br />
<br />Use only the BIOS Boot menu key to trigger the flash stick, as a UEFI device if offered:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise the boot order in BIOS will just restart the flash stick install.
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Alright well that's good to know. But I couldn't see anything along those lines online, but I'm probably looking in the wrong places. The Workstation is a dell precision T3500 with a xeon w3530 in it. Then the "home computer" is a dell inspiron 530 with
 a core 2 duo e8400 in it. Thanks!

            Just looked up both of those models and neither are supported for windows 10. <br />This is probably why you can’t get windows 10 installed.<br />I am very sorry. <br />You can always contact dell support to see if there ever will be support for those models.

            Are both computers licensed for Windows 7? 
<br />
<br />Please note that the Software download page does not support OEM product keys if thats what you will be using for verification.
<br />
<br />Step 1: You need to download the install files for Windows 7 if you are reinstalling it on a system where it was previously installed. You can use the following resources:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Windows and Office ISO Download Tool – HeiDoc.net
<br /><a href="http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science...</a>

<br />
<br />Step 2: Make a bootable copy:
<br />

<br />
<br />Step 3: Download any necessary drivers you might need for Windows 7 from the manufacturers website. 
<br />
<br />Step 4: Perform a custom install - see the Windows 7 section of the following article how to do that:

<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

<br />Step 5: how find your product key and reactivate:
<br />
<br />Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />The product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit. It looks like the following:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436622ef-639b-4594-a399-cac030e5fc33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.c...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:
<br />
<br />Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.
<br />
<br />If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.
<br />
<br />If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need to use the product key also.

            Hi Layne, when you start the installation, you changed the boot order to boot from the Installation media, during the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation media at this point

<h2>            Desktop folder is empty, desktop is missing icons but desktop content still exists somewhere.</h2>
                    so, i woke up this morning and had an issue - most of my desktop icons had disappeared. i checked my desktop folder, it's empty. what?. so i went to my steam and tried to create a new desktop icon for a game. error - desktop icon already exists. this makes
 no sense so i did a system restore to yesterday. system restore succesful, desktop icons that were still there took their original position scattered about my desktop and some of the others came back but most of the desktop is empty i'm still missing a ton
 of shortcuts.&nbsp;<br />
I also had multiple background images, the folder was saved in a desktop folder, it's now gone. it won't let me change the background now. when i search it in the taskbar it has the folder and all the images, but when i go to that folders location it says 'empty'
 even though from the taskbar i can open all the images in paint. what the hell is going on and why?&nbsp;

            Hey Mitch.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sounds like it's signed you into a Temporary Account. Sometimes when a Windows or Version Update fails due to a corrupted account it will create a temp one to sign into.
<br />
<br />You should be able to leave the password box blank to sign in to the temp account.  
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Users if you can see your old account with its files intact.  If not check at C:\Windows.old to see if files were archived there during a version install that fails.  
<br />
<br />If so copy the files out externally so they are safe.  
<br />
<br />Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it will start into your account.  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and Sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>.  
<br />To do this you may need to access the Command Prompt from Repair Mode or the booted media:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />From the Built-in Admin account you can try to repair the old account using one of these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-y...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-w...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can try to create a new Local Admininstrator Account to see how it works:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-local-account-in-windows-10/95097c32-40c4-48c0-8f3b-3bcb67afaf7c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>.   
<br />
<br />Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run.  If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old account when ready. in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other Users.  Hide the Built-in Admin account per tutorial.  
<br />
<br />If all else fails then you can try a Reset from the Repair Mode:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />

<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

<p>Just having a look at these new forums. &nbsp;On a few posts I have made, I have noticed that I only have a reply button? Is there another way to quote previous posts? It makes discussion and the forums themselves much duller without that feature. Hope im wrong,

<h2>            User Profile Service Failed to Login Window 7 - Problems with Fix I&#39;ve Tried</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible please someone can help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to log on just now to my laptop running Windows 7 Premium and when I typed in my password on the logon screen&nbsp;it came up with the message "The User Profile Service Failed to Login User."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched online for a solution and found the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Type in Regedit</p>
<p>* Click hkey_local_service</p>
<p>* Select software/microsft/windows nt/current version/profile list</p>
<p>* Rename the file without the BAK ext to .old</p>
<p>* Delete the BAK on the file below</p>
<p>* Change the State on the right hand side to zero</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Login as ADMIN and you should be able to access all the data for all accounts - check using<br />
File Explorer - C:\Users&nbsp;.<br />
<br />
You used method 1 here - check methods 2 and 3 to access all of your account data.<br />
<br />
Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />
temporary profile: "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded"<br />

Hope this helps.

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for getting back to me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've created a new standard account but I can't see it when I go on the C drive User list. Does it have to be created as an Administrator?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry, can I also ask Rob - once Method 2 is complete do I also need to complete Method 3 or will Method 2 have fixed everything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes you have to make it an ADMIN account to see data not in a particular Standard Account.<br />
Admins can see ALL data and Standard can only see data in their specific account. If you are<br />
logged in as ADMIN then you can raise a Standard Account to Admin level if you wish.<br />
<br />
You need to use the methods as needed until your issue is corrected.<br />
