    <title>Lost display while configuring second monitor using HDMI on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost display while configuring second monitor using HDMI on Windows 8 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I am not technologically inclined at all so bare with me while I explain my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day I wanted to display my laptop screen on an alternate monitor using my HDMI cable. I went to settings (where you can change the routing of the display) and changed it to come up on the alternate screen ONLY. Once I did that my laptop screen
 went black (of course) and the alternate monitor went pink and displayed nothing else. I tried making sure that both ends were securely plugged in and nothing changed. I tried another alternate monitor, same issue. I also tried a different HDMI cable hoping
 there was just an issue with the initial one... still nothing. I have no other monitors to try and now my laptop is stuck with a black screen. It does display the "hp" logo for a few seconds on start up but that is all. &nbsp;I have tried hitting f5 around that
 time and directly after to enter safe mode hoping that would change something but no luck. &nbsp;Also removed the battery and replaced it. I am hoping someone knows of a trick I can try to bring my screen back.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello Courtney,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per your description, I understand that you are unable to get any visuals after boot screen on your laptop. I will certainly help you with the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you get any error message/code during Windows startup?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you able to get display on external monitor?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I recommend you to go through the following methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change Project screen settings to setup display on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows + P</strong>, a side bar would appear which says, “<strong>Project</strong>”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You will see multiple options like<strong>, PC screen Only</strong>,
<strong>Duplicate</strong>, <strong>Extend</strong> and <strong>Second screen only</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select one of them at a time to check the display output.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persists,
</span><span>I suggest you to deliberately crash your computer by unplugging the power supply during windows load screen 3 times, you suppose to see recovery screen where you can see options to
 login in safe mode; safe mode with networking or normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>If this doesn’t work please follow below mentioned steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Turn on or restart your computer.<br />
2. Hold down the F8 key before the Windows logo appears. If the computer makes a complaining noise, tap the F8 key repeatedly instead of holding it down.<br />
3. If a Windows logo or “Windows starting” appears, wait until Windows loads. Then restart the computer and try pressing&nbsp;F8 again.<br />
4. Once you are successful, a menu will appear with a number of boot options. Use an arrow key to navigate to “Safe Mode” and press the Enter key.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>If you are
<em>able to login</em> on your Windows please follow below steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows + R, run command box would appear.<br />
2. Enter “msconfig” (without quotes) and push enter.<br />
4. Select the “Boot” tab.<br />
5. In the “Boot options” section, check “Safe boot.” Also, make sure the radio button “Minimal” is selected.<br />
6. Click “OK’.<br />
7. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you get into safe mode please follow steps to perform
<strong>Clean Boot.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to go through the following articles based on Setup of Monitors on Windows 8.1:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue continues then please perform pending Windows Update.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps to install available Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press Windows + C, type
<strong>Windows Update</strong> in the Search box, then click <strong>Windows Update</strong> in the results pane.</span></li><li>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Actually sounds like the Aux drive has a problem. Have you tried using it in another computer?<br />
<br />
Does Windows Explorer work when you are not using the Aux drive in the process?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set<br />
VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft drivers - update those&nbsp;without&nbsp;Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also <br />
update the BIOS&nbsp;and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

Refer to these threads for many more excellent tips however be sure to check <br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e6a2532b-70b2-43f8-94ed-7d30cca20a08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11c2f771-808e-4b69-aa7a-cfa27e73a237" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - especially when using copy/paste and/or drag/drop and often to/from an external USB attached drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.&nbsp; You can always reinstall it again later if needed,
 right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98d9db22-592b-404b-89ea-62dbef73b1d9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!

<p>I would Barrow a friends game first to make sure you can access the content from the GOTY edition.</p>
<p>Some games that have the extra content on in (ie. GOTY, Legends ect...) Need that same exact copy and not a normal version.</p>
<p>Its like installing the game on your xbox, you need the disc in order to start the game.</p>
<p>Same is for some games that have the extra content on that disc. (the disc is used as a key of sorts)</p>
<p>Its to help prevent piracy (people who go online and download the game files and edit them for play on their account)</p>
<p>If it is a DLC then the license is in your Xbox, if it is a seperate add on disc (ie. Shivering Isles ect...) then licenses are copied from the disk onto your hard drive to allow play.</p>
<p>But Games with extra content on the main disc game most of the time (even content was installed on the xbox) will need an exact copy of the game (not a normal copy), so the disc will allow proof of ownership.</p>

<p>That's true for some, Red Dead Redemption for example needs the disc still. The stuff from bethesda, such as Fallout, is DLC you install from the second disc and only needs the main disc for playing purposes.</p>

<h2>            AT Command syntax</h2>
                    
<p>I need to use the AT command to schedule tasks. However, I can't see all the options I can set while using the GUI.</p>
<p>For example, how can I schedule a task to run for 2 hours every 2 minutes?</p>
<p>Is there any command&nbsp;based tool to schedule tasks (better = with more options)? Using VBS or PowerShell is not a problem...</p>

<div>I'm not sure what options you believe may exist that aren't shown when </div>
<div>you type AT /? in a Command Prompt window.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You also can look at </div>
<div><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490866.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490866.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The latter page points out that there is a more powerful scheduling </div>
<div>command available, Schtasks. See </div>
<div><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490996.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490996.aspx</a> (or type</div>
<div>schtasks /? in a Command Prompt window).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>AFAIK, neither AT nor Schtasks has the ability to stop a task that </div>
<div>otherwise would continue to run indefinitely after being started (i.e., </div>
<div>"schedule a task to run for 2 hours"). If you want to do that, you'd</div>
<div>have to schedule something like process.exe </div>
<div>(<a href="http://www.beyondlogic.org/consulting/processutil/processutil.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.beyondlogic.org/consulting/processutil/processutil.htm</a>) or a</div>
<div>similar command line utility.</div>

<p>Here's the complete help and syntax of the at command.</p>
<p>The AT command schedules commands and programs to run on a computer at<br />
a specified time and date. The Schedule service must be running to use<br />
the AT command.</p>
<p>AT [\\computername] [ [id] [/DELETE] | /DELETE [/YES]]<br />
AT [\\computername] time [/INTERACTIVE]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[ /EVERY:date[,...] | /NEXT:date[,...]] "command"</p>
<p>\\computername&nbsp;Specifies a remote computer. Commands are scheduled on the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local computer if this parameter is omitted.</p>
<p>id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is an identification number assigned to a scheduled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command.</p>
<p>/delete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancels a scheduled command. If id is omitted, all the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;scheduled commands on the computer are canceled.</p>
<p>/yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used with cancel all jobs command when no further<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confirmation is desired.</p>
<p>time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies the time when command is to run.</p>
<p>/interactive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows the job to interact with the desktop of the user<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who is logged on at the time the job runs.</p>
<p>/every:date[,...]&nbsp;&nbsp; Runs the command on each specified day(s) of the week or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;month. If date is omitted, the current day of the month<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is assumed.</p>
<p>/next:date[,...]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Runs the specified command on the next occurrence of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day (for example, next Thursday).&nbsp; If date is omitted, the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current day of the month is assumed.</p>
<p>"command"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Windows NT command, or batch program to be run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you want to set a task, say... I want my computer to Open up Cmd.exe once, every monday, at 5:00 P.M.&nbsp;you would do something like this.</p>
<p>AT 17:00 /every:Monday "Run cmd.exe"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Likhitha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be that Windows can't&nbsp;actually create the recovery drive. The complete error message I get is,&nbsp; "We can't create a recovery drive. A problem occurred while creating the recovery drive".&nbsp; The process stops at this point and doesn't even
 give me a chance to connect a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DELL includes with most of their laptops an ability to do a Dell Factory Image Restore which is accessed by hitting F8 a few times before Windows is initiated and it access a partition on the hard drive that restores the mirror image. My hunch is that the&nbsp;DELL
 firmware is protecting its own proprietary process for backing up files and is preventing Windows from&nbsp;creating its&nbsp;own recovery partition because there would likely be a conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. If you have any further insight, please respond back. I went to the DELL website and they&nbsp;want me to buy a new laptop with Windows 10 preinstalled because they haven't done any testing and will not be providing any support for upgrading to Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frank.</p>

            <p>Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have suggested fixes for this problem but the most reliable solution still seems to be to make a Windows 10 installation disk on a USB stick instead - see the&nbsp;procedural&nbsp;guide &amp; links in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 to believe, there might have been other system problems on those users' computers].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are really uncertain about all this then make a Recovery drive <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
without </span>System files and make an installation disk as well - it's the setting of the
<em>Include system files</em> option that seems to cause all the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search this forum for the problem, you will find the suggestions other users have made but I cannot give you any links to these threads - none of the suggested fixes seemed reliable enough to bother making any notes about them.&nbsp; Many Dell &amp; HP computers
 with DFIR partitions also had problems creating Windows 7 <em>System repair disks
</em>and that was never satisfactorily resolved either.</p>

</p><p>I've used the media creation tool to make a USB copy and hopefully I won't need drivers down the road when I need to do the re-install because DELL is not providing drivers for Windows 10 for my model.&nbsp; But if really have to, I guess I can always use the
 DVDs&nbsp;to do a factory reset of Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Dell isn't making any Windows 10 drivers for either of my computers either [Dell Inspiron 9300 from 2005 &amp; Dell Inspiron 1545 from 2010].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did quite a few experiments and have ended up with a mixture of drivers from the Windows 10 installation itself, from Windows Update, from the "Microsoft update catalog" and from Dell [on the 9300, this includes some WinXP versions, some Win7 versions,
 one Vista version].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The 5 year old 1545 works completely.&nbsp; On the 9300 [the 10 year old one], I cannot use Task scheduler to wake the system from sleep or hibernation** and I cannot use the Windows utility
<em>PowerCfg </em>to generate "battery reports" - I have learnt to live with both of these shortcomings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's some guidance on drivers in my post at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/96eddd4e-4b0a-46f1-8c71-96ff380ad272?threadId=03aef37a-f353-4449-89b4-37f417c8a102">
Where to get hardware drivers</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not expect you ever to need to use the original Windows 7 DVD again.&nbsp; Like you, I still have mine but I've transferred&nbsp;it to USB stick [this only takes 10 minutes, if you are interested]&nbsp;because I think I am less likely to break a USB stick than
 I am to crack a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I removed my DFIR partition a few years ago after I'd used the bundled Dell utility "Dell DataSafe Backup Local" to&nbsp;install the DFIR&nbsp;on a USB.&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>** Several other Windows 10 users have reported the same TS wakeup limitation with upgraded computers despite having all the right settings made in TS and it probably reflects some incompatibility&nbsp;in motherboard devices.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>That was good thinking with the drivers. I will keep it in mind if I get to that point.&nbsp; Despite Dell's warnings, I haven't experienced any major loss of functionality so I will continue to use it. I too will probably find minor loss of functionality that
 I should be able to live with.</p>

<p>Hi. I had the same problem with an HP notebook and Windows 10. I found that&nbsp;this issue&nbsp;was related to&nbsp;the setting "enable virtualisation". i.e. this error only occurs on my computer when the virtualisation setting is enabled, and stopped when virtualisation
 is disabled. See how to change this setting in step 3 of the following article: </p>

            Hi Anne
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I would recommend first trying to first recover access to the account you prefer to use. Then delete the other, keeping in mind Microsofts alert on this "Skype is one of a range of consumer services that is accessed through a Microsoft account. It is not possible to separate your Skype profile from your Microsoft account. If you close your Microsoft account, in addition to not being able to sign in to or access Skype, you'll no longer be able to sign in to other Microsoft consumer products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows."
<br />
<br />1. To recover access to your account, please follow the process as described in the links below:
<br />- <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA109/i-ve-forgotten-my-skype-user-name-or-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA109/i-ve-for...</a>

<br />
<br />2. To delete an account

<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<br />I wish you a great day/night :)!

<h2>            WoT Rule &#35;1&#58; The &#38;quot&#59;team&#38;quot&#59; with the MOST idiots, loses the match&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Really.</p>
<p>It's sad, but it's true.</p>
<p>How many matches have you joined where BOTH teams played smart &amp; the match was won by the team that played just a little bit smarter than the other team? (Not many, I wager. These are super rare events in my experience.)</p>
<p>Usually, you have multiple idiots (even at level 10) that CHARGE out &amp; instantly die (don't defend the base, or defend the flanks, etc.)...just to return to the garage with the magic of the "A" button. This prevents them from admitting that they are actually
 GARBAGE players (like they would in a game where they would respawn 30 times or more) with the skill of a Neanderthal man. The result...YOU get a loss &amp; you had almost NO chance to get a WIN.</p>
<p>I often wonder what kind of WIN (or should I say LOSS) percentage they have?</p>

<p>The ONLY exception to rule #1, is a superheroic performance by 1 or more players to counteract the idiots on your team.</p>

<p>GOOD players, you are to be saluted! You had to carry the really GARBAGE players to that elusive WIN!</p>

<p>What's even better is the 'pro' people that rush ahead of everyone, die really quick, and then proceed to turn on their headset crying about how they are not getting support. hey idiot, support was 500 feet behind you but you didn't want it apparently.</p>
<p>But there are some games where most everyone is listening and we all concentrate fire on my spots while holding a flank and we win, flawlessly!</p>

<p>Duke, I am sure we all have many stories about what you mentioned. A simple fix would be to allow bigger squads, three is not enough. If we could have a t least 6-7 in a squad that would make the game a lot better. Overall I like the game.</p>

<p>This game had a chance to play, logically &amp; smart. However,it shot itself in the foot!
</p>
<p>They didn't use any of their guns, though....because they would have had to wait for their circle to shrink &amp; they STILL would have missed the target, "if" it didn't bounce off, 1st.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy it, but for me it's less than 50% enjoyable &amp; only the matches with my friends make it bearable.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p>

<p>Think you nailed it on the head op. &nbsp;seems a very cool game but ruined, not by players, but by matchmaking. &nbsp;almost always stacked one way or other almost as if someone was controlling the outcome beforehand...(wot) &nbsp;</p>
<p>their must be some kind of skill ranking system involved other than what tier your on because you bought your way there rather than earned it. &nbsp;seems everyone has multi tier 10's but very very few have the class 1 rankings, or even more of a miracle, the
 tankers ace badge for any of there tanks.</p>

<p>wanted to restate something. &nbsp;after just playing 12 so matches and being on the losing end and almost same map (komarin) which popped up repeatedly that for as good as game is its equally frustrating and bad. &nbsp;cod problem was lag which hard to fix. &nbsp;wot
 is being put into matches with novices who are more thrilled by the sound of the river than shooting tanks. &nbsp;why are so many french players in the west server? &nbsp;how can so many bad players be matched up against good players REPEATEDLY!!! &nbsp; games is truly broke
 in that aspect. &nbsp;simply put, as it repeats maps to make sure the "quota" is met, i accuse wot of purposely stacking teams with novices to let people get there thrill of victory.
</p>
<p>for those who have no problems good for you you obviously play at the right times and have figured it out when to take advantage of the scrub teams the game is putting together. &nbsp;the quality of teamates im seeing during losing streaks are putting me very
 close to erasing this game from my hard drive.</p>

<p>The "bad experiences" that you experience during play is 100%...INTENTIONAL. They are there to entice you to PAY $ to "fix" the problem.</p>
<p>They (Wargaming) have concluded that ONLY bad experiences provide the impetus for people to spend cash on this pile of a game. Almost NOBODY feels like they NEED to buy anything from these morons when they are on a winning streak. Therefore: bad experiences
 are NECESSARY, in their eyes.</p>
<p>Here's another bit of BAD NEWSs for you...the tier 8 tanks are GAR-BAGE! They are pulled into tier 10 matches (as the "bottom man" to sacrifice to the higher tier tanks), their guns are underpowered (making it difficult to kill ANYTHING), the bullets are
 VERY EXPENSIVE (which makes earning a profit, very tough) &amp; it takes a very LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time to EARN enough XP all the way through to the tier 9 tanks. This is intended to entice you to spend REAL $$$ for their PREMIUM membership. Sadly, tons
 of idiots DO IT!</p>
<p>If you think it's BAD, now....just wait until you buy your 1st tier 8 tank!</p>
<p>(I made it through to tier 9 &nbsp;M-55 just to spite them. I have almost every achievement, for FREE &amp; I have NOT &amp; will NEVER pay them for ANYTHING. That is how I exact my revenge.)</p>
<p>Best of luck to you in your matches!!!</p>

<p>it is a cool game. &nbsp;ive got 3 tier 10's working on 4th. &nbsp;problem is not tanks as tanks are the same for all. &nbsp;problem is quality of players and lopsided teams. &nbsp;people who spawn on one side and drive all the way around map to other side to die without firing
 shots, still going to places only beginners go to but have higher tier tanks than skill to use them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>if they wont use skill then at least use the number of matches a person played or something to more even out teams... &nbsp;if it was baseball it would be akin to playing the new york yankees with the local lilltle league team on your side. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>most games you can tell in the first 30 secs pretty much how its going to go... its really taking the fun out of the game for me... &nbsp;is there really not enough players to use some kind of partial skill based system...</p>

<p>News alert: They don't care about ANYTHING except your $$$. </p>
<p>They ENSURE bad experiences in the hopes that you will decide to buy PREMIUM (or something else) to counter the problem. It really doesn't change the horrible imbalances that are making the game unplayable.</p>
<p>That's why I don't BUY anything. Nothing that they have is really worth owning, because it's all cardboard &amp; styrofoam.</p>
<p>If you can enjoy this tripe, then GOOD for you! &nbsp;It sucks, day-after-day &amp; I have lots of games that are better than this one. Once I max out the achievement points (all for FREE), I'm dumping this in the receptacle where it belongs....guess which one!</p>

<p>at exactly 3pm today started getting demolished by very unskilled teams that just run right into your lines and butt heads. be great but im upgrading a tank and cant do much. &nbsp;these games are over by the 10 min mark. &nbsp;and these red teams would have been
 destroyed by 10 min mark by anything close to a decent team. &nbsp;how can so many lopsided teams be put together in a row.... geography? &nbsp;location? &nbsp;time played? &nbsp;what do they go by?</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business interaction with regular Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having very similar problem like in this post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sfb/regular-skype-user-stuck-in-pending-external/59e1cf96-185a-46a5-9d49-b0aa3e77f5ef</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Skype for Business users cannot add regular Skype users to their contact list. We can search Skype directory, but that is it. In previously mentioned post I did not find any definite answer. So does anyone know what is causing this sort of problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have enabled External Communications in Skype Admin Center (as I mentioned, we can search Skype directory). We have only one Domain also (onmicrosoft.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any recommendations.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ssquirrell,<br />
<br />
To communicate with an external Skype account in Skype for Business, the Skype account should be signed with a Microsoft account. If the Skype user has a custom Microsoft account (one that does not end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com) you
 must format their IM address like this:</span></p>
<p><span>name(example.com )@msn.com<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span></p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as commenter in original link I am trying to add myself as external contact. Here is configuration of my Skype account and clients:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Regular Skype for Macintosh and also Windows. </p>
<p>- Linked with Microsoft using @gmail.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Still after seeing myself in Skype directory using search by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Regular Skype name, </p>
<p>2) Microsoft registered email and </p>
<p>3) your recommendation &lt;skypename&gt;@msn.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see myself as "Presence unknown" or "Presence unknown - External network" in Skype for Business contact list. Plus I do not receive any contact request messages on my regular Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all in all this situation, that I can search Skype Directory, see contacts there and add them to list, but they do not receive request message, is thing that confuses me.</p>

            <p>Hi Ssquirrell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For such a situation, I need to collect your ‘onmicrosoft.com’ domain for further checking. To protect your privacy, I recommend you provide the domain (Skype for Business account) in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
private message</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, for the external communication of the Skype for Business and Skype, please re-confirm both the 2 clients (Skype for Business and Skype) are the newly updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I’d like to confirm whether the issue is related to Skype user. So, you can try applying for another Skype account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and then add the newly applied Skype account with your Skype for Business account to see the result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><b>
</b>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Anti-virus applications are also known to cause these kinds of issues.</p>
<p><b>Disable antivirus software</b></p>

</span></b></p>
<p><b>Important Note:
</b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><span>It's likely that firewall is blocking the program.

How&nbsp;do I remove this old Folder from system &amp; the directory in Windows Explorer?&nbsp; Is this the result of using the Rename command?&nbsp; If so, what other option is available&nbsp;to avoid a long list of empty folders? Pls help.

Have you tried rebooting into Safe Mode and deleting the folder that way?<br />

<h2>            Problem loading games </h2>
                    I've just started having this problem. Forza horizon and Fifa 13 both get stuck on the start up loading screens. When ever I'm signed in on my main account they never load but when I'm signed out Fifa loads up fine (Haven't tried Forza yet). I have also
 tried loading Fifa on another account which also doesn't work. When loading up Fifa while signed out and then signing in on my account when the game has loaded results in my console freezing completely? Any ideas why this is happening and how to fix it? Thanks

    <title>HELP PLS I accidentally turned my external hard drive into windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtisw2  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP PLS I accidentally turned my external hard drive into windows 10 installation disk</h2>
                    <p>I very stupidly formatted a windows installation disk onto my Seagate 1TB external hard drive. I thought I was just innnocently saving a file It now reads as ESB-USB 31GB max space and not the nearly 1TB max space I had on there before this incident for
 which most of that was data which has now vanished and apparently been replaced by just this installation drive and when I click on the drive now it just shows the reinstall disk details and none of my previous files.
<br />
<br />
Quite simply: is the data I lost recoverable? It worries me a lot the max space is now 31GB and not the 1TB previously so does that mean I lost all but 31GB? if it is recoverable? am hoping to speak with someone who perhaps had this issue and if they were able
 to get their lost data back. What did you use? please don't lecture me on the importance of backing up files I GET THAT I am more frantic about getting the files back right now to care about what I should had done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a good free/not free program that can recover files in instances like this? or is it a case of sending it to a data recovery shop which could put me a few hundred out of pocket :( thanks.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

            Hello, I am sorry to hear that you have accidentally formatted your disk. Unfortunately, since your disk has overwritten over some parts of your drive, it is hard to say that your data is recoverable. However, you may try to do so. I can not guarantee that you will get your files back, but you may as well try and get at least some of the files back. Try using a third party software called Recuva File recovery. You can do a quick google search and find the download.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions!       
        </p>

            Hi  CurtisW2 
<br />
<br />Below are two applications that may be able to recover the original 1TB partition and hopefully most of your data from what is now unallocated space. There is no guarantees, but those would be the best option for success . .

<p>yeh thx for the reply. I just don't know what to do as I tried to download 'Recuva' file you mentioned but all it seemed to do after I downloaded it was when installing it just stayed on the '0% installing' for ages and didn't budge. So for some totally
 bizzare reason I can't use that. So fricken typical. I am paranoid of actually doing anythhng with the drive right now for fear or losing anything even moreso making it more unrecoverable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't suppose anyone who has been through this probem themselves has any advice do they on how to retain the lost data? I am tempted to let a professional data recovery lab deal with it even if I will pay out the nose.

<p>Ok thanks for that. I also meant to ask earlier: can I just unplug the affected drive so it can't affected in anyway from this point? I just wanted to work on at least doing what I originally intented to do (reinstsall windows) without worrying about the
 external hard drive issue for now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do with my computer regardless of the external hard drive issue isn't going to affect the problem as long as its unplugged yes?

            Hi CurtisW2
<br />
<br />That hard drive space has been marked as unallocated, so it does not matter whether you leave that connected or disconnect that drive, Windows will not access that space, so no more harm can be done . . .

            Best way to ensure that you get your data back is to contact a data recovery lab. However like I said, some of your files have been overwritten while installing Windows, so some parts are unrecoverable. 
<br />Hope this helps.

<h2>            Windows 10 Family Safety&#58; Trying to set up parental controls, I accidentally have two user accounts for my child.  How do I merge them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Trying to set up parental controls, I accidentally have two user accounts for my child.&nbsp; How do I merge them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been struggling for hours to try to set up parental controls on my PC with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before upgrading to Windows 10, my daughter had her own user set up on my PC with tight controls in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've figured out the only way I can have parental controls is to set up an MS Live account for my daughter (I won't mention how furious this makes me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created an account, logged in to her profile, and tried to log in to her MS Live account from there. &nbsp;I get to the settings window where I can try to connect to a microsoft live account. &nbsp;Enter the login for the account I just created, enter her existing
 user password. The screen then gives me the extremely helpful error message, "Oops. Something went wrong. Whatever it was it was probably our fault Please try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several times, and still get the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I notice there are suddenly 3 user account on my computer - Mine, my daughter's original account, and an account connected to the MS live account I just created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I merge the two accounts into one for my daughter? &nbsp;She has files, pictures, and bookmarks saved in her existing user account she still wants access to, so I don't want to tell her she needs to use the new account without them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
