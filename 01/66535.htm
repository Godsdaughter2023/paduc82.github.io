<h2>            Windows 7 Devices and Printers window hangs on loading</h2>
                    Using windows 7 on standard pc - not upgraded<br />
<br />
using server 2008 r2 upgraded from 2003 recently, therefore adding win 7 pc to domain again<br />
<br />
copied across users profile etc. but for some reason devices and printers windows will not load<br />
<br />
There is a usb printer attached to this pc and I can see that in device manager but only if I select show hidden devices<br />
<br />
when selecting devices and printers windows - nothing shows in window but progress bar crawls across top of screen but even when reaching the end after a considerable period of time - nothing is displayed, no monitor, pc, mouse, keyboard or printers.<br />
<br />
Have tried bluetooth services fix - no joy - tried sfc fix- no joy - tried ms hotfix - no joy.<br />
<br />
Tried creating new user and re-copying profile stuff but same problem.<br />
<br />
Any other options.......???????<br />
<br />
Other users on this pc are unaffected - devices and printers window opens normally with full complement of devices and printers
<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows zoomed in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fraserclark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows zoomed in</h2>
                    <p>A while ago I was playing Star Wars: The Old Republic and it zooms in my laptop's screen and I it usually zooms out but this time it hasn't. I've tried everything to fix it but nothing worked. Just then I plugged my laptop into my T.V using a HDMI cable
 and it zooms out on the T.V and the laptop, but it zooms back in once I remove the cable.</p>
<p><br />
I couldn't upload a decent picture, but you get the point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been really bugging me, and I couldn't find a way to fix it.<br />
<br />
Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Fraser</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, but I tried this the first time it happened. The dropbox just kept closing whenever I tried to adjust it.</p>

When I click on the "1024 x 768" box, it opens up. Then it just closes instantly. A few times its opened and I've been able to actually adjust the slider, but it just keeps going back to the 1024 x 768.</p>

            Do you have a key stuck?&nbsp; Pressing any key would close the popup before you can use it.&nbsp; You might try it in safe mode.&nbsp; Or maybe scan for viruses or malware, because that could also make it impossible to use popup menus.

<h2>            Blue Screen on an i7 processor and 64bit version of Windows 7 Professional</h2>
                    BSOD on an i7 processor and 64bit version of Windows 7 Professional, bought this system hoping that I would be setting myself with a solid system to run a business and with plenty of future in it. Since that time I have had regular Blue Screens of Death
 but have not been able to figure out what is causing them - not that I am particularly any good at resolving these sorts of problems.<br />
<br />
What do I need to supply to get help on this forum?<br />
<br />
System specs are:<br />
<br />
Intel Core i7 2600<br />
Installed RAM 8 GB<br />
Motherboard Z68XP-UD4<br />
OCZ-SOLID3 ATA solid state drive<br />
ST22000DL003-9VT166 ATA hard drive<br />
Graphics Card NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550 Ti<br />
<br />
I have a screen shot I took of one of the recent blue screens if that is of any use...<br />

            <p>None of the above helps.&nbsp; When trying the "Get help with the Windows 10 Start menu" I could not get into Settings.&nbsp; I would get an error message box saying that "ms-settings: The wait operation timed out."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that does work for me so far is right-clicking on the Start button.&nbsp; It does bring up a list of all the items that should be there, just not in the same format.&nbsp; However, my daughter has this same problem on her laptop, but this trick does
 not work on hers.&nbsp; We both developed this same problem about 2-3 days ago.<br />

            <p>I made the mistake of re-booting my laptop.&nbsp; That caused all the icons in my Task Bar to disappear.&nbsp; If I opened up a program by clicking on the Desktop icon, it wouldn't show up in the Task Bar.&nbsp; It was just black.&nbsp; And now right-clicking on the Start Button
 doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wound up doing a System Restore because I remembered that there were some Windows Upgrades that had recently been installed, and that's about when the problems started occurring.&nbsp; Now my Task Bar is back.&nbsp; My Start Button worked a few times, but it's apparently
 gone again.</p>

    <title>using separate administrator account on Windows 10 to avoid encryption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfcohen  say:</h3>
<h2>            using separate administrator account on Windows 10 to avoid encryption malware</h2>
                    <p>Prior to Win 8, I used to have two accounts on my laptop in hopes of avoiding ransom encryption malware: a standard account that I used day-to-day, and an admin account that I logged into only when I was installing software or making other changes that required
 admin privileges. Then I got a new laptop running Windows 10, and it looks like an e-mail account (and possibly a Microsoft account?) is required to set up a new user account on the machine. Not wanting to accidentally lock myself out of my own laptop, I went
 back to a single user account with admin privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past week or so, I know of two different organizations that have gotten hit with CryptoLocker or a similar ransom malware, and it's making me nervous that I'm working on an account with admin privileges. I want to create a new admin account, and then
 change "mine" -&nbsp;<em>i.e.</em>, the one I work on - to a standard user. Once again, I'm getting hung up on something as minuscule as an e-mail address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both a hotmail address and a gmail address that are associated with my MS account. The gmail is set to primary. Can I use the other one (hotmail) as the primary for the admin account, or do I have to create an entirely new e-mail address and MS account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what's the deal with "family accounts"? Should the admin user be part of my family or an "other" user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I create a restore point before I set up the new admin account, or is that foolish since if I'm locked out of the machine I won't be able to restore it anyway? &nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any light you all can shed on this would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you make any recent changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try the methods and check after each method:<br />
<div><strong>Method 1: Run the Microsoft Fixit, to ‘fix the problem with Microsoft Windows Update that is not working’.
</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Temporarily disable the antivirus, firewall and third party startup programs, to avoid the interruption.<br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1: Temporarily disable the Antivirus and Firewall.<br />
</strong><strong>Disclaimer for disabling or uninstalling the Antivirus and Firewall:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks. Turning off Windows
 Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.<br />
<div><strong>Disable Antivirus: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</strong></a><strong>
<br />
</strong><strong>Disable Windows Firewall: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</strong></a><strong>
<br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Once you performed the steps, make sure you ‘Turn on the Firewall’ and re-enable the antivirus to avoid the risk of virus infection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Perform ‘Clean boot’, to disable third party startup programs:
<br />
</strong><strong>Troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><br />
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Once you are done with “clean boot”, please follow <strong>
Step 7 </strong>from the article mentioned above to set the computer to normal startup.
<br />
<div><strong>Step 3: Try to install the update and check.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: If the update does not install automatically, you may try the steps provided in the article below to install the updates.
</strong>The information provided in the article is equally applicable to Vista update error 8007041D:</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Update-error-800f0826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Update-error-800f0826</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Manually try installing the update from Microsoft Download Center.

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access another device as long as it's configured and connected to your network. To check if your second computer will do that, check the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<strong> Network and Sharing</strong>. See the screenshot below on how to:
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25769507-f2e1-43c7-b44d-8e967f72775d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25769507-f2e1-43c7-b44d-8e967f72775d" /></a></li><li>Under <strong>Change sharing options for different network profiles</strong>, make sure that everything is turned on for
<strong>Private</strong>,<strong> Guest or Public</strong>, <strong>Domain (current profile)</strong>, and<strong> All Networks</strong> tab.
</li><li>Click<strong> Save changes</strong> and try to access your second computer.</li></ol>

<p>This could be related to file permission on both devices. To check if your files can be shared with everyone, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>This PC</strong> on the search and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
</li><li>Right-click on the <strong>C: drive</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.
</li><li>Choose <strong>Sharing &gt; A</strong><strong>dvanced Sharing</strong> &gt; <strong>
Permissions</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that it's shared with everyone. See screenshot below: <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4b25c4a-8dc8-460b-a60a-9a52751014ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks for the follow up regarding your concern. Let's recreate the HomeGroup to further troubleshoot the issue. First, your devices need to leave the HomeGroup. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <em>HomeGroup</em> on the search bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Leave the homegroup</strong>, click on <strong>Next</strong>, and select
<strong>Finish</strong>. </li><li><strong>Note</strong>: If you're unsuccessful to leave the HomeGroup, turn off all the PC's on your home network and delete all the contents inside the
<strong>hidden PeerNetworking</strong> located in the folder, <strong>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking</strong>.
</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>

<h3> jack reynolds 2  say:</h3>
<h2>            video not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Envy M4 Windows 10 computer with a Intel HD Graphics 4000 card in it.&nbsp; ON Jan, 12, my windows 10 updated and when it rebooted there was a blue screen with the message "SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" no file name attached.&nbsp; Your system needs
 restarting.&nbsp; After several times getting the same blue screen, I went to another computer (lucky I had another) and did some research.&nbsp; Said it had something to do with the video driver.&nbsp; More research and several attempts to restart and still the BSOD.&nbsp; Finally
 got into the BIOS and was able to restore to a earlier point.&nbsp; Got my computer up and running.&nbsp; Went to plug in my Sabrent USB DH 88 video graphics display adapter and it would not work.&nbsp; OK let's plug the monitor into the vga out and make sure that works.
 NO PROBLEM, worked fine.&nbsp; I have been using the DH88 for several years and even on my windows 10 computer with no problem until after this last update.&nbsp; When I turn on my projector, it shows a blue screen until it receives a signal, at which point it changes
 to what ever the signal is being sent to it.&nbsp; Plug it into my vga port and it changes to my extended desk top.&nbsp; Plug it into the DH 88 and the screen goes black.&nbsp; NOW before you say there is something wrong with the DH88, I did plug it into another computer
 and it worked fine on that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; SO I do not know what MICROSOFT did in this last update,&nbsp; I sure could use some help in getting the DH 88 to work on my computer again.&nbsp; And no I can't just use the vga out because I use multiple monitors with my computer
 at the same time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the steps you have tried to resolve the issue. We appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned the issue started after a Windows update, I would suggest you to try uninstalling the update and check if the issue persists. This will help us identify if the update is causing the issue. The steps to uninstall the update are given below:</p>

    <title>Windows 7 boots to an unresponsive black screen with mouse cursor... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nowg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 boots to an unresponsive black screen with mouse cursor...</h2>
                    <p>Started up the PC one day and it booted to a black screen. I didn't change the configuration in any way, it just happened suddenly.</p>
<p>What it does:</p>
<p>The PC turns on like normal. I get the bios screen. I get the Windows logo screen. Then I get a black screen with a mouse cursor in the middle.
</p>
<p>I can move the mouse, but the buttons don't do anything--left or right click.&nbsp; No keys on the keyboard change the screen. Ctrl+Alt+Del does nothing. Windows key does nothing. Esc does nothing, etc. At this point the only option is to hold down the power
 button and turn it off.</p>
<p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>I tried to start it in safe mode, but the same thing happens. It shows the system files that are loading. The last file it shows loading is Windows/system32/DRIVERS/AtiPcie.sys then it goes to a black screen with a mouse cursor again; only this time it is
 in safe mode resolution so the mouse cursor is larger and not as sharp. Also, no keyboard strokes have any affect just as with normal mode.</p>
<p>It is a Dell Inspiron, so it came with an onboard repair utility. I used the Startup Repair tool, but it found no problems. The diagnostics tools found no issues with the hard drive or any of the other major system components. However, this error came up
 which appears to be related to the multi-card (SD, micro&nbsp;SD, etc.)&nbsp;reader on the front of the PC:</p>
<p>error code 4400:011A<br />
msg:SCSI_1-000 DISK_generic-_SD/MMC - target not ready</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that this is unrelated to the black screen. I unplugged the card reader and still had the same problem. Otherwise, it passes all other tests the onboard diagnostic utility has including, memory tests, fan tests, hard drive tests, etc.</p>
<p>I have not, however, tried a full system restore yet. From what I've read in several forums, many have tried this in similar situations and still had the same problem. Since there are several files I'd rather not lose, I wanted to explore all other avenues.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a repeat question in the forum. Most of the other situations seemed similar, but there was always something they could do that I could not, like press Ctrl+Alt+Del or boot into safe mode or whatever.</p>
<p>Here is as much of the system info that I can gather without having the PC on (not mine, I'm doing this for a friend):</p>
<p>-Dell Inspiron (I think it's a 570)</p>
<p>-OS: Windows 7 Home</p>
<p>-AMD Athlon II X2</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>The issue (black screen) you’re facing could be related to drivers and could be resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware
 or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p><span>To confirm the same, start the Computer in low-resolution video mode. This starts Windows using your current video driver and using low resolution and refresh
 rate settings.<br />
This option is available in Advanced startup options.</span></p>
<p><span>To start you computer in low-resolution video mode, follow the steps below:
<br />
1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
<br />
2. Press and hold the <b>F8</b> key as your computer restarts.<br />
3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight <b>
Enable low-resolution video (640×480)</b>, and then press <b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem doesn't reappear in low-resolution mode, then the issue is driver related. You can resolve this by downloading display card driver from the
 manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and update the chipset, display and graphic drivers to the latest one for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the links below for more details on updating drivers:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for the swift reply and for taking time to help me.</p>
<p>I tried starting the computer in low-res mode, but the same thing happened: the Windows logo comes up, then&nbsp;the black screen with a centered mouse cursor. I can move the cursor, but clicking does nothing and the pressing the keyboard keys doesn't do anything
 either. So there is no confusion, the screen is entirely black, with the exception of the mouse cursor. There is no task bar, no icons, nothing.&nbsp;A completely black screen.</p>
<p>I looked at the link to "Why is my screen black..." and it is not relevant to my situation. All the issues there assume one has some sort of interface with Windows once it boots. Again, I just get the black screen, nothing else. In the link, where people
 have a black screen, all the suggested fixes tell people to click on the task bar, or start in safe mode, or run regedit. I can't do any of those things with the computer in the state that it's in right now.</p>
<p>Do you have a suggestion for what I should try next?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Nowg</p>

<h3> anthonymourgis  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete the finger print data of one person so I may enroll the new employee&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting finger prints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have a Windows 8 platform and recently terminated an employee who had their account setup on both a desktop and laptop.&nbsp; After deleting the account on the desktop, it took me a while to figure out why I could still not log into the system.&nbsp; An hour later,
 the problem was corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To not repeat the process on the laptop, I decided to keep the account and simply rename the account to the new employee taking over.&nbsp; I've changed the passwords, but cannot setup the fingerprint scanner.&nbsp; It says I must get the former enrollee to swipe
 their finger.&nbsp; This employee was terminated and their likelihood of coming back to assist me is slim to none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is:&nbsp; How do I delete the data of one person so I may enroll the new employee?&nbsp; I found one method, but it requires me to delete ALL fingerprint data of ALL users.&nbsp; This is not something I want to do.&nbsp; Please help.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The FingerPrint reader is not really part of Windows.<br />
<br />
You will need to work with the System Maker's Support who is responsible for both the<br />
hardware and the driver/security software for the fingerprint reader. If they&nbsp;have forums<br />
check in those as well.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>&nbsp;The card 'died' and I replaced it with a GT520, 1 Gb,&nbsp;which has all the latest drivers ;160mb download!

            As you have not listed attempted fixes suggested on the EA site,<br />
&nbsp;I'll start at the top.<br />
Are other games running properly ?<br />
Are you using an auto-update function ? Does the game play if you don't let it update ? Did you re-install the game because it would no longer run after you<br />
changed cards ?<br />
Have you tried downloading the patch and installing it manually&nbsp; ?<br />
<br />
When the 8800GT died were you having the same symptoms as now ?<br />
Did you get you drivers from the Nivida Web site, and uninstall the previous drivers and install the new drivers manually ?
<br />
Is your game on disk or a download from EA or Steam ?<br />
<br />
Compatibility mode is no use in this instance.<br />

            <div>Thanks for your very prompt response.</div>
<div>I’ll answer the answers;</div>
<div>1. Yes; my other games (Far Cry 1 and 2, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Crysis 2 and so forth)are running OK.</div>
<div>2. The game automatically loads an ‘updater’ and then freezes my PC, requiring the ‘hard reset’ I mentioned.I don’t see (know!) how I can prevent the updater from operating.</div>
<div>3. Yes, I did reinstall the game after the card change (twice! after running ‘repair’ without success)</div>
<div>4.The ‘patch’ you mention is, I believe the ‘updater’ which freezes the PC so I have not had the opportunity to ‘manually’ install it.</div>
<div>5. The game was happy to run with the 8800 GT. That card expired while running Crysis 2.</div>
<div>6. Updated Nvidia drivers came direct from their site. In fact the new (Gt520 silent) card automatically downloaded them (about 160mb I think).</div>
<div>Interestingly I just this minute looked at my Control Panel and there are two 301.42 drivers shown. One is entitled ‘3D Vision Controller Driver’ and the other is called ‘3D Vision Driver’. They share the same date. There is also a separate ‘Nvidia Graphics
 Driver 301.42’ (sorry I can’t just copy the page and show it to you) </div>
<div>Have I perhaps got three drivers all conflicting do you suppose?</div>
<div>I do not recall uninstalling any graphics driver when I installed the new graphics card. And in fact the card was installed in the PC in May 2012 ,while all those aforementioned drivers are dated 27 July 2012.</div>
<div>7. The game is on disc and on re-installation it pointed me to the Origin/ EA site which I dutifully installed.
<div>You mention Steam. That too is installed on my PC (in fact I have bought, from Steam, my first downloaded game , Sniper Elite V2, this week and it has installed and plays OK) I have used Steam to check the validity of my Graphics Drivers in the past and
 suspect that the 27 July installation was a result of the Steam referral to Nvidia.</div>
<div>Hope that will give some further ‘grist’ for your ‘mill’. and I look forward to any further thoughts you may have on how I can resolve the problem.</div>
<div>Thanks, once again, for your time and input.</div>
<div>Kind regards</div>

            Nice detailed post Alan - ( a rare occurrence)<br />
<br />
<br />
While there may be other issues&nbsp; it would be best to get a clean start with the drivers. Having several installs in not best practice.<br />
Uninstall all Nvidia graphics drivers components including Physx, 3D ,<br />
Nvidia HD Audio, and Nvidia updater. <br />
After rebooting reinstall the drivers and use the 'custom' install option. Only install what you use. The drivers and PhysX&nbsp; may be all you need.
<br />
Personally, I only do manual install of drivers after downloading from the Nvidia
<br />
Web site (still using the 296.10),&nbsp; so I don't install the Nvidia updater either.<br />
Only use WHQL (finished) drivers (BETA are still being tested), and close all<br />
other apps and browsers while uninstalling and installing drivers.<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here - NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a>
<br />
<br />
If you don't recall installing drivers the updater may be to blame. Also setup<br />
Windows Updates so it does not automatically download and install updates<br />
or it may do a driver install behind your back as well. The same applies to Steam, or any other 'automatic' driver installer -
<br />
<br />
There is a possibility your Anti-Virus, or Firewall is conflicting with the update.
<br />
Try disabling your AV temporarily while the update is in progress.<br />
If you run from Clean Boot you may find something else is conflicting with the<br />
games update.<br />

Have a look at the link below, and maybe post a thread on the games forums<br />
if this does not help.<br />

Dutifully installed Origins did you ? Origin is EA's &nbsp; Steam wannabe.<br />
It is required for Battlefield 3, but I was not aware that it is required for MOH.
<br />
If Origin is not required for MOH&nbsp; you may avoid further complications by uninstalling it (unless it has something you like) until EA demands that<br />
you use it. <br />

<h2>            Xbox Live Family Sharing Plans - Ideas</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, <span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I play Xbox all day when I'm not working and so does my family, and up until recently we shared my Xbox one console for gold and other such services, but now I bought everyone their own consoles and I have to pay for their gold and re buy games that they
 love to play that I bought digitally on my gamertag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what I'm asking is that there should be a family plan that either allows&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Family bundle of gold, one payment for the whole family.</p>
<p>-Family sharing of gold and games of adult head of family sharing, only share through family and not for the 3/year deal.</p>
<p>If either of those could happen, I'd greatly appreciate it and will continue to support and encourage more years of Xbox, not saying I won't now but, be here for the people and not about profit, that'll come when the people are happy.</p>

            <p>Movie Maker can generate videos in one of two aspect ratios (Widescreen 16:9 and Standard 4:3). This is done from the&nbsp;<strong>Project</strong> tab and you click on the desired aspect ratio for your project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this only manages the final output. It has no effect on your source files. It sounds like you have 4:3 source files or files that otherwise are not 16:9 (say with vertical video). There is no capability within Movie Maker to stretch the video horizontally
 to fit into widescreen. Instead you'll see your video with black bars on the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movie Maker is aiming to keep &nbsp;your original aspect ratio so that you don't end up stretching things horizontally making things appear squat and fat. I understand some people may be okay with that, but Movie Maker doesn't let you do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only thing you can do is film your original footage in the desired aspect ratio (16:9) to begin with. Set your project to match and you should have no back bars.</p>

<h2>            Skype Meetings - &#34;Join Skype Meeting&#34; changing font to Wingdings</h2>
                    <p>My company uses Skype for Business to schedule Skype meetings within the company. When a user sends out a meeting/calendar invite, it originally sends with a link to the meeting with Hyperlink: "Join Skype Meeting". We are finding however, that when someone
 views the meeting within their calendar (regardless of whether or not they have accepted yet), the font for this Hyperlink changes to Wingdings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not do this for all users, but for most. The person sending the invite will still see the font in normal Calibri font, however the person receiving the invite sees it in Wingdings. We have tested this with Mac (El Cap) and Windows (10), but cannot
 determine what is causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this issue/know a solution?</p>

            Hi ThomasWright8 ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. To Add a Contact in Android
<br />Tap Contacts button at bottom &gt; Tap person icon with + sign &gt; On next screen
<br />A. You can search for a person using Skype Name, Mail ID, Phone number or full name
<br />B. Invite to Skype
<br />C. Add a Phone number
<br />
<br />2. Modify a Contact
<br />Long tap on a contact &gt; Edit Contact
<br />
<br />3. How to contact them using Skype
<br />In Contacts view, tap on a person to open conversation view &gt; Type a message even a simple Hello will do good. This acts as a request to connect. Once they respond, you can start chatting with them.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<div>No I am not part of a family settings with this laptop. At first, I had used a previous gmail account that had family settings. So once the box popped up, I &nbsp;created a new gmail account that is separate from anyone else in my household and opened
 a new Microsoft account as well. &nbsp;Then I switched this new account as the administrator and &nbsp;deleted the other &nbsp;account - and it still will not allow me to open google without permission. I have installed and uninstalled Google Chrome and restarted my laptop
 several times. I ask have read about every forum out there, but still cannot get this working. It is very frustrating - I do not understand why I am being blocked from using Google Chrome when I have not even initiated family settings with this account.&nbsp;</div>

I'm having the same problem but when I unadded myself from my "family" nothing happened and it is still prompting me to ask permission to use any third party browser.&nbsp; I followed all the&nbsp;steps Microsoft provides.&nbsp; When I click "ask by email" it tells me there's
 an error.&nbsp; This is probably because I'm not a part of a family.&nbsp; Please help me with this because I'm really starting to become annoyed.

<p>Hi Julian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue regarding the permission when you're trying to use the different browser is because of the settings on
<strong>Family and Safety.</strong> To resolve your concern, we suggest that you check if the account that you are using is already removed to the
<strong>Family list. </strong>To remove your account to the <strong>Family</strong>, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use the <strong>Adult account </strong>to log in using this <strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account?refd=login.live.com&amp;destrt=home-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Family and Safety Features">link.</a></strong></li><li>Click on the <strong>Family tab</strong>.</li><li>On the account that you want to remove, click <strong>More &gt; Remove from family.</strong></li><li>Then click <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the suggestion works for you.</p>

<p>Hi Laurie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be needing a bit more information to help you better. Do you recall any changes made on your end prior to this behavior? To clarify, have you tried installing all necessary updates? Have you tried to reset your camera app? Have you tried running the
 app troubleshooter?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Bugs with Windows 10 boot&#47;startup screen. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bugs with Windows 10 boot&#47;startup screen.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">This isn't really anything serious, but to me it's a bit annoying. When it boots, it first shows the blue windows logo. Then the screen turns black for like 5 seconds.
 Next, a grey screen shows up for like half a second then the sign in screen page appears. After that, rather than showing a smooth transition to the desktop, it does this micro stutter and just cuts to the desktop. I don't know if there's a way to actually
 show what's happening to me on here since the whole boot process is just a mess. I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem. I did a clean install of my graphic drivers and the command prompt thing but it still persists. I'm not sure if I should a full clean
 install just to solve this. Does anyone have a fix?</span>

    <title>What Dot Matrix or Impact Printers will work with Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flak88  say:</h3>
<h2>            What Dot Matrix or Impact Printers will work with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have Quickbooks and have just been FORCED to update to Window 10 from XP by the QB newest version. We have over 3000 tractor feed checks to use up... 3 years worth. So we want to continue to use these printers. We are having a lot of trouble finding any
 that install on Win10 easily. All the queries about "dot matrix" and "Impact" here seem to show it's an Olympic class excersize in gymnastics. Considering how important these printers are to businesses and banks around the world, we are very surprised by the
 non-support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried to find working drivers for the Panasonic KX-P1124/2123/1091, Epson LQ-1010 and Citizen GSX-190 that were in storage. So far, only junk, phishing and spyware (and thank you to Spybot and AVG for protection!!). We are also unhappy with the ADD
 PRINTER list for manual install. Some places say we need to use Epson FX or LQ drivers for non-Epson printers. But the Win10 Epson list is cryptic: "ESP/P Mono 1 V4 Class Driver"? What the ... is that??? It's not on the Epson site. We tried the entire list
 and the results are all gibberish in the top 1-2 lines, full page advance and 1-2 lines, advance, 1-2 lines.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are NOT using USB. We are using LPT 1 and the printer worked perfectly as on ECP under WinXP. A suggestion was to set BIOS for LPT 1 to Regular or Unidirectional. Did that, no help. Another was to set the Spooler to RAW (not EMF). Uhhh... How? Can't find
 any Win10 spooler options, unlike in XP (which was set to the default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what dot matrix impact printers will work properly with Win10 and Quickbooks? With minimal contortions? Are there any NEW or OLD ones? Is there a compatibility list? PLEASE discuss your solutions here.</p>

            <p>Ok I've experimented some... in the BIOS, LPT1 was set to "regular" for the tests below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Epson LQ-1010 (24 pin) wouldn't work with any "ESC/P Standard (x) V4 Class" drivers" but the "ESC/P V4 Class" driver sort of worked. It printed nicely, shifted 3 inches to the right. Also "@EJL 1284.4 (line 1), @EJL (line 2) printed in the far upper
 left corner on every page I tried to print, including the Windows Test Page. This also moved the top margin of the text I did want down an inch. Lastly, on all pages tested, a "1" was printed in the middle of the page in what would've been in the bottom margin
 if not for the 1' top margin shift, which is actually the top of the 2nd sheet of paper. I didn't ask for this page number to be printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Panasonic KX-P2123 (24 pin) didn't work on any Epson driver. It didn't work with the Generic driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The KX-P1124 (24 pin) worked with the "Epson ESC/P 9pin V4 Class" driver, but print was light, as if in 9 pin draft mode. It also printed the "@EJL 1284.4 (line 1), @EJL (line 2) and the page number, as described above. However, the "Generic/Text Only" driver
 did print correctly, but as if draft mode with NO formatting at all (the letters were font Arial 20). But the "@EJL 1284.4 (line 1), @EJL (line 2) and page number were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't tried the Citizen yet.</p>

            <p>I enabled ECP in BIOS, returned to the&nbsp;"Epson ESC/P 9pin V4 Class" driver and Windows test page came up the same, but no page number. The stuff in upper corner still appears. I also sometimes notice the upper corner print includes "U" (line 3) and "CEcHH"

            <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Reporting success!!</strong></span> We bought a (much) newer impact dot matrix printer. Installed the Okidata ML420 after calling the company by phone and being assured that the printer was supported on Win
 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The install was not without incident. The ML420 did fine for test pages and txt, rtf, doc printing. However, it didn't print tractor feed checks at all. Intuit/Quickbooks support didn't get us anywhere (this was the program that needed the checks to print)
 after an hour on the phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Okidata had the fix.</strong></span> They almost immediately figured the Win 10 driver for the printer was faulty. They directed us to go to the printer install window and download the most recent printer drivers.
 This done, they directed us to find the Epson FX Series 1 (80) driver and install that. After that made sure we were using the USB port connection, not the LPT1 port. Test.... It worked perfectly for everything!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Late note: see below for exact details on this procedure which I confirmed 11/19/2016]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I wonder if such would work with our old Panasonic printers, even using LPT ports. Have alot of ink cartridges left.</p>

            <p>I think I was fairly precise as to what were the problems with installing the dot matrix printers we had in the posts above. But if I must spell it out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;USELESS - FAULTY DRIVERS INSTALLED IN WIN 10 FOR DOT MATRIX/IMPACT PRINTERS OF ALL TYPES, OLD AND NEW.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;INEFFECTIVE AND FAULTY P-N-P RECOGNITION OF DOT MATRIX/IMPACT PRINTERS,... LPT OR USB.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;CONFUSING OR USELESS LABELING OF WIN 10 ON DRIVERS THAT DO EXIST. ("ESP/P Mono 1 V4 Class Driver"? What the ... is that???)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;NO SUGGESTION IN WIN 10 TO FIND UPDATED DRIVERS AND HOW TO DO IT. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>WIN 10 IS NOT A "SMART" OS.</strong></span></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THE WINDOWS HELP/TROUBLESHOOTER WAS NOT VERY HELPFUL.... AS IT HAS BEEN FOR GENERATIONS.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;CONFUSING OR MISSING INFO IN WIN 10 (AND AT MS SITES) ON WHAT WOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HELP ONLINE BY ALL REPUTABLE SOURCES IS MISSING, CONFUSING OR USELESS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: WinXP was/is almost happy to live with any printer made up to 2015. It's driver list was extensive and understandable and automatically updated. If not for Quick Books required OS update, we would still be happy with XP and saved $680 and several
 days work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, we had no error codes or notices when using older printers mentioned above. All attempts either didn't print anything or printed gibberish. All MS help sites had NOTHING to get us going!! I searched 12 hours... nearly 150 links, by the Firefox history
 count. I deduced by myself that finding a Win 10 certified impact printer would be the solution, if they existed. The Okidata brand was used by banks so it was our best choice. Okidata confirmed this deduction by phone call. We bought their printer and when
 the install went south, a perfect solution was given quickly by Okidata, as noted above. ALL difficulties were directly attributable to Win 10 itself.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I would suggest you to install the drivers using updates and check if that helps."</em></p>
<p>Considering we had solved our problem 100% before your reply, why should I try to do it all over again? I wrote my solution for others to profit by. We are happy with Okidata for understanding our 1st call query about what was wrong. They employ SMART people
 there who know what business people's problems are and how to solve them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now well over a month and the solution is still good. Since I spent those days on this issue, we sent the old printers to our obsolete parts pile. If you want to solve the driver problem, more power to ya. Send a dozen pre-paid shipping boxes to us
 and we'll send you all our old printers to have fun with.</p>

            <p>I was able to get a Panasonic KX-P2124 to work with Windows 10 recently under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1 - The computer was upgraded from Windows 7 and previously had the printer driver installed.</p>
<p>2 - The printer is connected using an IoGear USB to Parallel printer converter (GUC1284B).</p>
<p>Basically, I told Windows 10 to add a printer, and it didn't find anything.</p>
<p>Then I clicked on "The printer that I want isn't listed"</p>
<p>Then in the new window, I selected "Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings"</p>
<p>I selected the port associated with the USB converted (USB001)</p>
<p>The printer was listed in the available printers, possibly left from Windows 7.</p>
<p>A test print worked fine as has normal printing.</p>

            <p>I just went over the steps again to be sure. It's a bit of a trail (WHY, MS?). Here's how we got in the missing drivers and updated any older ones:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel or Printers. If Control Panel, select "Printers and Devices". A window for them appears with all these current devices shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select "Add a printer" in upper left region of window. A new "Add printer" window appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "Add a printer" window look under the search window for "My printer is not listed" and select it. Do this ignoring the fact Windows is now searching for devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A window appears saying "Find a printer by other options". Select "Add a local printer or a network printer with manual settings" and click "Next" in lower right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A window to select the printer port appears. We needed the USB port and it's all the way down the list beside "Use an existing port". You choose your appropriate port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A manual search "Install the printer driver" window appears. Ignore device list for now and select "Windows Update" button under the device list. This should update your PC to hold all the drivers Windows 10 has NOT auto included. You'll wait 5-10 minutes
 for it depending on speed of PC and connection... go make coffee... all selections in this window will be blank or grey till it's done. Don't close the window till the updated selections return!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[NOTE TO MICROSOFT: WHY WASN'T IT OFFERED SOONER AND MORE EASILY, HMMMM?? A "manual driver search" button could've been put on the FIRST "Add printer" window and all would be done SO much more quickly. Make the port selection in the top half of the window
 and it's perfect on ONE PAGE.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When the update completes you can now select the manufacturer and find the driver you need. (We needed the "Epson FX Series 1 (80)" driver according to Okidata.) Click on the right one and click "Next" in lower right. This should get you to the promised
 land. When installed the new icon will show in the Printers list. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We then set it as the default and that sealed the deal for our QB to see it too (but may have to restart QB to see it though). Test print was good except for setting QB print alignment in that program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If bad results try another driver. HOWEVER, You have to wait for the looonnnggg driver update again though. I just tried it twice and all the new drivers have disappeared each time. I DECLARE A KLUDGE!!! (and I don't use this fine old term lightly here)
 WHO DESIGNED THE MANUAL DRIVER SYSTEM??!! Once in, they should stay in!</p>

                    <p>Microsoft drove me crazy with notices to upgrade to windows 10 and now I can't log in to the pc only on one account. I do not know how to do all those fixes that people are putting on this site. Now I have to go and bring my pc to a computer repair shop
 and pay $$$$ I get it fixed.&nbsp; Next computer WILL not have a Windows OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for this big head ache Microsoft&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Mr Bill </p>
<p>Why don't you spend some of our money here on a program to fix this ongoing problem.&nbsp;

            Hello<br />
<br />
I came across your reply and I have a similar problem. For the last week or so Windows Live Mail has not been working. When I Sync I get the following message:<br />
<br />
Unable to send or receive messages for the Live.co (oldman79) account. Signing in to Windows Live ID failed because the service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.<br />
<br />
Server Error: 0x800488FE<br />
Server: 'http://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/Sync.aspx'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800488FE<br />
<br />
I get a similar message when I try to sign on, and also when I try to sign on to Messenger. I do not use Hotmail. I suspect that I am not getting the right message.<br />
<br />
So far I have disabled Widows Firewall and AVG anti-virus to no effect.<br />
<br />
I have also uninstalled Mail and installed another downloaded version (but I still have my original emails!). I still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Anything you can suggest will be extremely helpful. Thanks.<br />
