<h2>            Tap-to-click doesn&#39;t work after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I m using HP Pavilion DV6. I just upgraded OS from windows 7 to windows 10. Left click key on touchpad is working so does the right click. But tapping doesn't work. I checked in touchpad driver settings, tapping is enabled. But still it doesn't work. before
 installing windows 10 it was working fine with windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80070057 when copying one folder of files into another. solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. As i said in the title, I keep getting this error. To summarize, I payed for and downloaded these sounds that Im trying to upload onto a music software called Reaper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This downloaded a zip folder for the sounds which Im trying to extract into/copy into another folder in the reaper files. all im trying to do is extract and copy these sound folders into a program folder for reaper but everytime I do it gives me "Error 0x80070057:
 The parameter is incorrect".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the issue? I scanned my computer and there seems to be nothing wrong with it.</p>

            <p>Presumably the program folder for this software is in C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)?</p>
<p>If so then you need Administrative Privileges to add files manually to that location.</p>
<p>Does your software have the function to import files, or to use files in a different location?</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor and Office Insider for Android. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You can find where your images are in collections in File explorer itself.
<br />
<br />OneDrive is now backed directly into File Explorer, so you don't have to go hunting for your online files.
<br />
<br />Your OneDrive files will show up in File Explorer after you sync them to your PC:
<br />
<br />1. Go to the right side of the taskbar and right-click (or press and hold) the OneDrive  icon. If you don’t see it there, you might need to select the Show hidden icons arrow first.
<br />
<br />2. Select Settings, go to the Account tab, and then select Choose folders.
<br />
<br />3. Select the Sync all files and folders in my OneDrive check box, then OK.
<br />
<br />4. Open File Explorer and check to see if your OneDrive files are there. 
<br />
<br />You can share the files to another One Drive folder.

<h2>            Bought a game on Xbox store although it wont download on my xbox</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought Outlast: Bundle of Terror (Xbox one edition) on the Xbox store on my computer. When i finished the purchase said that I was done and that it should install on my Xbox and the exact quote was:</p>
<p>" All done! Thanks for purchasing.</p>
<p>When you sign in on your Xbox One, you'll find this and anything else you've installed in
<strong>My games and apps.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This will automatically install on your home Xbox. If your Xbox is on or is set to Instant-on, automatic updates and purchases are on, and it has enough space, it'll start to download. If you'd like to change your home Xbox, on the console,
 go to <strong>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; My home Xbox.</strong> To change your power options, go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Power mode &amp; startup. </strong>"</p>
<p>My Xbox was on at the time and it already has the power option of Instant-on. I have "automatic updates and purchases are on" already on. I have enough space on my Xbox to download the game and it has already been set to be my home Xbox. (as well all the
 Xbox live services were up at the time and I have signed in and out multiple times as well as giving my Xbox regular and hard reboots. I am also signed into the same account on my Xbox as i was when I bought the game)</p>
<p>I am not sure if I missed anything or looking over something, but if anyone could help me that would be great! Thanks for taking the time to read my post.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello MaxParadox,</p>
<p>Go to My Games &amp; Apps, signed in as the profile which bought the game, and scroll to the far right until you see a section called Ready to Install. It's a grey pane; you may need to let it sit for a few minutes to let it populate with content.</p>
<p>Once it populates, you should see the contents of the Outlast bundle there. Simply hit A to download.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>Hi maxen,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my post although your advice didn't seem to work. I spent all of my time on the "my games &amp; apps" page waiting for the "ready to install" column to pop up with the outlast bundle pack although it never did. At this time
 i spent 1 hour and 15 min. which adds onto the other few hours that i spent earlier figuring out how to download the game onto my console. Although thank you for trying to help overall and would you possibly know how to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi maxen (or anyone else helping/reading),</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help although I figured out the problem! Since I currently live in a different continent then the US I set my Xbox to be in the region I was currently living in although when I bought the game it was on the US Xbox website. So
 I then changed my Xbox's region to be in the US and then it showed up in the "ready to install" column. Although thank you for taking your time to help me with my problem and I hope you have a great day!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Is there a verification system on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all! Recently I've noticed that some players have had "Verified" and then a tick next to it in their display name on my Xbox One friends list so this has brought me to wonder, is this verification a real thing that I can enlist my account for or is
 it just a silly trend that people are doing to make themselves look official?</p>

            Hi Thomas.
<br />
<br />Your activation error is saying that you are using the key, which are not valid.
<br />
<br />This sounds like you are using enterprise activation key, which can not be used for simple user, this is only for organisations.
<br />
<br />We have only one moveable activation key in keys if you have the box windows 10 version.
<br />
<br />In all other scenario is buy a new licence.

            Hello ThomasAlison
<br />
<br />For Activation Issue, first you have to know what kind of License you have with Windows 10
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-re-install-windows-10-without-a-product-key/523e6231-88bf-4764-8235-412f2bfc257e">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Now, if you have Activation Code from an old PC that belongs to you and Windows was pre-installed on it, you could not transfer the License to affected PC.
<br />
<br />If you already have checked everything on the web and still no have a solution you can call or live chat with an Official Agent Microsoft Support
<br />
<br />- I share you the references:

<p>Something I learned when buying a second hand PC with Win7 a few years ago is make sure to reboot the machine.</p>
<p>I got caught out by viewing it coming back from sleep/hibernate, so 'this Windows is not genuine' didn't pop up,</p>
<p>as it would when rebooting.</p>
<p>The desktop background also does not load when rebooting a non-genuine copy of Windows. I was lucky to have got the
</p>
<p>machine a good enough price to compensate for having to buy a new Win7 license key though.</p>
<p>.</p>

            Hi Thomas,
<br />
<br />It is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis or it is a cracked version of Windows
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

    <title>How can I register with SmartScreen as a &#34;commonly downloaded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cameronpeters  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I register with SmartScreen as a &#34;commonly downloaded program&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    We are a member of the BizSpark program, and we develop Windows desktop software.<br />
<br />
We've recently completed our first beta, and we're getting ready to make it available for download via CacheFly.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we download our setup file, we get a message "this is not a commonly downloaded program", etc, etc, which will mean that our customers will need to go through extra steps to get it to install.<br />
<br />
We've gone to all the trouble of getting a digital certificate and digitally signing the program, but we still get a big warning message from SmartScreen.&nbsp; Is there some way to register our product with SmartScreen so that it's easier for our customers to install
 it without the warnings?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

    <title>Removing Windows Mail contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bjcreek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing Windows Mail contacts</h2>
                    
<p>I've had ongoing problems with auto-complete in Windows Mail.&nbsp; One of my contacts has a new address.&nbsp; When I begin to type in the name, Mail completes the entry with the correct new address.&nbsp; But when I hit enter, or tab, it also adds in the old incorrect
 address.&nbsp; I don't mean suggests it.&nbsp; I mean adds it in to be used, even though the old address is never in the auto-complete list.&nbsp; Appears out of nowere.</p>
<p>I went into regedit.exe, found the auto-complete entries, and double-clicked each line of code until I found the two addresses for the contact.&nbsp; The new one, which should be there, and the old one I had supposedly deleted.&nbsp; I deleted both of them, intending
 to start over, exited the editor, re-started my computer, and started a new email.&nbsp; No good.&nbsp; The old incorrect address was added in, just as before, although as before it didn't appear in the auto-complete list.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            The auto-complete application holds the LAST 29 contacts you had used. The list will get refurnbished as you e-mail to more different contacts. Eventually the one you don't use will get phased out.<br />
But if you don't want to wait, you can clear out the entire auto-complete list and start fresh.<br />
Here is the tutorial :<br />
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/245/1/How-to-clear-the-email-auto-complete-entries-in-Windows-Mail.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/245/1/How-to-clear-the-email-auto-complete-entries-in-Windows-Mail.html</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Excerpt....<br />
<br />
Deleting all the email auto-complete entries
<p>To clear all the email auto-complete entries, you may delete the Recently Used Addresses key itself. Use these steps:</p>
<p>Click Start, type the following command and press <strong>{ENTER}</strong></p>
<p>cmd /k reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows Mail\Recently Used Addresses" /f</p>
<p>Type <strong>EXIT</strong> to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>Go open your Windows Mail, see if you get anything when you type a letter in the To field. There should be no list offered.</p>

<h2>            IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL - Computer freezes and black screens</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>original title:&nbsp;Blue screen with IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, random freezes,random restarts, screen turning black and being unresponsive but fan is heard still working in the computer.</p>
<p>Hey, i have been having trouble with my computer. My computer is the Gateway LX6810-01. Recently my computer would randomly freeze,restart or go to the blue screen with the IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL and then quickly restart after about a couple of minutes from
 starting my computer. After this happen, i would restart my computer and it would work fine for the day. Next day, same thing. Then it got worse. Slowly i would have to do more restarts and mess around a bit more. The blue screen stopped restarting right away,
 allowing me to look at the numbers and stuff.The problems then changed. Going from freezes and random restarts, my computer screen will turn black and will not work. My computer fan could be heard but nothing would happen. Now my computer will refuse to work
 somedays and will not even start up. IF im lucky my computer will give me the option to do a system restore, which after restoring will fix my computer for day. I have not done any system upgrades or installations.</p>
<p>Info before problems occured: I havent been doing much before this happened. The only major thing i could think of was i started to play games such as L4D2 and started to keep them lowered and leave them there for long periods of time while i went to play
 other games. I know this was very stupid of me, but i couldnt save the game and i didnt wanna lose my data until i finished the campign. I know this is a poor excuse but im just trying to justify myself.</p>
<p>Past problems: People have told me that my model of computer has overheating issues and has a cheap fan installed. Ive only had 2 past problems. One was it was overhating and i simply moved it to a less cramped space. The next problem was it was overheating
 again. This time i took a brush and went inside the fan and tried to get some dust out. I got a giant clump of dust in there. i took it out and it seems like that fixed the problem.</p>
<p>General Info: things i thought might be helpful for finding a soulution to my problem. I used to have lots of startup items. Things such as xfire,skype to utorrent. I have Norton security which freaks out at me with outdated stuff after i have done a system
 restore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things i have done: I have tried blowing out dust from my computer. I have also tried different virus scanners such as maleware bytes. To my best knowledge this isnt a virus. I have taken it to Geek squad. The person put in a disk and before he could do
 much, my computer restarted. He said it was a failing Motherboard. I brought it to a local computer store. They opened my computer and looked for burnt stuff and smelled my computer. They wanted me to pay for a dignois which takes 2weeks. I decided not to
 do it yet. I then called gateway and they wanted me to pay $125 to talk to someone. I refused this because i doubt talking will fix my computer seeing how i can barely start it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My take on the problem: With all the symptoms and error messages i have gotten, i do not think it is a virus. I think something is corrupted in my computer. Recently a system restore gave me a message "A recent driver installation or upgrade may be preventing
 the system from starting" Error Code 0x0. This combined with the error code from the blue screen makes me think its a corrupted driver, but im not sure. Another thing is that i have been having a ant problem. I doubt this is it but im listing all possible
 causes of problems. Could the ants crawl in and mess with something? I doubt ants like to eat wire but idk. Another thing is while im away, my mom will move my computer for vacuming not matter what i tell her. COuld her constant moving and careless hands causes
 something to get disloadged or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any1 could help me it would be great. I know its a long post but i need help. Thanks to any1 who might be able to help me :)</p>

<p><span><span>Bluescreen errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; From what you've posted,
 I suspect hardware but cannot say that for sure yet (but we'll try testing both hardware and software as we proceed).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should
 help you resolve your problem. </span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other options and explanations of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, go to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can you boot into Safe Mode with networking?<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip
 any steps here or above that require you to be able to boot normally if you can’t stay or get booted though that doesn't&nbsp;yet seem to be an issue which is a good thing (and the same for safe mode if that’s the case there as well).<span>&nbsp;</span>Post
 back when you’ve done whatever you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use SkyDrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error (as you discover them throughout this and the above processes) which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control Panel
 / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp;</span><span>Use removal
 tools when appropriate</span></span><a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Once
 you've uninstalled your current AV program, download, install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless
 you decide to switch which I did when I first tried it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start /
 search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click
 on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft
 Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>You
 may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible (assuming that is the cause):</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If you've cleaned it out and it is still overheaing, then where is the heat coming from?&nbsp; If it's the processor they sell little processor fans to help with that
 type of problem and they are cheap and it might be worth a try.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.&nbsp; After this, the choices are essentially a clean install (which may or may not resolve the problem) or taking it to a computer repair shop (NOT Geek Squad which doesn't really know what it's doing but a reputable professional) for diagnosis, service and
 repair and/or replacment.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h3> bitterroot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot send mail from Microsoft Outlook</h2>
                    I can receive but not send mail in Microsoft outlook. I talked to a tech at Go Daddy, checked all the outgoing&nbsp;settings in email acounts and rebooted the computer but it still won't send. When i hit the send button it says "sending Mail" and stays that
 way -for hours if i let it go. I have Vista, Microsoft Outlook 2003 version. This has happened before, and the tech at Godaddy was helpful but it took probably 20 minutes to figure it out. This time hte tech was at a loss after having me check all of the putgoing
 settings.

            Hello bitterroot,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
Sorry you are having a problem with this.&nbsp; I have added the steps below for setting up outgoing emails.&nbsp; It looks like you are familiar with this set up from your past experiences.&nbsp; I have also added a link below for support at Microsoft Office Community.&nbsp;
 You can search FAQ's as well as post your question.&nbsp; I would suggest going there if you have no luck with steps below.&nbsp; Also, you might want to contact your ISP.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<strong>I can receive, but not send email:<br />

<p><span><span>If you can successfully receive e‑mail messages, but can't send messages, then Windows Mail is having problems connecting to the outgoing e‑mail

<h2>            Is it possible for me to get a clean copy of Windows 10 on a fully cleaned hard drive without purchasing it again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Windows 10 on a pc i built about two years ago. My hard drive recently got corrupted and Windows 10 no longer boots up and I can’t factory reset it. I want to fully clean my hard drive, but I don’t want to lose my Operating System and if I do, I
 obviously don’t want to pay for Windows 10 again. Is there a solution to my issue, either a way to fully clean my hard drive without losing the OS or a way to get Windos 10 back without buying it again</p>

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can always reinstall Windows no matter what version it is.     
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>I've been working at this PC to be able to boot windows now for weeks and I'm still lost. I managed to get the install windows 10 screen to pop up with my installation media USB drive. I tried using diskpart to create a partition to install Windows 10 on,
 that didn't work (Diskpart has encountered an error: Data Error (Cyclic Redundancy Check)).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>p.s In the bottom left corner of the installation window, there is a yellow triangle saying "Windows cannot be installed on this drive, make sure it is activated in the BIOS"</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.p.s When prompted to select a drive to install windows, my drive is called "Drive 0 unallocated Space"</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Have Windows 7 installed and am having issues connecting to internet wirelessly. I can see our wireless network but each time I click it, I get a box entitled "Network Authentication" which states, "Please enter user credentials" with a name and
 password. My computer does not have a password. I do not have any credentials saved in the computer (I checked via the control panel). I have tried every possible combination of things and I simply cannot get through. If I 'x' out of it, behind it states "Additional
 login information is required". I have gone into the control panel and already checked the box in network and sharing for "turn off password protected sharing". That did nothing. Any help to get rid of this annoying credential box would be VERY much appreciated!</strong></p>

<p>XbowSteve and Yelliez,</p>
<p>I had the same issue: I bought a new computer (ASUS U43F laptop), and when I attempted to connect to my home wireless network, I received a window that said "Windows Security" and "Network Authentication: Please enter user credentials" which&nbsp;also included
 a block for Username and Password.&nbsp; I have three other machines humming along my wireless network happily, some on Windows 7 and some on Mac OSX Snow Leopard.</p>
<p>Problem was, I purchased this computer today, and did not enter a system password.&nbsp; Additionally, I was the one who set up my wireless network, and I do not require user authentication, only an encryption key.&nbsp; Additionally, there were no credentials stored
 yet, and I had only my admin account set up.</p>
<p>#1: Do not listen to those&nbsp;who say it is a router issue, it is not.&nbsp; IT IS NOT ASKING FOR THE ROUTER ADMIN&nbsp;USERNAME AND PASSWORD!</p>
<p>#2: Do not get caught up in the long list of poorly answered&nbsp;questions in the "User Credentials" threads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#3: IT IS ALSO NOT A PASSWORD-PROTECTED SHARING ISSUE!&nbsp; ACK!</p>
<p>Instead, do this:</p>
<p>(1) Go to Control Panel, then Network and Internet, then Network and Sharing Center.</p>
<p>(2) Click Manage Wireless Networks in the upper left portion of the window.</p>
<p>(3) If your computer is new, then just click&nbsp;"Add."&nbsp;If not, then click "Add," go through the steps below and then choose the new network as your active network.</p>
<p>(4) Select "Manually create a network profile."</p>
<p>(5) Complete the form in the next window, including your network SSID, encryption type, encryption key, etc.&nbsp; Select the option to conect automatically.</p>
<p>(6) Save.&nbsp; It should say "Network Successfully Added."</p>
<p>Presto!&nbsp; That should do it - I'm not that different.</p>
