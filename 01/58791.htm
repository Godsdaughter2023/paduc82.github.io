            Hi bimalendumohapatra
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO YOUR COMPUTER - Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B.  To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi bimalendumohapatra 
<br />
<br />Are you dual booting your system with Linux?
<br />
<br />lilo.sys is a Linux boot loader and that seems to be causing your system crashes, however, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection Won&#39;t Connect</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Looking for some help in setting up Remote Desktop Connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Surface Pro 4 running Win10 release 10586 I installed the Remote Desktop Preview today from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my desktop running the same version of Win10 I installed the Remote Desktop Assistant created a file and copied that to my SP4. I have enabled Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer and Allow remote connection to this computer. I added my
 user account to Remote Desktop Users and have this account setting on the SP4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't connect, keep getting a screen when I try to connect saying it can't connect but no information. I checked the Windows Firewall settings, Remote Desktop is allowed. Tried Network Level Authentication deselected and selected, but no change. Looking
 on Bing couldn't find a solution. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Mark</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back with me,&nbsp; There was an update to the Call of Duty- Heroes game (my version is Microsoft Windows based).&nbsp; The update was in late July and all Windows based players could not get back into the game including about 10 players in my alliance
 and many others.&nbsp; The game was created by Activision and from what I heard there may be some sort of issue between Microsoft and Activision.&nbsp; I spent 3 years in this particular game to get to the level that I was and spent money with you to do that,&nbsp; I would
 like to know what Microsoft can do to resolve this possible issue with Activision so I can resume this game on my computer.&nbsp; I was going to buy a Microsoft Surface so I could play easier on the road but it is windows based and would likely not allow to play
 the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please investigate this issue for me and reply.&nbsp; I look forward to your response</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for following up. I will definitely try to investigate this on my end and see what we can find out. I am a gamer myself - I spend huge amount time and resources with the games I like, and therefore could understand how it feels to be on your situation.
 I just need a few more information so I can check what troubleshooting steps I can suggest.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages when trying to launch or connect to the game?</li><li>When did this issue start to occur? And since you mentioned something about update, can you tell us more about it? What is the update for? Or could you get in touch with Activision's support or community website to verify the update logs?
</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling/reinstalling the game?</li><li>Did you purchase the game through Windows Store or third party online game store?</li><li>What is the current OS build, version and edition of your Windows 10 operating system?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I would suggest checking <strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update</strong> and see if your PC is running on the latest version of Windows 10. Check and install the latest updates available and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Mark</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp; Sounds like I have the perfect person to help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to error message,&nbsp; I get the following (see below).&nbsp; It loads store and says already have this.&nbsp; then comes back to screen below.&nbsp; It is a never ending do-loop.</p>
<p>Update was mid July.&nbsp; It was to add a hero and fix some bugs. Yes I tried uninstall and reinstall.&nbsp; I even went to the geek squad.&nbsp; They updated me to windows 10 and new windows store and still have same problem.&nbsp; They said it is issue with Activision and
 Microsoft from what they could see.&nbsp; Yes I purchased game through Windows store in 2015.&nbsp; Windows updates were always slower than other platforms but since I started the game here with Microsoft Windows I had to continue with you to keep my status.&nbsp; I am not
 sure on current OS build.&nbsp; I can tell you Geek squad just upgraded me very recently.&nbsp; About 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got back into the game as low level player on amazon platform because I could not get into your platform.&nbsp; When I got back into chat I found out there are many players with the same issue, so it is not my computer, it is actually an issue between Microsoft
 and Activision from everything I could find out.&nbsp; Hopefully this clears things up.&nbsp; Again thank you for your help.&nbsp; Many people are waiting a resolution to this.&nbsp; Anything Microsoft can do to help us would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>You're welcome, <strong>Mr G360</strong>. It looks like some of the message on your response did not go through. I don't see any error message or screenshot on my end. Can you post that again please so I can verify?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I tried searching our community forums for posts that has the same, if not, slightly similar issues with CoD - Heroes and found a few ones who were able to resolve the issue. The methods involved are resetting the Windows Store cache, as well
 as Repair and resetting the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to reset Windows Store app cache:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> key to open <strong>Run </strong>box.</li><li>Enter <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> in the Run command and click <strong>OK</strong>. (You might notice the Command Prompt will pop up and then immediately disappear. When it does, that means the reset has completed.<br />
</li><li>Restart your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the above step fails, the next few troubleshooting suggestions that I have can be found on
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>. First, check for Windows Store updates, and perform the update if there
 is one. Next is repair and reset the app if it can be found on the <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong> (same goes with step 3.) And lastly. run the
<strong>Troubleshooter for Microsoft Store apps</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Mr G360</strong>. Apologies for the delayed response. I was already out of the office when your reply came through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems to be another error that we need to look at. This time, try running
<strong>wsreset.exe</strong> via <strong>Elevated</strong> <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. First, close Windows Store, then type
<strong>CMD</strong> on the Windows search box. Right click on Command Prompt and select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. When CMD launches, type wsreset.exe and hit the Enter key. Let us know the outcome, or if you would still get the same error message when shutting down your PC.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for this.&nbsp; I did what you said and when I hit enter nothing happened.&nbsp; Then I shut down computer and did not receive an error message, so I guess that part worked.&nbsp; Still cannot get into the game Call of Duty-Heroes. Keeps saying there is an update
 available but the update is not in Windows store and the do-loop continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any luck trying to see about Microsoft Windows Store and Activision about problem loading update into Windows platform?</p>

<p>If the Windows Store reset did not work, then as a last resort we could try running the game in compatibility mode and see if it helps. Check out
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> for more information and steps on how to run the compatibility troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did a research regarding this issue with the game but were not able to find any news. If the above troubleshooting steps fails, the best that I can suggest is to reach out to our developers via

            Hi Bentleyafrica,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a compatibility issue with the device and Windows 7. However, you may try running the device in Compatibility Mode. If that does not work, you have to contact the device manufacturer for updated drivers which support Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Run the device in Compatibility Mode, do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Locate the executable file for the driver installation program.<br />
2. Right-click the file and then click Properties.<br />
3. In the Package Name Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab.<br />
4. Click to select the Run this program in compatibility mode for check box, click Windows XP or Windows Vista in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click OK.<br />
5. Double-click the executable file to start the installation program.<br />
<br />

<p>Hello Remi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for trusting the community in this query. We would like to set your expectation that the query is too complex for the community to be addressed accurately.
<br />
<br />
There are a few things that you have to consider in handling this storage capacity. One is if your system hardware is able to read the said capacity. You would also need to consider the type of storage you're going to use. You may base on this old-reliable
 articles for a few helpful information:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2581408/windows-support-for-hard-disks-that-are-larger-than-2-tb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows support for hard disks that are larger than 2 TB.</a></p>

<p><br />
For sure, you will be needing more accurate information about how Windows 10 editions can handle such large storage. You may want to post this query on
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Social TechNet</a>. Professional ITs and developers lurks in TechNet. Thus, they're very familiar with these kinds of concern.

                    I am currently running Windows 8.1 with Bing. I am seeking how to apply to get Windows 10 upgrade before it is no longer free. I looked up what Windows 8.1 with Bing is. I saw that there is no notable difference to the normal Windows 8.1. So why am I unable
 to upgrade? I don't have the Windows icon in my taskbar that I should have. Please help...

</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>

<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same problem-&nbsp; I installed the $40 download version of Win 8 Pro, installed a clean (not upgrade to Win 7) copy, and activated it with no difficulty-&nbsp; Just today (about a week after the initial install), I did the "add feature" for the
 free download of Media Center and it has completely broken the OS; I can't activate it using any key that I've been given by Microsoft-&nbsp; The phone activation also gives me a key that apparently doesn't match whatever the OS is looking for, so I'm stuck with
 a mess that can't be activated with my original Win 8 key or my new Media Center key-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the best I can think of is to simply reinstall the OS from the ground up so that, with a bit of luck, the original non-media-center version of the OS will respond to its key- &nbsp;I figured that something like this was bound to happen, so I didn't do the
 install on my primary system-&nbsp; A piece of advice for anyone who discovers this thread: MAKE A CLEAN RESTORE POINT BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE FREE DOWNLOAD OF MEDIA CENTER-</p>

            <p>Hi Guys, thanks for your responses. I finally got it sorted but ended up pulling most of my hair out in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the issues of windows not being activated and then once refreshed it did not update. I exhausted the Microsoft support and finally at the fifth (yes fifth, who all seemed to do the same check list) he thought of asking me about my machine and how old
 it was. Well this then unleashed the question of had I needed to updated the BIOS. After contacting ACER they agreed that the BIOS had to be upgraded whilst the PC was running Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WISH MICROSOFT HAD TOLD ME THIS DURING DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL! So once formatting my system running the BIOS update and re-installing Windows 8, it now updates, added the feature Media Centre and is working wonderfully (fingers crossed).</p>

                    <p>When clicking on the Cortana icon or the search box on the task bar directly&nbsp;- it does nothing at all.
<br />
If I click the Start Icon and start typing - the search box opens, takes my inputs, and returns the results I typed in.
<br />
<br />
ONLY when trying to initiate a search using the Cortana Icon or search box directly - I get nothing.
<br />
<br />
I have thus far : <br />
<br />
Tried System File Checker fix:&nbsp;did not work. <br />
DISM fix: did not work. <br />
Repaired the Search / Indexing. <br />
Uninstalled all recent updates that&nbsp;showed up in&nbsp;the updates list : Did not work. &nbsp;<br />
Wiped and reloaded windows to build 10.0.10586 Build 10586 (there are currently NO updates applied to this rebuild and I have completely disabled Automatic Updates via GPO)&nbsp;- did not resolve the issues.
<br />
I have checked and rechecked language and location settings - they are all set properly, USA / English. I do not and have not changed regions.
<br />
<br />
I have also tried applying the latest build update 1511 - that broke things even worse (edge browser won't launch - just closes immediately and Cortana is also broken in the same way). ~this was the main reason I disable updates via GPO because 1511 is about&nbsp;as
 good an upgrade as SP1 for Vista was... IE: a complete joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have read&nbsp;multiple threads on this issue going back to July of this year - and I have tried every suggested fix, and followed every suggested link - and none of them are working at all to resolve this issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I reset windows today (second time in 24 hours)&nbsp;- Cortana worked fine -till I rebooted the machine after installing Office 2016 - then&nbsp;it broke - I uninstalled Office (literally the only thing I installed after the reload / reset.)&nbsp; Removing it did not
 make Cortana work again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To restate&nbsp;: Clicking on the Cortana Icon or Search Box in the Task bar do not bring up the search window, or allow me to enter text : If I click the start button and type - search is working.&nbsp; My current version of windows is Pre 1511 upgrade , has no other
 apps installed other than the default - and no update or KB fixes installed either... this is about as vanilla as a windows build gets... Cortana DID work right after reset - but after first reboot - no longer worked.

<br />
Thank you for the reply. <br />
<br />
I've done the GetApp procedure from powershell (which is actually where every other suggestion said to run it from) - for grins - I did also try it from the CMD - no joy&nbsp;- it doesn't work either...
<br />
<br />
We are in a domain,&nbsp;and upon creating the accounts and logging into the PC - everything works..<br />
Only after I log off / reboot / restart do the problems occur.. <br />
<br />
Per your instructions : <br />
I created a new local account - logged in - Everything worked. <br />
I restarted the PC, and logged back in with the same account &nbsp;: the issues occur as stated above.<br />
<br />
I created a new domain account per our standard process - I log in to this workstation - everything works.<br />
I restarted and logged back in with the domain account : the issues occur as stated above.
<br />
<br />
Changing users only works for the very first time I log in with that account - the second I log off, restart, change users / shut down - the issues are present.
<br />
<br />
These issues are occurring regardless of the rights level of the User accounts on the domain or local machine.<br />
I can create 1000 accounts, and every time - after a reboot / logoff-logon event the issues happen.&nbsp;<br />
They happen with normal&nbsp;Local User accounts, they happen with any domain account I attempt to use regardless of the rights level of that account either local machine or domain.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank You again. </p>

            <p>I have been struggling with this same issue - ever since the 1511 update. &nbsp;However, I can't even get a result by clicking on the start icon and typing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work just fine. &nbsp;In fact, like this person, it worked just fine for one - and only one - login. &nbsp;Thereafter, just a dead box with "Ask me anything" printed nicely in the middle of it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a bug in the update. &nbsp;Someone needs to work a patch to get this back into the functional world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a workaround yet?</p>

            Were you able to find a solution to this issue? I've been having the same issue too (except I can get results by clicking on the start icon and typing). Cortana just isn't working for me ever since the November upgrade; yet, when I did try Jenith James'
 suggestion about logging onto another account, it worked (on that logged-in account)! Along with the Cortana not being right, I also cannot log onto my Microsoft account for the Microsoft Store, nor do I have Microsoft Edge. Everything, though, is working
 fine on my other account (that I almost never use) -- which is the problem, because it isn't even the one I'm wanting to use. I really hope Microsoft sends out a patch, because it's a frustrating issue!

            <p>I can circumvent the problem by going to another account, or creating another account, then closing the main account and logging back on with the new one. &nbsp;While that seems to work, I lose all the weeks/months of personalization and specificity that I built
 with the primary login screen. &nbsp;Now, to regain that old functionality, I have a days-long task ahead of me, and there's no telling if the original problem won't reappear. &nbsp;It is definitely worth a try, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After numerous (20 or 30) restarts of the system, I can get consistent access to my Start Program through the windows button on the lower left. &nbsp;Any slight tweak in the system, however, a driver update or something, and I lose that function again, as well.
 &nbsp;Then it's back to the alternate login account again if I was to use my system at all. &nbsp;(All functions work in the alternate login account, by the way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: &nbsp;This is a major problem, it was brought in by the 1511 update, and there's no outward indication MS is fixing it - not even an "I'm sorry for the inconvenience, we're working on it." message.</p>

            Once again, the text entry capability in the window is gone. &nbsp;You can't type anything there. &nbsp;Also, by simply clicking the start menu icon (the windows in the lower left), you often (more often than not) trigger a "CRITICAL ERROR" that closes your login
 account and requires you to login again (usually with the same results). &nbsp;Switching to an alternate login account for a while seems to help, but this whole thing is making W-10 an embarrassing exposure of Microsoft's fall from technical competence.

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That is User Account Control just making sure you're the one wanting to Uninstall the  program, and not some hacker.   So it's fine to go ahead.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt reply. But I still don't understand, if they wanted to make sure it was me they could have simply asked for the password, which they do anyway and avoid an unrelated message.</p>
<p>The problem is that it claims that setup.exe is from an unkown publisher. How could this happen? Where is this setup.exe coming from:</p>
<p>(1) Microsoft? How come it is unknown publisher?</p>
<p>(2) From the scanner software that I installed? That did have a known publisher.</p>
<p>Please help me understand, or suggest an alternative safe method of removing the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            Dan, errors about unknown publishers or invalid security certificates are random and often make no sense.  I gave up a long time ago trying to figure them out.  You just have to try to find a workaround.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot uninstall the app in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, then what I first try is to reinstall the program over itself to see if it will then allow itself to be uninstalled correctly.  
<br />
<br />If that fails I go into the Task Manager (right click task bar) on the Details tab look for any processes it has running to killl, then delete it's C:\Program File, if necessary taking Ownership first using this convenient shortcut:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>

<p>(1) Before installing the new software I went to Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security -&gt;Check for updates</p>
<p>and install all Windows recommended updates. I repeated till there were no new updates.</p>
<p>(2) Then I downloaded the install software from Fujitsu website mentioned on the scanner documentation.</p>

            Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer/scanner which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer,/scanner if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer/scanner software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer/scanner drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer/scanner software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<h2>            Cant install any VPN network adapters</h2>
                    Since installing windows 10 i have not been able to run my vpn software. I have been on to the company who have been trying to help me and have advised me to install one or two different adapters, all of which were unsuccessful. I have just attempted to
 install LogMeIn Hamachi which has also failed to install the network addapter, which leads me to believe windows 10 is blocking the instalation of them. I have run the exe's as administrator which made no difference. I had no problems prior to upgrading from
 windows 7. I was advised to download and install <span>Windows Driver Kit but that has not helped at all either.</span>

<h2>            How do I burn Windows 7 in ISO format to a disk&#63;</h2>
                    <p><i>Working with W7 Home Premium ISO</i></p>
<p>I just recently purchased a new laptop. It is the first I bought that did not come with the Windows OS on disc. I have never worked with ISO files and was wondering if I placed the ISO file on disc, when I wipe out the harddrive and set up a partition, do
 I just place the ISO disc in the drive like a regular OS disc?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Mathew, I would recommend you not use this ISO to wipe your installation. Manufacturers are phasing out recovery discs because computers either come with a recovery partition or the ability to create your own recovery disc or both.
</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still prefer to use the .ISO file as an option in case your system cannot boot, use the following instructions:</p>
<p>Download Windows 7 Home Premium:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58996.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Windows 7 Home Premium (x86)</u></a>

</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes very recently to the computer before this issue occurred?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you receiving any error message or error code?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Check in Safe mode with Networking.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also check if the issue persists in safe mode with networking and check.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot and check.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error message, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as
 a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<h2>            Error reading file in Photo Editor</h2>
                    I own a Kodak EasyShare&nbsp;C813. When I upload the videos/pictures to my computer, I go to Start Menu, then Pictures. I can see the thumbnails load, but when I click&nbsp;to view the&nbsp;images (majority around 1.1 MB), Microsoft Photo Editor (MPE)&nbsp;opens with a window
 reading l"oading"- and goes directly into a pop up window reading- "! Error Reading File." I can open the files with Internet Explorer, and&nbsp;Paint, but can not edit them as needed since MPE cannot read the file.<br />
My version of Microsoft Photo Editor is 3.0.2.3

                    <div>Looking for some help: I need to install Service Pack 1 for Vista. Microsoft strongly recommends I do the install via Windows Update vs. downloading from the Microsoft download site.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I attempt the SP1 download from Windows Update, It shows a successful install. However, when I check "Installed Updates," &nbsp;SP1 is missing from the list.</div>

<div>I need to install SP1 in order to install SP2 and/or upgrade to Windows 7...any help would be much appreciated.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Is it a Vista 32-bit or a Vista 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See...</p>

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Is IE7 or IE8 installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p><strong>Note: Support for Vista Gold (no Service Packs) ended on Tuesday, 13 April

<h2>            Right clicking leads to explorer crash and restart</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to right click on a file/folder or even on a blank space in for example Drive C or E, the blue circle of waiting&nbsp;appears and explorer crashes, and of course the context menu won't open, and restarts but the problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: Maybe it's useful to point out that when I go to Windows Update section of&nbsp;settings app, the little dots come and go but nothing shows up, in a sense Windows Update doesn't load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S2: I have used sfc /scannow, the file that was corrupted was "_DataOracleClientPerfCounters_shared12_neutral.h". But I don't know what it has to do with right clicking!</p>

 Not sure what the problem is as my original disk was English. I broke the disk last year shutting the draw it was in, not that it matters, and would really like to to get an iso I can use.</p>

            Answers:
<div>1-2. The errors are random, no matter what browser, or metro app i use, it cant upload any files that is larger than as what i said. Errors are like failed to upload.<br />
4. By simply just uploading images, or pdf files, etc,. Its not just on a certain file type sort of thing, as long as the file is large enough as I said, it wont upload and shows/display errors, same to as when i do speed testing on any speed test app or site.
 But then when i use any browser such as IE 10, Chrome or Firefox, it cant even upload any size of file, i can just upload a little bit on yahoo mail metro app.<br />
5. About the internet speed, my net speed on average is at 600-1200kbps, and up to 3.6 mbps during off peak hours. I tested and did the uploads at the times the net is fast at 3.6mbps but still got the same results, i can download files at 460KB/s and upload
 files at around 44KB/s on my windows 7, though the download on my windows 8 is the same to that of my windows 7, the upload on my windows 8 is nothing, as in nothing, it cant upload correctly and shows error, like failed to upload the file and try again, and
 whenever i try and try, it still is the same error. :/<br />
<br />
Heres also the screenshot of my broadband provider on task manager, it is not showing connected even though im already connected to the internet on the "Mobile Area"<br />
<br />
Picture Link:<br />
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3nzHMoUpvlBNjVKSG1wUmlwbk0/edit?usp=sharing<br />
<br />
&gt;Ive already tried reinstalling the software of my broadband provider too, but still the same.<br />
&gt;Ive tried my broadband on my desktop pc with windows 8 too, and its working in there, its just that in my windows 8 lappy that this is happening to me. :/ :/<br />
<br />
&gt;about the screenshot, I just happen to upload the file my my google drive, so i updated the link, and also uploaded the other one on google drive too which is above,....actually as of now i use my windows 7 just to do that.. :/<br />

            Hi Joshua,
<div>Thank you for a quick update on this issue.<br />
<div>I would like to gather certain information on this issue:<br />
Is there any security software installed on the computer?</div>
<div>If you have installed any security software, then it might be a reason for this issue.</div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow the methods:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to temporarily disable the security software and check if it helps to upload files.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Important Note: </strong>Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
If it still does not fix the issue, let’s try to temporarily disable Windows firewall and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
You can refer to the link to temporarily turn off Windows Firewall:</div>
<div><br />
“<strong>Windows Firewall from start to finish”</strong></div>
<div><br />
Follow the section “<strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>”</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> For Windows Firewall: You shouldn’t turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your PC (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>I would also suggest you to disable any proxy settings if enabled on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><font color="#000000">You may follow the steps to do so:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open Internet Explorer on the desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on Tools icon option on the top right corner.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select Internet Option from the list.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on Connection tab.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on LAN Settings.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Uncheck the box which says “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on OK.</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            hello there..thanks for the reply, ive already did them, but problem still persist<br />
<br />
about Method 1:<br />
&gt;Windows 8 comes with a built in anti virus right?, windows defender, ...so thats one of my avs already and another one av which i have installed is avg internet security 2013. Ive already disabled them,the avg internet security 2013, and the windows defender
 defaultly installed long time ago,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
about Method 2:<br />
same to the windows avs i have disabled,my windows firewall is also disabled ever since i installed windows 8, but still the problem persist.<br />
<br />
about Method 3:<br />
i did the steps already, as what i can see, my IE10 already has the "Use a Proxy Server for your LAN" unchecked already, so what i just did is leave it still unchecked and click ok.<br />
<br />
so, i did all the steps/methods already, but still the problem persist.. :'( :/<br />
<br />
Anything else to fix this??...i am also experiencing problems connecting to my wifi and any other wifis i try to conect to using my windows 8 in my lappy, but my windows 7 which is in dual boot with my windows 7, i can connect to my wifi or other wifi devices,
 its just that theres really something going on to my system, ive already did everything i can like installing the windows 8 drivers for the wifi, etc,... so I conclude that windows 8 is really having trouble to do networking.. anyway, how to fix the upload
 problem? :/<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Ege</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 10, excited about Edge....didn't show up on taskbar, searched through all the apps...not present at all....is Microsoft Edge not available in Malaysia? Pretty sure its available everywhere.
