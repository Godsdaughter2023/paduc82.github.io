<h2>            How to fix - Build 15063 - Chrome crashes regularly . Reboot is required.</h2>
                    <p>I leave my computer on 24/7. Chrome browser hangs after about 24-48 hours. Task manager shows multiple instance of Google Chrome Background processes, like 8-10 or so. Task manager will not end all these processes. Have done malware checks using AVG and
 Malwarebytes.&nbsp; Uninstalled and re-installed Chrome. Help would be appreciated..</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I also use Potplayer media Player and leave it on 24/7. Does not seem to matter if it's on or not, though.</p>

<p>Chrome uses one process for each tab/web app. Might be an issue with Chrome not playing nice with the new build. Are there any flash or media content? Do you use any extensions? Might be a memory leak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running Chrome with no extensions.</p>
<p>Chrome also have its own Task Manager in <strong><em>Menu-&gt; Tools -&gt; Task Manager.</em></strong></p>

</p><p>That was the clue I needed! Re-running AVG in Deep Scan Mode uncovered 7 instances of Win32:Malware. One for each extra Google Background Process that kept showing up every time I opened Chrome.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Yunarto.
<br />may be battery is loosing capacity. If there is battery calibration tool on manufacturer site or already installed please  use it. Otherwise replace battery.

<p>Apologies to you and the others. I'm just yelling and it's not directed at anyone.</p>
<p>I'm not on a laptop running on battery. I'm on a desktop PC and this is happening.</p>
<p>I'm hooked up to a UPS which allows me to shut down normally should there be a power failure.</p>
<p>I'm simply furious about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 goes into a hard freeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the fourth time it's happened in about as many days since upgrading to windows 10 from windows 7. (via full retail installation disk).</p>
<p>Needless to say, the reliability score is dropping like a rock.</p>
<p>Cursor vanishes.</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>Cannot get into Task Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forced to hold the power button down until the PC shuts down.</p>
<p>(Cold Reboot)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cannot get any error reports because the whole system has locked up</span> !</p>
<p>The only error message on the reliability report is same as mentioned in the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, this was also happening prior to going to windows 10.</p>
<p>I've replaced the power supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've replaced (upgraded) the CPU.</p>
<p>I've ran numerous checks on memory and the motherboard. nothing.</p>
<p>I've updated the motherboard bios.</p>
<p>The only thing I haven't done is wipe the SSD and do a clean install from scratch.</p>

<h2>            When downloading Word docs from my email they are automatically converted to Paint docs and will not open in Word 7.</h2>

            <p>Many thanks to all who have given advice but still no joy unfortunately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the sevenforums approach but still no Open With -</p>
<p>When downloaded from Hotmail the files appear as a Paint DOC File in the Temporary Internet Files. When right clicked the only options are OPEN, CUT, COPY, DELETE, PROPERTIES
 – there is no OPEN WITH.</p>
<p>If OPEN (or double click on the file) is used then&nbsp;a PAINT diagnostic appears “Paint cannot read this file. This is not a valid bitmap file or its format is not currently
 supported.” The files were sent as valid Word files - how they are corrupted to Paint I have no idea,</p>
<p>Only by copying the downloaded file to Desktop and then SAVE AS a Word doc can I get a result. This is rather cumbersome each time a Word file is downloaded.</p>
<p>The same problem applies to Gmail downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again but rather than waste your time I will contact a local IT concsultant to look at my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards/John</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened an Office 365 Business account for my Wife.</p>
<p>I am able to log onto the Office 365 account on a browser using the e-mail and password so I am sure that the user name and password are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that I am unable to log onto Windows 8.1 or now Windows 10 OS (I upgraded hoping it would solve the problem).</p>
<p>When I select the "Reset Password" option it says that the account is not recognised.</p>
<p>Today I also tried to link her account to a new Windows Phone and it too stated that the account is not recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot below is the login screen for Windows 10 for a Microsoft Account.</p>

Sorry for how this looks -- it's hard to copy it into such a thin window...<br />
makes it easy to copy in your update history (NOT)...sorrry for the pars that are not readable, easily -- have to scroll across to see them...<br />
<br />
I can't run sfc.&nbsp; Keeps telling me a repair is pending and to reboot.<br />
<br />
I tried to remove all the optional win components so I coukld then reinstall tyhem thinking that might help...<br />
not... they are marked removed in the installer but they are still present on disk.<br />
<br />
I'm very slowing fixing problems one by one -- installing drivers...installed licensing... etc... worried on that one for a bit
<br />
as kept saying my serial number was bogus on my Dell OEM machine... but figured that would -- some licensing files had gone awol...<br />
<br />
Just had machine lock up due to explorer going crazy -- it seems to go off and scan my network every once in a while --- usually no more than once a day, but that problem has mutated due to my getting a faster network card.&nbsp; At 1Gbps, explorer would slowly
 fill up memory (48GB) until programs would start dying due to memory exhaustion (if I didn't catch it).<br />
<br />
Then upgraded network card to a dual 10Gb (running as a team), ... Now it usually dies at around 5GB usage by locking up the machine -- interrupt exhaustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can usually recover if I pull the network cord and then try to restart explorer (it's my desktop
 instance)... for some reason it is very slow to die... (process explorer/hacker) can't kill it .. but usually dies within a minute and new explorer takes over and I'm good for another day or so..)... That's a problem that goes very far back (other posts by
 me mentioning that somewhere in these fora(?)&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />
<br />
Anyway.. Some update from MS made machine unbootable -- system repaire was a no go. It even listed the cause as some recent update...<br />
<br />
I'm NOT sure, but it was in the same bactch of update where MS tried to install new securrity home essentials SW that would disable SW on your system if it found it was unlicensed... but that update failed to install....I did find "body parts" of something
 similar -- some watsvc -- win-act-tech-service. that faild to install correctly as well...
<br />
<br />
It might have been an IE10 update... since the one that causes problems on lapt0o-ps with hybrid graphics also causes problems on desktops with high end graphics caards (Nvidia 590)... -- not in nuking the machine, mind you, but in disabling windows aero...<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry for the horrid formatting, but my standard browser extensions aren't allinstalled and working either, and it usually allows me to bring up a separate editor or at least resize this tiny edit winjdow... *sigh*...<br />
<br />
FWIW, I don't expect anyone to be able to solve this .. I'm gonna have to reinstall from scratch and lose all settings,and programs (the idea of reinstallying 150-200 programs -- finding the sources and licenses for all of them again is horrifying..<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm mostly whining about my fate... and sharing with MS, the wonderful impact of their anti-piracy nonsense on their customers... (not just theirs but the rest of the corporate overlords as well...<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch... at least with XP I could do complete, non image backups... unlike with MS's new backup<br />
that doesn't backup programs... (unless they are on the same HD as the OS)....<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I keep all my docs and valuables on a non-MS server that allows me to do daily backups.<br />
<br />
*sigh*...<br />
Oh... Here is the screen capture text from explorer's hang in the middle of this writing;:<br />
<br />
Note the #GB transfered -- and my system had been up about 20-30 minutes when that happened.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yup.&nbsp; though the memory consuming got turned into interrupts eating the bus bandwidth (still have available CPU(s))... but as interrupt i/o requests complete they get priority boosted -- (I think) -- probably not designed with a dual 10Gb Intel Card in mind.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Even though the card has various types of xmit and rcv offload, the cpu is bound on either one end or the other (depending on packet sizes and who's doing sending/receiving..etc)..&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The 'redx on network usually is NOT there now.&nbsp; That's correlated (but not totally cured) by running a upnp-daemon on the gateway server.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
The performance action center thing eventually expired.<br />
<br />
Yup...this computer has been through the wringer and then some -- but I usually manage to sit on it and nurse it back to working condition...&nbsp; sometimes it take longers than other times.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This is a first -- having a win-update crash one of my computers, though one of the IE10 readiness updates that blue-screened a bunch of laptops w/hybrid graphics, also killed my aero desktop (basic themes only).... found other people on net who had that too
 -- removed update, aero came back).<br />
<br />
This time, given it was a nasty crash that wouldn't allow any system restores.&nbsp; Normally I might try to get out of a mess like this by doing a upgrade to the same version, in place, -- tends to run everything through a strainer.&nbsp; But not being able to get the
 system up made that a bit hard.<br />
<br />
Haven't had a crash this&nbsp; hard since win 7 was introduced -- and in the first 3 months -- it ate my disk twice (I think both times it was a system restore that failed and then failed to rollback properly)....<br />
<br />
FWIW -- I restored all the files from the "/windows.old" into /windows<br />
and recreated the problem -- system wouldn't boot and wasn't repairable.&nbsp; So I what's painful about this is I don't know which update or file<br />
caused the crash, but it is repeatable if I put it back in place.&nbsp; Yuck.<br />

I might be, but it would be one that Micsoft's Security Essentials hasn't been able to detect since it was made available (have had it installed for well over a year) and I have it run complete scans on everything weekly (full scan takes about 12 hours including
 network disks).<br />
<br />
If MS cannot detect the infection....after years of operating on this system<br />
with their resources and with the machine getting regular updates, its hard to see how anything might.&nbsp;

That's too bad... at least you might know that these errors are not the result of malware, but the result of a user trying to support themselves with microsoft's withholding information on how to do so.<br />
<br />
For example.&nbsp; If I had a list of files on my disk from when it was good (or last good), and even a backup of those files, I could restore them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I got sfc to run and it repaired several files, but several it said it would not.<br />
If wouldn't ask for the original source disk like previous versions of SFC, nor would it attempt to download the update that supposedly included those files.&nbsp; The system can pull down updates, and has the original source DVD available to it should it need to
 restore any file, but SFC isn't built to recover your system nor does MS make the information available to users for them to recover their system.&nbsp; Instead, they just let them flounder and flail until they give up and reformat again.&nbsp;&nbsp; What a wonderful support
 program -- for which they will only charge you .. hundreds of dollars/hour till you eventually give up and reformat/reinstall again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
That's professional?&nbsp; Only with MS, do they have the solutions: power-cycle the computer, or reinstall the OS.&nbsp; I don't hear that with any other vendor.<br />
The idea that you have to reboot your computer to replace a file is a design flaw that doesn't exist on any other modern OS that I know of.&nbsp; It's anachronistic.&nbsp; Yet rather than fix reliability problems stemming back 20 years, they go forward with yet more
 patches to gloss over and get around that problem (among others).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I really am sorry I sound so frustrated, but I have given feedback about these issues going back to Win98 days, and find no evidence that anything I said is heard.&nbsp; I don't expect that they will change in my lifetime, so it's frustrating.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply, I can understand why you would give the response you did, it is atypical behavior from a modern, freshly installed Windows computer.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, mine is stubbornly, manually repaired rather than reformatted, as often as possible.&nbsp;
 So I can easily see that others thinking it isn't worth it, and wondering what a masochist I must be.&nbsp; Sigh.<br />

And note,<span style="font-weight: bold"> I didn't write this note in italics... </span>
I did everything to turn it off, but it wouldn't turn it off.<br />
<br />
The bit about them deliberately disabling other work-arounds for their bad editory is very annoying -- Seems they really want people's replies to appear less readable and intelligible -- likely so they will be more easily ignored.&nbsp;
<br />

Thanks, MS, we really appreciate your ignoring and abusing us.<br />

                    <p>Surely I am not the only one with this problem. All the answers so far have been no help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open any website in Edge just fine but when I switch to "open&nbsp;with internet explorer"&nbsp;I get a blank white screen ever ware except on the menu bar at the top of screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does appear that the web page url, for example google.com,will work if I put it in&nbsp;the compatibility view list, then I can get to that web page. &nbsp;But when I click on links to web pages not in the compatibility list they do not appear. &nbsp;I get a blank page/
 white screen.&nbsp; This has not happened on any other of the computers I have upgraded from win 7 or win 8.1.</p>

            <p>I have this issue as well and noted it in another post. None of the MS support suggestions work.</p>
<p>The issue is that ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, IE 11 will only display web pages that are listed in the "compatibility view." &nbsp;Obviously we cannot add every web page to the compatibility view list. &nbsp;Is there a way to force IE 11 to open all web pages
 in compatibility view? &nbsp;I am not expecting an answer really but since upgrading Windows 10, I have been forced by Microsoft to adopt a new browser. &nbsp;So, now I use Chrome for everything.</p>

<h2>            Time out of sync</h2>
                    I'm in Adelaide, Australia - and my vista home, time is not syncing with the internet. Every website, forum/blog etc, i am a member of is out of sync with the real time here. I tried the internet time update thingy, and my clock goes back a hour. I tried
 this, w32tm /resync and my clock goes back 1 hour. The local place, area setting in vista is correct. (Adelaide, Australia) Dunno what else to do as its driving me nuts. Bobby.

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Hi Bobby (IntheDogBox),</span></p>
<p><span>I have found some additional steps for you to try to help you resolve this issue. Some you may have tried before but, if I understand your original post correctly, some
 you haven’t. Try these steps and let us know if you are still unable to get your clock to sync correctly:</span></p>
<p><span>1. If you point at your
<strong><span>clock</span></strong>, you'll get a little pop-up that shows you the date</span></p>
<p><span>2. If you click on the
<strong><span>clock</span></strong>, a window opens showing you an analog
<strong><span>clock</span></strong> and a
<br />
calendar. Click on Change date and time settings…</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Date and Time window, click on the tab called Internet Time.</span></p>
<p><span>4. It will tell you that there is an error while synchronizing. To try and fix
<br />
this, click on Change settings….</span></p>
<p><span>5. You'll see you have the option to not synchronize with a time server if you so
<br />
choose. By default <strong><span>Vista</span></strong> is set to
<strong><span>sync</span></strong> with time.windows.com. Clicking on Update
<br />
now still gave me an error.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click on the drop down arrow and you'll see other servers you can try to
<strong><span>sync</span></strong> <br />
with. You can actually add more/different servers to this list by editing the <br />
registry. If you'd like to modify them, take a look at:<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DateTime\Servers]</span></p>
<p><span>Please note if you choose to edite the registry that you should backup your data FIRST and realize that editing the registry can cause problems with Vista Functionality
 that may require a complete reinstall!</span></p>
<p><span>7. Try a few times before one of them worked. It immediately tells you if it
<br />
succeeded in syncing or not.</span></p>
<p><span>8. You'll see the time of the next synchronization,
<strong><span>Vista</span></strong> automatically syncs once a week.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope you find this information useful. Please let us know either way. If it doesn’t work we can look at additional steps to help you resolve this.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Jack</span></p>

            <p>There is an internal battery that stores system settings while the computer is off.&nbsp; Sounds like yours needs to be replaced.&nbsp; Check the manual that came with the computer and/or the support web site to see if it is something you can replace or if you will need assistance replacing it.&nbsp; In most desktop computers it's pretty easy to replace, in most laptops nearly impossible. </p>

Try the VLC app in the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; It's free and works OK.&nbsp; Also try the Windows Media Player which is included in windows 10.&nbsp; There are also other media player apps which you can try.&nbsp; Search the Microsoft Store, keyword
<strong>media players</strong>.

<p>I have done some investigating and if you want to play DVDs you should download the full VLC application at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can play just about any format including DVD movie rips.</p>

            Agree with VLC. If any formats dont work then also download K-lite Codec pack, this adds support to VLC player for additional video and audio types.

            Hi, I'm having the same issue. Has there been a fix for this? I've looked through all the settings in media center, and the option is just not there. &nbsp;I used to be able to burn from media center before upgrading to window 8. &nbsp;

            <p>All DVD burning has been removed from Media Center and burning videos to dvd&nbsp;is not included in Windows 8 Media Player--only data and music can be added to dvd. You have to buy dvd video burning program. DVD's are going the way of vcr tapes and floppy disks.
 Everything will be online in the future. Try programs like Wondershare.</p>

<h2>            Uninstall Office 97 without the Disc</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7. I upgraded to Office 2013. I was unable to uninstall my Office 97 since i did not have the disc. Installing Office 2013 did not delete the program. I have looked through the forum and found links that made no sense or did not work.
 At the following link for the uninstall wizard, it says that the page cannot be found:&nbsp;

<p>I am unable to find any other way to fix this. I would appreciate any and all guidance!

            <p>Use Revouninstaller to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> (freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.

<h2>            Windows 10 mail app doesn&#39;t sync after waking from sleep</h2>
                    This doesn't happen all the time, but very very often, after my computer is in sleep mode, my email will not sync no matter what. I usually have to restart to get it going. Any idea what could be causing this?

    <title>What do I need to do to file a manufacture warranty claim for a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trudinh  say:</h3>
<h2>            What do I need to do to file a manufacture warranty claim for a Microsoft product&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I bought a Microsoft&nbsp;Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse in January. After 8 months its stop working on me. I know there is a 1 year manufacturer warranty, so how exactly do I claim it. Nowhere on the website it allows me to do so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft customer support, </p>
<p>
</p><p>the 1st time, they put me on hold for 45 minutes, I just end up hanging up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the 2nd time, they say they will transfer me to the department that can help me with that, they end up hanging up on me, some transfer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the 3rd time, the lady told me to go back to the electronic store I bought it from, which is Frys Electronic, a Microsoft&nbsp;authorizes seller. First off it's past the 30 day return period, secondly its a "MANUFACTURE WARRANTY" not "RETAIL WARRANTY". The lady
 then told me that the Microsoft&nbsp;manufacture warranty only apply to item bought at the Microsoft&nbsp;online store and Microsoft window store. WHAT?! I told her that frys electronic is a Microsoft authorized seller, does that mean that Microsoft&nbsp;warranty doesn't
 cover on product sold by their authorized partner seller? she frozed&nbsp;and then told me that she will transfer me to the department that can help me. she ends up on hanging up on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So apparently, when they say they will "transfer you to the department that can help" it mean they will hang up on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is Microsoft&nbsp;manufacture warranty just a fake warranty? I know I am making a big deal out of a $69 mouse. BUT!! I'm curious, if it's like this for a $69 mouse, what is it like with a thousand dollar surface laptop?</p>

            Hi Grant, that is a programming Environment for programming in Java
<br />
<br />If you are not a software developer that needs that application, uninstall it, I believe it is that application that is causing the folder generation
<br />
<br />Then delete all those folders and restart your PC

            Hi Grant, hmmm . . . 
<br />
<br />Maybe the next best thing is to check if NetBeans is on your Windows Startup process and stop it from there, which would also stop the generation of those folders . .. 
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if NetBeans is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list see if NetBeans is listed there , uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Restart your System and this annoyance will be gone . . .

<h2>            Need help with Windows 8.1 product key expires soon message</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So I bought my Sony Vaio laptop in 2013 before I left for college. Two years later it crapped out. I got a refurbished laptop but eventually my dad replaced the hard drive in the Sony Vaio. We couldn't get Windows to boot up through a disk or a USB so I took
 it to a reputable computer repair place near my home. They reinstalled Windows 8.1 and got it running and I've been using the Vaio ever since.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Everything's been hunky dory until today, when I get a message that says "Your Windows License will expire soon. You need to activate Windows in PC settings." I run a command prompt to find my original license key and type it in. I get the message "That key
 can't be used to activate this edition of Windows. Please try a different key." I then tried using a license key finder program and I found the license key that is going to expire soon. But the one I found from the command prompt was different.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I have no idea how to solve this other than buying a new license key, which I shouldn't have to do because Windows came preinstalled on this computer. Can anyone help me out? I looked online and couldn't find any relevant information to my situation.</p>

<p>I don't know what edition of Windows 8.1 they installed or what license type.</p>
<p>Sounds lijke they installed with&nbsp;a Volume License which is not for private use and does need re-activation regularly.</p>
<p>No, you can't do that part.</p>

    <title>Black Screen after Resume from Sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Screen after Resume from Sleep</h2>
                    
<p>Hi...I see from other forums that this issue is not uncommon. But I need to resolve if possible. I just bought a Lenovo&nbsp;ideapad mid-Oct. I have no viruses and an active antivirus program running.</p>
<p>I have Win 7 64-bit Home edition. When I try to wake up my computer from sleep, it shows the "resuming windows" message and things seem to go forward but then the screen never changes from black to my desktop with icons. The only way I can get to my desktop
 is to shut down and restart.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot update Asus Latop containing 32Gb SSD Drive with your latest update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see this is a common problem with you people and this latest gigantic update, so I am going to add to the complaints on this website as that seems to be the only way to get this company to address genuine problems with these massive software downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to make your latest major windows 10 update (you know which one it is because you released it, the latest one) only to be told that there is not enough (specifically 8gb) space on my 32GB SSD drive to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is NOTHING else on this hard drive other than your software and Microsoft Office Word. Absolutely not one other peice of software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you reply with 'disk cleanup' and 'removing unwanted files', THIS HAS ALL BEEN DONE. THERE IS NO FURTHER SPACE TO BE REGAINED IN THIS WAY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly describe the workaround or process involved in running this update of yours which WILL NOT stop autorunning from either an external drive / source or in whichever way is necessary. DO NOT tell me to 'make more disk space available'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            People with 32 GB devices have problems with not enough space to do the major semi annual 'updates'.  These updates require 6-8GB of free hard drive space to complete.
<br />
<br />The suggestion is to create an image copy backup of your current computer so that you have a "known good" fallback point that you can restore to in case of extreme problems.  That way you can restore it and get back to work while you look for a longer term solution.
<br />
<br />This link
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a>
<br />is about 'hiding' updates, not just driver updates. 
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Asus with 32GB SSD. Windows 10 preinstalled so yes, it is compatible.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />
<br />Actually that is not a guarantee it will permanently be "compatible".  A  few months ago MS created a Win 10 update that made some specific ATOM type CPU's no longer Win 10 compatible. They were just a couple of years old. 
<br />
<br />So yes, go to the appropriate provided link and VERIFY that your computer is STILL / CURRENTLY Windows 10 compatible.
<br />
<br />******************************
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />So installing this update from ISO media will circumvent the disk space issue, correct?
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />
<br />Using an ISO copy of the update file on external storage frees up that amount of space on the HD. This is a good thing since space on this small device is at a premium.
<br />
<br />
<br />*******************************
<br />
<br />For you the situation boils down to 2 options:  
<br />.  *  spend a lot of time going to extremes to free up enough HD space for the update to complete (and be prepared to do it again in 6 months time)
<br />.  *  do a "clean install" of Windows, forcing you to re-install applications and restore your personal files from a backup location (you have to back them up BEFORE doing the clean install!)
<br />
<br />Devices with 32 GB fall well within MS's minimum specification for Win 10.  MS says Win 10 requires "only" 20GB.  But that is for a clean install.  Windows loves "temp" files. It scatters them all over the installation. And forgets to clean up after itself.  Office takes up to 4-5GB for a local install depending the specific bundle.  So now you are up to 25 of 32 GB.  Only 7GB free.  Throw in just a very few temp files and you no longer have enough space for the major update ... For example, CCleaner  tells me I have over 1GB of temp files that can be cleaned up just a few weeks after running CCleaner the last time.
<br />
<br />Here are some more clean up tips for you to consider
<br />32GB DEVICES ARE TOO SMALL …
<br />
<br />If you have a 32GB drive, you have my condolences (I just barely dodged that particular bullet myself). 
<br />
<br />MS says that Windows 10 only needs 20GB to install, making a 32GB drive appear adequate. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />
<br />But, in the “real world” that is not the case. MS and computer builders like to add “free sample” software (aka "crapware").  Over time, add some Windows updates, and system checkpoints and oops, you very quickly no longer have the 6-8GB of space required to do the major spring/fall updates.

</p><p>People with 32 GB devices have problems with not enough space to do the major semi annual 'updates'. These updates require 6-8GB of free hard drive space to complete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Correct. Hence the reason for my post</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The suggestion is to create an image copy backup of your current computer so that you have a "known good" fallback point that you can restore to in case of extreme problems. That way you can restore it and get back to work while you look for a longer term
 solution. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">I understand what a backup is. </p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">I need to -update- a computer. Not back one up. I have various fallbacks in place which protect data that i preserve as this is not mine and is protected by various SLAs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This link <br />
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a><br />
is about 'hiding' updates, not just driver updates. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">i have read about hiding updates. i was contractually disallowed from implementing this feature on client's windows personal computers</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">the onus here is not on me to have to find suitable workarounds for microsoft's operating system. this is 2018; if one of the world's largest software - and hardware (upon which their software is supposed to be designed to run
 without massive oversights such as this) manufacturers can not implement updates in such a fashion that takes one of the world's OTHER largest hardware manufacturers most common practices into serious consideration, well, time to move on i guess. and yes,
 i have been doing this for a long time. guess the last twelve to eighteen months has just been the tipping point for me being willing to endure stupid behaviours from manufacturers who are either too desperate, too lazy, not agile or not current enough to
 undertake a program of work that benefits paying users</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&lt;snip&gt; <br />
Asus with 32GB SSD. Windows 10 preinstalled so yes, it is compatible. <br />
&lt;/snip&gt; <br />
<br />
Actually that is not a guarantee it will permanently be "compatible". A few months ago MS created a Win 10 update that made some specific ATOM type CPU's no longer Win 10 compatible. They were just a couple of years old.
<br />
<br />
So yes, go to the appropriate provided link and VERIFY that your computer is STILL / CURRENTLY Windows 10 compatible.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">i did not use the word 'permanently' at any point in my post</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">also see previous reply on microsoft and their own responsibility - either assumed or inferred - in wanting a large part of the population on this planet to partake in the uptake of the operating system that they want used. this
 was not my problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>****************************** <br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt; <br />
So installing this update from ISO media will circumvent the disk space issue, correct?
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt; <br />
<br />
Using an ISO copy of the update file on external storage frees up that amount of space on the HD. This is a good thing since space on this small device is at a premium.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">i do not understand</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">if i do not have this update resident on the actual hard drive - then how could this have 'freed up' that amount of space on the hard drive that was in use</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">i was obliged to find out if i was able to run this update from an external source in order to circumvent the problem of microsoft's update being too large for the non-removable media that was installed within one of more of the
 machines that i was responsible for maintaining</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>******************************* <br />
<br />
For you the situation boils down to 2 options: <br />
. * spend a lot of time going to extremes to free up enough HD space for the update to complete (and be prepared to do it again in 6 months time)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">There is not enough space on the media installed in this personal computer to undertake this. so this is not an option. i want that made clear for any other person invested in, or considering investing in (as i had been up until
 the end of april 2018) purchasing and installing microsoft operating systems and specifically, in this case, 'windows 10'</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>. * do a "clean install" of Windows, forcing you to re-install applications and restore your personal files from a backup location (you have to back them up BEFORE doing the clean install!)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">No. See microsoft's advertising and press release 'offensives' pre-windows 10 release regarding the supposed coming ease of use and end of dreaded 'updates' to their operating system/s</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Devices with 32 GB fall well within MS's minimum specification for Win 10. MS says Win 10 requires "only" 20GB. But that is for a clean install. Windows loves "temp" files. It scatters them all over the installation. And forgets to clean up after itself.
 Office takes up to 4-5GB for a local install depending the specific bundle. So now you are up to 25 of 32 GB. Only 7GB free. Throw in just a very few temp files and you no longer have enough space for the major update ... For example, CCleaner tells me I have
 over 1GB of temp files that can be cleaned up just a few weeks after running CCleaner the last time.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some more clean up tips for you to consider <br />
32GB DEVICES ARE TOO SMALL … <br />
<br />
If you have a 32GB drive, you have my condolences (I just barely dodged that particular bullet myself).
<br />
<br />
MS says that Windows 10 only needs 20GB to install, making a 32GB drive appear adequate.

<br />
But, in the “real world” that is not the case. MS and computer builders like to add “free sample” software (aka "crapware"). Over time, add some Windows updates, and system checkpoints and oops, you very quickly no longer have the 6-8GB of space required to
 do the major spring/fall updates. <br />

</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The only action i have undertaken, which i congratulate no-one other than myself for, is to have prepared my clients - ALL of them - for the possibility late 2016 that i would not be supporting microsoft and its hardware or software
 in the future. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">ironic for some i suppose as i am forced to work on a microsoft computer but then that is not my problem nor my concern</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">my peace of mind has already returned, at least in part, in having begun the process of shipping out all of the asus, hp, dell and other personal computers running windows 10 from my MSP's offices and replacing these will Apple's
 superior offering. </p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">if microsoft cannot even consider current trends - and yes many of those trends INCLUDING SMALLER SSD MEDIA DRIVES become the norm and the standard - when developing its software, it is more than welcome to be consigned to the
 fanboys and those who have both the time and the financial or other resource to pursue ridiculous hurdles such as critical, unavoidable and now impossible updates to its operating system. I'm out and that's that.</p>
