<h2>            Hacking&#47;modding in Dark Souls on Xbox360</h2>
                    
<p>I did not know exactly how or where to report something like this but I've sent emails to NamcoBandai and Microsoft Xbox360 and posted the specific encounter on their forums in hopes that something be done.<br />
<br />
I was PvPing in human form in Anor Londo with a friend of mine playing fair and having fun doing 1v1s and even allowing blue invaders to fight red invaders if they wanted, when a player invaded me as a red phantom, player name (mod removed). This player was
 2handing an unchigatana and casted tranquil walk of peace and began charging us. I counter-casted a tranquil walk of peace and he engaged both of us and just kept auto attacking while completely unaffected by my casting of tranquil walk of peace. My friend
 used 6 wrath of gods castings along with crystal weapon stabbing him in the back and there was no damage appearing at all. This player did NOT have a shield equipped and did NOT cast greater magic shield. After the player took two backstabs I pummeled him
 with great fireballs while he attacked my friend and slowly bleed proc'd him to death. I used greater combustion on him afterwards till he did the same and killed me.<br />
<br />
During the entire time he was moving freely and taking no damage while 2handing his uchigatana.<br />
<br />
I became human again and met my friend once more thinking this wouldn't happen again and of course the same player&nbsp;(mod removed)&nbsp;invaded us. This time we knew who it was and right away we opened up on him with every spell we had. He stood there still displaying
 no damage whatsoever, this time naked and taunting us while getting blasted with greater fireballs and wrath of gods/moonlight great sword beams. He never cast anything but tranquil walk of peace on us so we were slowed and he auto attacked us again till bleed
 procs killed both of us.<br />
<br />
This is obviously a mod/hack for the game which is pretty ridiculous being allowed in the multiplayer. This player was completely invulnerable to all forms of attacks and also invulnerable to status changes such as tranquil walk of peace slow. After checking
 online and discovering that this is present in BOTH platforms(xbox360 and ps3) because people were posting the same kinds of encounters and there are youtube videos present, I decided to attempt to report the player. I've sent emails and made topics posted
 to several websites including Microsoft in hopes to raise some awareness to this and get this fixed ASAP or at least so that player is penalized.<br />
<br />
I understand that Dark Souls may not be the perfect game or have perfect balance, but the game is still fun to play even when I die in PvP. The game has been a great experience until this hacking popped up. The prevalence of this kind of hacking/modding should
 never reach publicity, yet "God Mode" videos exist on youtube and appears to have migrated into the multiplayer.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and I hope awareness of this situation gets those players' accounts penalized as more people report them to BandaiNamco and the proper platform company.(ps3/xbox360)<br />
<br />
Offender Xbox360 account name = (mod removed)<br />
Offense = Hacking making himself invulnerable to all forms of damage and status ailments.<br />

<p>Loli, the best way to deal with someone who has a hacked build like this is to use weapons that have bleed effects. &nbsp;Bleed is the one thing that those hacked toons are vulnerable to. &nbsp;If one of you has a dex build, the Lifehunt Scythe will be a fantastic
 weapon. &nbsp;If two of you attack him with bleed weps like katanas or spiked weapons, it will tear off 30% of his health (50% if you use the Lifehunt) immediately.<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation, these hacked builds aren't very common.&nbsp; I've been playing online in many PvP sessions, and haven't seen one yet in either the DLC or regular areas.&nbsp; There are a few trolling around, but not as many as people think.</p>

<h3> johnnybegoode77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Android app does not work with bluetooth speaker v2.1 &#43;EDR</h2>
                    <p>Bought my aging parent a bluetooth speaker because they cannot hear me on their tablets and cell phone.</p>
<p>The bluetooth speaker with built in mic is v.2.1 +EDR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speaker works with other radio and video app.</p>
<p>https://www.amazon.com/TopePop-Portable-Bluetooth-microphone-Smartphones/dp/B017EL24XI/ref=sr_1_5?s=aht&amp;srs=12689156011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1496944273&amp;sr=1-5</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there is no sound coming out of the speaker when using the Skype android app even when both the speaker and android device's "bluetooth/media/notification/everything else" volume are set to full.</p>
<p>I am using the latest updated version of the android Skype app.</p>
<p>I also checked all the settings on Skype to make sure everything is in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can hear them, however I'm not sure if it is the mic on the android device or the the mic on the bluetooth speaker that pick it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is likely a "Microsoft software issue".<br />
What are the bluetooth versions that Skype android app support?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not all Bluetooth headset features may be available when making a call with Skype. You may check on this link “<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10617/how-do-i-use-a-bluetooth-device-with-skype?q=bluetooth+devices&amp;platform=android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bluetooth

<p>
</p><p>Thanks! I'd tried more than everything and beyond the suggestions in those chain of links.</p>
<p>By the way, I was referring to&nbsp;Skype Android app not PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not not seeking any other special features, and certainly not all but only one feature.</p>
<p>I just want sound coming out from the bluetooth speaker when using the Skype Android app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just asking for sound to come out of the bluetooth speaker!</p>
<p>Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the only purpose that the bluetooth speaker is for (Sound) and that is also where Skype Android app fails badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reasons like incompatibility with phone/tablet/speaker is not the fault of the user/manufacturer of bluetooth devices but the app itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app is not capable of doing the simple task.</p>
<p>That is sending Sound to every bluetooth speaker like what any other app does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular Bluetooth speaker connects to the android phone/tablet and sounds work with every other app except Skype, then the problem is with Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this is at the core of Microsoft's software writing culture.</p>
<p>There is always something that would get ****!</p>
<p>It is never plug and play and would never be.</p>
<p>You could take ages just to get the device to perform a simple task that it is suppose to</p>
<p>and would never ever get it to perform.</p>
<p>It is a waste of time and money to deal with most MS's product.</p>
<p>Problem like this probably creep in after MS acquires Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it get fixed but then I should not get my hopes up.</p>
<p>Maybe you could only get sounds from bluetooth speakers using the latest BT version or you have to get those high end bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p>Those cheap ones would not work.</p>
<p>This is how PC works too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no mention on description of the android Skype app that it does not support Bluetooth&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">v.2.1 +EDR anymore. This is really frustrating.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Why not, and why it doesn't work anymore. That is how MS sucks.</span></p>

<p>Hi John, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I understand your pain (in a way) because I have a different kind of problem with bluetooth. Can I ask you how did you access the skype settings on the latest version of skype? I somehow am unable to find it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my suggestion, in case you're still struggling with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, test the speaker with any other calling app like your phone. Check if the call is being connected and audio is being sent and received correctly (then it's a microsoft software issue). Next steps:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn off any applications that you think are using the bluetooth device like music players, other calling apps, etc.
</p>
<p>2. Restart skype and make a voice call. (if it's an android, I recommend you first clear your recents app and then go to Settings --&gt; Apps --&gt; Skype --&gt; Force Stop).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my post on Microsoft community: </p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope you find a solution to your problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Varun </p>

<p>I have the exact same issue with my bluetooth headset and Skype on Android (Galaxy)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headset works just fine with youtube, music, movies etc. Sound is clear.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I try Skype, and receive a call, it rings on the phone, the caller also comes through the phone's speaker and not my headphones.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried rebooting the phone to make sure nothing is using bluetooth, only skype loaded. Same deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype will just not work with bluetooth properly and from the older forums and google searches, it would seem this has been an issue for many users and for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this day and age, surely Skype should be working with bluetooth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on please fix this. Not only is this very bad for people with headphones, but also for those who like to use Skype hands free when driving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This HAS to be fixed and soon!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. I too got a Bluetooth speaker (REMAX RB-M10 v4.1) for my dad who is hard of hearing. I am able to play music from 3G mobile calls, WhatsApp calls, internet radio, YouTube, etc. Also, I have another Bluetooth earpiece (JABRA TAG)
 with no problem even with Skype. Only the Bluetooth speaker just simply doesn't work with Skype. When I tried to swap between phone speaker and phone loudspeaker and Bluetooth, only my JABRA have the Bluetooth option. The REMAX speaker does not have the Bluetooth
 option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Skype is able to find the problem and come out with a solution quickly.</p>

<p>

<p>I just bought a pair of bluetooth sony headset and could not get it work on Skype app for android. There is not option to setup audio device in the app, or at least i cannot find it.
</p>
<p>Then I found this thread. Is it still so that skype does not support bluetooth speaker/headsets? or does it rquire some tweak to make it work?</p>

<p>The issue is definitely the Skype for Android App. I have Skype for Business on the same Android Phone and it works fine. Microsoft please address and resolve ASAP. I've been a Skype subscriber for 11 years using iPhone and rarely had any issues. I moved
 to an Android and this is a show stopper for me at this point. I need my Skype Bluetooth calls.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>After Windows 10 upgrade - wrong AMD driver got installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsbubbleelee  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 upgrade - wrong AMD driver got installed</h2>
                    <p>So now all I see is a blank screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Laptop starts fine enough, the regular noise, the new Win 10 logo starts, then nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I asked about the upgrade, I was told that Win 10 said that the AMD driver needed to be updated, so the person selected 32bit, and I think it should have been 64bit driver. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family. I would be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From the description of the issue, I understand that you are experiencing a black screen after Windows 10 upgrade.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could occur due to incompatible, outdated or corrupted device drivers. You can also check if detaching all other peripheral devices except for keyboard and mouse works out the issue. Also,
</span></span>try unplugging HDMI cables and all TVs or monitors except for your main.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue (black screen) you’re facing could be most likely related to display drivers and could be resolved by updating the drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to open the Task Manager and run the System File Checker tool to rectify any issue with System File integrity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow below.</p>
<p>1. Open task manager&nbsp;by pressing&nbsp;<strong>ctrl</strong>, <strong>alt</strong>, and
<strong>delete</strong> at the same time&nbsp;and clicking on it from the given menu</p>
<p>2. In task manager, go to <strong>file</strong> and select <strong>run new task</strong>.</p>
<p>3. In the create new task window, check the box next to the text "<strong>create this task with administrative privileges</strong>".</p>
<p>4. Type in&nbsp; <strong>cmd</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;then press enter ,which will bring up the Command Prompt Window.</p>
<p>5. in windows command prompt, type in "sfc /scannow" ,which scans integrity of all protected system files and repairs files with problems when possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In some of the rare cases it may be the login screen where you are stuck with the cursor blinking.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p>1) In the black screen click once to activate the screen.</p>
<p>2) Tap the CTRL key (it activates the invisible password field)</p>
<p>3) Enter your password and hit enter</p>
<p>This will activate explorer after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer starts successfully, update the driver for the graphic device on your computer.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see the black screen <strong><span>only</span></strong> <strong><span>after sign-in
</span></strong>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></li><li><span>If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>If this resolves the black screen, use corruption resolution steps (dism, then sfc), and run the all apps PowerShell command in
<a href="https://vkbexternal.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/VKBWebService/ViewContent.aspx?scid=KB%3ben-US%3b3080495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">3080495</span></span></a>.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>If this does not work, use File, Run new task in Task Manager to start an Administrator CMD window. Use this to create a new administrator user with the following commands (changing “&lt;password&gt;” to something of the customer’s choosing):<br />
</span><span>net user test &lt;password&gt; /add<br />
net localgroup Administrators test /add</span><span> </span></li><li><span>This will give you a test user to try, which will confirm if the issue is user or system-specific.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen <strong><span>before sign-in</span></strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></li><li><span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters </span>
<ul>
<li><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></li><li><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>

            I had a problem with the driver and rolled it back in device manager because it was marked with a yellow triangle. This was working ok. Then I started getting low memory warnings so I went to Device Manager again. This time I updated the Display driver
 in Device Manager and it has been working well.

<h2>            Image Backup Software Not Working After Creators Update</h2>
                    After installing the Creators Update, Maxtor Maxblast 5 and Seagate Disk Wizard no longer work. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling both. Maxblast 5&nbsp; will open, but the program stops working after choosing a disk for the image backup. Disk Wizard
 will not start. I had used Maxblast 5 a short time prior to installing the Creators Update with no problems. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

            Thank you for the reply. I have a couple of days left to decide if I want to do the rollback, but that is probably the route I will take. Maxblast support was discontinued when they merged with Seagate over a decade ago. Disk Wizard v18 was supported for
 Windows 10, but I don't know if they will update for the Creators Update. Both are actually just versions of Acronis True Image provided by the hard drive manufacturers. I have noticed online that Acronis True Image users are having issues with the update
 as well and Acronis is trying to address them.<br />
<br />
I do understand that software does sometimes become obsolete, but Maxblast has performed flawlessly through many versions of Windows including the Windows 10 Insider Previews, the Original Windows 10 Release, and the Anniversary Update. Hopefully, as Microsoft
 addresses the many bugs of this update, my Maxblast will work once again.

            Hi <strong>Cizzy</strong> ,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
<strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows 7 Answers Forum!</span>
</strong></p>
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Touch Pack will be available Windows 7 Ultimate, Professional, and Home Premium operating system. Touch Pack will be preinstalled on OEM machines and are not intended for end-user installations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft won’t provide standalone downloadable setup installer or update package via Windows Update
<br />
(WU) to deliver Touch Pack for supported Windows 7 editions. So,&nbsp;make sure Touch Pack is installed and available before ordering a branded computer with capability.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7, you have to get in touch with Dell to get it installed on your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can read the document below which gives a brief introduction to Windows Touch Pack.<br />

<p>It means that the nVIDIA Control Panel(C:\Windows\System32\nvcplui.exe) is partly corrupted. You can't&nbsp;reinstall this program&nbsp;from anywhere, so you should do a restore point to before when the trouble started.<br />

            I was logged in as a standard user when this happened. I logged in as administrator and it was working properly there. I can go back to standard user and there is a problem. Why is that? Do I still need to restore at a point before that?

<br />
That's odd. Maybe your standard account is corrupted so why not try on/create another standard to see if it will work there.<br />
System Restore should still fix it though.

<h2>            Windows 10 Exit Sound Not Playing</h2>
                    <p><strong>I entered the prompt in the registry and I did set it to 0. "Exit Windows" does appear in my sound options. I just have trouble for it making sound.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After I changed the sound for "Exit Windows", there's no shutdown sound, and that makes me a bit frustrated. I even tried adding the "Windows Logoff" sound, and that didn't work either. Can someone please help me? How do I make the "Exit Windows" sound actually
 work?</p>

</p><blockquote>Does anyone know if there is a way to revert back to the regular looking Skype for Windows? It has worked just fine for me for years.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I was talked through such a reversion on my Mac by Skype support (Chat). It was a little complicated on the Mac. I think it's easier on a PC. See the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that in order to not have the newer version automatically overwrite this "classic" version, you may have to change the name of the .EXE file, e.g. to something like "Classic Skype.EXE" This is what they did with it on my Mac. Different process, but
 same idea. See how you go.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access Redeem page</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
I'm having a problem with "Redeem" function on my account.&nbsp;I'm getting the following error whenever I go to the Redeem page (from the Browser of from the Store app):<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Give us a little while to fix this<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something’s wrong on our side. For now, you may want to try searching for something else.<br />
<br />
It's been like that for the last 2 weeks, when I got the new laptop and upgraded to Windows 10 and tried to redeem Minecraft for Windows 10. The Microsoft account I'm using is based on a Hotmail address I've had for years, but this is the first time I've used
 it to log into the Store app and tried to redeem a code.

<p>Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>1. How are you trying to burn the disc? <br />
2. Are you using non ms program or ms program to burn?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the disc inserted is identified as "Blank disc" in the Navigation pane but a message in the List pane instructs you to insert a writable disc, the disc might be defective or no longer writable. This disc might not be writable, for example, if you previously
 tried to burn items to the disc but you stopped the burn before it was finished. Try inserting a writable disc that you have not previously used.<br />
Refer this link.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
<br />
Try these steps and check if that helps.<br />
If your computer has a CD or DVD burner, you can copy files to a writable disc. This process is called burning a disc. Windows burns discs in the Live File System format or in the Mastered format, depending on which disc format you choose. For more information
 about deciding which format you should choose when burning a disc, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Which-CD-or-DVD-format-should-I-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Which-CD-or-DVD-format-should-I-use</a><br />
<br />
Choose the Live File System format when you want to burn a data disc that will play in a computer running Windows XP or later.
<br />
1. Insert a writable disc, such as a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, or DVD+RW disc, into your computer's CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Disc burner.<br />
2. In the AutoPlay dialog box that appears, click Burn files to disc using Windows Explorer.<br />
If the AutoPlay dialog box doesn't appear, click the Start button , click Computer, and then double-click your disc burner.<br />
3. In the Burn a Disc dialog box, type a name for this disc in the Disc title box, click Like a USB flash drive, and then click next.<br />
This is the option for burning a disc that uses the Live File System disc format. It might take several minutes for the disc to be formatted. When the formatting is complete, an empty disc folder opens.<br />
4. Open the folder that contains the files you want to burn, and then drag the files into the empty disc folder.<br />
To select more than one item, press and hold the Ctrl key, and then click the files you want to burn.<br />
As you drag files into the disc folder, they are copied automatically to the disc.<br />
You can copy files (or entire folders) to the disc folder by dragging them to the disc icon or to an open disc folder<br />
5. After copying the files and folders, you might need to close the disc session. For more information, see

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Close-or-finalize-a-CD-or-DVD</a><br />
<br />
Choose the Mastered format when you need a disc that will play on any computer or in some different consumer electronic devices, such as CD, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc players, that can play digital music files, pictures, or video files.
<br />
1. Insert a writable disc, such as a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, or DVD+RW disc, into your computer's CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Disc burner.<br />
2. In the AutoPlay dialog box that appears, click Burn files to disc using Windows Explorer.<br />
If the AutoPlay dialog box doesn't appear, click the Start button , click Computer, and then double-click your disc burner.<br />
3. In the Burn a Disc dialog box, type a name for this disc in the Disc title box, click With a CD/DVD player, and then click next.<br />
4. Open the folder that contains the files you want to burn, and then drag the files into the empty disc folder.<br />
To select more than one item, press and hold the Ctrl key, and then click the files you want to burn.<br />
5. On the toolbar, click Burn to disc, and then follow the steps in the wizard.<br />
The selected files are copied to the disc. When the disc burning is complete, the disc burner tray will open and you can remove the disc. You can now use the disc in another computer or in some CD or DVD players. The disc session is already closed.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Phone on Windows 10 laptop and tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravinray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Phone on Windows 10 laptop and tablet</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop and 8-inch tablet from the same vendor, both upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 Yesterday I discovered the laptop has Microsoft Phone installed, though it doesn't work, but the tablet, which has a Micro-sim slot with a local carrier's
 sim card installed, doesn't have it. Attempting to install Phone on the tablet from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRDTBWP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRDTBWP</a> resulted in "<span>This app does not work on your device." Accessing the URL from my laptop the first time doesn't give me that notification,
 but refreshing it did.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So can Microsoft Phone be installed on my tablet that has a Micro-sim slot? It's ironic that the sim-less laptop has it while the tablet doesn't.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            This seems to be a way to sync and receive calls from your smartphone (Android or iOS) on Windows 10. Although, with more devices coming built in with LTE modems, it will likely facilitate sending and receiving calls directly from your computer.

            Having the Phone app installed doesn't mean you have the Windows Phone operating system on the laptop. I have a desktop device and also see the Phone app in the start menu. If you don't want it there, click Start&gt;Settings&gt;App&gt;Apps and Features, scroll to Phone, select it, and click Uninstall.

<h2>            Simultaneous user accounts</h2>
                    <div>RE: &nbsp;Simultaneous user accounts</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to open another user account in a window and run processes in both user accounts simultaneously? &nbsp;User account switching does not work well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I inherited a system where my predecessor used a number of database queries and crystal report procedures created with his login credentials. &nbsp;When I move some of them to my login, they crash and do not process. &nbsp;If I login to his user account, I lose access
 to my work environment while the queries update until I finish the procedure. &nbsp;Some of these process take 30 minutes to multiple hours to process. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found that if I simply start the process then switch users, the processes do not always work. &nbsp;This forces me to switch users, run the process and idle myself until finished. &nbsp;The processes are rather complex and will take a great deal of time to
 debug all of them in my user environment. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm afraid using a virtual machine will give us the same issues updating the data. &nbsp;I've searched the topic and do not find a solution that is on point, most are leading me to a virtual machine or there is not a solution. &nbsp;</div>

If these processes crash under your account and stall while they run in a session that is currently not the foreground session then they are held together with pieces of string and sealing wax. Debugging them would be a very time-consuming exercise, if at all
 possible. The cheapest option is to run them on a dedicated machine. Hardware is cheap these days!

Sorry, no "dual" accounts with Windows 7. One account can be interactive, the others must run in the background.

<p><strong>I just purchased a new PC with Windows 7 Home Premium. I want to use the Parental Controls to "assist" our 12 year old son with time management, however, I also want him to be able to download his games and programs he needs for school without having
 to come sign in as Administrator to allow it. Isn't there a way to set some kind of group policy that will allow him those permissions? Even a standard user at work has permission to install programs on his or her personal laptop that he needs to do the job.&nbsp;</strong></p>

            You should be able to make him a&nbsp;power user, and then put parental controls on for the account. I'm not next to a windows 7 machine, so i'll try it when i get by one.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not completely.&nbsp; The Poweer users group still exists in both Vista and Windows 7.&nbsp; From the MMC description: "Power Users are included for backwards compatibility and possess limited administrative powers."</p>

            But the ACL entries are completely removed. So Power Users group is useless.

<p>Sorry about that power users, i was using Vista and not near windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as i can tell, the closest thing you can get on Home Premium is to turn off UAC, but even then, sometimes programs won't install.</p>

<p>I'm looking to do exactly the same thing. In addition, I keep most of my files on a networked drive but don't want my son to have access to those files. I really need help, ASAP.</p>

            Well to keep your files safe on the network drive, maybe a username and password login, or a firewall with hostnames or ip's will keep it safe.&nbsp; I'm still not sure if you can do what you want to with Home Premium as far as the restricted user. As far as
 i can tell, you have to be on Pro or above.

<p>So far, I haven't had any luck with that - I thought that only I could access those files through passwords but that's not the case.&nbsp; I can access all of the files with Windows 7 Home Premium. I haven't had my system set up this was before and the old "Power
 User" account sounds like that's what I need. If that's not possible, then there must be another way. Obviously, I'm not a network person.</p>
