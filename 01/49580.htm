<h2>            AMD&#47;ATI video driver has stopped working properly</h2>
                    <p>Some elements on web pages have ceased to function.&nbsp; For instance the information tiles on a Fitbit dashboard homepage will not display their information.&nbsp; When I checked the computer's status a message in the System Action Center had two messages that said
 the AMD/ATI Video Driver has stopped working properly.&nbsp; When I click the icon for more information one sent me to a KB article on HP's website.&nbsp; Not helpful to me.&nbsp; The other one says I can't download the solution and to check my internet connection (which
 is working fine).<br />
<br />
I tried to install a new AMD driver that their website suggested after retrieving my card info, but halfway thru the computer went into safe mode and a minute or two later shut down, stopping the install.&nbsp; Obviously I wasn't suppose to do that!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/amdati-graphics-driver-wont-install-without/3eb41da4-c6a5-420b-889f-3058f8f5243d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/amdati-graphics-driver-wont-install-without/3eb41da4-c6a5-420b-889f-3058f8f5243d</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AMD/ATI Graphics Driver won't install without computer stepping in and shutting down.
<div>I followed Mr. Stuart's advice and removed all AMD/ATI driver programs and went thru the install for new driver. Once again it loaded 130+mgb of info and part way through the installation process, the computer spontaneously shut down "to protect information,"
 or something on that order. <br />

            <p>​Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually this type of issues occur when there is any third party program/app is causing this issue. You may also face this issue if the driver is not removed completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to remove the driver software from the Device Manager and then try to install the latest driver from the AMD website and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>To uninstall from device manager follow the steps given below. To uninstall drivers</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span> </span></span></span><span><span>Click on Start menu, type in

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)</span><span> </span></span></span><span><span>The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)</span><span> </span></span></span><span><span>Expand the category for Display adapters.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)</span><span> </span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the device and select Properties.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)</span><span> </span></span></span><span><span>Select the Driver tab on the device's Properties dialog box.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)</span><span> </span></span></span><span><span>Click the Uninstall Driver button.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed.
</span></span></p>
<p>Once you have removed the driver software completely, try installing the latest driver software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you in a better way.</p>

            Hi, to boot your PC straight to the Desktop, without the need for a password, like previous versions of Windows, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h2>            I think I got double charged for a Pre-Order&#63; How is this possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!
 I hope I'm in the right place - I can't find a way to send a support ticket in the traditional 'e-mail' form.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I recently pre-ordered Madden Legendary Edition - prior to launch, as I navigated to the Xbox Dashboard and saw it still read "Pre-order" last night prior to launch - I thought I *had* pre-ordered, but the store didn't reflect that. Not wanting to miss out
 on pre-order bonuses. I made sure to pre-order then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out I was right. I had pre-ordered a couple of weeks earlier - see attached.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Question: How is it possible to pre-order a game twice? Anddddd can I *not* pay for the same game twice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Mail app doesn't offer the ability to create/delete/rename folders within the app. Maybe it will, later. But, it doesn't now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using an Outlook.com account, you can log into its web interface and create/delete/rename folders there. &nbsp;Earlier, these changes were not synching to Mail app, as I complained above. &nbsp;But, within the last week, presumably due to the last Mail
 update, they are in synch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User-created folders on an IMAP account ought to sync, as well, but I haven't checked that.</p>

</p><p>Don't know if it helps, but Windows Update always shows that "We'll finish installing some updates the next time your PC is restarted". I've restarted plenty of times but this same message keeps showing in WU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Rakesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice. I tried to do a clean boot and upgrade but still nothing. To add insult to injury, my Windows seems to be prompting me to upgrade more often than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be something to do with not being able to access the update server? When I go to Windows Update and try to check for updates, I never get anywhere. The computer just tries to retrieve new updates but never succeeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully there's something else I can try.</p>

<h2>            Black Screen after running chkdsk - Explorer.exe won&#39;t start</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>I have seen others with this problem but I haven't found a solution and maybe my situation is unique, I don't know, I just know I need
 help!</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During the last week I noticed Norton antivirus was not running.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had to reinstall it to get it working.<span>&nbsp; </span>As I didn't actually know how long this had been off I ran a scan (found a few cookies that didn’t seem very problematic) and ran spybot as well to be sure.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Spybot found others but would not let me repair them successfully but these also seemed non-threatening.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried to restore at an earlier date but it would not let me do this nor would it successfully backup either.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also wouldn't successfully install windows updates either.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I ran chkdsk on drive C: and rebooted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I got the black screen after the "welcome" screen with a moveable curser and the first thing that pops up is "Windows Calendar Not responding" or something like that, then another pop
 up says the screensaver won't load and than windows update thing comes up where I can get on the internet but still can't do any windows updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A friend showed me how to run explore.exe though the task manager but that only worked once.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can't get it to load up.<span>&nbsp; </span>I really don't want to reinstall Vista so is there a fix?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can get into safe mode fine and see my files.<span>&nbsp; </span>I desperately need help!!! Thanks!</span></p>

            Malke is right - re-installing Vista is probably the best thing for you to do (after you backup your data); but if you want to try some lesser measures that guarantee no results (since I happen to agree with her that lesser measures won't fully resolve
 the problem), we can go over a few of them:<br />
<br />
I suggest you backup your important data first before trying anything as we can't be sure when or if you'll lose access to safe mode as well - it sounds like your problems are getting worse as time goes on.<br />
<br />
First we need to deal with the potential infection.&nbsp; Running a series of anti-malware programs is the way to go (not just one or two which may miss something).&nbsp;
<span>
While in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Safe Mode</span> with networking (click repeatedly on F8 during the boot process) try to run anti-malware programs.&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp; install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). And just to make sure you don't have any rootkits, run
<a href="http://www.greatis.com/unhackme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.greatis.com/unhackme/</a>.&nbsp; Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a> and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background) - this one can be run while your normal AV program is installed and running.&nbsp;
 Hopefully running all these scans will take care of any infection you may have had.<br />
<br />
Next, we need to deal with the damage done by the infection (or whatever happened to your system).<br />
<br />
<span>Do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to identify the corrupt files if any (and yes, I know how HUGE the listing is).&nbsp; Reboot after the scan.<br />
<br />
<span>
we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a></span><span>.<br />
</span><br />
</span>If after this you still can only boot into safe mode (you can't get into normal mode), then
<span>
I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix </span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way but if you can still access through safe mode then you can do it more normally) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either
 using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk with the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...<br />
</span><br />
This last step is the one Malke recommended as her choice and it may be the only choice given your circumstances - but I thought I'd give you some options to try that will cost you only some time (perhaps even wasted time since I happen to agree with Malke
 that re-installing Vista is the best solution and that it may turn out to be the only solution).<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck and I wish you all the best.</span>

            It sounds like your computer is severely infected. Running Chkdsk was not a good step as it probably scrambled up an already-messed up system which was probably damaged by the infections. I understand that you don't want to reinstall Windows but this is
 probably the best thing for you to do.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).

            <p><span>Hi Richardson,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The above issue might occur if the graphics card installed on the computer in non-updated or incompatible with Windows 10 OS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li><li><span>Since when are you facing the above issue? Did you make any recent system changes?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error message or error code when the screen flashes?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if similar issue persists on booting the computer in <strong>
Safe mode</strong>?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Boot the PC in <strong>Safe mode with networking</strong> to diagnose if the issue is caused due to any of the corrupted, incompatible or faulty device drivers installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Expand the options to boot into <strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>

    <title>Laptop randomly restarts while playing games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roboticj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop randomly restarts while playing games</h2>
                    My Toshiba Satellite L505D-LS5006 has run games such as "Minecraft" or "Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars" perfectly fine in the past, but lately if I play them for 30-45 minutes, the screen will go black and the system restarts. What could be causing
 this and can I fix it? Here are my specs:<br />
<br />
Manufacturer: TOSHIBA<br />
<br />
Model: Satellite L505D<br />
<br />
Rating: 4.0 Windows Experience Index<br />
<br />
Processor: AMD Athlon(tm) II Dual-Core M300 2.00 GHz<br />
<br />
Installed Mamory (RAM): 4.00 GB (3.50 usable)<br />
<br />
System type: 32-bit Operating System<br />
<br />
If those are helpful. Thanks.

            I have tested this for several days now, and, yes, the problem only occurs while playing games. I can leave the computer idle for hours without a restart or even open several programs like Microsoft Office or Finale 2012 and use them without problem, but
 the problem only occurs in games like Minecraft.<br />
<br />
By changes, do you mean repairs, or do you mean software. I recently had the computer sent in for repair through a SAMS Club extended warranty (due to Toshiba's expiring) and the result was to replace the motherboard, wipe the 288 GB hard drive, and clean the
 cooling fan and heat-sink. Software wise, I have not recently installed software except for a trial of Windowblinds, which didn't work correctly anyway, so I uninstalled it.<br />

            I have been testing different things lately, and one was to open task manaer and change the processor priority of my video games to high when running. This appears to have worked and I no longer have random restarts. Thanks for your help though.<br />
<br />
Edit: I take that back, it still happens.<br />

            <p>Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I assumed yours was still being supported by HP** but I now appreciate that it is not [so I assume that it is over 10 years old as that is their general support period].&nbsp; {**
<em>Mine is a DJ 2540 and is only a few years old so I thought a DJ 5440 must be newer</em>}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that HP give you generic instructions about installing drivers in <a href="http://support.hp.com/gb-en/product/hp-deskjet-5440-printer-series/445466/model/445467/document/c01796879/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.hp.com/gb-en/product/hp-deskjet-5440-printer-series/445466/model/445467/document/c01796879/</a>&nbsp; I checked the
<a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft update catalog service</a>&nbsp;and found nothing for HP Deskjet 5440 so that's why you are having no success with the generic instructions they gave you as those instructions
 seem to pre-suppose the existence of a recognised Windows driver for that specific model.&nbsp; {HP must have given up on your specific model before this catalog was compiled as the hardware makers are the ones who log their drivers in it}</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being the case, my suggestions might solve your problem or might not.&nbsp; They are simply the steps that I think are most likely to be successful.&nbsp; Personally, I would make a system image before trying each of these suggestions so that you can get back
 to square one if anything goes horribly wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion 1 - Go to the <em>Devices &amp; printers</em> dialog, click on <em>Add a printer</em>, select
<em>HP</em> then select <em>HP Deskjet 5400 series</em> [the sequence in the list is awkward, this entry is about 10% of the way down the list], Click
<em>Next</em> and follow the menu-driven procedure through to its conclusion.&nbsp; Even if this is completely successful, consider running my Suggestion 4 below as well in case of future need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion 2 - Get out whatever driver came with your printer in the first place and try installing that in compatibility mode [right-click on its executable, select the
<em>Compatibility </em>tab, set the checkbox for <em>Run this program in Compatibility mode for ...</em> then select an OS that the printer worked properly with.&nbsp; Then go back to the executable, right-click &amp; select
<em>Run as Admin</em>.&nbsp; This suggestion is not frivolous, until it blew something internally, I was successfully using my 1999/2000 HP Deskjet 1220C this way on Windows 7 x64 for four years [despite the HP user forums implying that this was not possible].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion 3 - Go back to the HP site at <a href="http://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-deskjet-5440-printer-series/445466/model/445467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-deskjet-5440-printer-series/445466/model/445467</a> but select Windows 10 as your OS.&nbsp; In the result<del>s</del>, the Utility-Diagnostic tools item will now contain a generic installer [<a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software13/COL50403/mp-150580-2/hppiw.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="hppiw.exe"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">hppiw.exe</span></a>]
 that is described "<em>The HP Printer Install Wizard for Windows was created to help Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, and Windows 10 users download and install the latest and most appropriate HP software solution for their HP Printer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply run the tool and follow
 the on-screen instructions."&nbsp; </em>Download &amp; run [Run as Admin] that file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion 4 - Log in to an Admin-level account first and then, using IE [it has to be IE], go back to the
<a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft update catalog service</a>&nbsp;and search for
<em>HP Deskjet 5400 series</em>.&nbsp; It will give you a lot of results so click on the driver name in the left-hand
<em>Title </em>column to see the details for each potential choice [including whether it is 32 or 64 bit].&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the list is the [32 bit]
<span><em>Microsoft driver update for HP Deskjet 5400 Series</em> dated 21 June 2006.&nbsp; [You might also wish to download &amp; file away the second item, the 64 bit version,&nbsp;just in case you change computers in the future]&nbsp; Add the chosen driver[s] to the "basket"
 then download - you'll be asked to select a download folder&nbsp;first {it is at this stage that the process would pause without any error message or other explanation if you had not been logged into an Admin-level account before&nbsp;starting IE}.&nbsp;
</span>I think these drivers will also work with Windows 10<em> so, in the hope that your printer keeps running for years to come, it would be well worth your keeping copies of them filed away ready for your next computer to use.&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion&nbsp;5 - Go [back] to the HP user forums for Deskjets &amp; search for 5440.&nbsp; See if any of the other suggestions can help you - unless you already have looked through all the relevant ones [I realise that you have been here once already as one of the
 threads I just looked at was by you].</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no telling, in advance, which of these suggestions will lead to the best possible solution.&nbsp; So please do come back to this forum to explain what happened when you tried them.&nbsp; Your experiences will benefit any other HP Deskjet 5440 users who come
 here searching for guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,</p>

    <title>Unable to connect to Live without running a test first - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> voradors  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect to Live without running a test first</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, my wife and son's accounts have not been able to sign into xbox live automatically.&nbsp; When they try to, they get an error and it asks them to run a test of the network first.&nbsp; The test runs, and completes with no errors (open NAT), and then allows
 them to connect with no additional changes needed.&nbsp; This happens every time we boot up the xbox.</p>
<p>A few changes happened when this started, and i am unsure what the cause is:</p>
<p>1 - I purchased an Xbox Slim, and gave my Elite to my wife and her standard Xbox to my son.&nbsp; Transfered my data from my 120 GB HDD to the Slim's 250 GB, and then gave the old 120GB to my son.&nbsp; Wife's hard drive stayed the same.</p>
<p>2 - Recently added the son's account to the family plan. (dont think this is the cause, since my account is on the plan as well and i dont have this issue)</p>
<p>All Xbox's have port forwarding on the switch and have open NATs with no network problems.&nbsp; Once the test completes, there are no issues.&nbsp; I have played a few XBL arcade games to see if this could be related to some weird DRM issue, but i havent had any
 problems. </p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>I am just guessing here. &nbsp;But I would first suspect the harddrive swaps as being the cause.</p>
<p>I would suspect that there are some old "settings" of some kind still on the harddrives that have been moved to a different Xbox. &nbsp; Try going to &nbsp;your son's Xbox and run the "Restore to factory defaults" function and then reboot his xbox. After it reboots,
 if you use some manual network settings, go into his Network settings and re-enter the manual information. &nbsp; Then see if it makes any difference.</p>

<p>So the profiles were moved to the different consoles via a memory stick or transfer cable, then? Can you try recovering their accounts to their respective consoles, to see if that allows them to connect to LIVE without running a test?</p>

<h2>            April 2018 Feature update makes machine slow</h2>
                    <p>Just get April Feature updates. Machine appears to be slower. It looks at the fonts rending and graphics become a little different by visual (looks sharper) and I suspect that's what makes machine slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any suggestions or advice on how to go back to the pre-update performance?</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>No, the key which can be used with either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 is only intended for use with 1 of the disk. You cannot use it to install both. 1 license, 1 installation, so choose wisely. If you want to install Windows 7 32 or 64 bit on another partition
 or another computer, you will need to purchase an additional license. </p>

            <p>Dear mge80,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the license is for two p.c.'s or more, which I doubt, then No you can't run two p.c.'s on one license regardless of the ownership and location of the machines. I'm not an expert or employee of Microsoft's but I'm sure that it's one license per p.c.&nbsp;
 if you could do what you suggest it would be open to abuse by unscrupulous people with phantom relatives secreted all over the world.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by some bizarre reason you are allowed to share a license, please post a response so that I can unearth a few relatives to share the cost of a new Windows installation. If you want free computing look to "Linux Ubuntu", the latest version will be released
 in a day or two and is completely free unconditionally and forever. If manufacturers supplied Linux drivers with their hardware, I I for one would abandon "Windows after the Infamous Win 10. updating nightmare from Windows7, to Windows 10 minutes, causing
 ruined computers and many distraught p,c, users. I luckily had backed up all my data and documents and was able to rescue mine after several failed attempts at updating. I did eventually get Windows 10 but on the wrong drive,aand none of my programs were installed
 and the s,s,d which formerly held&nbsp; Win 7, all my programs and my sanity was now filled with indiscernible "gobbledygook". I reckon I've wasted roughly three weeks achieving a version of Windows 10 for about 10 minutes, hence the name Windows 10, at the cost
 of a corrupted computer and brain damage. I have managed to get my p.c. back to a usable state because I had created a system image and a back up of all my personal stuff but I am having the joys of owning this wonderful operating system forced on me by Windows
 update trying to download and install it almost daily. Microsoft, I don't want Windows 10, till it install cleanly and easily so please don't bother me till it's ready for me and thousands of others to install properly and easily.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the rant, Liz</p>

            This suggest there is a connection failure.

Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
Scroll down to Network adapters
Select Network adapters
Click Run the Troubleshooter

When complete, restart then try accessing the webpage again.

Does the issue occur in other web browsers?

If the problem persists:

Try resetting Microsoft Edge:

Open Start, type: powershell
Right click PowerShell then click Run as administrator

At the prompt, type: 

Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}

Hit Enter

When complete, exit PowerShell, restart your computer then check if Edge is working again.

<h3> rudo roemer  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB3147458 installs with date 1&#47;1&#47;1601 and keeps reisnatalling upon uninstalling with same date.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my KB3147458 update installs, but claims under "Installed Updates" to have been installed on 1/1/1601. Windows update then thinks it needs reinstallation, tries to do it after each restart but always ends up with the same 1/1/1601 date and hence upon reboot
 wants to repeat the whole process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manual "uninstall" and reboot does not solve the problem, the new install again ends up being fom 1/1/1601.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is to be done? Thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>I am afraid this hasn't worked. I did what was required for a clean boot and restarted. Initially, some AVG free anti-virus software was still running, so I removed this fully from the machine. The restarted to check that clean-boot conditions are now fullfilled.
 They are. The did the update for "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3147458)". However, the system restarts (warns as usual not to switch off the machine, gets to 35% in the update process, then shows to login screen).
 But upon inspection, it always says "We couldn't finish installing updates". Then reloads the KB3147458 and process starts again.</p>

    <title>Win 10 won&#39;t lower fan speed after Creator Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metalbunny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 won&#39;t lower fan speed after Creator Update</h2>
                    <p>My 6 month old Asus X556UQ laptop (Intel i5-7200U) was super quiet before; most the time it didn't make any noticeable sound at all. It's got a SSD and no other drives, so the cooling fan is literally the only moving part and the only thing that can even
 cause noise. BUT the fan used to barely ever run even when I watched HD video, and basically never span up to any noticeable noise level unless I ran something that used the secondary Geforce GPU (instead of the Intel GPU).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, thanks to the creator update the fan is almost constantly running quite high for no reason, which gets really annoying really fast. I got the latest drivers I could find - most haven't been updated since I checked for updates a few months ago - reinstalled
 them all, and it made no difference.&nbsp; According to device manager it IS using the Intel thermal driver (provided by Asus), which I assume would mean it works properly. I also updated the BIOS while I was at it, just to be safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cooling policy is set to "active" when plugged in and "passive" when on battery, but it's always been like that and before this update it made no difference, the fan was still able to stop when not needed. Now the fan runs much higher all the time, and
 yet the CPU speeds, loads, or temperatures it runs at haven't changed at all. Lowest load (idling with 50% memory load) is 4-8% @ 0.8-1 GHz w. ~30 C CPU temp - at which point the fan literally isn't needed, but it's still running quite high. Playing 1080p30
 video the load jumps to 30-40% @ 3.1 GHz, but the temp only goes up to 45-50 C and yet the fan will ramp up until it's very loud after a couple minutes. (OpenHardwareMonitor can't show the fan speed on Win10, so have to go by noise levels).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also after this update, whenever the CPU heats up the slightest the fan will ramp up to highest speed (which can get obnoxiously loud) and when the CPU then cools off the fan will continue running that high for half an hour to an hour (sometimes longer)
 before it begins to throttle down, but it never drops down to be quiet anymore. Before the update, the fan would slow down almost immediately and become unnoticeable after a few minutes - that's how it's supposed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching to passive cooling also makes no difference (whether plugged in or not), other than the fan sometimes shuts down when idling (but not always anymore which is yet another problem and a serious issue for the battery life).</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the ASUS computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3a. Is it hot where you live right now and if so, is the laptop used in an air-conditioned (or at least well-ventilated) room?
<br />
<br />3b. If you elevate the laptop such that there's about a ¼" of space between the bottom and the surface it's resting on (preferably a hard, clean surface, not your lap), does the behavior persist? 
<br />

<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

            I have seen this complaint a couple of times recently.  I don't recall seeing a fix yet.
<br />
<br />There is a workaround you can try. There are a number of 3rd party tools you can install that claim to be able to allow you to control your cooling fans.  Here is a search I did that listed a few, and a few reviews of the class. It appears that you may have to try more than one before you find one that works. (Make sure to uninstall each one before installing the next. Having more than one installed could lead to conflicts, like running more than one antivirus at the same time).

<p>1. Purchased in mid-February.</p>
<p>2. Came with Win 10 installed. And hardware drivers only exist for Win 10.</p>
<p>3. No, it's not hot (gets up to about 23-24 C ambient throughout the entire year), and the laptop feels cold to the touch. Air-condition is non-existent in this part of the world (Denmark).</p>
<p>3b. Makes no difference. It's a mono-shell body similar to Apple's design, meaning air is sucked in through the keyboard and blow out through vents in the hinge. There are no vents in the bottom. Gave it a good blow with the compressed air, makes no difference.</p>
<p>4. It originally came with a trial of McAfee something. Uninstalled it the day of purchase and purged it with McAfee's clean scrubber. Using Avast free with all the pointless features removed instead.</p>
<p>5. See #4</p>
<p>6. Win 10 version 1703 (build 15063.674).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worth noting that after after I wrote the first post, Windows updated and the fan's been mostly running at what I believe is the lowest speed since. Usually I cannot tell from the CPU load that Windows update is running, so don't know if all the noise I've
 been noticing is from that (I don't know if the fan triggers from the wifi usage).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also forgot to mention that Cortana doesn't work here (language/region conflict) so it doesn't and cannot run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't think about it before, but realized last night that task manager only shows the overall CPU load and that I have to use resource monitor or afterburner to see the load on each core, so don't know if there's been something running (like WAU) on one
 of the cores that I just haven't noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not solved, but definitely behaving better after last night's update. Fan still runs on passive, which I do believe it shouldn't, but I use it so rarely I may just never have noticed it.</p>

            1. May we assume that "last night's update" was KB4041676 (since you're running OS Build 15063.674) now?
<br />
<br />2. Did you (a) uninstall the McAfee free-trialware AND THEN (b) download/ run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed Avast Free?
<br />
<br />3. In File Explorer [WinKey+E], navigate to &amp; right-click on:

<br />.  •  C:\Program Files\Avast Software &lt;=this folder

<h2>            I Think Something is Wrong with My Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wiped and reinstalled Windows on my hard drive, and&nbsp;I think something is wrong. Right now, whenever I try to click on the Windows search bar, nothing happens, and when I press the Windows key, it takes a while for me to access the programs and such.
 Clicking the Windows key doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some programs that require internet are also not working. I think it's an issue with drivers. Also, this started happening after I installed a Windows update. I don't know if it's a driver issue, but I can't check because of my Windows key malfunction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Dominic.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Compare the install you did with this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Did you create the latest bootable media, boot it as a UEFI device, delete all partitions down to Unallocatd Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-format the needed partitions and begin?  This makes it foolproof, and it isn't a Clean Install without doing this.
<br />
<br />If you did these things then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, Dominic21
<br />
<br />You could also check to see if there are some sectors of the hard drive damaged
<br />
<br />Take a look to the following link, there is a step by step guide 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>
<br />www.hirensbootcd.org/download/
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.
