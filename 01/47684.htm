<h2>            Upgrade causing defender to cry wolf-Dislike having a warning about a non-security issue</h2>
                    <p>Criticism.</p>
<p>If the windows defender shield is to be considered highly important then it can't be used to simply notify me of something trivial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem- I see that there is an warning (!) on the defender icon so I stop everything as computer security should take precedence over everything . &nbsp;For years that icon notification meant something was wrong that deserved immediate attention. Now I am becoming
 trained to ignore it since all it means is that my screen brightness isn't "optimal". It is where I want it. There is no way for me to check a box and tell it to ignore that my brightness is out of optimal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there was something important I wouldn't know as now I have to continue as the alert remains while windows is simply crying wolf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please change ASAP before windows users are conditioned to ignore defender alerts.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your operating system became corrupted. You may need to reinstall
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. Before you reinstall Windows 10, kindly back up all your important files as reinstalling Windows 10 will remove all your personal files and data. After backing up your files, reinstall Windows 10 by following the steps indicated
 on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4000735/windows-10-reinstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Group Policy Editor uses ADMX files and it sounds like at least one of yours is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are usually located here (assuming Windows is installed in the Windows folder on your C drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are just XML files and how it got corrupted I have no idea but they can be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are seeing stuff like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9a10853-9135-416a-8bd3-59c4c37bdb4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9a10853-9135-416a-8bd3-59c4c37bdb4f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps just replacing the one file is all you need so there is a copy of the tcpip.admx file on my OneDrive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?id=A8C24A4BD70DC25C%21107&amp;cid=A8C24A4BD70DC25C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?id=A8C24A4BD70DC25C!107&amp;cid=A8C24A4BD70DC25C</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to take ownership of the current file to replace it and here's one way to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/take-ownership-of-file-or-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/take-ownership-of-file-or-folder/</a></p>

    <title>HOW TO USE THE OLD VERSION OF NETFLIX WITH THE LATEST XBOX360 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HOW TO USE THE OLD VERSION OF NETFLIX WITH THE LATEST XBOX360 DASHBOARD UPDATE</h2>
                    

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HOW TO USE THE OLD VERSION OF NETFLIX WITH THE LATEST XBOX360 DASHBOARD UPDATE</span></b></p>

<p>Millions of Xbox members were shocked to realize that the new Netflix, which was bundled into the latest Xbox360 dashboard update, was complete without the party streaming function. A Microsoft spokesperson stated,
<b>“<em>The new app platform on Xbox does not support the video party mode feature at this time, so will not be available in any existing app…”</em></b><em>&nbsp;
</em></p>

<p>Although the new version of Netflix on the Xbox360 dashboard looks great, it does not offer the option to create parties and watch movies with your friends. Also, it no longer offers the ability to activate multiple Xbox consoles by inputting a code on your
 Netflix account. Instead, in order to activate the console(s) to use as a Netflix device, you must first enter your email address and password. This is a requirement that many members may not be willing to do, especially if the console(s) to be activated are
 for other people to watch Netflix movies!</p>

<p>Luckily, there is a way to have both the new version of Netflix and the previous version! With both versions of Netflix, you can simply choose which version you want to use, depending on what you’re doing! For example, to enjoy enhanced features of the new
 version of Netflix, choose to play the new version. If you want to kick back and watch movies together with other Xbox Live friends, choose the previous version!</p>

<p>After updating your Xbox360 console with the latest Xbox360 dashboard update, you will notice some amazing new apps! When you click on the Netflix app, you will be alerted that the download has begun. After completing the download, you may be asked to enter
 your email and password. After this step, you will be taken into the Netflix movie database in which you can choose from thousands of the newest and hottest movie titles! Unfortunately, however, you may notice that any other consoles that were activated under
 your account may also need your email and password. If you have others who enjoy Netflix on their device but under your account, you may not want to provide them with your email and password, as they will have direct access to your account and personal information
 on Netflix.com.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">TO ACTIVATE AN XBOX360 CONSOLE BY THE USUAL METHOD (WITH CODES) OR TO CONTINUE ENJOYING MOVIES WITH OTHERS, IN A PARTY, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:</span></b></p>

<ul>
<li>The new Netflix app does not require you to delete the previous Netflix download, nor does it replace it. If you have not already done so,
<b>DO NOT DELETE THE PREVIOUS Netflix DOWNLOAD!</b> </li><li>To access the previous version of Netflix that was already installed on your device before the update, click on the silver Xbox home button on the controller to access the mini-dashboard.&nbsp;
</li><li>Within the mini-dashboard, scroll left once to access the <b>Games </b>tab. </li><li>Select <b>Quickplay </b>(<i>Note</i>: <i>Quickplay under the Home tab on the dashboard will not work, as it is not the same as theQuickplay within the Games tab!)</i>
</li><li>Within <b>Quickplay</b>, scroll all the way over to the right (<b>All</b> tab).
</li><li>Under the <b>All</b> tab, there will be a list of every download on your storage device.
</li><li>You may notice two Netflix app downloads. The newest version is indicated by a red Netflix<b>
</b>logo. The previous version is indicated by a white filmstrip logo. Click on the Netflix app indicated by the
<b>white filmstrip logo </b>(Google filmstrip for help with definition). </li><li>You will be prompted to re-activate the device on Netflix.com but will immediately be interrupted by an error message, which states that the device cannot be registered or some other problem; and will ask you to
<i>Try again?</i>. To clear this issue, log onto your <b>Netflix.com</b> account on your computer.
</li><li>Within your Netflix account, click on <b>Manage Netflix ready devices and computers</b>.
</li><li>Click on <b>Disconnect Devices</b> (confirmation will appear). </li><li>On your Xbox360, click the <b>A button</b> to <b>Try again </b>(if applicable).
</li><li>Now you will have access to the <b>code screen</b> that was hidden in the background by the error message.
</li><li>On your Netflix.com account, click on <b>Activate a device</b> and enter the code into the code box.
</li><li>Click <b>Activate</b>. </li></ul>

<p><b>COMPLETE *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Netflix will then begin to load, and you will have access to this version, as well as the newer version, if you have installed it. You will also be able to invite other Netflix members to parties and watch movies with other Xbox Live
 members!</p>

<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions and Answers:</b></p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I already deleted the old version of Netflix?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> Good News! You can re-install this version of Netflix only if someone with the previous version invites you to a Netflix party and game. Upon acceptance of the invite, you will receive an error message and will be prompted to download the Netflix
 game. Click on <i>yes</i> or <i>ok</i> to re-download the previous app and follow the same instructions as listed above!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Do I have to install the new version of Netflix?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> No, downloading the new Netflix app is not required. You can use the previous version by accessing it through the Quickplay selection on the Games tab (described in instructions).</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> My friend’s Xbox was activated under my account so that he could watch Netflix, but now he needs my email and password to get onto the new version. I don’t want to give out my information, so what do I do?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> Tell him to download the previous Netflix app if he does not already have it. To do this, simply invite him to your Netflix party and game. If you do not have the previous version, follow the instructions!</p>

<p>When I try to run the old Netflix app using Quickplay, it gives me an error that the content isn't found and I need to insert the game disc or memory device to continue. I went to Memory - Hard Drive to make sure I had the old Netflix app on my hard drive
 and it's now listed as corrupted. This is the case on both of my 360 systems.</p>
<p>Is anyone else able to use this work around? Or does the new dashboard automatically corrupt the old Netflix app?</p>

<p>The new dashboard update does not corrupt the previous Netflix app. Of course, this would imply that Microsoft or Netflix does not want us to utilize the previous version of Netflix: a notion that is hard for me to fully understand. Rather, Microsoft nor
 Netflix seem to be aware that &nbsp;the new dashboard can, in fact, support Netflix party streaming. It must simply be done using the previous format, however.</p>

<p>@ Crouton:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only recommendation that I can give regarding this particular issue is to delete both versions of Netflix. After deleting the apps, however, you may have to find another friend who has the previous version of Netflix so that he can invite
 you to a Netflix game and party. This would be the only way to retrieve the previous version of Netflix, as you will be prompted to reinstall the download. Try to do this step before re-installing the newer version. In fact, you may refuse to re-download the
 new Netflix app altogther.</p>

<p>So much trouble for Netflix? Why would anyone care?? Its a video game console. Get butthurt over the next new game of your favorite franchise getting delayed... not over this. The ability to talk and interrupt a movie over Xbox Live's party chat is a pretty
 lame priority. Maybe if more Xbox owners were actual gamers, then this wouldn't be a deal.</p>

    <title>Still having trouble with Alternate MAC address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cherylniles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Still having trouble with Alternate MAC address</h2>
                    <p>I posted a couple of weeks ago about having trouble with the Xbox One generating alternative MAC addresses which then circumvents the parental control system that I use, the Disney Circle.&nbsp; Here is the original post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Here is my question: Each time my son uses the Xbox one, it uses a new MAC address.&nbsp; This circumvents the parent control system that I use, the Disney Circle, because the Circle identifies the device by the MAC address and any new device joining
 my network is automatically assigned to the "home profile" which does not have a "bedtime".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found info on how to create an alternate MAC address on the Xbox One, and I've been to the advanced settings to check into that.&nbsp; But, the Xbox seems to be doing this automatically each time he turns it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for information on how to make it stop creating alternate MAC addresses."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was advised to reserve an IP address for the Xbox through my router and I did that.&nbsp; I had some false starts with that approach - I realized after one attempt that my adult account was still signed in to the Xbox so my
 son could access the settings through that.&nbsp; I signed myself out (and changed the password).&nbsp; Then I tried reserving the IP address a few times because I wasn't sure I had done it right.&nbsp; I didn't see any new Xbox devices connecting to my Circle device for
 the end of last week and so I thought that maybe I had fixed my problem.&nbsp; But, this weekend several new Xbox devices (called Xbox but with different MAC addresses) joined my Circle.&nbsp; So, it appears this is not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another person who replied to my question said that the Xbox won't just generate alternative MAC addresses on its own - that someone is actively doing this.&nbsp; So, that has to be my son because he's the only one in the house
 who uses the Xbox (unless this can be done remotely somehow and a friend is helping him?).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you get to the advanced settings and select "alternate MAC address" from a child account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of years ago my son had created an alternative profile using my email address and password.&nbsp; I removed it from our "family" since I couldn't figure out a way to re-designate it as a child account a few months ago.&nbsp;
 Is it possible that he is somehow accessing my account via that old profile?&nbsp; There is no evidence of that old profile on the Xbox...</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble with your Mac Address settings. The best way to have the Disney Circle work would be to manually set up a static IP address to do that you'd need to
 go to your "Settings" under "Network" find the "Advanced Settings". In there take note of your Wireless MAC or Wired MAC depending what internet connection you are using. Then select Alternate Mac Address and set it to manual and&nbsp;reenter the MAC address there.
 Doing that will keep your MAC address from changing. Keep in mind that anyone clearing the&nbsp;Alternate MAC address would cause it to change. You may want to try setting up a parental restriction from your child's account to be blocked from accessing the&nbsp;settings.
 Hope this helps&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your very clear description of how to manually set the MAC address on the Xbox.&nbsp; Since I've set a static IP address a couple of times through the router I'm more intrigued by your suggestion to set a parental restriction to block my son from accessing
 the settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I've searched through the settings on the Microsoft website and googled for about 15 minutes and I cannot find instructions for how to block my son from accessing the settings on the Xbox.&nbsp; Do I need to do this from the console directly?

<p>Ah ha!&nbsp; I think I found the problem.&nbsp; The Xbox was set up to automatically sign my profile in when turned on!&nbsp; I've changed that now so that no one is signed in automatically and I chose the "lock down" setting for my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, assuming that one cannot access the settings from a child account, I think, maybe, keep your fingers crossed for me, I've got it.</p>
<p>

<p>That's discouraging!&nbsp; So is there a way to prevent a child account from accessing the alternate mac address settings?</p>

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no setting that will prevent him from accessing the MAC address. If you are attempting to set up Timers for when he can and can't use the console you can always update the parental settings and

Set up screen time limits for your child</a>. </p>
<p>By setting it up this way, even if the Mac address is changed the screen time settings will still be placed directly to the account from the parent account and it will only allow him to play within the times that are set.

<p>So then, the earlier recommendation to reserve the IP address doesn't really help.&nbsp; If he can always get to the alternate MAC address button in the network settings then it doesn't really matter if I reserve the IP address through the router or through the
 Xbox console, right?</p>

<h2>            BSOD &#58; USB Driver on PC &#40;SOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had BSOD on my PC. I am very sorry that I cannot include the crash dump file because the Windows won't start at all. And it won't enter the BIOS too. I can see that fans and HDD are turned on, but won't enter the BIOS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I only remember that the BSOD said "USB Driver" and blank screen suddenly appear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The BSOD occured when I use my printer to scan. Usually I connect the printer's USB cable to back USB port. But today I connected it to front USB port. I haven't use this front USB port for a long time because there was error but no BSOD. Since that I
 only use back port.</div>
<div>I moved my PC's position at my room, so I just use front port to connect the printer (it's the closest port with my printer) and voila! BSOD occured.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I assume that the BSOD occured because I use the front port.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is my PC spec</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Motherboard: MSi 870-G45</div>
<div>Processor: AMD Phenom II X4 BE</div>
<div>RAM: 2 GB DDR 3</div>
<div>Windows 7 32 bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My PC is 2 years old.</div>
<div>I didn't install any drivers recently.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is additional information. I have not use my PC for 3 or 4 days. And when I want to use it again, the BIOS won't enter too. I clean my PC from dust (dissassembled VGA &amp; RAM) and it worked again. But I only checked if it work and shut down the computer
 properly. The next day (which is today), I use my printer and the BSOD appear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anything I can do to make my Windows start again? Any answers would very help me. Sorry for long post.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Newest Progress</div>
<div><br />
I open up my PC and unplug the front usb port cable from motherboard. Windows has working again. No BSOD. So I would like to share the minidump file<br />
<br />
http://sdrv.ms/1f9VtW3<br />
<br />
Does anybody can tell me the problem? If the printer's driver is main problem, I will install new printer driver. If not, I just want to let it use the old driver.</div>

<div>My PC already going well. It was hardware issue. The front USB port is not in normal function. Since I don't use it much, I will keep the USB cord unplug from mobo.</div>

<p>Hi ronl763,</p>
<p><br />
•&nbsp;Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>Would you provide more information about “<strong>box around the fonts</strong>” and if possible sent us a screenshot of the desktop.<br />
For the icons are larger I would suggest that you try changing the screen resolution and check if it works.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open <strong>Display Settings</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, clicking
<strong>Personalization</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Display Settings</strong>.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Under <strong>Resolution</strong>, move the <strong>slider to the resolution</strong> you want, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Change screen resolution</strong><br />

            1. This is an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>I am Suman Saha, form India. I have a basic question about internet security. I have to do several works related to net banking and others. When I have to work a long time on the internet, is the windows defender antivirus sufficient for online security?
 Or, should I go through other third-party antivirus software? Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Suman
<br />
<br />Windows 10 now contains a full and competent Security Suite . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has, over the last few years become a fully featured Security solution 
<br />
<br />It is rated on a par with the paid for Anti-virus software, the virus definitions are updated regularly, it will not slow our PC down, works well with Edge and it is Free 
<br />
<br />Defender now has a new feature - Controlled Folder Access, which protects against a ransomware attack
<br />
<br />Honestly, you do not need more protection than Defender can supply . ..

<p>Have been trying to get an open NAT on my Xbox for quite a while now, have tried static IP, port forwarding etc but haven't had any luck. My question is, has anyone in the same situation been successful? Perhaps it's something to do with BT Infinity? Any
 suggestions on how to fix it would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I love the Home Hub 5, best I've had from BT.</p>
<p>It's weird though, I know one friend with the HH5, when he first turns his Xbox One on, his NAT will always be Moderate, sometimes Strict, to sort it though he just runs a network test from the dashboard and it goes back to Open, he just repeats the process
 each time.</p>
<p>A few times my NAT said it was Moderate when I was sitting in a Call of Duty lobby, on the dashboard though it was Open and I've never messed with any settings.</p>
<p>It is a wired connection I'm using.<br />
<br />
I still wonder though if it's something at Microsofts/Xbox Live end, I mean a lot of the people reporting issues with NAT on Xbox One didn't have all these issues with the 360, odd one.</p>

<p>Got mine Open in 5 minutes on HH5.</p>
<p>Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>Login to your hub and go to advanced settings followed by Home Network.</p>
<p>Look for your Xbox in the list of devices and select it.</p>
<p>Choose "Always use this IP address" and click apply.</p>
<p>Now click on Firewall followed by DMZ.</p>
<p>Select "Yes" for DMZ enable and choose your XB1 from the dropdown list, then click apply.</p>
<p>Turn your Xbox back on and Test Multiplayer connection. After testing hold down both triggers and bumper buttons at the same time.</p>
<p>Reboot and and take a look now, you should have an Open NAT which will stay that way providing you don't mess about with any more settings.</p>
<p>You could also forward the ports manually, but this is by far the quickest and easiest method, plus as Xbox Live is a closed network using DMZ doesn't pose a security risk in the way that using it on a PC would.</p>

<p>@Saber Sh4dow - the biggest problem with port forwarding is as you mentioned, some games will on occasion require a different port so in my opinion DMZ (if setup correctly) is the easiest way forward, that way, once you have an open nat it should always
 stay that way.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, for some reason XB1 doesn't appear to work too well with UPNP which means that for the HH5 especially you will need to do something.</p>

<p>Cheers for the offer mate but I don't play COD Ghosts anymore. Even though when I played it my NAT said Moderate in-game I didn't have no issues joining games. To be honest if I tried to change the settings, I'd only mess it up big time lol</p>

<h2>            MSI GAMING GT73VR - Running Win 10 OEM but unable to boot on Win 7 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really disappointed by Windows 10 (more especially by that famous "Fall Creator Update" then that "Spring Creator Update" wich litteraly finished me with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want to go back to Windows 7 wich used to be very good, stable, and powerfull, but then when I tried installing from UEFI/LEGACY BOOT it says a driver is missing, so I tried to use Win10 /sources drivers to force-install Win7 (wich could be installed
 and booted ONLY ONCE)</p>
<p>"Successfull Install" but then when I boot Windows 7 it starts freezing on the Win7 bootlogo then bluescreen then reboot then again....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if I could do anything to this please, BECAUSE I REALLY CANT KEEP WINDOWS 10 ! IT BREAKS MYSELF !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend of mine told me to check if I could downgrade or load a custom VBIOS but I'm definitely not sure that's the way to do it. I really dislike flashing a BIOS, and even more when the computer actually costs 3600 EUR....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for further replies!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Maxime</p>

<p>Hi Maxime, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the possible reasons why it's showing a blue screen can be due to a hardware failure, outdated driver and compatibility issue. To fix issues with blue screen of death in Windows 7, we suggest that you check this

<p>Hello and thanks for the fast reply!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually can install windows 7 on a fresh SSD using windows 10 sources drivers&nbsp; I also tried cloning a WIN 7 VM to replicate using clonezilla ; I could install but not run win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also updated my BIOS to the latest version yesterday then tried again then failed still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just reminded with the RECOVERY thing you were evoking, I didn't check if my OEM windows 10 has a Windows.old to revert back to win7 but I am actually pretty sure it has one! I keep you updated by tonight! :) thanks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, are you sure it's just not my motherboard wich doesn't support win7 at all or just a "fresh" win7 and then can only run a modded / OEM win7 instead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maxime</p>

    <title>Windows Keys and GVGMall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slayxmasterx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Keys and GVGMall</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased keys from GVGMall.com for Windows 10 Pro OEM (https://www.gvgmall.com/microsoft-cdkey/microsoft-windows-10-pro-oem-cd-key-global.html) and Office 2016 Pro (https://www.gvgmall.com/microsoft-cdkey/office2016-professional-plus-cd-key-global.html).
 The way that the key was delivered to me does not look legitimate (screenshot below). I am thinking they resold me a volume license key/MSDNAA key or something similar and marketed as OEM. I then called Microsoft sales and asked them about GVGMall and I do
 not believe they understood what I was asking (probably wrong department to speak to). I am about to issue a chargeback to my credit card company, but want to see if it is legitimate or not and if not using this to strengthen my case when I issue a chargeback
 and make everyone aware if this is a scam or not when they search the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            If you are buying OEM keys for your own use, that contrary to the OEM license terms. Sorry to rain on your parade. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately MS makes it almost impossible for users to validate if a vendor is legitimate or not, and totally impossible to validate a product key before actually using it.

    <title>Cortana keeps popping up in top left. How do I disable this&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e.v.12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana keeps popping up in top left. How do I disable this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Cortana occasionally, and thus haven't found the need to fully disable her. However, as of late, she and a random a tagline spontaneously appear in the top left of my screen, covering whatever happens to be there and generally taking up useless screen
 space unless I want to know who the tallest woman in the world is. It refuses to fade, and you have to click on it (which initiates a full-on voice search) to make it go away. It often happens right at startup, covering a portion of the lock screen, though
 it can (AND DOES) happen anytime at any interval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORTANT: this is different than the Cortana search bar. It seems to have nothing to do with stimulus to Cortana in the taskbar, and activation does not appear to correlate with anything I am aware of. And no option in Settings or Notebook correspond with
 this function (that I've seen). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I hope I can be of help. Go to Cortana Settings and you will see Lock Screen: Use Cortana even when the screen is locked. Turn that off because it says in tiny text: To get Cortana tips on your lockscreen, choose Picture or Slideshow as your background.
 Once you turn it off, it will not appear again.</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>
