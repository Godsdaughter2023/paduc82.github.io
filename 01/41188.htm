<h2>            Dell Inspiron won&#39;t turn on&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1521 running Vista, and I've had it for about 2 1/2 to 3 years. On Monday night I was online and all of a sudden a blue screen came up and my
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">laptop</a> shut off. I don't know if it was THE blue screen of death because I didn't have a chance to look at it, but it certainly was a blue screen of doom =/<br />
<br />
Anyways right after the blue screen came up and my laptop turned off, the caps lock light (the lock icon w/the 'A' on it next to the power button) kept blinking. At the
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">time</a> , my laptop was plugged into the AC adapter charger thing (I don't know about how computers work, i just know how to use the internet!) so its not like the battery was low or anything.
 I kept pressing and holding down the power button several times with the AC charger thing in the laptop, and without the AC charger thing, and it would not turn on. The only thing that happened was that the caps lock icon would blink blue for about 45 seconds
 (or 45 times, not sure) and laptop would make the sound it always makes when its about to turn on. Then after the 45 seconds/times, the sound would stop. Nothing ever appeared on the screen. The laptop was very hot at the time, but I've had this computer for
 years and its been hotter than it was today and it never did anything like this.</p>
<p>Also, for the past 2 weeks or so, i've been getting a popup in the bottom right corner of my screen (where the time is) from Dell saying that my battery is reaching the end of its usable life and needs to be replaced. Has my
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">laptop battery</a> gone out for good or was that popup totally unrelated?</p>
<p><br />
AND yesterday (Tuesday night) I was finally able to turn my laptop on and got this error message when I reached Windows desktop:</p>

What's going on?? Please help me out! My laptop is like my life and I don't have money to replace it. Also, please use very simple terms- I don't understand
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">computer</a> jargon and I have no idea how to remove/replace the battery or memory or anything like that. Don't really know where to post this, so hopefully this is the correct forum... Know
 this is long, but I think I have all the useful info in here...<br />
<br />
THANK YOU so much in advance, I really need the help!!</p>

<p><span>Frankly, it sounds like a hardware problem but we'll try to test both hardware annd sofware as best we can.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information
 you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or
 one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools /
 Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt startiing from C;\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Look in the&nbsp;System section.</span></p>
<p><span>I'd like to test the hard drive and RAM more throughly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get
 the diagnostic utility from: </span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work,
<span>read the posts and follow the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.
</span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7</span></a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;
 I realize they are long but resolving blue screen errors is not a simple process.&nbsp; Getting information about the bluescreen is the firsst step and his posts explain how to freeze the screen so you have time to copy down the EXACT message (word-for-word with
 all the codes) and post it back here in a reply.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It may be a battery issue though I'd expect it to work fine when plugged in (but since it's telling you to replace
 the battery, it seems that's a good thing to do to see if it resolves the problem).&nbsp; The problems you were having with the power button itself suggest a problem with the motherboard or some other hardware device (perhaps even the button itself) but we have
 no means to test these things.&nbsp; Perhaps the following article on hardware troubleshooting will help:
<a href="http://elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try
 some other options.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            Thank you for your quick response! I will try doing these things as soon as my computer decides to turn itself on :( Any ideas/tricks on how I can get it to turn on? I've tried turning it on with and without the AC adapter/charger and neither worked.

<p>I have no clue how to turn it on if the power button doesn't work.&nbsp; I suggest you contact Dell Techncial Support and see if they can help you.&nbsp; Once it's on, leave it on until we identify and hopefully resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I was able to turn&nbsp; the computer on just this morning. When I turned it on, a screen came up that said: Windows Boot Manager</p>
<p>A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. If you have Windows installation disk, insert the disk.....</p>
<p>Otherwise to start Windows, so&nbsp;you can investigate further, press the ENTER key to display the boot menu, press F8 for Adv Boot options and select Last Known Good.</p>
<p>Status: 0xc0000428</p>
<p>Info: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>So I attempted to open up the adv. boot menu but it just went to a blank screen and turned off. The next time I turned it on, it went directly to Startup Repair and it started scanning but then shut off.</p>
<p>-Restarted and started Startup Repair again. Thought it worked, because Startup Repair instructions said that comp might restart several times and comp restarted on its own.</p>
<p>- Comp eventually went to desktop and no error results came up so I figured all clear. So I tried to open up the internet to go to memtest.org like you suggested, but comp shut down.</p>
<p>- Kept restarting, sometimes caps light would flash like before and would not turn on</p>
<p>- Tried pressing F8 at startup, and tried to open Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Command, and Last Known Good several times. Everytime I tried to select any of those options, comp went to black screen. Sometimes power was still on, sometimes power shut off.</p>
<p>- Black page w/plain white font, no error box, came up saying 'The file is possibly corrupt. The file header does not match the computed checksum'.</p>
<p>- Everytime I turn on PC, the Windows Boot Manager message comes up again and I try pressing ENTER but it just restarts comp to open up Windows Boot Manager message again and process is repeated. Never actually opens boot menu.</p>
<p>I've been trying to do&nbsp;Startup Repair&nbsp;and F8 to reach Last Known Good to do System Restore for the past few hours. Startup Repair at least came up at the beginning but now nothing will really open. I'm really conecerned now and I tried thinking what possibly
 could have been installed that could be malicious. I installed Windows Powerpoint trial abt 2 weeks ago, but I did it from the actual Windows website. The only other thing I've done was charge my iPod touch via USB cable. Could my iPod touch be infected w/a
 virus that trasmitted to my comp via USB? Is it even possible for that to happen? (My iPod runs fine though, no errors). I had also plugged in a USB to my computer that I was using for files for a school group project. Several of us had passed USB around and
 plugged into our own computers, but I also don't see how that could cause a virus or something, seeing as I plugged it into school computers w/anti-virus programs and whenever I plugged in USB, there were no issues..... Actually now that I think about it,
 whenever I tried to save things to the USB it would say that there was an error but I figured it was because we were saving Powerpoint files from all versions of PP (ie: 2003, 2007) and they were incompatible. Could this be the issue?</p>
<p>I really don't even know what to do at this point. Btw I don't have the recovery disk so I was trying to do all the Sys Restore/Startup repair by turning on PC.</p>
<p>What to do now? This is really bad because I will be going out of the country on Tues night and don't see it being resolved before then :(</p>

<p>I also called Dell Tech Support from Thurs. Technician had me remove laptop battery and AC power and try turning on comp that way. Did not turn on. Had me plug in AC power and turn on comp (still w/o battery). Did not turn on. Caps light blinked both times
 as usual.</p>
<p>Tech said that they would have to send technician out to me but it would take 2-3 business days to process (so he might've called Monday/Tue and come out Tue/Wed at earliest). But I am going out of the country on Tue night for 12 days so I would not be around
 for technican to come. Tech reccommended that I do not call for technician to come until I return to the States.</p>
<p>That was really upsetting because I had planned on having my laptop with me while I am away to keep in contact with family, check email, etc. and it seems like something serious has happened....</p>

<p>Put the disk in the drive set&nbsp;to boot to the CD drive first as previously described and turn on the computer and press any key when prompted to boot to the disk.&nbsp; You shouldn't encounter any of those error messages if you do this.&nbsp; You can then use the Redovery
 Options I described in my prior post (all of which can be done just using the disk - I excluded those that requied normal booting or booting to safe mode intentionally).&nbsp; Then run the procedures I suggested in the order they are listed (unless you've already
 tried one and it didn't help so you can skip trying again).</p>
<p>I don''t know if it will fix the problem but it's worth a shot.&nbsp; If not, you're in no worse shape than you already are but if it does work you may be able to take it on your trip with you.&nbsp; At worst, you wait until you return and let the Dell technician
 deal with it.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck and enjoy your travel (and that nice expense account)!</p>

<p><br />
I have no idea.&nbsp; The ingenuity of hackers is incredible so I imagine it might be possible depending on what you transferred.&nbsp; If it was data or files or emails with attachments or web sites that you then opened, then it is certainly possible.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>

            JJewels&nbsp; I have good news and bad news.&nbsp; The good news is that this is fixable, but the bad news is that it might take a bit to actually find out what is wrong.&nbsp; Try removing the battery but leaving the laptop plugged into the power outlet.&nbsp; You can remove
 the battery by turning over the laptop and looking for either one or two slid switches on the bottom that will release the battery, then you simply pull it out.&nbsp; Now as for the BOSD or blue screen of death you can try running a repair on your computer.&nbsp; The
 way you run a repair is you insert your Windows Operating System disk into the DVD/CD ROM.&nbsp; You restart your computer and hit F12 while it is turning on, this will open the boot menu for you.&nbsp; You will need to select the CD ROM and then hit any key when it
 asks to boot from cd.&nbsp; Continue with the selections until you see an option on the screen to run a repair.&nbsp; You will need to read each screen the pops up carefully but it should be in the bottom left corner.&nbsp; You will be taken to a screen with several options.&nbsp;
 Choose the repair options and let it run.&nbsp; Once this is done restart the computer and try letting it log directly into windows as usual.&nbsp; If this does not work you have one other option and that is to run a complete reload.&nbsp; This is the bad news, with a reload
 you will loose any pictures, documents, or extra programs that were located on your Hard Drive.&nbsp; If you have any questions or need help with this please check out
<a href="http://www.grantedpeace.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.grantedpeace.com</a> and you can either email or call the computer repair division.&nbsp; I hope this helps you out some.

The Intel 82865G chipset does not support Aero:<br />

<br />
<br />
XPDM drivers - these drivers do not support Windows 7 OS premium features such as Microsoft Aero* and only offer limited functionality on some computers.<br />
<br />
<p>Only XPDM drivers are available for the following older Intel® graphics controllers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Intel® 915GM/GMS, 910GML Express Chipset family </li><li>Intel® 82915G/82910GL Express Chipset family </li><li>Intel® 82865G Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82852/82855 Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82845G Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82830M Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82815 Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82810 Graphics Controller</li></ul>

<br />
You can buy a video card that supports Aero if you have a desktop computer.<br />
<br />
Give your PC some graphics muscle by installing a new video card:<br />

<h2>            Starting XBOX One by Voltage return</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>is there any possibility to boot the System when connecting to the socket or by switching on the socket in which the Xbox is plugged in?</p>
<p>The question is because of using KNX-Bus at home. Only the needed sockets are powered. When switching on the socket from the XBOX One it would be nice, when the Xbox One boots automatically.</p>

<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Marino&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Share this information to assist you better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you installed all the required updates?</li><li>Have you tried to run the 'hardware and devices troubleshooter'?</li></ol>
This issue might occur if the drivers for the microphone are not compatible or are not installed
<br />
successfully on the Windows 10. I suggest you to check the issue&nbsp;by connecting&nbsp;different microphone, if the issue persists. Follow the methods below and check if it helps:
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers or headphones.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter,</strong> and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, click
<strong>Troubleshoot audio playback</strong>.‌ If you're prompted for an <br />
administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Try the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download a fresh copy of the latest driver for the device and place it on your Desktop.<span><span><br />
</span>2. <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Right click</span></strong> the driver
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">installation file</span></strong> and select
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Properties</span></strong> / <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Compatibility Tab</span></strong>.</span><span><span><br />
</span>3. Place a <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">check mark</span></strong> in the
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Run this program in compatibility mode for</span></strong>.</span><span><span><br />
</span>4. In the <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">drop down menu</span></strong>,
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">select Windows 7/8</span></strong>.</span><span><span><br />
</span>5. Click <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Apply</span></strong> /<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span></strong>.</span><span><span><br />
6. <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Right click</span></strong> the installation file and select the
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Run As Administrator</span></strong> option to install.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Test to determine if this process was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not work, contact support for the device manufacturer and ask if they plan to release drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Your reply is very important to ensure a proper resolution. Please get back to us with the above information to assist you accordingly.</span></span></p>

About a year and a half ago I build a PC and ive been slowly upgrading it was the years go on. I recently bought a new case for my pc and it did have a minor problem of shutting down randomly every once in a while but since I unplugged everything and moved
 it to the new case its been happening more frequently.&nbsp;</p>

After further research I ran some SFC fix and it stated the one file has been repaired and the scan came back clean now. I also researched that it may be a windows update issue and to disable automatically finding software, instead to "let me chose" what to
 update. This seemed to calm the issue down however the random shutdowns still occur. I did some research and my PC should have enough power for everything so I do not believe its my supply. &nbsp;All the drivers are also up to date.</p>

<h2>            Bitlocker with password possible on Surface 2 Pro</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>
<p>Surface 2 Pro (Win 8.1 x64 Pro)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Bitlocker Bootdrive encryption without TPM &amp; USB but with a password.</p>
<p>I like to get asked for a password at boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things I did:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivating the TPM in uefi</li><li>Allowing encryption without TPM in Windows</li><li>Trying to encrypt&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>If I try to encrypt the System partition the wizard just acccepts a USB drive to save its key. I am not asked for a password.</p>
<p>How can I achieve that I am asked for a password at startup? I don't want to use PIN+TPM. I just want a boot password.</p>

            The helpful anwser would be that the Surface is not supporting encryption via Password (perhaps due to the fact that the tablet should work without keyboard)

<p>Hi Kelli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Svchost.exe error usually occurs when restarting your computer after a Windows Update. It can also be possibly caused by a virus or corrupted system files. As our initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you run the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/products/scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Safety Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again. Any data that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting
 the entire data, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we would like to get a screenshot of the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

    <title>Disable taskbar thumbnail preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spoonbob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable taskbar thumbnail preview</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span><strong>Turning off Taskbar features</strong></span><br />
<br />
First, I am trying to find the language to describe the problem, and am having some problems even finding screen shots and names of the taskbar functions I am referring to. It would be exremely helpful if Microsoft coul name and provide screeen shots of every
 part of the Windows n screens.</p>
<p>When I hover my mouse over a system tray icon, several enhanced features come into play. I can find references to jump lists, and how to control them, and to previes, and how to control them. I haven't yet found a description or porper name of the windowed&nbsp;list
 of open applications that appears when the mouse pointer hovers over a system tray icon. For example, if I have 10 copies of Internet Explorer open, a list pops up of ALL the open Explorer instances and their search bar titles. Without knowing the name of
 this window, it's diffucult to ask the question - it would be useful to have a pointer "What's this?" tool to name a windows object and its properties.</p>
<p>The problem with this list is that the only option in the list in to select one of the listed instances of the application. There are no functions to close the list, or an easy path to keep the list from popping up. I suppose Microsoft thought to be such
 an exceptionally useful tool that they didn't think to include personalization and user control functions.</p>
<p>For me, they are exceptionally intrusive and severely interrupt work flow. I have absolutely no use for the lists. I often have 20 or more instances of Internet Explorer or other applications open at one time. When one of these lists pops up, it can significantly
 cover the work space. These list windows are designed to be sticky or persistent - so that they can remain open for significant periods of time. If they pop up open over an application (for example Access or Excel) then the data entry fields cannot be accessed
 until the window goes away.</p>
<p>The problem is made more difficult by the working environment. I do much of my work on a laptop on a couch, rather than a desktop. And the system tray has been set 4 layers deep. The result is that when I take from the mouse to go to the keyboard, there
 is often some slippage. When the pointer slips across the icons, it brings up these annoying and work-interrupting lists. I'm entering hundreds to thousands of fielded data a day, and so any blockage of access to data entry fields is an impact on productivity.</p>
<p>I need a way to turn this feature completely off, and not a kludge that sets a time delay. A time delay function works to some extent, but if I have to type for any extended period of time, the mouse pointer will slip, hover over an icons, and cause the
 list window to pop up.</p>
<p>This need to avoid a kludge is something Microsoft needs to consider more closely. This isn the appropriate forum, but I'll bring it up anyway, I don't know if Excel 2010 solves this problem, but I've had a technical problem with Excel from the beginning.
 Like this taskbar issue, it seems to originate in programming assumptions about the uses of the software, and coercing certain "labor saving" functions that makes it hard for users who have less common uses.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am just obtuse, and there is a clear, simple workaround or option. Any suggestions?</p>

<p><span>Hi spoonbob,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The feature you’re referring to here is known as&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Preview-an-open-window-on-the-desktop-using-Peek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>taskbar
 thumbnail preview</span></a>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Windows 7 does not include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to disable the taskbar thumbnail preview feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The only option that comes close enough to disabling the feature is by editing registry settings. This can be done by setting the taskbar thumbnail
 preview hover delay to a large value (say 25000 milliseconds or more), so that the preview is not immediately generated when you hover over a taskbar icon.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you wish to change the settings to delay the taskbar thumbnail previews, follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps
 that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can
 restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, type<strong>regedit.exe</strong> in the Start search box and hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to the following location:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Explorer \ Advanced</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Create a new&nbsp;<strong>DWORD (32-bit)</strong>value named
<strong>ExtendedUIHoverTime</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. Double-click&nbsp;<strong>ExtendedUIHoverTime</strong> and click<strong>Decimal</strong></span></p>
<p><span>5. To increase the hover delay to 10 seconds, type&nbsp;<strong>10<span>000</span></strong>. Type<strong>5<span>0000</span></strong> for 50 seconds,
 etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Exit the Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Restart the computer.</span></p>

    <title>Fallout 3 game of the year edition problems. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> furanshisuko12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fallout 3 game of the year edition problems.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought Fallout 3 game of the year edition for my Xbox 360. When I went to install it my 360 wouldn't turn on. I didn't worry about it since Xbox One has backwards compatibility and Fallout 3 is one of the games available. I installed the game
 first on my ONE and then I went on and put in the second disc to install all of the dlc that come with the game of the year edition. At first I got an error message with a code [0x87e0000d]. Then it said 5 items need updates, size of 626.MB. After that everything
 started to install by itself without any trouble and when everything finished I put the first disc again to start playing. When I check the available downloadable content inside the game it only said I had the Broken Steel dlc and that Mothership Zeta, Operation:Anchorage,
 The pitt and Point Lookout needed to be bought seperatly for $4.99 each...I contacted Xbox support about the issue and in the end they told me to uninstall everything and install it again. I went on to do that. Put in disc two again and got the same error
 code. Then I got something new which said Xbox preview dashboard needed a 15MB update. I did it. Then I had to do the same 626.MB update for the dlc. Now nothing wants to install, not even Broken steel which didn't give me any trouble. I told the Xbox support
 member with who I was chatting that nothing wanted to install now and she kindly sent me this link to see if I can resolve my issue here.....So here I am. Can anyone help me and please tell me why wont my Fallout 3 GOTY Dlc appear and why does it tell me to
 buy them again if they are already supposedly installed?</p>

<p>I don't have an install problem, but I do have a playability problem. &nbsp;I completed the survey required with no response (3 weeks ago). &nbsp;I have the Fallout 3 GOTY (Platinum Hits) and all of it is installed on my internal hard drive. &nbsp;I did the same with my
 360. &nbsp;I thought it was all good until I went to play on the 360 and during the game load up, it "activated" my DLC's and opened the quests in the game. &nbsp;However, on my Xbox One, the DLC's do NOT load up when the game runs. &nbsp;I have verified the DLC's are available
 on the hard drive, but they will not "activate" when playing the game. &nbsp;I am playing the game from disc, no digital downloads.</p>

<p>I uninstalled the games and defaulted my installation to my internal hard drive. &nbsp;I got the messages of updates were required for the DLC's and they installed and now I'm getting the "loading additional content" message when I start the game as well as the

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t allow me to adjust my screen resolution. </h2>
                    I upgraded my Dell from XP to Windows 7 and it absolutely will not allow me to adjust my resolution. I have an lcd slat screen, and the settings are stuck at 16 bit color with 640x480 resolution. I have updated all possible drivers and even downloaded
 new ones. I've disabled the standard vga hoping it would revert to the new one but that didn't work. I treid restarting in safe mode but I still didn't have the option to change it. This is driving me nuts, can anyone help?

                    Does anyone know if i have to have an active windows or a driver update renewed before i can get the new windows 10 home update on the 29th of July? From January until earlier this week I had Windows Home Version 1511, but a day or two i noticed that I
 am now running Windows 10 Home Insider Preview. I keep getting these pop up notices that I need to Install a new build of windows, and if i don't my computer may have to shut down every 2 hours and eventually not come back up, with options to close or learn
 more and I get a pop up notices that something went wrong and &nbsp;that's when my computer shuts down. Can someone please help me. I've been desperately searching microsoft all week trying to find answers and i haven't gotten any. Thanks,&nbsp;

<h2>            Check back soon. We can&#39;t get data for your settings.</h2>
                    <p>About 4 days ago, I began seeing "Check back soon. We can't get data for your settings." on the Xbox One under Account...Family settings when My sign-in, security &amp; passkey is selected. This is my master account with 2 child accounts. When the child account
 are logged in, their information shows with check boxes next to each enabled security item. Mine used to show many items listed here but now only shows the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had issues recently with the time allotment on one child account not being followed. He was able to play more hours than we was supposed to. I removed his account and cleared the cache and it seams to have fixed the issue. However, he keeps unplugging
 the machine and moving it to other rooms and I noticed the issue returned, so I reset the accounts again and that is when the message began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Has anyone encountered this before?</li><li>Does this mean the family settings are not being saved?</li><li>How do I get the information back instead of this message?</li></ol>
<p>Any insight to this is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Ranses,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. Sounds like when your son is moving the console, he may be unplugging it at the wrong time. So what it is doing is causing corrupt files. We recommend a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a>. Then once all is good have them unplug it when the console is completely powered off. To do this just hold the power button on the console itself. Try this and let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. When you state default email, which email address are you referring to?</p>
<p>2. Do you have multiple devices linked by one Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that if you change the login&nbsp;email address of a device you will not be able to sync that device to other devices that you own and that are connected via the email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to change the login email address for your devices without&nbsp;creating a
<strong>New User Account </strong>follow the steps below</p>
<p>
</p><p>* <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Navigate to <strong><span>Start/&gt;</span></strong>
<span><strong>Settings/&gt;Accounts/&gt;Your Account</strong></span></span></p>
<p>* On the right pane&nbsp;click <strong>Manage my Microsoft account, </strong>which will take you to online.</p>
<p>* Select <strong>Your info </strong>from top menu, then click on <strong>Manage your sign-in email or phone number.
</strong>Enter your email account&nbsp;password, when it prompts to do and click Sign-in</p>
<p>* Again it will ask you to verify your Identity through <strong>Alternative email address
</strong>or by <strong>Phone verification</strong>, which will send you a authentication code accordingly.</p>
<p>* Once you enter the&nbsp;verification code push <strong>Submit</strong>, then click
<strong>Set it up later </strong>when it ask for device setup.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Under <strong>Account aliases, </strong>click <strong>Add email </strong>and choose the email either through
<strong>Create a new email</strong> <strong>address </strong>or <strong>Add a existing email</strong>
<strong>address</strong>, then click <strong>Add alias</strong></p>
<p>* On completing this, click on <strong>Make primary </strong>next to the desired email address to make it primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're done&nbsp;with change your email address. Reboot your PC for changes to take place. This procedure won't change or wipe your personal files or settings, instead it will change your email address. Going forward&nbsp;you will be communicated and&nbsp;alerts will be
 sent to new email address. If you want to remove the old email address, then you can do the same by clicking on
<strong>Remove </strong>without any issues<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Left Click Not Working Unless I Hold Control, Can I Fix This&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I play games like Minecraft or Borderlands or even Saints Row 4, I can't use my left click option while moving unless I hold control.
<div>So here's an example so you get a better idea of my problem</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would be walking around a lot when suddenly I see an enemy, so in order to shoot them I would Left Click with my mouse, but for whatever reason I'm not able to move and shoot at the same time. The only way I can do this is if I hold down my Control button,
 which I constantly find annoying. So whenever I play games left clicking doesn't work unless I stay still for a long time or hold control so I can move and shoot. Is there a way I can fix this? Has anyone experienced the problem before or does it require another
 mouse, because I've tried using other external Mouses/Mice.</div>
                </div>

    <title>No XPF-format or incompatible version number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozegirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            No XPF-format or incompatible version number</h2>
                    <p>System is an Asus EEE PC netbook with Windows 7 STARTER. <br />
<br />
I have a 3rd party proprietary program which up until a week ago worked fine. The netbook was accidentally left on and the battery ran down so it shutdown irregularly.<br />
<br />
After plugging it in, turning on, and charging up, and on attempting to open, the program did not launch normally but gave the error message and error log attached. Windows was updating also (20 updates), after which several restarts were done and the error
 still persists. Each time the error generates a new error log - the file number on the error changes slightly each time.
<br />
<br />
I suspect that it is a file or registry entry which has become corrupt due to the sudden shutdown. The question is: which one? I don't know enough to know what file might need replacing. I haven't tried re-installling the program as it seems to me to be a file
 related to the windows system itself, so re-installing may not solve the issue, and re-installing the program is not straightforward as it is very customised and each re-installation requires contacting the author of the program for re-registration of the
 licence - it's not just a matter of running an installation disc. I have not attempted a system restore as I did that once before and it froze the system for a few hours, and it would also result in having to re-install the program with a freshly generated
 licence. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have googled for answers and the only things found related to other programs or issues not applicable here. This program is required for an integral part of our business so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

</p><p>It appears that there was corruption in the registry as a result of the power shutdown.</p>
<p>

<h3> jackfalvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 display on additional monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have a second monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Power Point and finish my slide show the second monitor loses its display setting and must be reset to display icons in their proper place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can fix this by going to the windows 10 control panel, selecting display and resetting everything back to 1/2 display</p>
<p>
</p><p>These setting don't hold. Each time I use PP I must reset!</p>

            <p>It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into
<u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan.</p>

<p>- </p>
<p>Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3"><u>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</u></a></p>
<p>- </p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem. To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points</i>. </p>
<p>- </p>
<p>You can check for corrupted system files. Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type
<u>CMD </u>in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type
<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.</i></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log. To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer. Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>When you get your system back in good working order, <b>I urge you to back your system up to an external hard drive and make regular periodic updates to it.</b></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

<p>When it opens, it only gives me two options, to either "Configure this drive for backup" or "Configure storage settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've went into Control Panel and look for it there, and it only offers me the "Configure storage settings" again.</p>
<p>I tried resetting it back to default.</p>
<p>Nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent about an hour trying to research a solution that will actually work, but I am unable to find one.</p>
<p>Can you please help me? Any would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Perceus, <br />
<br />
I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.
<br />
<br />
Any recent changes made to the system that might have caused the issue? <br />
<br />
Now, based on the details you've indicated in your post, you were not able to do any advanced troubleshooting. I've listed down some methods you could follow to isolate and resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
The first option is to scan system using the System File Checker tool. This will check for any integrity violations and repair any missing or corrupted system files.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to </em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>restart your computer
</em></span><em>after completing this action as your system would need to refresh.</em><br />
<br />
Here's the support article for guidelines on how to use the System File Checker tool:

<br />
The second method is to perform a repair upgrade. This process is more advanced. <br />

Update us with the outcome. <br />
