    <title>How can i change the button sizes of standard windows buttons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soul--reaver  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i change the button sizes of standard windows buttons&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Originally&nbsp;I installed my Windows 7 installation with a 1920*1080 resolution monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This caused windows to select by default 120 dpi for my windows text size instead of the normal 96 dpi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was easily fixed for the current user account&nbsp;and a small regedit also fixed it for the login screen. The problem still remaining is the button sizes of some buttons within various programs and Windows installers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take total commander for example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Commander search window buttons when windows is initially installed with a 1920*1080 resolution, by default a dpi&nbsp;of 120&nbsp;and afterwards changed it back&nbsp;to 96 dpi</p>
<p><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v120/Soul--Reaver/images/wrongsizebuttons.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v120/Soul--Reaver/images/wrongsizebuttons.png</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Commander search window buttons when windows is initially installed with a 1680*1050 resolution and by default a dpi of 96</p>
<p><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v120/Soul--Reaver/images/correctsizebuttons.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v120/Soul--Reaver/images/correctsizebuttons.png</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see the buttons are different in size, especially height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched the internet but could find no answer as to how to change the buttons back to default sizes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can somebody help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update 05-02-2011: It seems this is global setting not found in the user profiles as creating a new account and logging in with that does not change the size of the buttons even though the new account says that 96 dpi is the default and its current DPI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>
This is how my pen originally worked. I got use to this and I liked it. My boyfriend did something to my surface pro 3 yesterday because I couldn't open the store. When I turned it on today it didn't work the same at all. The eraser button does work as an eraser
 but not continuously I have to tap while holding the button to get it to erase. Before I was able to use the "right-click button" to circle things and move them around and so forth but now that does nothing. At least not that I can tell.</p>

            Thanks but it wasn't the battery. I messed around on it some more and solved the issue. I have to uninstall the program, fix the time and date setting and reinstall the app. At first the app wouldn't install and that's why I had to fix the time and date
 and that seemed to fix all the problems I was having. I didn't even know the time and date was wrong but I saw somewhere online that it could cause problems so I decided to check it out and sure enough it was way off.

<h2>            Windows 8 Keeps Freezing</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my laptop to windows 8, it worked fine in windows 7. It kept freezing about 2 minutes into boot. So I decided to do a computer reset so my computer was restored back to factory settings. Its doing the same thing again. My laptop is compatible
 with windows 8 I made sure of that. It's fine in safe mode. I can't download&nbsp;any&nbsp;drivers in safe mode with networking because windows wont run windows installer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Do you receive any error code or message?<br />
2. Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Is the computer freezing even in safe mode?<br />
4. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the below methods and check the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1<br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if the computer freezes.<br />
</p>
<p>Method 2: Perform clean boot and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Enable half of the services</p>
<p>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b) Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d) Click OK, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</p>
<p>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </p>
<p>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</p>
<p>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</p>
<p><br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem</p>
<p>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 7:</p>
<p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.<br />
</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps in the below link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows hangs or freezes:</span></b></p>

            <p>I too am having a very similar problem on a Toshiba Satelite C655 laptop purchased in 2011. I upgraded from a fully patched Win 7 to Win 8. I installed the drivers using the Toshiba upgrade assistant. For about 30 minutes after login the system is effectively
 frozen. As soon as it boots I try and start the Task manager to see I can determine the cause. The Task Manager takes about 10 minutes to load but when it does come up it shows that the disk drive is at 100%.</p>
<p>After about half an hour the system finishes whatever is happening (or it times out) and the system behaves normally until the next restart (cold or warm).</p>
<p>I have turned off all startup services and it still freezes per your instructions above.</p>
<p>So far I have used PC tools to clean and compact the registry and I forced a full defrag on the drive with no improvement. It is like the system is indexing something. It gives no errors, it is just unresponsive during this time.</p>
<p>This is a real issue.</p>

            Hi AntChi, I am trying to try your suggestion.&nbsp; I am new to Windows 8 64bit.&nbsp; I am upgrading from 32bit windows Xp.&nbsp; Windows 8 has installed, and I can log in, but it randomly freezes within about 5min of logging on.&nbsp; I don't know where to find the Power
 management options or the windows update options in Windows 8, and my computer does not run for long enough to look around and find them.<br />
<br />
Will report findings below:<br />
To set power to high performance in win 8<br />
<ul>
<li>from start screen press windows key + x</li><li>select power options on the menu that comes up</li><li>click "create a power plan" from the left hand menu</li><li>select "High Performance"</li><li>Name the plan something</li></ul>
Ok I have got my computer into High Performance power setting.&nbsp; It has taken me about 10 restarts to get this far.&nbsp; My computer is still freezing but I haven't tried the update yet.&nbsp; Not sure computer will run long enough to update anything but will try.<br />
<br />
To perform a Windows update in Windows 8:<br />
<ul>
<li>press windows key + x</li><li>&nbsp;Select Control Panel</li><li>Select System and Security</li><li>Select Windows Update</li><li>Click on the link telling you how many updates there are for your machine (there were 32 for mine - including my graphics card which I rather suspect is the source of my freezing)</li></ul>
<p>Took another 5 restarts to get to this stage.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next, now I know how to get to this step, I will go there as quickly as possible and start the updating.&nbsp; I hope the computer will run long enough to download and install any of the updates!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Took 3 restarts to bring up the windows update screen again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alright.&nbsp; Got to click the install updates button.&nbsp; Is currently downloading 32 updates.&nbsp; Don't see any data coming in yet (0kb total, 0% complete).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows updates were not downloading even though I could get onto the interned with explorer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Couldn’t update from the Microsoft web site, have to use windows updater via control panel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While I was googleing for how to make it download, my graphics card checked and found an update was available by its self.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Downloaded and installed that manually via internet explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer froze again with 65% remaining.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Restarted. Opened NVidia Settings screen from panel in bottom right next to the time.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Clicked, Help &gt; Updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then clicked on Download in the dialogue box that came up telling me there was an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Took me to the same web page that I was on before.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Finished the download this time and ran a security scan.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Installed the driver (Nvidia display driver v314.22).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finished installing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Couldn’t find a way of shutting down computer in windows 8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Found a button that logged me out.<span>&nbsp; </span>On login screen there was a power button in bottom right hand side.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Selected Install updates then shut down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I did this option there were only 14 updates not 32 like when I went through control panel. These updates are actually installing though.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is up to 6 out of 14 at the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alright computer installed the 14 updates, plus I installed the Nvidia driver updates manually, leaving 17 left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough after one freeze I got back to Windows update and there are only 17 to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly computer is still freezing (I thought the video driver update would have fixed it).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also Windows update is still refusing to download the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also my DVD drive does not show up…Not sure a new operating system is worth all this hassle!</p>

<p>Hello CapitalG,<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you consider moving to the full Retail Version of Windows 7 since you are still on the RC version.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be to see do a clean boot and see if there is any software or 3rd party program that could be interferring with
<br />
MailWasher Pro.<br />
<br />
KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>I would like to see if any startup items or third party services could be causing the issue.&nbsp; This is called a clean boot. You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused
 by a loading program or service.</p>
<p><br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            What if this doesn't work? I have the full version of Windows 7 and just downloaded a free trail of a Audio Editor. I either get the exact same message or the program program doesn't respond at all. Even when I run it as the administrator.<br />

<h2>            Edge browser won&#39;t open in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 about a month ago and had no issues until today when Edge just refuses to open. &nbsp;I click and the button changes slightly, I select from the start menu, whatever, nothing happens. &nbsp;To make matters worse I'm now having to use Google
 Chrome but that's been hijacked by bl**dy Mydial so I don't trust it to use my bank, PayPal, etc. &nbsp;There doesn't seem to be a "system restore" in Windows 10 as there always has been in previous versions, a bad mistake if it's missing and bad organisation if
 it's there but impossible to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a few tips from earlier posts and followed them but so far nothing works. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;Please stay simple, I'm a non-computer-literate granddad. &nbsp;It wojuld be a bonus if I can find out how to remove MyDial without having to send cash to some chancer
 selling anti spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final question: my Norton antivirus keeps (kept) telling me that as yet Windows 10 doesn't allow Norton to work. &nbsp;****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually solved the problem myself by doing a system restore.&nbsp; The function is not where you'd expect to find it and took about 30 minutes instead of two but here's how I found it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on start</p>
<p>Click on "Settings"</p>
<p>Click on "Update and security"</p>
<p>Type search term "System restore" </p>
<p>Click on "Create a restore point" which actually opens a new menu (?!)</p>
<p>Choose the "System protection" tab</p>
<p>Now, finally, you have a "System restore" button.&nbsp; Just like you used to have straight from system tools before the tools at MS decided otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a pity there isn't a "weekend restore" button for the time and lost patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good day (from France)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Inserting Media interrupts Windows Media Player playback &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>First, let's get one thing out of the way:&nbsp; I have Autoplay disabled.&nbsp; Just double-checked.&nbsp; It's disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I can remember (Windows 7, possibly before that), while watching a movie or listening to an MP3 file, regardless of autoplay settings, the playback of that file is interrupted whenever inserting media such as a flash drive, a CD or DVD.&nbsp; As if
 that weren't bad enough, there is no way to get back to where it left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even worse?&nbsp; Suppose I'm playing a video file, and I insert a flash drive.&nbsp; Not only is the movie interrupted, Windows Media Player doesn't even show me anything worth looking at when it comes to getting back to the movie.&nbsp; My video of the movie is interrupted,
 the audio of the movie continues (I can play/pause and stuff at the bottom of the window - it's as if I'm just listening to an MP3 at that point).... meanwhile Windows Media Player switches to the most inopportunely useless screen ever conceived in the history
 of mankind that shows a stupid little file tree on the left (a file tree that tries really hard to only show "media" such as my "plugable" hard drive, my DVD drive, flash drive, etc., so there isn't even any way to get back to the file on my INTERNAL HARD
 DRIVE that I'm actually interested in), and a huge blank area in the middle of the window that says, "To begin, insert a disc into the drive" (referring to the CD/DVD drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow.&nbsp; So while watching a movie on my hard drive, inserting a flash drive into a USB port is apparently my signal to Windows Media Player that I want to...&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>i n s e r t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D V D&nbsp;</em>? ? ? ?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is beyond unacceptable for this behavior to ever have existed.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Apparently Microsoft does not test their own products before releasing.&nbsp; But for this behavior to exist for AN ENTIRE FREAKING DECADE is just simply beyond anything I can put into
 words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, the purpose of this post is to call attention to this issue.&nbsp; Forgive my frustration, but it has bottled up for a decade and is now exploding.&nbsp; Please see past my anger, and rest assured there are millions of people out there who find this extremely
 annoying but who simply aren't taking the time to tell you about it because they probably think Microsoft will figure it out on their own.</p>

<p>A friend of mine has the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the troubleshooter does is reset my WMP settings to default, which doesn't solve the problem.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>This problem has existed regardless of the WMP or Windows version, and with many different motherboards/configurations over the years (different installs every time).<br />

<p>I don't know if it is related, but I notice that there are times that my external monitor will blink off then on, and about 25% of the time, it will happen again shortly, then the machine locks up. Laptop display stays on, but system is frozen and power
 button needs to be held down. I have a zip of then minidump as well.</p>

<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
117 is almost always your video driver, though antivirus/antispyware/security products as well as others can<br />
cause it. Have you updated any drivers lately? Be sure to check in Control Panel - Windows Updates to see<br />
if any were updated there.<br />
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers lately - check in Control Panel -<br />
Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below<br />
and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can<br />
cause this error.<br />
<br />
Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's&nbsp;Support as there could be known<br />
issues -&nbsp;also check in their forums.<br />

<p><strong>BCCode: 117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000117&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x117: VIDEO_TDR_TIMEOUT_DETECTED<br />
<br />
</strong>The VIDEO_TDR_TIMEOUT_DETECTED bug check has a value of 0x00000117. This indicates that the display driver failed to respond in a timely fashion.
</p>
<p>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code </p>
<p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Update the Video driver - also look for BIOS and low level chipset drivers at the System
<br />
Maker's (motherboard maker's for custom systems).<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check for Viruses/Malware.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the hard drive for errors - run Checkdisk (see below)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The inclusion of the 116 error code in the troubleshooter is only coincidence and holds no<br />
specific meaning (other than driver caused bluescreens do occur with some frequency).<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

<p>Dell only appears to have Windows 2000, XP and Vista drivers for the graphics device in your laptop. They recommend using the latest Vista driver as a general principle when Windows 7 ones don't exist. Is that what you are using? See:</p>

<h2>            How to delete synced files from NBA 2K14&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After restoring to factory defaults the game was uninstalled but when I reinstall the game and sync the files, all the files were originally saved. Those saved files were corrupted so you cannot resume MyGm or MyCareer or start a new one. So how do you delete
 the synced files from 2k? That will be the only way to fix the crash to menu/unable to start new MyGm and MyCareer.</p>

<p>G'day Sh0wSt0pp3r! It appears that the best way to wipe your MyCareer clean is by deleting your 2K account and starting fresh.

<h2>            Win 10 and Win 8.1 running at the same time sort of</h2>
                    <p>I was running Win 8.1 and upgraded to Win 10, with just a few problems but it is running and seems to be ok with the exception that I can't download from the Store, upgrades to Win 10 have stopped working and small things like that... I know both are sort
 of running as I still have Windows Media Player and it works fine. Its almost like they are running on top of each other. &nbsp;Any ideas about how to correct this ? &nbsp;Not sure if I revert to the 8.1 then where do I get the reinstall for Win 10 again ? &nbsp;also I think
 I'm over the 30 days to revert back to 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help. &nbsp;I ran both of the listed things you suggest and Windows Store is working at times now. When I stated that both seem to be running at the same time here is what I mean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Going back and forth between for example chrome and the home page if I minimize Chrome and it goes to the task bar on the bottom, but you can't click it again to bring it up for use, you have to hover over the icon and click open... I am aware that you
 want me to use Edge but I'm an old lady and really like how I have Chrome set up :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If playing a game the game will initially start but then go immediately back to the home page as if you didn't start anything. Or it will start and then not do anything other then sit there, and you have to click it off and start over. &nbsp;This happens when
 opening programs from the live tiles as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have Windows Updates that say they need to be downloaded and installed and I have them listed as KB3081441 which has tried to install 3 times. The last successful update I had was 8-11-15. I am set to Automatic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows Media Player still works for me just fine and I understood that this should not be working. I appreciate that it is because I use it a lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I guess basically what I am trying to convey is that what should take 1 click or 1 command requires for me doing it another way. I didn't have a lot of problems upgrading and I can live with what I have but I am concerned that my security updates are
 not being installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I did 2 steps you listed and they finished they said they were fine after finishing. I appreciate your help and I am happy with my upgrade because WIN 8.1 had it's problems . &nbsp;Also me and Cortana are becoming fast friends but she has had to learn
 my Kentucky accent and sometimes when she gets CLOSE to what she thinks I mean it puts a smile on my face what she comes up with !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Thank you for your time and help</p>
<p>Kat</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t resume from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Worked fine in Win 7. When I resume, I hear it power on (the led lights back up), I see a black screen. My computer has a physical restart button and when I press it, it restarts and resumes the computer; I see the resuming message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ATI Radeon 7770, but I don't think that's the problem. I tried the integrated graphics and it has the same problem. I have an Asrock z97m motherboard and I've already updated the BIOS. Hibernate works fine though.</p>

 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows OEM Product key to activate Windows Retail</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus PC with an OEM product code printed on the bottom. If I use a retail Windows 7 Home Premium to perform a clean install, can I use the OEM product code to activate windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Bill</p>

            <p>Yes as long as the OEM key is for Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you do a "Keyless" install, next install the Manufacture's Device drivers&nbsp;and then activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows.</strong></p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to: 'Type your Windows product key', do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p><br />
During this 30 day grace period you can try resolving your problems.&nbsp; <br />
After you are satisfied all problems have been resolved then activate Windows.</p>
<p><br />
How to Activate Windows 7 by Internet<br />
1) Click Start and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; Activate&nbsp; <br />
2) Click on the 'Activate Windows' option at the top of the list<br />
3) Click on 'Activate Windows online now'<br />
4) Enter your 25 character product key (not case sensitive)<br />
5) Click 'Next' and wait for the key to be verified.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; Alternate Method: Start/Control Panel/System and Security/System/<br />
&nbsp; Now scroll down to the bottom and click 'Change product Key'</p>

    <title>Blue question mark on disk drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelsey vera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue question mark on disk drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi. So my problem is that my drive has this blue question mark and I can't access/open it, I also couldn't find it in Disk Manager but I can see it in Drive Manager. What I did was I turned it into Storage Pool but after finding out that it's not what I
 need to do, I deleted that pool, and now I can't open it :/.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Also, my drive is WDC WD10SPZX-22Z10T0 and it is attached via SATA.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kelsey,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue with your disk drive is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. The blue question mark issue could possibly be resolved
<strong>if the drive shows up in the Disk Manager</strong>. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=Windows10ITPro&amp;forum=win10itproapps%2Cwin10itprohardware%2Cwin10itprosetup%2Cwin10itpronetworking%2Cwin10itprosecurity%2Cwin10itprovirt%2Cwin10itprogeneral%2Cwin10itpromobile%2CWindowsInsiderPreview&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=missing+disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a></strong>.
 There are specialists there that can provide a more advanced recommendation on the next step to resolve your issue.
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Why do I keep getting my files multiplied&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So it seems whenever I download PDF files-no matter what it is-I keep getting copies I never authiorized. Saying this-not that you have to authorize anything any more. So last night I was getting really fustrated. So I went to where these files were at.
 I copied and only one file to stick it elsewhere. So now on some files-the o0nes I copied and moved-some files I have like five despite only dealing with one file. So why is Microsoft so inept?Has anyone dealt with this before?</p>

            <p>A service pack (SP) is a Windows update, often combining previously released updates, that helps make Windows more reliable.&nbsp; See this page to learn more what a service pack is and how to get it.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/service-packs-download#sptabs=win7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Service Pack and Update Center</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the automatic update feature (Windows Update), then you will not have to download all the full service pack, because Windows Update only downloads the parts you need for your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, yes: a touch-screen monitor will allow you to use all of Windows 8.1 with no restrictions.&nbsp; How much you might decide to use it is another matter.&nbsp; I have a touch screen computer at home with Windows 8.1 but I hardly ever actually
 touch it.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Unspecified changes to sys configuration might&#39;ve caused the problem</h2>
                    <p>So what do you plan to do about my computer which WON'T boot since I elected to revert it from Windows 10 (normal MS pushed update from win 7 home premium)-&nbsp; Original Title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have an Acer system bought new in '10, and nothing been done to it except bumping the oem 3Gb of ram to 4Gb. Came with Win 7 Hm Prem os, and had that until recently. The expected push of Win 10 came thru about a week ago for THIS system, and it accomplished
 with not much more issue than a long period of download/install. Then I noticed that certain things were NOT working; my research caused me to come to realize that those who might've normally helped were too hard to contact for one like me, and that the system
 was all about hiding new report-back functions in the small print disclosures most people gloss over.</p>
<p>Made a decision to revert back.Did that, and stem has not booted once properly since.startup recovery WON'T correct the issue, tells me the following:"Unspecified changes to sys configuration might've caused the problem" &nbsp;I really NEED this machine, so any
 help would be mych appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey there Sinister Rage X!</p>

<p>The requirements are not posted on the Ambassador FAQ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But here is what is posted:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Why did I get rejected from the program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to reject a user from the program without notice or reason, but the vast majority of rejections are because applicants have had some Xbox LIVE Enforcement action taken against them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note: Official Microsoft agents on Twitter @XboxSupport and the Xbox.com Support Forums will be unable to provide further details regarding your case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend possibly trying again at a later time.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>that dosent matter. Not all applications to the ambassadors program are accepted. This doesent mean yours wasent accepted because you had "enforcement action"</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Thats just the majority of people who try to apply, they had enforcement action within the last 365 days. What UrReMoTeCoNTRoL said was spot on. Let me point out a few highlights in his quote:
</p>
<p>[quote user="UrReMoTeCoNTRoL"]</p>
<p>Q: Why did I get rejected from the program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to <span>reject a user</span> from the program
<span>without notice or reason,</span> but the vast majority of rejections are because applicants have had some Xbox LIVE Enforcement action taken against them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note: Official Microsoft agents on Twitter @XboxSupport and the Xbox.com Support Forums will be unable to provide further details regarding your case.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats directly from the Ambassadors FAQ page</p>
<p>the "but the vast majority of rejections are because applicants have had some Xbox LIVE " does not mean YOU has had enforcement action. but they may have rejected you for a different reason. Nobody can tell you why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Maybe try back in a month or two</p>

<h2>            Games previously obtained from Games with Gold showing as not owned</h2>
                    <p>Two games, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime and Slime Rancher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I was crazy at first. The games don't show up in my order history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my achievements tell the story. Slime Rancher was a gwg game on August 2017. I have achievements throughout 8/17, on 1/18, 2/18, 4/18 and 11/18. There's no way that was a trial. No it shows that I don't own the game. When I go to launch it, it says
 "Your trial for this game has expired"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime was a gwg game on 2/17. I have achievements from 3/17, 7/17, and 4/18. When I go to launch it I get the "Do you own this game or app?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only profile on my xbox, so I'm not mistakenly looking at different profiles. I'm trying to go back through old gwg games I've purchased to see if these are the only two affected</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you sure about that? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've redeemed every Games with Gold title for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and the Payment &amp; Billing page doesn't show any GwG titles for me.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I've 100% completed Slime Rancher, and when I go to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/slime-rancher/c2nc88m7nwz1?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
store</a>, it shows I don't own it either. That happens because you technically don't own the Xbox One GwG titles. You can only claim them when they are available, and you need an active subscription to continue playing them.
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/xbox-live-membership/games-with-gold-faq#e7236417048e494d92d48f4811ea1c70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/xbox-live-membership/games-with-gold-faq#e7236417048e494d92d48f4811ea1c70</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an active subscription, then try hard resetting your console. All you have to do is hold the power button on the console until it turns off (it should only take about 10 seconds). After that, turn it back on and try again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit - Also, double check the pages for Slime Rancher and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, if you did claim them on your account, then it should say, "Install on my devices" above the price / buy to own.

            Did you let your Gold lapse at all? Meaning did you have a break in your Gold time at all? If so you’ll lose access to those games if you did.

            Personally, when I look for an old GwG like in this case, I've never looked in my Order History. I'll look first in my Ready to Install list or even under the Games with Gold tab in My Games and Apps. If it's still not showing there, which does happen
 occasionally, then I'll just manually search for the game title in the Store, and there it should say "Install" when you view it in the Store if you've already downloaded it before from GwG.&nbsp;

    <title>Downgrade to 32-bit WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dutchman308  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downgrade to 32-bit WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased a brand new Dell notebook running WINDOWS 10 64-bit. It was a very cheap notebook so i wasn't expecting much but, once powering up and setting up the basic system with all of the Dell bloatware, I have used 98% of the built in 32GB
 eMMC storage. That's before installing any apps or downloading anything. The notebook is actually really nice other than the tiny amount of storage which can't be upgraded. So, I am thinking about refreshing the system with a fresh copy of WINDOWS 10 32-bit
 and keeping it light. Other than binning it, does anyone have any other ideas? The other question is - can/how do you downgrade your copy of OEM WINDOWS 10 64-bit to 32-bit without buying a new license? Where would i find my license serial?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

            No need to worry for the license. However, it might be worth checking if 32 bit drivers are provided. Andre's post in the thread below should help you for low capacity drives:

            Yes, MS is only helping builders deliver inadequately provisioned devices by agreeing that 32GB drives are appropriate for WIndows 10.  They aren't. period.
<br />
<br />No problem. Just do a "clean install" of 32 bit.  There is no other "downgrade" process.  Your Windows license allows you to use either version.
<br />
<br />According to MS 32bit should free up about 4GB of space.
<br />
<br />As well as switching to 32 bit there are a number of other things you can do to reduce space used.  Doing a clean install will wipe out the factory installed 'crapware'. But there is more you can remove. Windows comes with a whole bunch of apps you probably don't need.  As well, you can offload some applications to external drives.

Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

            Hi James, yes going to the 32Bit version of Windows 10 would be your best option, it will give you a lot more space, I would also think about turning off Automatic Updates on that system to maintain the space . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, your licence covers both versions, you will not need a product key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a lot of possible reasons why your computer would shutdown on its own. There could be a critical error in the system process, corrupted registry or system file, or recent settings or hardware changes in which the system finds invalid for the
 current setup. We need to ask you the following questions so that we would know how to assist you properly with your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When the computer shuts off, did you experience any Blue Screen error?</li><li>Did the computer provided you any error codes?</li><li>Were you able to turn on the computer again? If yes, have you had troubles turning on the computer?</li><li>Do you remember doing any changes in the computer before the issue occurred?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>
        </p>

            Hi Masta.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Facebook Security checkup which will make sure all of your posts and actions are your own and then help you change to a stronger password to lock out whoever might have hacked you.  I like a password that runs together an old address+phonenumber so you remember it but it doesn't exist elsewhere.  
<br />
<br />Facebook security checkup:  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/799880743466869/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/799880743466869/</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
