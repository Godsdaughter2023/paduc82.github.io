 try to sync depending on the device’s storage capacity and the size of your Player Library. After which you can choose a different sync method if you want (manually).</span></p>

<h2>            How do I format my drive for a Clean Install of W7 Pro 64 Bit if my system is running on it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am all ready to proceed with my install of Windows 7 Pro 64Bit... BUT,&nbsp;I understand that I must "Format" my primary hard drive, which is currently running&nbsp;XP Pro&nbsp;32 Bit... I have gone into the BIOS and also System Tools and apparently there is no way to
 format the "System" drive that I am able to locate.</p>
<p>How do I format this drive so that I have the "Clean" drive for&nbsp;the custom&nbsp;installation&nbsp;of Windows 7... I purchased the Disk, it is a "Full Version" not requiring an Upgrade or previously installed version of Windows, although I do have my key for XP Pro
 should it be required. I just can't seem to figure out how to format&nbsp;this "running" OS Drive...??? Is there something I'm missing...? The only way I can&nbsp;imagine it would work is&nbsp;that I will probably have to remove the drive, and format it with another computer...???
 Is that the solution? Sure doesn't indicate that anywhere in the help files or&nbsp;instructions I've&nbsp;been through,&nbsp;just that I must format the drive for a "Clean Install" via the Custom Installation... With No Information on "How" to accomplish it...???</p>
<p>I'm in the middle of this and just don't see a way to proceed... HELP!?!? Thank You</p>

<p>Although if I run into any issues down the road, apparently I'll have to go through that process all over again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can avoid the possible hassle you experienced from installing Windows by making an image of your current system. If you ever need to reinstall because of a crash, virus, etc. you simply restore the image and if you've already activated Windows 7 you
 won't have to reactivate (you may need to reactivate if you've made hardware changes). Only big catch is the image usually won't work if you replace the motherboard - that normally requires a true reinstall. You will need external storage (hard drive, flash
 drive, or DVD) to store it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Create A System Image In Windows 7 </strong><br />
<br />
After you install and activate Windows 7 create a system image as a backup for your current computer in case you ever need to reinstall it. This will restore your computer to it's exact state when the image was made - that will save you the trouble of having
 to reinstall Windows 7 and everything currently installed again, and it takes much less time to do. Files and changes made after the image is created will not be restored if you use the image to restore Windows.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Click the Start Menu and type "Back Up" then click on Back up your Files.&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; In the Control Panel window that appears, Click the blue Create a system image link.<br />
3.&nbsp; The Create a system image window should pop-up.&nbsp; Select which hard disk, DVD, or network location you are going to save your system image to.&nbsp; Click Next to continue.<br />
4.&nbsp; On the next page check both your System and System Reserved drives.&nbsp; Once you have selected the drives Click Next to continue. Note: You can select as many drives as you want (if available), but the more you choose to include means the larger the image
 size will be. <br />
5.&nbsp; The next window is just a review, make sure everything is correct then Click Start backup to start the process.&nbsp; This can take 10 minutes or more so patience is required.<br />
6.&nbsp; After the backup completes, you'll be prompted with the option to create a system repair disc.&nbsp; This is a good idea just in case your system has any problems in the future.&nbsp; Click Yes.<br />
7.&nbsp; Choose which Disc Recording drive you'll be using to burn the disc.&nbsp; Insert a blank CD or DVD to the physical drive and then Click Create disc.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You can also use a free hard drive imaging program - the two below will have more features (and are better) then Windows 7 built in imaging program. Both enable you to make a boot disk to start the recovery, and both programs allow you to divide the backup
 to multiple DVDs.<br />

<p>Our school has recently upgraded all our PC's and laptops to Windows 10 and we have installed Autocollage.&nbsp; Many of the teachers take photos as evidence of the childrens work so we use Autocollage quite alot.&nbsp; In the past, on Windows 7, we have just installed
 it and off we go.&nbsp; However, now it seems to be a 30 day trial version, and once the 30 days are up we are being asked to register and enter a 25 digit/letter key.&nbsp; We have never in the past needed a key and do not have one.&nbsp; We have looked on the volume licencing
 site and no information there.&nbsp; I have searched the Microsoft support pages and all the links lead me to pages that are clearly out of date and no longer exist.&nbsp; Does anyone have any advice?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p />

<p>Hello Claire,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like this issue is being caused by the recent upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. If you still have the product key for the Microsoft Research Autocollage, you may try to enter it and see if it will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this works.</p>

<p>Hi Timothy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be several reasons why Windows 10 update fails. It can be due to a corrupted or missing update components. However, we would like to ask for the exact error message you get when updating. You can also include a screenshot of the failed update.
 Here's <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
how to include a screenshot in your post</a>.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Windows 8 came pre-installed, I would suggest you to get in touch with the Toshiba annd obtain the installation media for Windows 8. Once you obtain the mdia, you may follow the suggestions provided by VipinPalathully Gopi in his earlier post.</p>

<h2>            Media sharing not working</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently had a blue screen crash when un-installing Comodo Internet Security. When I re started Windows, Comodo wouldn't un-install at all and I had to use a custom remove tool to get rid of it, which also meant hacking at my registrty and deleting many
 files that were causing problems. Since then I have been unable to get media sharing to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done all the usual things:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Restarted Windows media player service</li><li>Restarted uPnP service</li><li>Restarted SSDP service</li><li>Deleted files from App Data/Windows media player folder</li><li>Trying media sharing from another admin user account</li><li>Made a system restore to a time before I hacked my registry and deleted all those files the custom remove tool (REVO) said to delete</li><li>Just about everything else I could find in many forums</li></ul>
The thing is, Windows isn't reporting any errors, it seems to think everything is working fine. The network and sharing centre can see all my devices; I've logged on to my router which also can see all my devices; WMP sharing is on etc., etc. Yet nothing can
 see my files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm also trying with TVersity and MediMonkey media player 4 (This is the software I'd used mostly for streaming video and music previously with no problems).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've gone 3 years without having to flatten and restore my PC and I really don't want to now. Anyone got any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            Thanks but, as I stated in an earlier post, I don't have an install DVD. I have decided to re-format the PC after buying a new laptop (overdue anyway).
<div><br />
<div>Thanks to all who replied, but I think I have spent enough hours now, trying to fix the unfixable.</div>

<h3> muchoboosto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extender Setup - Configuration Error</h2>
                    
<p>So, I've searched this issue to death and have gotten no where. The specific error I receive in Windows Media Center (WMC) is "Configuration Error - An error was encountered while configuring your computer for use with this extender."</p>
<p>This error happens after entering the code from the xbox into WMC, I click next and it starts the "Configuring your extender and computer". It gets to the second checkbox which says "Searching for your extender" which is when I get the error listed above.</p>
<p>I've never had WMC connected to this xbox before so there were no settings to disassociate on the xbox. Xbox is connect via ethernet cable to a 2wire router (provided by ATT uverse). Internet and LIVE connection are both present on xbox and pc.</p>
<p>I am able to setup regular media sharing via xbox dashboard to show images and play music. So that tells me the 2 boxes can talk to each other in some way.</p>
<p>I run my pc as an admin - win 7 x64 enterprise. Its connected to router via wifi. I've checked my windows firewall to ensure that all nessecary WMC ports are open to allow incoming/outgoing data.</p>
<p>I've set my router to allow the xbox to stream.</p>
<p>Windows event viewer lists the following useless error: "Media Center Extender Setup cannot create an account for the Extender with ID: uuid: ##..##..##<br />
Error: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of at this point is the company I work for has enabled something I'm not aware of that is blocking WMC from doing what it needs to.</p>
<p>How can I resolve this error?</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Have you tried to delete the map pack, clear your cache, and then re-download the map pack?<br />
<br />
I remember this was a huge issue when the map pack first came out and people either couldn't see the Moon map or they couldn't load it. It usually meant that there was an issue with their game disc either being scratched or the console being unable to read
 certain files that were needed for this map to work.<br />
<br />
Do you have access to another copy of the game, either from a friend or maybe the ability to rent one to test this theory out?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HID-compliant mouse driver keeps reinstalling without permission and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rj3x37  say:</h3>
<h2>            HID-compliant mouse driver keeps reinstalling without permission and stops my Logitech trackball from working.</h2>
                    
<p>A month ago I bought a Microsoft wireless comfort keyboard 5000 and a mouse came with it. I had/have NO intention to use the mouse.&nbsp; I use&nbsp;trackballs PERIOD!&nbsp; None of MS's trackballs have the features I want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is infrequent&nbsp;and has no obvious cause.&nbsp; But tonight for the 3rd time since installing the keyboard I booted up Win 7 only to find the cursor would NOT move!&nbsp; For the 3rd time I used the keyboard functions to get to the Control Panel menu and
 open the Mouse Properties&nbsp;and Device Manager.&nbsp; And for the 3rd time found that the HID-compliant mouse driver was installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time I found it, I&nbsp;Disabled the driver, but&nbsp;after rebooting WIN 7 still did not recognize the properly installed Logitech cordless trackball.&nbsp; Since disabling the driver did not work I unistalled it.&nbsp; Low &amp; behold the trackball IMMEDIATELY started
 working, no need to reboot.</p>
<p>2nd time I went straight to&nbsp;uninstalling the HID mouse driver.&nbsp; And believe it or not, the trackball returned to functionality immediately.</p>
<p>This time uninstalling the driver I had to reboot to get the trackball to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I stop WIN 7 from re-installing this UNWANTED driver?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And side issue, how to I get the Mouse Properties' Buttons tab to once again show my Logitech Trackball properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after uninstalling the MS mouse it continues to show the MS mouse image.&nbsp;&nbsp; AND the only choices in the "Connected device" pull down
 are MS products.&nbsp; Why doesn't it list my INSTALLED Logitech Trackball?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>Hi Rj3x37,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>HID Compliant mouse is installed by default in Windows whenever windows detects a mouse.<span>&nbsp;</span>So, on every reboot your logitech
 mouse is getting detected as a new device and hence windows is installing the driver for your mouse automatically from the driver store. Moreover, you do not see the logitech trackball properties under your Mouse properties tab under Control Panel. Disabling
 the default windows driver installation for devices will disable for every new device you plug-in.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps I would suggest you to try in order to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Re-install the latest logitech drivers for your mouse</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It seems like your logitech mouse drivers are corrupt. Before you install the latest drivers for your logitech mouse, I would suggest you to uninstall
 the existing drivers completely including any logitech software.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>You’ve to use your keyboard functions to re-install
 drivers for your mouse once you completely uninstall the current drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 the mouse driver component.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the mouse component and click on uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the drivers from the Logitech Website:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/trackballs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/trackballs</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Re-install the Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard driver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step did not help you, then uninstall the Microsoft Wireless Comfort keyboard drivers along with Microsoft Intellipoint software.
 Follow the same steps as given in the step 1 to know how to uninstall a driver. </span>
</p>
<p><span>To uninstall Microsoft Intellipoint software, you need to go to<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">programs
 and features</a> wizard in the control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you completely uninstall the software, download and install the keyboard software and drivers by visiting the link below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Microsoft Hardware Support and drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=117&amp;active_tab=systemRequirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=117&amp;active_tab=systemRequirements</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Provide the information from the setupapi.dev.log</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists beyond these steps, then rename the setupapi.dev.log file and then try re-installing the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type %WINDIR%\INF</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on Setupapi.dev.log and click on rename it to setupapi.dev.log.old</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you’ve renamed, windows will create a new log file.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>This
 log file will pinpoint the source of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Copy and paste the log<span>&nbsp;</span>file information while posting back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>What is Microsoft doing with Xbox&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> posiedonx2  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is Microsoft doing with Xbox&#63;</h2>
                    <p>E3 is currently&nbsp;going on currently, and this has created a lot of frustration for me, and I'm sure many others, because Microsoft seems to be doing nothing innovative, new, but most importantly, exclusive with their games. I am wondering what Xbox and Microsoft are doing to bring new and exciting games to the Xbox? Right now every trailer&nbsp;I see for new, exciting looking games&nbsp;are PlayStation exclusive. So my question is, what is Xbox doing in regards to new games, but more importantly new IPs? Not another Halo, Gears, or Forza. Xbox seems to be sitting back and taking a fat L in terms of new games. The only reason I'm even bothering to keep my Xbox&nbsp;is that I don't&nbsp;have the money to buy a PlayStation and to re-purchase any game I would want to play. Is Xbox even making an effort right now to create new Xbox exclusive IP? To me, it doesn't&nbsp;feel like it. So what are Microsoft and Xbox ACTIVELY doing right now to fix this problem?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /

            <p>Hey PoseidonX2, I agree with the comment about exclusives. I have had xbox consoles since the original Xbox....currently own a 360, one and one x yet in all my time as an xbox gamer I have found the only exclusive to interest me was Ryse Son of Rome.....I would love to see a continuation of that game either continuing as Damocles in another story line or maybe take Alecto, Tisiphone and Megara the greek goddesses of vengeance or the Norse Vidar? Possibly a game like Kratos or the Uncharted games. An open world Thief would rock in my opinion too.</p>

<h2>            Why is there nowhere on this Microsoft-website a link to an older Version of Skype&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>And why .. doesnt the browser see, that I have an MacOS 10.13 and installs MOJAVE .. this sucks and is so unprofessional. But I had a look at the design ... MAN! You guys bought SKYPE and screwed it completely up ... it looks so bad - why dont you ask Apple-Designers
 to help you a bit with usability and Design? </p>
<p>But the biggest bull.... is that I download Skype and it tells me after having it installed, .. that it is not for that version of my system .. REALLYYYY ???</p>

    <title>Question about Skyrim DLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randyau93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Skyrim DLC</h2>
                    
<p>A friend has an Xbox 360 but, for whatever reason, he has not chosen to set up his console on the Internet at home. If he wants DLC or updates, he takes it to his brother's home and connects it there. He tells me that while he can play Skyrim at home, he
 cannot play Skyrim DLC, which raises the question: does Skyrim's DLC require an active Internet connection in order to be played?</p>

            <p>I asked somewhat of the same question. &nbsp;Here is what i got ( if anybody has better info post away), somehow when you buy dlc it attaches to the console that buys and the gamertag that buys it, both of them. &nbsp;That maybe why. &nbsp;I want Hearthfire for my second xbox, but would have to buy on this account.......wont work or didnt for me. &nbsp;My 2nd xbox only has one major update. &nbsp;I will have to wait till its on disc. mobile post</p>

            <p>So, I buy an Arcade game or DLC today, and my console goes titus uppus tomorrow, I go out and buy a new console but because I had downloaded the game / DLC to a different console, I cannot just download and play again??</p>

            <p>it's not exactly like that. I had a 360 with a bunch of things downloaded to it and then picked up an elite. I had to re download everything i wanted but did not habve to pay for it.</p>
<p>when you download any dlc i believe the process goes like this: purchase $$ or MS points and a transaction that the DLC was purchased is registered against your gamertag/profile. download space and liscencing registeres against your console. </p>
<p>Example: Nostrah can download delete and downlaod again all the hearthfire DLC i want as long as i do it on the same console because my purchase history and liscenced console match up. Nostrah cant plug into a friends console and re download hearthfire because the profile and the console do not match the initial point of purchase.</p>
<p>for skyrim - you do not need an active internet coneection so when you downlowded it did you plug in your profile and hardrive into a friend's console? that may be the issue. If you take your entire rig and only use his ethernet cable you should be fine,</p>
<p>to your follow up post you would need a transfer cable if your xbox broke to take all the liscences and what not and put them on the new machine,</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>

<p>I've had two consoles go RRoD, and both times I kept my hard drive and re-connected it to my console. Both times I had to transfer licenses for any XBLA games or DLC I had purchased, but after that download everything worked fine. I didn't re-purchase the
 first item ...</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In the case of my friend, he initially brought his hard drive to his brother's house and downloaded the DLC using his brother's console (we'll call his stuff A, and his brother's B). So Xbox B was using Hard Drive A to download the DLC using A's profile.
 When I said that might be the initial problem, he brought his entire console to his brother's house and re-downloaded it. So Hard Drive A was reconnected to Xbox A and the DLC's licenses were updated (at no charge). The software was tested at B's home with
 no issues; the DLC worked just fine. When the console was returned to A's home (as a reminder, A has not connected his console to the 'net at home), the main game worked fine, but he was unable to use the DLC he had purchased.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Does that clarify the issue a bit more? On appearance, Skyrim's DLC requires an active Internet connection, but that seems odd. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks to all responders, by the way :)</p>

            <p>That's because if you put something downloaded on a new console, after it was already downloaded on a different one, it requires you to do a license transfer. This is to ensure that people don't simply take their gamertag and put it on a friend's console and download the DLC or other item for them to use for free. It prevents illegal copying.</p>
<p>Once you connect and do a legal transfer, all would be well again.</p>
<p>As for the Arcade games though, most of them do require being connected to play. I am not sure why.</p>
<p>Now, Skyrim's DLC in particular... If you brought your whole console to your friends house and downloaded it with your own gamertag and console, there should not be a problem, so if that's the case, I don't know what's wrong. If you only took your storage device, such as your HD or a USB, then the license reads to your friends console and you wont be able to play offline.</p>

<li>What is your operating system? </li><li>Do you want to remove the credentials on Family Safety itself? Are you only removing it on Credential Manager?
</li><li>Can you remove other credentials in Credential Manager?</li></ul>

<h2>            Surface Book i7&#47;512&#47;dGPU BSOD&#58; VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR &#40;while browsing in Firefox&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Got another blue screen of death on my Surface book today while browsing in Firefox. This time it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting frustrating. How could you launch such an untested / unfinished product?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, all updates installed successfully as of 10/29. Yes, they show as successfully installed in Windows Update history. Yes, I manually installed the SB driver .MSI posted to the Surface support forums too just to make sure nothing somehow got missed. But
 you all already know that because it just can't be possible that you actually launched this product without knowing full well you were shipping buggy drivers with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm embarrassed for your engineers as I'm sure they begged for the release to be pushed so they could finish, but some PM wasn't having it. Fire that PM. Hire more engineers. Get this fixed. It was WAY to expensive for me to be forced to do all this beta
 testing for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have some sort of customer retention thank you package planned for all the SB early adopters who paid top dollar, only to have to put up with all these blatant bugs that you simply HAD to know you were shipping them.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out, John. While I haven't seen the VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR&nbsp;since all the latest updates, I've had 2 new BSODs (on top of the several Intel GPU driver crashes you're already well aware of). I'm sorry I didn't take pics of them
 but one said something about POWER, and the other said something about TIMING. Hopefully you have bugs open for BSODs with those words in them that you can +1.</p>
