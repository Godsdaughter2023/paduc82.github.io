<p>
</p><p>Is there a work around for Garmin Plug-in? I have tried using internet explorer but I can't download GPX files to garmin gps. I am downloading from geocache.com. It sees my gps but will not write. Worked before Windows 10 upgrade. Not happy.</p>

            <p>Found a work-around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Garmin eTrex20, bought last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a Folder in MyDocuments and call it something like GeoCaches... or if you're downloading a whole series name the folder after that series to make it easy to find again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win10 you should still have the option to open a page using Internet Explorer... sign into Geocaching.com, find the series or cache you want and select to download the GPX file. When it asks you whether you want to open or save it, select SAVE AS, set
 the destination folder for the one you've created and save the gpx file there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open BaseCamp, connect your Garmin, then go to "file" then "import into my collection", then select the file path to the folder you created. Then select all the gpx files you downloaded in to that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then sync to your Garmin in the usual way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My eTrex 20 shows up all the stuff it used to under the old method, description, hints, logs etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DR.</p>

<span>Hi PamelaPayne-Wilson,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which version of
</span><span>Printmaster Platinum are you trying to install?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to install other programs on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error may occur when the Microsoft .NET Framework installation on the computer is damaged or
<span>&nbsp;</span>missing.</span></p>
<p><span>You can try the following steps to reinstall and repair the Microsoft .NET Framework installation on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click the&nbsp;<span>Start</span> button, click&nbsp;
<span>Control Panel</span>, click&nbsp;<span>Programs</span>, and then click
<span>Turn Windows features on or off</span>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate Microsoft .NET framework 3.5.1 uncheck the box, click OK and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Once you boot in normal mode, again go to
<span>Turn Windows features on or off</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>and place check mark next to Microsoft .NET framework 3.5.1 and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You can check if you can install the
</span><span>Printmaster Platinum software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the following article and see if it helps:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit RC &#40;build 7100&#41; demanding activation</h2>
                    I downloaded the Release Candidate a few months ago and installed it. it's running fine, but a few weeks ago messages began appearing asking me to activate. My understanding was that the RC build 7100 would continue to run until next June. I plan to purchase
 a license as soon as the product is released; i.e., I won't wait until next June, but since I'm just running pre-release software, I have no activation key. I'm concerned that my computer is now flagged as running a "non-genuine" copy of Windows 7. I'm in
 a client-server environment (host is Windows 2008 SBS).<br />
<br />
Thanks so much,<br />

            Hi Jim<br />
<br />
How did you originally activate the RC version?<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span>Go back to the download website where you downloaded the RC.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><br />
Windows 7 Release Candidate Customer Preview Program</span></span></a><br />
</span></span></p>
<span><span><br />
Scroll down and select the language for the 32-Bit or 64-Bit </span><span><span>that you have installed
</span><span><span>and click the GO button. On the next page, you should see the Product Key displayed.<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 RC is no longer available for download. If you’ve got the download and need a product key, they’ll be available until October 21, 2009.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>Thank You for using Windows 7

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the temp file which you are unable to delete might be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly happens when you try to delete the temp file? Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some Temp files that can't be deleted because the application associated with it is still running. So for you to be able to delete these Temporary files, you need to stop the service or the application that is running. Usually Temp files are associated
 with anti-virus programs that are always running at the background. </p>
<p>Close out of all programs, reboot, and try again if you wish to delete the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back with the required information.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Open
<strong>Task Manager </strong>and end the processes related to <strong>explorer.exe</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Press
<strong>Windows key and R. </strong>In the run box, type %temp% and try to delete the files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Once deleted open task manager click on<strong> File
</strong>select <strong>Run a new task</strong>. Type <strong>explore.exe </strong>
and click on <strong>OK.</strong></span></p>

            I couldn't get the second step to work. I opened task manager and ended the processes related to explorer.exe and then i tried doing what you said in the second step with the Windows key and R and it didn't work and i couldnt get back to the %temp% file.

<p>
</p><p>From Help &amp; Support:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to the Run command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Run command no longer appears on the Start menu in this version of Windows. The search box that appears on the Start menu provides much of the same functionality as the Run command. However, the Run command is still available if you prefer to use it.
 You can even add it to the Start menu for easier access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add the Run command to the Start menu Click to open Taskbar and Start Menu Properties.</p>
<p>Click the Start Menu tab, and then click Customize. In the list of Start menu options, select the Run command check box, and then click OK. The Run command will be displayed on the right side of the Start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: You can also access the Run command by pressing the Windows logo key + R.

            <p>Hey there james bont!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue! 'Play to' was introduced in Windows 7. Unfortunately Windows Vista does not support 'Play to'. You will need to upgrade your OS to be able to stream to Xbox One, but an alternate route you can go is to put your media onto a USB 3.0 drive and plug it into the Xbox One console to play content off of that! :)</p>

<h2>            How to remove eHome IR Receiver&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate and am having problems removing the Ehome IR receiver from my laptop (Alienware M17)&nbsp; I need to have this completely removed in order to play some online games due to a know conflict between the IR drivers and the computer
 games.&nbsp; I have tried disabling and uninstalling the drivers through the Device manager, but every time I reboot it adds it right back.&nbsp; On Vista I had it set to were it wouldn't load the drivers at all for this device and never had any problems until after
 the Windows 7 install.&nbsp; How do I completely remove this and keep it from reloading at reboot on Windows Ultimate 7?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />
I've tried booting into safe mode and disabling it from there, but when rebooted into normal mode the device is still showing up and drivers are still there causing the conflict.

<span>Hi Ibenz26,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Disable automatic driver downloads:<br />
- Start menu -&gt; Right click Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Advanced System Settings (top left) -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Windows Update Drivers Settings -&gt; Select "Never check for drivers when I connect a device." -&gt; OK -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK<br />
<br />
2) Turn off SSDP Discovery:<br />
- Start menu -&gt; Type in "services.msc" without quotes and press Enter -&gt; Scroll to "SSDP Discovery" -&gt; Right click and select Properties -&gt; Change Startup Type to "Disabled" -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK<br />
<br />
3) Uninstall ENE CIR Receiver:<br />
- Start menu -&gt; Right click Computer -&gt; Manage -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Click the + beside Human Interface Devices -&gt; Right click "ENE CIR Receiver" and select Uninstall -&gt; MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE UNINSTALL SOFTWARE BOX ON THE PROMPT (this will take the Microsoft
 eHome Infrared Trasceiver with it) -&gt; OK -&gt; Let the uninstall take place -&gt; Reboot the computer<br />
<br />
4) Preventing installation of IR device drivers:<br />
- Upon reboot you will receive a prompt asking you if you want to install the device drivers -&gt; SELECT "NEVER FOR THIS DEVICE"<br />
<br />
5) Turn ON SSDP Discovery:<br />
- Follow directions from earlier and select "Manual" from the drop down menu (Startup Type) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<h3> jima387  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to Windows 7 64 bit &#40;KB2592687&#41; fails with error code 80070002</h2>
                    I am trying to install the KB2592687 update for Windows 7 64 bit.<br />
I keeping getting an error 80070002<br />
KB2574819 is installed. The knowledge base article says it must be installed before KB2592687.<br />
KB2592687 is not in the installed updates list on my computer, so I cannot uninstall it.<br />
I have tried the following:<br />
Clean boot mode. No success.<br />
The Microsoft fixit. No success<br />
The System Update Readiness Tool.&nbsp; No Success<br />
After each step, I rerun the KB2592687. The update finishes. I then reboot the system. Before the login screen (at 30% complete)
<br />
it then reboots itself and at the very end (at 89% complete) it says Failure configuring windows updates reverting changes.<br />
Any Ideas would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi
<b>Jim, </b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community forums. I see that Windows update fails while configuring the updates. I appreciate the steps that you have performed
 to resolve the issue. It would be grateful if you could answer few questions. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which Microsoft fixit have you performed to resolve the issue?
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which is the antivirus program installed on the computer?
</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is this issue confined to a specific update or with all?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This problem occurs when some files in the update are missing, even though the update is downloaded and extracted successfully.
</span><span>If you receive
</span><span>Windows</span> Update error <b>80070002</b> while checking for updates, you need to remove the temporary update files that
<span>Windows</span> uses to identify updates for your computer. To remove the temporary files, stop the
<span>Windows</span> Update service, delete the temporary update files, restart the
<span>Windows</span> Update service, and then try to check for
<span>Windows</span> updates again.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Let us try to perform few steps to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Step 1: You may either run the Fixit or perform the steps provided in the article. If you have already ran this fixit you may ignore this method.
</p>
<p><b><span>You receive a "0x80070002" or "0x80070003" error code after you download an update
 from Windows Update, from Microsoft Update, or from Windows Server Update Services</span></b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2:
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            DOS files in Win10</h2>
                    <p>I recently found a post by John Shadow regarding selective backing up via a dos file he had written. I would like to apply this to my win10 but as a newbie, I do not know how to implement it. I have written it out as suggested in notepad but do not know
 how to get it to operate, any advice?</p>

            Hi George
<br />
<br />Can you please post a link to the instructions you are following form John Shadow, so I can understand this better and provide you a solution
<br />
<br />Did that involve typing a list of commands into Notepad?
<br />
<br />If so, did you save that file as a batch file and then double click the batch - was that the instructions given?
<br />
<br />If so, open the Notepad file, choose File - Save as
<br />
<br />At the bottom of the 'Save As' dialog, set file type to 'All Files' *.*
<br />
<br />Then manually enter the whole file name and at the end you must add .bat for the file to execute . . .
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update fails &#40;hangs&#41; on &#40;first&#41; reboot</h2>
                    <p>This, my second attempt to Win10AU, has seen some success in that the installation is now rebooted (so implementing the update). Unfortunately those white dots keep spinning and the installation will progress no further ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Win10AU Attempt 2</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Completes preparation</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update is downloaded and executes preparation phase (drafts mods). It achieves the first gateway; request to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Boots, Starts to implement mods</strong></p>
<p>The modifications are being implemented. The standard indication is presented to the user. This is the white-dots in motion-right framed to a circle. This does not stop (timebox at 4-hours) until a hard-reset.</p>
<ul>
<li>The graphic continues in motion until user-terminated; so it does not hang per se.</li><li>The hard-reset-and-reboot delivers the same outcome (requires another hard-reset).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Win10AU Attempt 1</em></span></p>
<p>There was one attempt, previous to the above, to install Win10AU. The system did hang (freeze) at n% (I did not record the value and only have a vague recollection it to be 62%). To set for the next attempt (above) included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing the Registry to remove update version keys</li><li>Executing Troubleshooter for Windows Update (that notified but was unable to resolve...)</li><li>Service Registration missing or corrupt (confirming&nbsp;<em><span><span><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</span></span></span><span><span>, Windows Update and<span><span>Cryptographic Services are enabled)</span></span></span></span></em></li></ul>

            <p>Hello Mr. Rajput</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your quick response. Please also accept my sincerest appreciation, to you and all of the team who have collaborated on the Win10U. This importantly includes those champions who engage with the Community towards achieving complete success
 with their updated product.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update to original post</strong></p>
<p>It appears that 4-hours may not have been long enough as the Win10AU installation appears to have progressed. I returned to the computer the following morning to face a request for my credentials. (The Win10 startup configuration included both my Microsoft
 Account and a PIN. The request was for a password so I submitted the Microsoft Account password - which I must have incorrectly entered. I got it on the third try and the installation continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Continuing resolution actions</strong></p>
<p>i believe eve the installation is on the fourth boot. Should it not indicate further progress tomorrow morning then I will transact your guidance exactly as is conveyed. Please except an update from me in approximately 15-hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Grateful thanks to you all</strong></p>
<p>I lack the requisite understanding to even begin to comprehend the challenge in bringing an OS Update to market so will thankfully receive your good works and do my utmost to respectfully follow the instructions *wink*. This comment may be inappropriate
 outside of Oz so please excuse should it cause offence. An overly large portion of posts include commentary or tonal colour that leave me believing that I may be the only person who isn't smart - that the world is full of "Rocket Scientists". This being not

            <p>Hi,<br />
I have exactly the same problem twice. During the anniversary update I ended up with the spinning dots and nothing else at the screen. The harddisk light didn't show any activity on my hard drive, too. That concerned me, because I thought the installation process
 is in a loop. </p>
<p>So I powered the PC off after approx. 1 hour and I was offered to go back to the previous version, which I did.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your comments should I wait even more than 4 hours?? If this is the case, then I can try it tonight again. Please confirm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephan</p>

<p>I believe that I have solved the main issue. This was achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>completing a fresh installation of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (Win10 AU) on a new/blank hard disk drive.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent issues arising</strong></p>
<p>Although I am having some challenges accessing the (old) disk drive (with the Windows 10 environment) within the new (Win10 AU) environment; this is a different issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am able to access the hard drive (old Win 10) when I connect it to a Windows 7 environment.</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Stephen.</p>
<p>I used a blank hard disk drive and did a fresh installation. It got me up and running - which is what I really needed - in under a week from my first attempt to complete the Win 10 Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old hard drive is still available to retrieve all of the key files - and I now have the bonus of reinstalling only those programs that I really want (without all of the stuff that I've trialed to slow things down).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a win-win for me when I take that perspective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wishing you the best of luck,</p>

 stuck on verifying DMI Pool Data. &nbsp;I sat there for a while and finally decided to shut down the computer and the same thing happened. I still cannot get into windows, the only thing I can do is enter the bios. I have tried to boot of a usb stick with the windows
 ten iso image on it, but I only&nbsp;got a purple screen.&nbsp; I put the usb drive in another computer to see if the usb drive was corrupted, but my other computer booted right into it.&nbsp;Please reply as soon as you can, I have not been able to use my computer for a
 month. Thank you so much for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>as I described below I had the problem that the anniversary update ended up in the spinning dots forever. I let it run the entire night and nothing changed. After 2 reboots (power off/power on) I was told Windows10 tries to go back to the last running status
 before the anniversary update. This took about&nbsp;15 minutes and worked fine. At least I had a running system again without the anniversary update. After going through this exercise 3 times I decided to re-install windows. I really don't have the time to try
 this update exercise more often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Via the advanced options in windows update, I selected to install windows, keep apps&nbsp;AND data. That did&nbsp;NOT work and I had the same problem again.
</p>
<p>Now I tried installing Windows, did NOT keep apps, but kept the data only. Success!</p>
<p>The update worked without issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I had to reinstall all apps, but that's not the issue. All the data was there, as expected.
</p>
<p>I think it's better to start all over with Windows than trying to&nbsp;troubleshoot the error. It takes forever without any guarantee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Screensaver Exit Delay Problem</h2>
                    Haven't seen a mention of this issue. My screensaver works fine. My problem is when I move the mouse or tap the space bar to return to my desktop... screen freezes and it often takes several minutes to return. I've tried the trusty Alt+Ctrl+Del combo and
 get no better (sooner) results.

<p>(While I'm not AllenLyne, this worked - eventually - for me too) So, friends, if you have the same problem:
</p>
<p>1) Uninstall Skype (as described above). </p>
<p>2) Download Skype back onto your computer using link. </p>
<p>3) Sign in (My Skype name didn't work - why not for goodness sake?? All these blind alleys/tripwires; PAINFUL!! - HOWEVER, signing in with my Microsoft password did - phew!
</p>
<p>4) When it asks you to go for the Windows 10 version DECLINE IT!! Use the 'No thanks' button.
</p>
<p>5) Agree T+Cs + allow Skype to adjust/have access (or whatever the Windows pop up says) to your computer, and....</p>
<p>
</p><p>HEY PRESTO, your original account should reappear (well mine appeared anyway)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all you kind people on the Forum who helped with this. </p>

<p>Hi there <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ac3bf0eb-cbc8-41b9-a589-6f007369becf" title="AllenLyne">
<p>
</p><p>See my answer above. The crucial thing is that when you have downloaded Skype and it asks you to go for the Windows 10, USE THE NO THANKS BUTTON! This should hopefully resore the old Skype. Pls read the ful reply below, as there is plenty of room for 'tripwires'
 that can make you think you are not on the right track etc. GOOD LUCK! Hope you get Skype back. All the best, Steve</p>

<p>(While I'm not AllenLyne, this worked - eventually - for me too) So, friends, if you have the same problem:
</p>
<p>1) Uninstall Skype (as described above). </p>
<p>2) Download Skype back onto your computer using link. </p>
<p>3) Sign in (My Skype name didn't work - why not for goodness sake?? All these blind alleys/tripwires; PAINFUL!! - HOWEVER, signing in with my Microsoft password did - phew!
</p>
<p>4) When it asks you to go for the Windows 10 version DECLINE IT!! Use the 'No thanks' button.
</p>
<p>5) Agree T+Cs + allow Skype to adjust/have access (or whatever the Windows pop up says) to your computer, and....</p>
<p>
</p><p>HEY PRESTO, your original account should reappear (well mine appeared anyway)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all you kind people on the Forum who helped with this. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Oh dear...I thought I'd successfully sorted it....Ha! The naivite! Predictably it all whent belly up when I quit/signed out. Here's my message to Skype at point of uninstalling:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is driving me up the wall. It keeps updating to Windows 10, and then nothing works.
</p>
<p>I managed, after a lot of hassle and help from the Skype community, to restore the 'old' version which brought up all my contacts etc. When I signed out, it upgraded again to the new inactive update.
</p>
<p>SO this is last chance saloon. If I re-install and get my old account up and running...and then it updates again to the inactive 'update', I'll give up Skype as a very bad job, and use WhatsApp instead.
</p>
<p>Now; I've been through a LOT of inconvenience with this, and have even taken the time to explain the situation to you here - What a thoroughly nice chap I am!
</p>
<p>To finish: If you are even a tiny bit decent, you'll email me at 
******* or call me on ******** with an apology and an explanation of how to properly resolve this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But, you know what? I doubt you will even read this. I'm certainly not 'holding my breath'. I'll just conclude 'Skype = Bad Karma" and warn everyone I know.
</p>
<p>So, over to you: Good or bad karma? Your choice!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I see where you are coming from. I still can't quit Skype, or it will revert to the useless version plaguing you. So I can only sign out, which means I'm forced to have Skype constantly running in the background. Grrrrr.....!
</p>
<p>I am definitley thinking that I'll just use WhatsApp. </p>
<p>

<span>Skype: Problems, problems! Why??
<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fanswers.microsoft.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2frsp-content-status-subscribed.png%3fver%3d18.1.24.7" />(On 27th Jan)
</span></span>
<div>
<p>Note: Because of the inflexible Skype topics and sub topics, I've had to enter topics that don't exactly apply: E.g. My concerns are for Skype for a laptop, not desktop etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>My initial problem with Skype was sorted (with the kind help of people on the community), but problems remain:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Why does Skype update my version to Windows 10, and when it does so, it totally disables all the Skype services, effectively making it useless? One would have thought a later version would be better, but no, I have to use the old 'Classic' version: Why?
 Why does Skype cause all that grief?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When I do manage to negotiate all the tripwires (and there's lots of them!) and install the Classic version, if I quit Skype, then it transfers my account to the updated version, and yes, you've guessed it; all services disabled. SO I have to reinstall
 the classic. What it means is that I can't quit Skype; it is always live. IE I have this icon on my task bar:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That never used to be the case: It used to just be the Skype icon without the green and white circle and the red bar below it. So why is that?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has Skype gone 'mouldy' on me? Is it just me, or will it be happening to everyone? What the hell is going on?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think I should just abandon it and go for WhatsApp instead. Couldn't balme me could you?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can answer why there are these short coming s are occurring! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>1. I understand that using the Skype version for Windows 10 can be confusing to most users, as there are some features were removed as the classic one is still the same, unfortunately I do not have a clear answer about it on what is going on and how it looked

<p>Dear Juan,</p>
<p>Thank you for trying to reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re1) IE: You don't know do you? Incredible. This isn't just a few features removed; this is the equivalent of a picture; no links; nothing. That's not a few features removed; that is total disablement! So, it looks like the customer
 is a victim - like a guinea pig in a research lab - having his time wasted and frustration exacerbated while the 'scientists' dissect the problem. Skype gains entirely at the customer's expense.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I can sign out. If I do, I get the logo on my task bar as shown in my post. If I quit Skype it, it asks me am I sure, and says I won't be able to make calls etc. Well; that is what one wants in that if you close your browser, then you won't be able to
 browse - well, sure; that's the idea. But the difference here - using the same comparison, would be that you would just get a picture of your browser when you re-open it. So what USED to happen when quitting Skype, was that the Skype logo would just be all
 blue, and one signed in by left clicking on it as usual. BUT what happens now, is that if I quit Skype (as opposed to sign out), it disables Skype and the logo is white. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the story. It would be nice if Skype could solve this and stop wasting my time and giving me frustration. The only gainers now really are Skype, not me. I'll simply sign out instead of quit. But I don't like it; the programme is clearly still running
 in the background. </p>

<p>
</p><p>If your problem is like mine, then you can sign out, but not quit....(or it will revert to the unusable version). But why is this not happening across the board? There has not been any reports about people abandoning Skype in their droves, so why is it just
 a few unfortunates like you and me? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to get this answered in my post of 27th Jan called <span>"Skype: Problems, problems! Why??" - And they don't seem to know....so far.</span></p>

<p>My university provided&nbsp;MSDNAA access and with that a free download of Windows 7 professional, on the site it says that one can use the activation key for multiple computers and actually recommends using it on multiple computers.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is any cause for concern about the software being compatible with a laptop. I've never really dealt with anything about a laptop other than common use, unfortunately. :\</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>It is possible, if you are using a Wi-Fi connection/adapter, that it does not support this feature in sharing connection. To be able to check, please follow the steps provided by Yisroel Tech in this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/problem-in-mobile-hotspot-in-windows10-anniversary/f1eca0fb-2bb0-48b9-a746-99a44a2f03af">thread</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update doesn&#39;t have option for using external media</h2>
                    I have to upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10. but it needs 8GB of space, and I don't have that much space. I have already transferred all of my personal files to a USB, and have uninstalled all non-essential programs, but I only have 5GB free.
 I have heard that Windows updates can use an external storage device, but there is no option for this displayed in the update manager - only disk cleanup and a refreshing option to check for changes in available storage. I have tried plugging in an empty&nbsp;16GB
 USB and refreshing the manager, but it isn't recognized. How do I update my computer?

<h2>            winmail dat files</h2>
                    I am using Windows 8 and Windows Live Mail 2012. Files I am sending as word docs are being received as winmail dat files. Solutions posted appear to be for Outlook users as I cannot find the tabs they speak of. Can someone please assist?

            <p>This is impossible. Windows Live Mail cannot produce attachments called winmail.dat. Only Office Outlook can produce them, so either the message 'received' is not the same one as the message 'sent', or else the message was sent using Outlook and not Windows
 Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the <em>Attach file </em>button looks like in Outlook:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsbm6za.dm1.livefilestore.com%2fy2pFMm2UkEKMon7anjNF34wmDRvnB-wRVnYuHKqm1amMy9chNsNwJqN53wov2ZPMYPye9_lB9reBv2re1LQtkViX6jYOUIw6zTGDxYrD44PgZA%2fOL2013-attach-files.png%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the <em>Attach file </em>button looks like in Windows Live Mail:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsbm6za.dm2301.livefilestore.com%2fy2pyM-iu-YDF8yU8Cwxw-EFatcmfMiIjGssd0jlIrWwfQ7hUcBjfkR6cW6zRZQbRb3FGr_RK0jYZHNvONyxgBbeVV-9dPXkZJNoGyMeunMgDMA%2fWLMail-attach-file.png%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're quite sure that you used the second of these to attach the file in your last test, then the message with an attachment that '<em>is still received as winmail dat file'</em> is not the one you sent (unless, of course, the file you attached was called
 winmail.dat).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that. It looks as if the impossible wasn't happening after all. In your initial post, you said that these attachments were being received as
<em>winmail dat</em><em> files</em>. Now you write that they're called <em>winmail doc</em>. It actually looks as if they're being sent and received as
<em>Break apart messages larger than ... </em>selected on the <em>Advanced</em> tab of the account's properties dialogue (right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em> to open the dialogue). Please check if that is the case, deselect the option and then re-run your test.</p>
