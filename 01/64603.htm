<p>Hi Valerie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons as to why your wireless internet connection is being slow.
<span>Internet connection speed can be affected by both where your computer is located and whether other wireless devices are in the same area. Using devices near your wireless connection with the same frequencies
</span><span>can cause interference, or completely block the wireless network connection. Also,
</span><span>spyware and viruses can definitely cause poor internet performance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For us to rectify the issue, you can reset your router and try to connect to the internet again. Should the issue remains the same, make sure that your PC is up-to-date and your antivirus program is running properly.</span><span> You can also contact
 your internet service provider to assist you further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get back to us anytime. We'll be glad to help you.</span></p>

    <title>I owe Microsoft money&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I owe Microsoft money&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have occurred a problem.</p>
<p>I had used my father's credit card to pay for my Xbox Live membership, but after it was paid, he wanted me to remove his card off of my account.</p>
<p>Since I had purchased a 12 month membership, I had to transfer the membership to another credit card to be able to remove my father's.</p>
<p>I used a prepaid credit card that was empty (it had no more credit on it).</p>
<p>The only thing was that after the 12 months had gone by, I noticed that I still had Xbox Live membership, so I went to check in my billing info, and noticed that the empty card was billed 10.34$CAD for membership, that I did not want. So I cancelled my membership
 immediately after seeing that.</p>
<p>I read in the support section of the website that I had to turn off auto-renewal; I did so.</p>
<p>But I still owe 10.34$ for something I didn't want.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get rid of that negative balance without adding in a new credit card? (I find this is getting pretty complicated and frustrating).</p>

<p>Phone support would be the only ones who would be able to help with a billing issue like this.
</p>
<p>Though, if it had been on a year, it should have renewed another year, not a month to month. Probably should have them take a look at that, as a year can be cancelled and refunded within the first 30 days.</p>

<p>since it does sound like a month to month membership so the 12month membership was a prepaid card and you had purchased a month to month promotion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no there is no refunds on 1 month memberships&nbsp;and the payment must be made and replaced</p>
<p>you can call support to remove the card once you paid off the balance</p>
<p>turning off autorenewal after renewal doesn't stop pending balances</p>
<p>its pretty simple if you want to cancel or not continue a service you always call to have it turned off</p>
<p>cancelation requires a phone call to support</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 RTM 64-bit mouse freezes&#47;stutters multiple times per minute</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've installed the Windows 7 Enterprise RTM (my company has software assurance) on one of our machines, dual booting with XP.&nbsp; The Windows 7 install is totally clean, but it has a nagging issue of mouse pointer freezing/stuttering that is driving me absolutely
 nuts! Basically, every 10-15 seconds, the mouse pointer just freezes in place for about a second. The computer itself doesn't seem to be locking up but the mouse pointer will then suddenly jump back about where it should have been if it didn't freeze. (i.e.,
 it seems to be lagging behind responding to the mouse but catches up, it doesn't continue from where it was).<br />
<br />
It seems like the problem is getting worse the more drivers and such that I setup, I was hoping once I got all my sound/video drivers in it would get better.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas and/or performance monitoring tips? Nothing seems to be spiking in task manager. And it all works fine in XP.<br />
<br />
System is:<br />
Asus P5WD2 motherboard<br />
Pentium D 940 (3.4, dual core)<br />
ATI Radeon HD4850 video card<br />
Asus Xonar D2X sound card<br />
Adaptec 29320 SCSI + Atlas 15K drive (Win XP boot drive) and Plextor SCSI CD burner<br />
Other SATA HDs including the Win 7 installed drive<br />
Razer Copperhead mouse<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips

<p>Its&nbsp;crucial that the correct edition is selected for an OEM license which is why I don't link to the Microsoft page directly... I am more active on the Dell Community Forums and we have had many users select the wrong Edition and get stuck&nbsp;so they input&nbsp;a
 generic product key and then get stuck with product activation...&nbsp;Even OEMs such as Dell make mistakes sometimes and ship out wrong installation media. e.g. here on a post I answered yesterday:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/t/19621642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/t/19621642</a>
</p>

</p><p>Its much easier if&nbsp;people check their edition in system properties before attempting reinstallation, this prevents the need for a trial/error case later on. The&nbsp;steps you mention&nbsp;to call Microsoft to get help with product activation of a wrong&nbsp;Edition will
 usually be a fruitless task, they will be unable to activate an incorrect edition.&nbsp;Mistakes between a Home and Professional editions are rare in comparison to mistakes between different Home Editions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's marketing make things significantly worse with the Home Editions...</p>
<p>Windows 8.0/8.1, Windows 8.0/8.1 Single Language and Windows 8.0/8.1N are all commonly sold as "Windows 8/8.1". Even Windows 8.1 with Bing and Windows 8.1 Single Language with Bing are also sold as "Windows 8.1". As mentioned this tool does not work with
 the Bing Editions which is another complication for the OEM license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trial/error case is when users download 5 .isos and go through them one by one until the key is input. As mentioned 2 .isos are missing so its not a comprehensive solution for the "Windows 8.1" OEM product family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guide also stresses to install with UEFI and SecureBoot which should now be&nbsp;implemented as standard on &gt;2012 systems.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There maybe a couple of reasons behind this misbehavior. An outdated driver is the most probable cause as it works directly with your devices. It could also be a corrupted system file that causes misrepresentation on your display and functions. Here are
 some proposed methods that you can follow to troubleshoot the concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you may run the Microsoft Easy fix diagnostic tool for network to automatically detect and fix any incompatibilities with your device and driver. Here are some that may apply to you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a></li><li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with connecting to the Internet or to websites</a></li><li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with wireless and other network adapters</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>More easy fix solutions are available on this article: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use Microsoft easy fix solutions</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to run the manual network troubleshooter, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Panel</strong>, on the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Search<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Control<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Panel<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>bar
 located on the upper-right corner of the Control Panel window, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click Troubleshooting on the results pane.</li><li>On the left pane, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>View<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>all</strong>.</li><li>Look for<span> </span><strong>Connecting to a Network</strong>, right-click, and have it<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Run<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>as<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>administrator</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions.</li><li>Once done, please check if issue still persists.</li><li>Please repeat the steps, and then run troubleshooter for <strong>Network adapter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update driver</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is suggested to update a device driver to resolve any incompatibility issues with the latest version of Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>To Update a driver, please go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Cortana<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>search bar beside the Start button. Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>devmgmt</strong>.<strong>msc</strong>. Hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Expand<span><span><strong>Network adapters</strong></span></span>. Look for your adapter.</li><li>Right-click, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Driver<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>tab. then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Rollback</strong>.</li><li>If options is grayed out, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>driver<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>instead.</li><li>Choose<span> </span><strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you getting any error message, when you try to download it?</span></p>
<p><span>Is it compatible with Windows 10?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of your device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you say "every game that worked on Windows XP‚Äù, I suspect that the problem might be with the compatibility. There are lot of changes made&nbsp;to&nbsp;Windows 10 OS in term of platform, which actually
 and clearly differs it from Windows XP platform. Suggest you to check and confirm that the Steam Client is compatible with Windows 10. If you're getting any error message or error code, then let us know that to analyze the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, check and install the latest Graphics card drivers for your device from Manufacturer website. Because this shouldn't be the reason for this issue. You can search for the drivers
 using your device model number on </span><span>Manufacturer website</span><span>.
</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replicated your issue on our end. It seems like that this is how Window Live Mail was design however you can use the "Sort by" tab at the upper portion of the "two line view".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I guess I will stick with one line view for now. &nbsp;Too bad, I really like the 2 line view with the message on the right. &nbsp;But I want the From or sender in bold on top. &nbsp;I have seen this on many computers, however they maybe are using
 Outlook. &nbsp;It would be a good feature for Windows Live Mail to add. &nbsp;I don't understand why they did it this way. &nbsp;It is more important to quickly identify the sender vs. the subject for me anyway.

<h2>            Windows 10 update, speakers not working</h2>
                    <p>HP notebook with Win10. The latest update was installed and now my internal speakers are not working. The audio&nbsp;jack is working with headphones and external speaker.</p>
<p>I have gone through all the fixes offered, troubleshooter, enhancements, uninstall driver, test sound. None of them have been a fix.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that the issue started after installing the latest update, there is a possibility that your audio drivers may also have to be updated. Driver updates for Windows 10 and many devices should be automatically downloaded and installed
 through Windows Update. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, you can try fixing it by&nbsp;updating the driver. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong>&nbsp;Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards,&nbsp;expand the&nbsp;<strong>Display adapters</strong>&nbsp;category, right click
 your graphics card and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select&nbsp;<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let us know if you need further help. </span></p>

<p><span>To delete the association for a specific file extension, type 'assoc .&lt;xxx&gt;=' at a command prompt, and then press
 ENTER, where &lt;xxx&gt; is the file extension you want to delete.</span></p>
<p><span>After removing the program associate to the '.dds' file extension you may try associating it to the program you need.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, to change the association for a specific file extension, type assoc .&lt;xxx&gt;=&lt;file type&gt; at a command prompt,
 and then press ENTER, where &lt;xxx&gt; is the file extension whose association you want to change, and &lt;file type&gt; is the program, dynamic data exchange (DDE), or OLE object you want to associate with the file extension.

<p>
</p><p>Let's use your example.&nbsp; It's actually a string and not a link so you can't do with it quite what you are describing.&nbsp; Nevertheless you can use it to start a download and choose where you want that to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,
</p>
<ol>
<li>select your link, and Copy it to Clipboard; e.g. press Ctrl-c once it is selected.&nbsp;
</li><li>Then you can use right-click,&nbsp; Go to copied Address.</li><li>You will see the Information bar at the bottom </li><li>To use it, either click on the down arrow for the Save button</li><li>Or press Alt-n, Tab, CursorDown</li><li>Then either click Save as or press a</li><li>That will let you see a Save As dialog which will let you pick where you want the file to be downloaded.</li></ol>

            Hey,
<div><br />
<div>I have had exactly the same experience. The update also deleted all my personalisation to the windows start screen - deleted all apps I had installed, removed all my sign-in settings - it was like a factory reset had been done. But most things running
 in the desktop (eg office 07) were still installed, although when I opened them it was like it was the first open after installing. Also, some folders on my desktop were deleted. This is the most critical thing for me as these files were not yet backed up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To answer your questions, in my case:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure how to work out what the update was? But it was automatically installed via Windows Update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The exact error message I get is:</div>
<div>"Documents.library-ms" is no longer working. This file can be safely deleted from your computer. Folders that have been included will not be affected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And no, there is nothing in my recycle bin.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Following your troubleshooting advice above restored my libraries (I can't be surem but I think to an older version - as in, I think some recent files are missing. Thank you though) but obviously did not restore my start menu or personalised settings (start
 menu background, installed apps, etc.) or my missing desktop files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any further advice would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks you,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Joanne</div>

            <p>The exact same thing just happened to me. Windows did an automatic update and I restarted my computer all of my files are gone as well as all personalization. Obviously this is a Windows problem. I suspect Microsoft knows about it but won't acknowledge it.
 Windows 8 is junk.</p>

<p>You can always find the original folder here</p>

<h2>            Retrieving information from original &#40;pre-Microsoft&#41; Skype account</h2>
                    I have had Skype since 2007! A couple of weeks ago, I clicked on my Skype icon, as I always have, and I got a notice about Microsoft having taken over (even though the buyout was over a year ago). I could not use Skype until I signed up to Microsoft. I
 can use Skype now to dial out, but EVERYthing is gone: my history, my phone contacts, my regulars, my payment information and service contract. I cannot tell if I still have my answering message service, or if people can still reach me by dialing my number,
 or when my year or multi-year contract ends.&nbsp;

<p>Hi, Thanks for your help. Never, in more than 2 decades of computer use, have I been more frustrated with a product or service than I am with this Microsoft/Skype changeover. I followed your instructions and got to a Skype page that is definitely me, picture
 and all. I was pretty much forced along the way to merge Skype and Microsoft, though I don't think I ever had a Microsoft account before this. Now I can see I have Skype credit. What I still cannot find is whether my automatic answering service works (yes,
 I made a recording for that long ago), what my call history is (the records say I have none other than a couple of calls made to toll-free numbers recently), and where my contacts list (including "Regulars") is, and I don't see the automatic recharging of
 my account when available funds run low.</p>
<p>Equally annoying, I can't even figure out now how to make a call, as I don't even see where the dial pad is! This is all overwhelmingly frustrating!</p>
<p>Forgive me if I sound angry -- I'm not angry at you, you're trying to help. But if Skype had any competition of note, I would have just moved to another carrier immediately by now.</p>
<p>There is some discrepancy between the email address that seems to be associated with my account now and the email address I used to sign up originally: br*****, an address that doesn't seem to be working at the moment (more frustration!). &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, point by point:</p>
<p>1: How do I dial out?</p>
<p>2: What happened to my answering machine service and outgoing message?</p>
<p>3: What happened to my automatic payment recharging?</p>
<p>4: Where are my Contacts, including Regulars?</p>
<p>5: Where are my many years of Call History?</p>
<p>6: Do I have to re-do everything: new billing, new addresses, new automatic charge credit card information?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p>
<p>--Bruce</p>

<p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;How do I dial out?</p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>Kindly confirm the&nbsp;<span>exact&nbsp;</span>Skype version installed on your device.</p>
<p>Hi, Now there is a new menu showing a credit balance and access to a dial pad. The version showing is:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">Skype version 8.12.0.14</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">Calling version 2017.24.01.66</p>
<p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span>What happened to my answering machine service and outgoing message?</p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span><span>If you are pertaining to customize/personal voicemail, please be advised that it is no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)"><span>What default message, what app language? I don't use a smart phone, I don't know anything</span></span>&nbsp;about apps. I'm on a Mac desktop computer.</span></p>
<p><span>My initial service with Skype was in 2005, and since then everything has been pretty much automatic:</span></p>
<p><span>Skype Name: br*****</span><br />
<span>Number: 83****</span><br />
<span>Date: 19-07-2005 15:18</span><br />
<span>- SkypeIn, 12 month subscription (2086233)</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span>What happened to my automatic payment recharging?</p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>Are you pertaining to automatic recharging of your credits or subscriptions?<br />
I have no idea what anything is called. My credit card number was on file and got debited when my $10 credit got used up, buying me another $10 worth. My answering machine "subscription" was paid automatically on an annual basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span>Where are my Contacts, including Regulars?</p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>Are you looking for your Skype contacts, Outlook/Microsoft, or address book contacts?<br />
I don't know anything about Outlook or Microsoft, except that I use Microsoft Word for Mac. The old Skype menu listed "Contacts" which included all the phone numbers I called over the years, and "Regulars," which included the (in this case) 4 people I called
 all the time. I guess Skype could use all the contacts from my Apple Contacts (Version 11.0 - 1808.6) since, I suppose, it would leave out the many, many contacts that have no phone number.</p>
<p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span>Where are my many years of Call History? </p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>What call history are you looking? Is it a Skype to Skype call or calls from a landline or mobile?</p>
<p>All the Skype calls I made were listed under a Skype menu called "History," that allowed me to see when was the last time (or the first time) that I called a particular person or number. All phone calls were made using Skype on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span>Do I have to re-do everything: new billing, new addresses, new automatic charge credit card information?</p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>I am unable to answer this question at the moment until I have your answers on the above questions.<br />
Since I started this inquiry, I have merged my Skype and Microsoft (though I still might have 2 separate accounts) and I can reach a page that shows me some history going back through 2015, shows my credit, and gives me a dialpad -- so I can make calls, at
 least. What I don't know is whether when I use up my $6.27, my credit card will be charged and my call credit will automatically jump back up to $10, or whether I have to put in all that information again. Everything is still the same as it was up until this
 surprise menu change and sign-up requirement a month ago, but what might make things even more confusing is the fact that I am an American with a US address and paying in dollars from a US account, but I am currently, temporarily in Germany (hence, if I push
 the wrong button on my computer, I wind up on an information page in German, a language I don't really speak very well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to bother you at Christmas time. Since I CAN dial out with Skype, it removes the urgency, so please enjoy the holiday before you get bothered with this stuff again. They say that timing is everything, though, and, as fate would have it, I suddenly
 find myself unable to send emails, a problem I'm working on now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers, and Merry Christmas,</p>
<p>

<p>P.S. &nbsp;I just found that I do have auto-recharge set, using my usual credit card. So I guess that means all that's missing (besides Contacts and Regulars and Call History) is the personalized answering machine message, which, if I understood you correctly,
 has been discontinued.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to fix my mother's account, as she is having the same problem with her contacts as you, Bruce‚Äîall of them have gone missing! I agree completely that this has been the worst update; I've had problems with my own account but managed to work them
 out. The problem with Mom's contacts, though, is really frustrating and I would like to resolve it before heading home from the holidays!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for in advance for the help!</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this issue start to occur?</li><li>Did you make any recent changes on the settings of your PC?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</li><li>Is it still the same even after maximizing the Settings window?</li></ul>

            It only happens every time I lock my computer and open the settings app after unlocking my PC. When in full-screen mode this doesn't happen, and once it happens it doesn't happen again until I lock and unlock my PC. I'm just kind of annoyed to have to
 resize it a lot of the time I open it. Any solutions?

<h2>            Windows Live Mail &#39;unable to send or receive messages&#39;</h2>
                    Hello
<div><br />
<div>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium on a 64-bit Toshiba laptop with Windows Essentials 12 installed. I use Microsoft Security Essentials as real-time protection.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Live Mail stopped downloading email from a BT Internet account recently. It will sometimes do so, every few days or so and for a short period, then stops again. A Gmail account works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, the problem does NOT seem to be with BT Internet: I installed the mail address on another computer using Windows Live Mail and the mail came pouring in. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here are the error messages I receive on the laptop (in both cases I allowed Windows to set up the account using its automatically):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Unable to send or receive messages for the Btinternet (X) account.

            Update.
<div><br />
<div>All the above was true, but now - after 19,000 emails were successfully downloaded onto my other computer - the same problem has arisen. Error message:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Unable to send or receive messages for the Btinternet (X) account. An unknown error has occurred.</p>
<p>Server: 'mail.btinternet.com'</p>

<p>Protocol: POP3</p>
<p>Port: 110</p>
<p>Secure(SSL): No</p>
<div><br />
<div>So ... it looks like it's a BT Internet problem after all? I'm stumped: BT could find no problem and emails are clearly there on their website.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any thoughts gratefully received.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Daniel,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />The VOLUME license is for business only, so it is illegal to use on an home user computer. Also, VOLUME license will expire some day and could be reactivated only with KMS.
<br />I suggest you to buy a proper license from Microsoft Store.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more information or help.

            Yes it is a volume license &amp; is illegal to use in a home PC, unscrupulous sellers purchase these license keys &amp; sell them cheaply to innocent people who believe they‚Äôre getting a good deal.
<br />Microsoft will eventually cancel the key &amp; you‚Äôll receive a message stating that you need to contact your organisations servers to reactivate the license. If you bought from eBay or a third party seller on Amazon or elsewhere then request a refund.

<br />
<br />Yes, it is a Multiple Activation key license. It is used in organizations. Now, what happens is, If Microsoft detects that this key is misused, they can block it. 
<br />
<br />Either they can run forever or can stop working anytime.

<br />Beware of Product Keys Sold Separately 
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC‚Äôs) distributed with COA‚Äôs, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it‚Äôs a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.

<p>Hey Stefano thank you for your help.</p>
<p>Yes indeed I need more help I went to Microsoft site and sawy windows home which is the one I want.</p>
<p>I say buying "Download" or "USB" which means download I can do from my computer and Microsoft will supply the the OEM key or something else, and USB means a USB will be sent to my house through mailing it will help me a lot if you could clarify to me what
 each of this option purchase mean.</p>

            The download option let you install Windows 10 Home directly on your device, without make you wait for the installation USB. They will send you the product key to your email.
<br />The USB option will make you wait some days to receive the installation USB, that will be sent to your home or if you prefer, to the nearest Microsoft store.
<br />The license in both case is RETAIL, that means you would be able in future to transfer it from a device to another. 
<br />If you have Windows 10 installed at the moment, I would suggest you to pick the Download option, because you can make a bootable USB at any moment and for free from Microsoft website.

<p>Thank you Stefano.</p>
<p>ok I will pick download because I don't have couple of days I need it now, and it's not a problem for me to make a bootable driver and it seems to be the best options for me at the moment. you saying that license of both options is the same? and not that
 VOLUME MAK thing, so the license will be mine and only mine without being depended on other computers? and 100% legal to use?</p>
<p>and what it means that in the future I will be able to pass it from one device to other? isn't product key is a 1 time use?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            The product key is a 1 device a time use; that's for a RETAIL license. That means you can have only one device running Windows 10 Home Edition, but you can transfert your license from a device to another if the old one is broken or if you don't use it anymore or if you sell it without Operating System.
<br />Yes, buying from Microsoft Store is the safest way to buy a Windows 10 license and of course this license is yours and yours only. Also, it is obviously legal.
<br />It will be RETAIL license because you buy it from the store; for me, it is the best kind of license for home user, because it allow to transfer between device.

            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />The MAK licence as you correctly point out is belonging to some company or organisation, and if they discontinue their licence, your PC will deactivate, or if Windows Update detects that licence, it will deactivate that licence
<br />
<br />You should purchase a full retail licence form the Microsoft Store, that is then yours for life and you can use that on any future PC's you purchase
<br />
<br />You should not be able to purchase an OEM licence, because those are for system builders/manufacturers and most of the OEM licences you will find on the Internet are not legit . . .

                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I got a free windows 10 education key with a purchase in my university's student and faculty store. I honestly hate the upgrade and it won't let me access certain settings. I would rather switch back to home, but I have no idea how to do so. I tried to do
 a factory reset but that didn't work. I only upgraded about 2 months ago.&nbsp;</p>

<br />You can try this downgrade method which is reported to work by many for Pro to Home, not sure about Education to Home but worth a try if you like your install:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/downgrade-from-windows-10-pro-to-home/345f5464-cb7a-44b3-8856-237cbec072c8">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you'll have to Clean Install  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Atwoah 
<br />
<br />Upgrading to a different Edition of Windows 10 is easy, downgrading to a different Edition is not so easy, you will need to backup your Data and the clean install Windows 10 Home . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
