<h2>            MY XBOX IS CRAP</h2>
                    <p>Right so the Xbox one possibly the worst most unreliable console in the world, i move my Xbox a lot and my Xbox is something that use all the time and i do not expect it to fail on mee!&nbsp;Every time i turn on my console i have to reconnect it to my WiFi, but this is also not as easy as it sounds, whenever i try to scroll over to the 'connect to Xbox live' section it freezes which then results in me having to restart my Xbox, i normally have to do this about 5 times before it will work then i will type my password and it will say caannot connect reastart my roater which i then do and it still does not work, at this point i go to xbox support it says ' you are 7,000,000 in line because so many people are having issues.'</p>

<h2>            Unable to do a System Restore, files missing.</h2>
                    Every thing seems to work fine when I run a system restore until reboot. &nbsp;After reboot, I get an error message that restore failed &nbsp;due to a missing file.
<div>Needless to say, it doesn't indicate which file is missing or what to do to fix the problem. &nbsp;I would greatly appreciate any advice that may be offered.</div>
<div>The system is running on Windows 7.</div>

            <p>Hi Charles, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1. What is the complete error message that you are receiving during system restore?<br />
2. Have you installed any third-party security software/antivirus on your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure that the "<strong>Volume Shadow Copy service</strong>" is set to automatic/manually under startup type.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click <strong>Start</strong> and type <strong>services.msc</strong> in the search box.<br />
b. Search for the <strong>Volume shadow copy</strong> service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure the service is started and set to <strong>Automatic/Manual</strong>.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the service is <em>stopped</em>, then follow these steps to restart the service.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. <strong>Right click</strong> on the service and click on restart.<br />
b. Select <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
c. In the Start-up type select <strong>Automatic/Manual</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: If the service is stopped, all the Restore points will be deleted.
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Disable antivirus software temporarily.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable the firewall/ anti-virus temporarily installed on your computer and then check if the issue still persists. If the issue resolves, then you might need to uninstall the software and reinstall it back or change the settings and check.
<div><br />
Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/disable-antivirus-software</a> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If that doesn't help, then I suggest you run a System File Checker scan to see if there are any corrupt files.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Refer: <strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.</strong></font></font></font></p>

    <title>POST RECOVERY &#40; Repair install&#41; FILE ACCESS PROBLEMS AE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 8boltwheels  say:</h3>
<h2>            POST RECOVERY &#40; Repair install&#41; FILE ACCESS PROBLEMS AE ATTRIBUTES in Folder.____</h2>
                    Scenario:<br />
Win XP Media center host repair reload, initiated from administrator.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that recovery&nbsp; instructions&nbsp; included with this particular model<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advise that files and user data are saved....this is billed as a repair, not destructive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disk reload.&nbsp; I had only wanted a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SINGLE program (ehsell.exe) repaired, but system took off and did the whole repair.<br />
<br />
@ the point of recover commit the system stated "saving your settings"&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Box is recovered with file access problems, in particular, a specific folder in user's folder<br />
&nbsp;tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
o-back up files for some of the critical stuff are on a networked host that failed 6 days later, file searches underway on disks from that host.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o- The SID values for the re-created user are apparently different, the old values must have stayed with the file ( in other folders I can read in this users folder tree) since I see the nemeric value when I was changing ownership, in an attempt to
 fix this problem.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o- This user had to be re-created by the administrator, post recovery.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o- all the files of the user appear to be complete in the folder tree as before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o-attributes show most or all of the files with alpha AE when attributes are enabled.<br />
<br />
I am praying that, because this was a repair over write, the administrators profile data was preserved, and may provide a recovery scenario for these files.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do not know how this folder was ever set to encrypted in the first place.<br />
I don't know if Xp admonishes the admin to create back up certificate if so, I have never been so admonished, ever.&nbsp; This computer is a single owner machine, and I am the only admin, so obviously somewhere along the way I had to have set this bit or value but
 I have no recollection, much less any records.&nbsp; o- is there any way to recover the point in time when this change was made? (FWIW) KB243026 ESINFO.exe?<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;o- I cannot examine any of the affected file's content, though their title/attribute data is in tact<br />
&nbsp; o- I cannot copy the files out to a thumb drive nor any other folder location in all of the C partition,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even logged in as administrator <br />
&nbsp; o- I am familiar today, with numerous KB's related to EFS, and in particular I am praying the comment in KB259732 'Resolution' does not apply. &nbsp; Or KB290260.
<br />
<br />
QUESTIONS:<br />
<br />
1. If I 'remove encryption' from the directory, using the re-created owner's login, is this a possible solution?&nbsp; ( Assuming the credentials survived the repair update) o- I will NOT even attempt this untill backups are made.<br />
<br />
2. What or how do I determine if any of the old certificate data resides on the host, post recovery?<br />
<br />
3. Any other possible scenarios, I haven't thought of?<br />
<br />

<p>oh shoot dude, as far as i know the only two ways to decrypt efs files is unencrypting it using the original user account or the administrator account ( the default recovery agent)<br />
<br />
if you've lost access to both those accounts because of doing the recovery/repair you've lost all hope of decrypting that. it has to be the original Administrator or the original user account.<br />
<br />
if your computer was not a home one and was part of a domain like at work or something then you could because the default recovery agent is the domain Administrator not the local computer administrator<br />
<br />
are you absolutely sure it created new accounts i thought the windows repair doesn't kill user accounts it only kills installed programs and windows itself.<br />
<br />
anyways good luck hey hopfully your new accounts are the acutaly recovery agents and you get your stuff back</p>

            Thanks, Daniel.&nbsp; That is exactly what I am praying Will happen - that the artifacts of the certificate somehow survived the repair update, and whatever the recovery steps are I will take.<br />
<br />
o-the administrator account both the ( safe_mode_only, and the default admin I created when the box was first put into service.)&nbsp; appeared to be in tact when the machine came up.&nbsp; All the folders there B4 update were there after.<br />
<br />
o- At the nost recent check, 120709-0315Z, there now appears 'administrator.%HOSTNAME%' in the docs and settings list.&nbsp; Could this be the 'settings' saved at the start of the recovery?<br />
<br />
o-at the time the critical data was placed on this machine, and the folder populated, and apparently encrypted,&nbsp; the XP box was networked to A W2K host&nbsp; that, whiloe not a domain controller was part of group 'workgroup', and both machine were networked using
 netbeui.<br />
<br />
o- there ARE .bkf files of the original user's folder, and all of documents and settings. ( occuring at different times) Of course the recovery attempts deny access to 100s of files in the backups but is it possible the credentials needed are contained ther
 and can be recovered?<br />
<br />
o-Ironically, the thunderbird environment for the effected user came up without any re-install work needed, all the settings, everything was as before.<br />
<br />
o- that is why I'm praying somehow I can survive this nightmare.&nbsp; Any EFS grurus out there?<br />
<br />

<p>Hello Daniel!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally I have a few moments in the "quiet week" between Christmas &amp; New Years, and thought you would like to know how it worked out:</p>
<p>In your question of Dec 7 2009:</p>
<p>"<em>are you absolutely sure it created new accounts i thought the windows repair doesn't kill user accounts it only kills installed programs and windows itself.</em> "</p>
<p>Sadly, yes it did force me to create new logins for each of the two accounts, although the Original data for those accounts survived the overwrite. ( post recovery, with 'unknown' RID values ) This process is, in part, what destroys the ability to read previously
 encrypted files, because the keys are generated with the owner's RID value, which are generated at creation, in part by the realtime clock value.&nbsp; The new logins had completly different RID values on creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless:</p>
<p>I was able to fully recover all but 2 files out of the 730+ that were encrypted.</p>
<p>I had to use a commercial product from a company that trades under the name elcomsoft.</p>
<p>The prerequisites for this to work are that you must truly be the owner of the 'lost' resources, and be in possession of all the original logins and their credentials.&nbsp; Once you go through the question and answer sessions. ( the software makes multiple passes
 on the data, and based on each pass, keeps asking for more from you until it succeeds, or tells you it cannot recover )&nbsp; I had to provide copies of the data from the original folders in appdata, that contain the certificates, and encrypted file keys to the
 recovery software.&nbsp; That was a huge challenge in it's own right, because I couldn't rip the bkf files with the original user account backups apart until I found a separate utility that worked.</p>
<p>As Microsoft states in one or more of the many KB's I read, anyone possessing the disk with both the data and certificates can eventually recover the data. ( Bad guys included)&nbsp; What they fail to provide any support for is how the pieces are re-constructed.&nbsp;
 Perhaps, for the obvious reasons that 'bad actors' would exploit this.&nbsp; The commercial product that I used provided this critical missing piece.</p>
<p>It took over 4 months.&nbsp; ( most of that for research ) Plus some additional time to finish hardware upgrades to the client computer ( dual disk drives, one for backups!)</p>
<p>I've learned:</p>
<p>Never &lt;EVER&gt; believe the BS a computer manufacturer tells you in a GUI: "your data is being saved"</p>
<p>Microsoft should &lt;REQUIRE&gt; any manufacturer who wraps Microsoft's recovery tools with their own crapwre to test for the existence for encrypted files and STOP the recovery process and force the user to explicitly permit it to continue, whenever any encrypted
 files are found on a system.</p>
<p>As the old well worn out saying goes: "Had I known then what I know now........."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a great new year!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may directly use your computer and remove the sign in screen. To do this, you will need configure the user account's settings. You may follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key </strong>+ <strong>R </strong>to open the <strong>Run
</strong>command box.</li><li>Type control <strong>userpasswords2</strong><span> </span>or<strong> </strong>
<strong>netplwiz </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong><strong>.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong> option, click<strong>Apply</strong>, and then
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. Turning off the password sign in might make your computer vulnerable from unauthorized usage of the computer/account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how that turned out for you.</p>

            Good morning.&nbsp; Thank you for your suggestion, however, I have completed this process (and verified it a number&nbsp;of times) yet it did not solve the problem.&nbsp; My sign-in screen appeared this morning to my disappointment. Although I do not have to actually
 "sign-in", I&nbsp;tap the space bar to make this screen disappear. I believe this sign-in screen was on top of another&nbsp;screen which I also do not want, which shows the day and time. So now I have 2 unnecessary screens over my wallpaper, when&nbsp;all I want to see is
 just my wallpaper of choice. &nbsp;I do recall having performed this same procedure on my old laptop and it worked out great--log-in screen never surfaced again.&nbsp; For some reason this time it is not working on my new laptop.&nbsp; Any other solutions would be appreciated.&nbsp;
 Also, I'm curious as to why this configuration doesn't take.

            Windows 10 Home version 1709 (OS Build 16299.248).&nbsp; I don't know how I can take a snapshot of my log-in screen since the screen disappears when I touch any key.&nbsp; The log-in screen has a box in the middle of the screen which reads LOG IN (as if I needed
 to enter a password).&nbsp; However, I am set up not to have to enter password.&nbsp; The first screen is a screen which shows the date and time (I do not want this screen either--I believe this is the lock screen; this is still showing despite completing reconfiguration)
 and the second screen is the log-in screen. In all, 2 unnecessary screens on top of the third screen which is my desktop screen/wallpaper.

            Problem solved.&nbsp; The tech at the store I bought my laptop had was able to disable both the sign-in as well as the lock screens. They are gone forever (that was the plan!). I found them to be two unnecessary steps I had to take each time I opened my laptop;
 I am a single user and have no cares about having to lock or sign in. Thank you for your assistance.

<p>==========================================<br />
If the format of the video clip is compatibile with <br />
Movie Maker....the following article may be worth <br />
a look:</p>
<p>Movie Maker -<br />
How To Rotate A Video Taken At An Angle Easily - XP - Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/how-to-rotate-a-video-taken-at-an-angle-easily-527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/how-to-rotate-a-video-taken-at-an-angle-easily-527</a></p>
<p>If there is a compatibility issue with the video format...<br />
it will need to be converted to the .WMV format before <br />
importing into Movie Maker.</p>
<p>There are many programs that can do conversions...<br />
The following freeware is one example...:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup260.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag FFSetup260.exe out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />
Next...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your video clips onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

            <p><span>Hi Frank,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are sorry for the inconvenience caused. We will assist you in resolving your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before suggesting further, I would like to ask you few questions regarding the query:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>When did the issue persist?</li><li>Have you created any system restore points on your PC?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform<span> <strong>S<span>ystem restore</span></strong> by following the steps from the link below if you have any created restore points and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you think an app or driver that you recently installed or uninstalled caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a
<strong>restore point</strong>. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to<strong> Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</strong> from the link below (Applies to Windows 10 also):</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system
 restoring. </span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>After performing System Restore, you cannot downgrade to previous Windows version using Rollback option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the answers to the above questions to assist you further on this query. Your reply is most important for us to ensure that we assist you accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;I&nbsp;have lost many apps that I loved, liked and used but no its deletes them because I had to do a restore because 10 is so awful. Now it won't let me load CDs or programs back on.</p>

    <title>Multiple Screen Time Limits per day in Family Safety Here and gone. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Screen Time Limits per day in Family Safety Here and gone.</h2>
                    <p>On August 19th I got an email from Microsoft Family detailing the changes and improvements that had been made to family safety. &nbsp;The part that I found most helpful was about multiple time limits per day coming back. &nbsp;See excerpt below.</p>
<div>
*** Multiple time limits per day </div>
<div>
<p>Set multiple time limits per day for your child's Windows PCs. When your child runs out of time on a Windows PC, you can also give more time on that device even when it's not connected to the internet. &nbsp;***</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>When I went to account.microsoft.com/family there was indeed the option to add multiple instances per day. &nbsp;When I went back on September 1st to change the limits for my children for school season it was back to the same useless one time per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how to get the multiple options back?</p>
                </div>

            <p>Do you guys even read the actual questions???!!!! Jarett referred to the changes that brought back multiple screen time options/blocks....for us it required having windows 10 anniversary...installed and worked....now that I went to modify the allowed blocks
 of time THEY.ARE.GONE. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sachin--your response was less than helpful, on the verge of being insulting...the link you provided for us to be 'informed that there are some changes made to the family safety website' has this in it:
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>currently there is NO WAY to set multiple screen time limits since it looks like this:

<p>It allowed me to give unlimited access during school hours so they could use at school. At home they had 2 hour limits. To get more time they had to either read or play outside for a specified amount of time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is still an issue that is not fixed...currently one of my kids' has the different time limits (presumably because I set it up when it was an option) but my other two have the standard i.e. 7am-7pm 2 hours, unlimited etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AAUGH...I really wanted to be able to set up unlimited during specified chunks of time (i.e. school hours and homework times) and timed limits the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> sudibar  say:</h3>
<h2>            child in ms family - resend the invitation</h2>
                    <p>Current status:</p>
<p>a) I have successfully created and configured accounts for my my wife and my younger son. I have run for the help to setup adult and child accounts including sending and accepting an invitation as an family child.</p>
<p>b) second son, did not accept the invitation and now the invitation page does not longer exist. He did receive an email but have not confirmed it. He is not in the ms-family!</p>
<p>c) re-sending an information to him seems to work from windows settings but no e-mail is actually sent</p>
<p>d) from [https://account.microsoft.com/family#/] I could not do anything as invitation was sent</p>
<p>e) according to some help comments on similar issues i have removed him from ms-family. And now
</p>
<p>- I cannot add him again as ms-settings seems to not work </p>
<p>- online account management states "They're already part of your family."</p>
<p>- none of tools display it properly or actually allows managing this account any more</p>
<p>- emails sent to him never are actually received (i believe never send)</p>
<p>f) accounts on our PCs are working although there is no family protection on second son's account</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resend the invitation and finalize it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 kernel_security_check_failure upon restart and shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8.1 on a Apple MacBook Pro Retina with the latest version of the Boot Camp 5 drivers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Every time I go to restart or shutdown my computer, I get a Kernel_Security_Check_failure BSOD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Computer passes all tests without any problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The same problem existed in Windows 8 also.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After a clean install of Win 8.1, I did notice that for the short duration that I did not have the boot camp drivers installed, this problem did not occur. As soon as the boot camp drivers were installed, the problem started happening.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are my crash minidumps: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/16XxuTF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <b>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the kernel has detected the corruption of a critical data structure.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 139, {<u><i><b>3</b></i></u>, ffffd000209d4750, ffffd000209d46a8, 0}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bugcheck is 3 which implies a LIST_ENTRY was corrupted (for example, a double remove).<br />
<br />
Most causes of this bug check tend to be self explanatory and easy to diagnose. One exception is code 3, LIST_ENTRY corruption. This type of bug check can be difficult to track down and indicates that an inconsistency has been introduced into a doubly-linked
 list (detected when an individual list entry element is added to or removed from the list). Unfortunately, the inconsistency is not necessarily detected at the time when the corruption occurred, so some detective work may be necessary to identify the root
 cause.<br />
<br />
We seem to have various NETIO.sys faults mentioned through a lot of the dumps which is the
<br />
<div>Network I/O Subsystem driver (Windows system driver). It's not the true cause and is being faulted by something else, likely another driver related to network. If we look carefully in some of the dumps:<br />
<br />
Probably caused by : <i><b>bcmwl664.sys ( bcmwl664+4afc2 )</b></i><br />
<br />
MODULE_NAME: <i><b>bcmwl664</b></i><br />
<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp;<i><b> bcmwl664.sys</b></i><br />
<br />
FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x139_<i><b>bcmwl664+4afc2</b></i><br />
<br />
<i><b>bcmwl664.sys </b></i>is the Broadcom 802.11g Network Adapter <i><b>OR </b></i>Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-Card driver.<br />
<br />
As far as I know there are no updates from this driver on Broadcom's site as it's OEM, and since I noticed you're running Windows on a Mac, we can't simply visit Mac's website for the drivers because there aren't any.<br />
<br />
You may have to purchase another 3rd party adapter to circumvent this issue. We can also see nvlddmkm.sys faults however which is the nVidia video driver. Ensure your video drivers are up to date via nVidia's website.<br />
<br />
<i><b>We can also enable Driver Verifier to see if we are possibly dealing with any other device driver corruption and or conflicts:</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

<h3> michaelfinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer and the Organize tab</h2>
                    <p>I can use Windows Explorer to move files and folders, send them to the Redycle Bin, and so on.&nbsp; I can drag them, or use the Alt/Edit/Copy/Paste drill, without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, if I try using the Organize tab with its drop-down menu, the top line of the screen says"(not responding") after file name, the screen freezes (but for the pointer), then usually goes feint, and nothing happens for a couple of minutes,&nbsp; Then up
 comes a small Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime&nbsp; Library screen and stays there for another few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Or is there a fault somewhere?</p>

            <p>eDDshellExt.dll is a shell extension you can disable it by using ShellExView as I pointed out on a link on my first reply. But its better if you can contact Acer if its possible to uninstall the program&nbsp; Acer eDataSecurity Management without any risk and
 download the latest from Acer particular to your model. See the following link:</p>

            <p>&lt;&lt;I can drag them, or use the Alt/Edit/Copy/Paste drill, without a problem. </p>
<p>Can you right click and get to the context menu to do the same?</p>
<p><br />
&lt;&lt;However, if I try using the Organize tab with its drop-down menu, the top line of the screen says"(not responding") after file name</p>
<p>You mean the top most which is usally blank?<br />
Does it occur to a particular type of file (video .avi etc.)?<br />
What is the current view of the file when it happens (thumbnail, icon, etc)?</p>
<p><br />
Try this to see if you can get more clues to the problem:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Go to Control Panel, Problem Reports and Solutions, click on "See problem history" on the left pane, scroll down to Windows Explorer, under it double click on the problem that correspond to the date and time you encountered the problem. Note the file name beside
 the header "Fault module name:", google for the file to see which program it belongs to. You can then uninstall, update or reinstall the program.</p>
<p><br />
I replied to an almost simillar problem but the OP did not reply back on my last instruction:</p>
<p>The Windows Explorer closes on selecting the "Organize" button on a folder.<br />

            <p>Hi NakaZets,</p><p><br /></p><p>To give you an idea, If you're using a child account, you need to sign in with the parent account associated to manage your privacy and online safety settings. For you to check if your account is an adult or child account, I recommend that you sign in your account through <em><strong>https://account.microsoft.com/family</strong></em>. From there, you should see the parent account associated which you need to sign in. If your account is an adult account and still got the same issue, I suggest that you contact our Xbox Support to double check your profile status on our server. They have the right tools needed to check account status and to guide you on how to change your account privacy and online safety settings.

<h2>            External Sound Card is not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nimbus music PC which I have been using for a couple of years. I have 2 external sound cards: my main device which is a Focusrite Scarlett 18i8, and&nbsp;backup device the Steinberg CI2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both devices have been working fine with my PC for a long time, however over the weekend my Scarlett stopped working, and my CI2 works with an intermittent buzzing noise. Both show up fine as audio devices and I have reinstalled drivers, checked speaker
 configurations etc. I have also tried both devices with my laptop and they both work fine so the issue is definitely with my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started after I changed my setup from having all my devices on my desk to putting them onto a freestanding shelf so I have changed USB ports and moved my PC and audio devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the best way to try to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Not Received my Money After Game Was Refunded</h2>
                    Hi i am Nate Gordon and Last weekend i had accidentally purchased sea of thieves, i put my card information into the windows store and when i hit next i assumed it would just go to another step except it had purchased the game. I put in my refund request
 and it was accepted about a day later, but its been 3 or 4 days since my refund was accepted and i have still not received the money in my bank account. I think Microsoft had a big
<strong>[Mod Removed-Profanity]</strong> because i bought the game on another website because i had a gift card they did not grant me my refund, if that was the case Microsoft is a terrible corporation. i tried to get this issue resolved, but when you call
 their customer service line it just directs you to their website that does not answer anything for me. i am losing my patience with this company, this is the third time they've
<strong>[Mod Removed-Profanity]</strong> something up with my payment, the first two times were with the Xbox game pass which i had canceled and then i was charged for the next 5 months. i need to get this issue resolved if it does not i will stop using your
 products and you have just lost another customer due to your poor customer service and lack of respect for your consumers.&nbsp;

            Like Smwutches said check the commerce.microsoft.com website to make the order you placed last weekend is showing as refunded if it is then the refund was processed through MS and at this point you would have to talk to your financial institution to find
 out when they are putting the money back into your account which from personal experience especially if you used paypal that could take up to 30 days.

    <title>Mouse won&#39;t click, keyboard malfunctions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tam_25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse won&#39;t click, keyboard malfunctions</h2>
                    Any help with this issue? At times, mouse will not click or cursor will not highlight items on hover. Ctrl+Alt+Del &gt; Task Manager helps sometimes, but not all. The problem is persistent with touchpad and with wireless mouse. Often, when the mouse starts
 working again, it right-clicks when using the left button. Keyboard malfunctions sometimes (wrong result when hit a key - as if Ctrl or Fn is held down, but not consistent). The problem is not persistent when using a peripheral keyboard as compared to the
 laptop's built-in keyboard. Computer will lag a bit rarely. These problems started after some recent Windows updates and I started using a Toshiba hub with my laptop. The problems are occur when connected to the hub and when not connected to the hub.

            <p>&nbsp;Problem resolution requires doing problem determination first.&nbsp; That combined with your comments about the registry in your OP combined with your having CCCleaner are all things related to my mentioning registry corruption.&nbsp; If you have run any kind of
 registry cleaner, or attempted any kind of registry modification, that could possibly, though not necessarily, be at least part of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp; You seem to have a lot of abnormal symptoms, so it's obvious that something within the billions of instructions in any Windows system isn't right.&nbsp; If after going through all the things in my list of things, you still have these problems, you're either
 going to have to come up with another way to find these needles in the billions of possibilities in the haystack or restore your computer.&nbsp; I'd recommend you back up any data you don't want to lose because symptoms like you're having often get worse with time.&nbsp;
 If using system restore doesn't work, you could end up having to restore your computer to factory settings according to the instructions in your user guide (which should be listed in your start menu).</p>
<p>&nbsp;When you've gotten your system back like you want it, I urge you to get yourself an external hard drive and a good 3rd party backup program. You can set it up to do everything automagically at the time and frequency of your choice. 1 TB external hard drives
 are about $80 these days and a really good FREE backup program is the Easeus todo backup free which you can download from<br />
<a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm</a> . That can save you a lot of time and frustration the next time something like this happens. Sooner or later it
 happens to all computers for one reason or another.<br />

<h3> lannycrims0n  say:</h3>
<h2>            4K Blu-ray playback on 1440p menu issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey everybody,</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm not sure if this has been answered but I couldn't find a solution, so apologies if it has. I've got my One X connected to my 1440p monitor outputting at that resolution. Games run fine, most apps run fine, but for whatever reason I have no menu showing up when playing back 4K blu-rays on it at 1440p. If I switch output resolution to 1080p or 720p voila, but otherwise I just get the background menu video playing. I can still navigate the menu but can't see it.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Have tried a number of 4K blu-rays including Westworld and The Force Awakens but the same result.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any ideas?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p>
