<h2>            Windows 8 Xbox games won&#39;t sign in</h2>
                    <div>I'm aware there are many threads already with this issue but none of them have come up with a resolution that I can find.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When starting games in metro such as Jetpack Joyride it will not sign in using my xbox live account. My Windows 8 user account is a linked Microsoft account. I am signed into xbox live (my gamertag etc appears in the start screen), I have tried the app
 troubleshooter from Microsoft, I've tried syncing licenses, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, I've tried disconnecting and reconnecting my Microsoft account, I've tried switching off my internet security software, I've tried running system
 file check (/sfc scannow), reset store cache, synced system time/date, signed into xbox.com then retrying, allowing through firewall, disabling firewall, etc.</div>
<div>Everything I've seen in other similar threads, I've tried.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any actual solution to this issue?</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: Just tried a 'refresh' of Windows 8 which was much more hassle than I'd hoped and still the problem persists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit #2: <b><u>I believe I have found a solution.</u></b> Please see my post on page 3. I can't mark my own post as the answer so this will have to do.</div>
                </div>

            <div><b>Edit #3:</b> I would encourage people to first try the methods that I listed in my original post as having not worked for me.</div>
<div>Many people find that simply correcting their system time zone is the solution, as PCol has stated on page two.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I think I may have stumbled onto a solution for us!</div>
<div><br />
<div>In solving a different issue I seemed to have also solved this.</div>
<div>My Users and Update settings disappeared from Windows 8 'PC Settings' and many things in Control Panel weren't working. After googling around I found AMD Driver Cleaner is the culprit.</div>
<div>The solution I found to fix this appears to have also fixed the sign in issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.deskmodder.de/blog/2013/02/11/windows-8-reparatur-mit-einem-inplace-upgrade/</div>
<div><br />
<div>The above is the link to the fix I used.</div>
<div>It's basically upgrading Windows 8 to Windows 8. Leaves all your folders, files, programs, apps in place. Essentially repairs the install I guess.</div>
<div>After doing this I was checking apps and programs for functionality and, to my surprise, Jetpack Joyride, Wordament and Microsoft Majong all successfully signed into Xbox Live.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did not rename shell32.dll as the link suggests (which is found at C:\windows\system32\shell32.dll for those who don't know), just followed the rest of the steps.</div>
<div>The only difference I encountered was on the first compatibility check it asked to restart to access files.</div>
<div>I restarted into Windows and ran the setup again without any issues and now I have my Users and Update settings back, and it seems I'm able to sign into Xbox in apps!<br />
<br />
<b>Edit #2:</b><br />
Here's a slightly more detailed list of instructions.</div>
<div>You may wish to create a system restore point in case this doesn't work for you.</div>
<div>1. Insert your Windows 8 installation media. This may be DVD, or USB. You can also mount an image. See below if you need help on this step.<br />
2. Open the disk/USB etc, and then open the Sources folder, and run Setup.exe<br />
3. You may need to insert your serial at this point. I'm unsure as I did not but I am running Enterprise.</div>
<div>4. If you are prompted to restart, then do so. <b>Do not</b> then boot from DVD/USB. Boot into Windows normally and run the setup.exe again as before.</div>
<div>5. In the selection Window choose upgrade, this will keep your files, folders, programs, apps etc. (You'll lose Windows updates).</div>
<div>6. You should now see the familiar installation screen with "Windows is gathering information etc". This will take a few minutes, allow this to run, Windows may restart a couple of times.</div>
<div>7. You will go through the colour selection and express/custom settings.</div>
<div>8. You should now be back into Windows with all your files etc. Try running an Xbox for Windows game.</div>
<div>9. Leave feedback here ;) and if it hasn't worked you can use a restore point. You should just have to install a load of Windows updates and be done.</div>
<div>If you want to remove the Windows.old folder that will no be in the root of your hard drive, follow these steps.<br />

<div><br />
<div>This is what seems to have worked for me.</div>
<div>Please try this fix and report back here. You have nothing to lose except all your Windows updates. (I had over 670MB initially, then Windows found 400MB more, over 1GB in total) of I also thought that one of these updates may have caused the issue and
 so ran them in small groups and restarted after each regardless of need. I ran Jetpack Joyride, Wordament and Microsoft Majong after each restart to check they signed in.<br />
<br />
If you don't have your original disk you can get Windows 8 Pro ISOs here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.davejunia.com/2012/10/windows-8-pro-upgrade-experience/#iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.davejunia.com/2012/10/windows-8-pro-upgrade-experience/#iso</a><br />
You'll still need to activate with your product key.<br />
You will need to burn these to a disc or USB or mount them to a virtual drive which you can do via right-clicking on the ISO and clicking 'Mount' in Windows 8. Both are fine.</div>
<div><br />
<b>Or</b> any Windows 8 ISO here:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a><br />
I believe the latter link downloads a program which then will download the relevant copy of Windows after given the key, could be wrong,<br />
You'll be presented 3 options:<br />
<div>1) Install now</div>
<div>2) Install by creating media</div>
<div>3) Install later from your desktop</div>
<div>2 or 3 will both work fine.</div>
<div><br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need further explanation for anything.<br />
I hope this helps all of you.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Edit:</b> If this works for you. Please do spread this solution to other threads you've seen regarding this issue.</div>

<p>Okay so this is what I did I had bought "Halo: Spartan Assault" and when I tried logging in it told me my time and date was wrong every other app told me different but I went into my desktop tile and tapped on the date and time on the bottom right hand corner
 and opened up the "Date and Time" window then tapped "Internet Time", chose "Change settings..." and unchecked the "Synchronize with an&nbsp;internet time server" tapped "Okay" went back and checked the box again and when I went back to the game it automatically
 signed me in, hope this helps if not play around with the time settings I'm guessing the time and date that your account shows has to be synced with the one on your surface pro/rt</p>

<div>Hello everyone! &nbsp;As silly as the whole "time-zone" solution may sound at first, it actually does fix the problem! &nbsp;I bought the computer just a few days ago and none of the games/apps would sign into Xbox live. &nbsp;After reading through many threads, such
 as this one, I realized that my time zone was set to "pacific". &nbsp;I changed it to "central" but, initially, it did not fix the problem. &nbsp;A few minutes ago, I saw Benn_garza's post, went into the "date &amp; time" settings and realized that after I changed my timezone,
 the computer was showing the wrong time. &nbsp;So, I went into "Internet Time" setting, clicked on "Change Settings" but was surprised to see that "sync with server" option was already checked off. Why was my computer showing the wrong time then..? Well, I then
 clicked "Update" button, which fixed the time my computer was displaying and more importantly - all of my games are able to sign in to Xbox Live! So, I would suggest everyone play around - there is definitely something to the "time zone" solution. &nbsp;Big thanks
 to Benn for pointing me in the right direction!</div>

            Hi there.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>To answer your question the issue first appeared after a windows update and restart.</div>
<div>As I mentioned above, I am connected to my network and it appears in the notification area but It doesn't show at the Network and Sharing Center.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>None of the above methods worked for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In Homegroup it says that <b><i>this computer can't connect to a homegroup because I am not connected to a private network</i></b> (which is not true). As my network doesn't show up at the
<b>Network and Sharing Center </b>I cannot change it from guest/public network to private.</div>

            Windows 8 here, I am ready to upgrade to 8.1 The store tells me I can upgrade but it won't connect. None of my MS apps will connect, Bing finance and others say I'm offline. Funny but I can watch you tube, post to facebook, play games, watch movies, in
 short the rest of my computer thinks I'm online. Funny how it's just the MS apps that can't connect. What gives? I'm so frustrated, I've been dealing with this issue for days just because I want to get rid of windows 8.0.

<h2>            User account problem after latest Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Help! The latest Windows 10 update has messed up my user account!</p>
<p>Prior to the upgrade, I had a user account (with administrator powers) called “Computer Admin” This account used all the settings in folder C:&gt;Users&gt;User.</p>
<p>After the upgrade when I log into “Computer Admin” all the settings have changed and I can’t access my files!!! It now seems to be getting its info from a new folder C:\Users\User.FISHERHOMEPC, (FisherHomePC is my computer name) and storing new info in a
 totally new library called “This PC”</p>
<p>My old info is still available in c:\Users\User, but I can only access this via File Explorer.</p>
<p>Please tell me how I can get my User Account to again use the data in the original C:\Users\User.</p>
<p>Or can I copy all the info in the old C:\Users\User to the new C:Users\User.FISHERHOMEPC?</p>
<p>My Windows details after the upgrade are Windows 10 Pro; Version 1709; OS Build 16299.98</p>

</p><p>Since it was identified that this is an account related issue, we suggest that you copy all your important files to your new account and remove the affected account as a workaround. All the files that were saved on this credential C:\Users\User can be transferred
 to C:\Users\User.FISHERHOMEPC.</p>

    <title>explorer.exe Application error The instruction at 0x77B9A9D0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaming scholar  say:</h3>
<h2>            explorer.exe Application error The instruction at 0x77B9A9D0 referenced memory at 0x73B66008. The required data was not placed into memory because of an I&#47;O error status of 0x0000185</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>Won't load desktop and explorer.exe gets application error</span></p>
<p>I'm really not sure what to do with this one.&nbsp; I've been hunting all over the net for answers but I just can't seem to get them.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Basically what's happened is it won't load my desktop at all.&nbsp; It shows the background picture all pretty like, but it won't load even the start button.&nbsp; I can get the task manager going, but that's about it.&nbsp; I once got it into safe mode with the command prompt,
 but I don't know enough about DOS to do any good with that.&nbsp; The only other piece of info I can give you is an error message that appears every so often.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
explorer.exe Application error<br />
The instruction at 0x77B9A9D0 referenced memory at 0x73B66008. The required data was not placed into memory because of an I/O error status of 0x0000185.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That's all it says, and I have no idea what that means.</p>
<p>This is on an Asus netbook, so there are no drives available to me other than USB.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 7 Starter on it and nothing has been changed.&nbsp; I tried creating a new profile in the command prompt, but it has the same problem.&nbsp; I also can't get the
 Task Manager to start a new task to try anything else.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Hi gaming scholar,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you receive the same error message when you try to boot into regular safe mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you receive the same error message when you try to boot into safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform a check disk from system recovery
 options. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1: Perform a check disk from Windows Recovery Options</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the command prompt, type&nbsp;<strong>chkdsk /r</strong>and press Enter.<strong> </strong>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<em>Answer<strong>&nbsp;Y</strong>&nbsp;when chkdsk asks you
 if you want to check the drive next time Vista boots (restarts).</em></span></p>
<p><span>Note: &nbsp;<strong>/r</strong>&nbsp;= The /r switch tells chkdsk to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector
 is a spot on the hard drive that cannot hold saved data anymore.<strong> </strong>
If you’ve any data on that sector, you’ll lose that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2: Use memory diagnostic tool from Windows Recovery options</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below to know how to run Windows Memory Diagnostics from system recovery options.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3: Perform a system restore</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above steps fail, then perform a system restore from the system recovery options.</span></p>
<p><span>You can visit the link provided in step 2 that contains steps to perform system restore from system recovery options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

</div>
<div>I'm trying to find a downloadable image resizer app for Windows XP Home. My Home version's Paint program has a good one but I'd like another one. The Microsoft PowerToys Image Resizer for Windows XP appears to be it. I've been to many of the above sites
 with successful downloads but I don't wind up with an app that I can run. The first attempt left me with no desktop icons and a Read Me file in the All Programs menu. Those and the usual .exe , setup, and application files which were revealed after Search
 for 'resizer'. I've opened these and selected Run and Install as prompted but I get nothing after that, just re-writes them over the first downloads. I can find nothing in any folder or on desktop or taskbar that will launch this app after many successful
 downloads from many websites. A couple of times, all I was left with after a completed download was a sign-up page for Facebook and twitter. I even right clicked on an image, assuming the app was running in the background, but the appropriate window did not
 appear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My first attempt was from the Microsoft website - Windows XP PowerToys Image Resizer. Seems no matter where I download it from I get an app that won't run.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm probably missing something here. Please enlighten me.</div>

<br />
<div>Thank you JohnsonRobert. I ran the above Fixit which did find a registry problem - corrected it.</div>
<div>I then (once again) successfully downloaded the app - with the same results. It keeps opening</div>
<div>a new tab for Waljam (I think that's it) saying IT'S the downloader for the Power Toys Image Resizer I just downloaded. That's the page with the Facebook/Twitter connection. Installing and running goes through the motions alright (windows for install,
 run, policy agreements, express or custom install..) but all I get in the end is a readme file at the bottom of my Start - All Programs list. Attempting to launch directly from the icon in it's folder gives the same results. Just rewrites over the first install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is the page I'm downloading from. I've tried other sites - same results.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/xp-downloads#2TC=powertoys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/xp-downloads#2TC=powertoys</a></div>
</blockquote>
===============================================================<br />
On the site you posted...right click the text...Image Resizer...<br />
<br />
From the menu...choose...Save Target As...<br />
<br />
Choose "Desktop"...<br />
<br />
Left click the..."Save"...button...<br />
<br />
The downloaded file should be a 520kb file named "ImageResizerPowertoySetup.exe".<br />
<br />
Create a System Restore point and then double left click the downloaded file to install it.<br />
</blockquote>
Still no dice. Everything went smoothly, the only thing different was getting a desktop setup icon. Double left-clicking that gave the same result as I was getting before - a window asking to Run or Cancel. This installs but won't run. I get this same window
 no matter which way I try to access the program. Clicking Run just re-installs it over the last one with no way TO run the program. Still just a readme file in the Start - All Programs menu. It's like it's zipped and there's no way to un-zip it. It's like
 the download only contains a Readme file - even though other files show up in a search.
<div><br />
<div>I'm more curious than anything else at this point. My XP Paint will do nicely but must go through a couple of windows - I think the Image Resizer has all in one window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help on this. I'll fiddle around with it later. Thanks again.</div>
</blockquote>
============================================<br />
This is the first time I've seen a report that the <br />
PowerToy Image Resizer would not function.<br />
<br />
Now I'm wondering if the utility is installed <br />
and you haven't discovered how to use it. <br />
<br />
You do not have to launch the utility...it is<br />
always ready to go.<br />
<br />
Try opening any folder that contains images <br />
and you should have an option to resize in<br />
the right click menu.<br />
<br />
Just right click one or more selected <br />
(highlighted) image thumbnails or filenames <br />
and choose Resize Pictures from the menu. <br />
You can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in<br />
the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and<br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.<br />
<br />
If this is the answer...I apologize for not thinking <br />
of it sooner.<br />

            If its Windows 10 Enterprise 1803, you should be able to plug in the USB and start the upgrade as you normally would. 
<br />
<br />See steps:

<br />
<br />If you don't have the Windows 10 Enterprise 1803, you will need to ask your organizations system administrator for permission and access to a Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 ISO download.

<br />This is normally available through the volume license service center.

            Hi ,jackieelkington1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Take action related to Touch Screen Driver - Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show Hidden Devices &gt; Expand Human Interface Devices &gt; Right click HID Compliant touch screen &gt; 
<br />A. Enable &gt; Restart your computer (if it is already enabled, disable it, reboot and then enable it again)
<br />B. Roll back &gt; Restart your computer
<br />C. Update driver from manufacturer's website - Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />There are two other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions

<h2>            Game sharing - One Xbox 360, Two accounts.</h2>
                    <p>I know I'm a little late to the party here on 360's, but I need some help.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get my son into playing some video-games (hoping it will help hand-eye coordination and direction listening etc).<br />
I've started him on Terraria, which I already had on the console from when I used it. I've made him a child account and everything, but he can only play the tutorial.<br />
I've tried to look up how to transfer the game to his account, but most of the forums and walk-throughs are for either 360 to One, or 360 to 360 or whatever. It's just the one 360, but It keeps saying I need to "Buy the Full Game" when I already did...<br />
I'm getting very frustrated, and I don't want to have to buy the game again for the same 360.<br />
</p>
<p>I thought I was fairly savvy when it came to Xbox's but this is a little depressing I have to admit. He looses all his progress everytime he starts it up and then he looks at me: "Mommy, what am I doing wrong? All of my things are gone, again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could one of you please help me out? I want my boy to like games, and at this rate he's not going to see the fun in it.</p>

<p>Hello Amanda!</p>
<p>It most likely means that he game was purchased from another Xbox 360 console. If you are using the same Microsoft Account that purchased the game it would let you fully play it but the license to the console would still be where it was purchased. I recommend
 you sign into the Gamertag that purchased the game originally then go into your "Settings" once there select the option that says "Account" in your "Account Management" area select "License Transfer" and then yes to do it. Once that is done any other profile
 should be able to play the game regularly.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Please let us know with a reply if this helps!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Region&#47;Timezone Changes to Amsterdam, but only at home</h2>
                    <p>I have a very odd and bizarre issue around the Time Zone on my laptop while at home, versus anywhere else (work for example).</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>While at work, I use my Galaxy Note 8 (t-Mobile) Hot-spot and when i check the Windows Time and Time Zone - it shows up correctly (Central Time).</li><li>While at home, using the same phone and hot-spot, my laptop changes Time Zone to Amsterdam!\</li><li>While at home, using my home ISP wifi (Spectrum Cable), I encounter the same thing -- it automatically changes to Amsterdam</li></ul>
<p>The really really odd thing (yes, even more odd than the above) is that Windows Maps also zooms me in to the Netherlands -- but when I use any other Map (Google) or "Find Me" service - it zooms in to exactly where I'm at (North Texas).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all sort of stuff - from changing the Bios battery, doing updates, manually changing the Time Zone to Central (maps still shows me in the Netherlands regardless of that) -- and even went as far as doing a complete re-install of Windows 10 (fresh
 install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought it was my ISP IP Address settings (I heard Windows uses IP for Location if laptop doesn't have built in GPS) -- but I checked the IP Address and it also checks out to North Texas.&nbsp; Also the fact that using the hot-spot off my T-Mobile
 phone produces the same issue -- but not at work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support was also unable to figure it out -- Lenovo pretty much said it was an OS issue, so they didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh -- btw, my home PC has the same issue, not just my laptop.</p>

            Computer geolocation can be tricky.    
<br />
<br />I once had a similar issue.  Depending on which "Who is" utility I used, my location was being place only 2000 (or so) miles out. At least on the same continent.
<br />
<br />The location give is based on records stored in multiple places on the internet. The resource being used when you are at home has bad information.  Sorry, I don't know how to tell them to fix it.
<br />
<br />What you can try is using a different DNS service at home.
<br />
<br />Here are some articles on how you can do that:

<br />
<br />This tool can help you find the best / fastest DNS service for your location:

<br />
<br />
<br />This is an interesting option, I just read about it, have not had a reason to try it. But it may be good way to resolve your problem:

            <p>The file type was not created by Windows 7 nor does your having Windows XP help you any (or hurt you.)&nbsp; The "DOC" file extension indicated it is likely a Microsoft Office Word document - likely saved in Microsoft Office Word 2003 or prior formatting.</p>
<p>If you have a new enough version of WordPerfect installed - it should be able to open it - although it will likely mess up some of the special formatting, if any exists.</p>
<p>If you do not need to EDIT the document - I suggest viewing it with this:<br />

<h3> susanzmolek  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I turn off hot keys in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Asus laptop on Windows 7 let me use F9 to turn off a situation where I'm typing along, a block of text is highlighted and automatically deleted before I even realize it has been highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I'm on Windows 10, this is no longer available to me.&nbsp; I know that some hot keys are active, because for example, I'll just type an r, and suddenly I have a question box to deal with.&nbsp; The worst is when two hours of work is highlighted without my
 knowledge and disappears in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 does not call these hot keys, so I cannot even find where they are or how to turn them off.&nbsp; I hate this.&nbsp; I need to word process!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get a message; would you like to turn on hot keys?&nbsp; Please tell me how to turn them off.&nbsp; I never turned them on...</p>

            This is not a helpful answer.&nbsp; If it is true, it makes me want to dump Windows 10.&nbsp; I have no way to contact Asus.&nbsp; The laptop worked fine until I put Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; I see that Windows 10 has a place to turn "sticky keys" on and off, but it is clearly
 set to off.&nbsp; It seems to me that platform software should not change how my laptop works.&nbsp; I hope there is more to the story than what you have told me already.<br />

    <title>Windows Update Error 80073712 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bsmith99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error 80073712</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 Professional X86_64 system that is working perfectly aside from this issue. I just noticed that my Windows Update was not able to query for new updates. It seems that it's been unable to detect any new updates for the last 10 weeks or
 so and I've been trying many many different steps to try to find out why.<br />
<br />
So far, I have tried:<br />
1) Reboot<br />
2) Enable/Disable Update Services<br />
3) Microsoft Fixit For Windows Update (Says it detects errors and fixes them, but it doesn't; and, on subsequent runnings, it still detects issues but still cannot fix)<br />
4) System Update Readiness Tool (Fails due to CSI Unable to Query Store Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000002)<br />
5) Attempt to Install Windows 7 SP 1 (Fails almost immediately)<br />
6) Attempt to do In Place Upgrade Twice (Copies all windows setup files over, then says setup cannot continue, please try latest updates, etc)<br />
6a) In place Upgrade once with "get the latest updates" and once without<br />
7) sfc /scannow will not run from within Windows, it says it cannot perform the requested operation (as admin terminal window)<br />
8) sfc /scannow from Windows 7 DVD Will say "pending reboot, can't etc etc" <br />
9) sfc /scannow with offline options will still say it cannot perform the requested operation<br />
10) Installed Updates in Control Panel shows no updates installed (absolutely completely wrong)<br />
11) Tried to rename c:\windows\softwaredistribution folder to another name and have it re-create. No progress on the fix<br />
12) c:\windows\winsxs\ has no pending.xml but a reboot.xml and I tried to rename that to something else to no avail<br />
13) Was going to look at HKLM/Components but it says Access Denied (I am admin). Tried to add myself, but it also said Access Denied<br />
14) Was going to attempt a System Restore, but I only have points from the last 10 days (seems to be too recent) and the previous before that is 3 years old<br />
15) Attempted to do an inplace upgrade from the DVD, but it said I must do it within Windows<br />
16) Ran a full chkdsk twice, no changes<br />
17) Ran a full system scan Microsoft Security Essentials, nothing found<br />
<br />
It would appear to me that my Windows Update (WinSXS/CBS/CSI?) database of updates is corrupt/lost and preventing any update or in place upgrade from occurring and sfc from running. It would seem to say "Oh man, i can't even tell you the version format, let
 alone actually scan it!". I'm really hoping for a way to clean and start the update database from scratch versus doing a brand new fresh install. Any help is much much much appreciated. Otherwise, I'll have to plan on doing a fresh install soon, as I can't
 have an un-patched Windows box for much longer!!<br />

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
The report from the Microsoft Genuine Advantage Diagnostics Tool that tells us this information:</div>
<div><br />
BIOS valid for OA 2.0: yes, but no SLIC table</div>
<div><br />
refers that the licensing information in your BIOS stored in the ACPI_SLIC table is corrupt. In order to get it right, you will have to contact the mannufacturer of the computer, since the licensing information points that the Windows is provided by an Original
 Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The product key used is probably a Volume License Key. For more information on this error, you can go through the More Information section in the following article:</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942962</a></div>
<div><br />
Regarding the issue with Windows Update, it is caused by corruptions in the Windows Servicing Store. An In Place upgrade usually resolves such issues. But since this is failing in your computer, you may have to eventually perform a Custom Installation.</div>
<div><br />
However, you could try resetting the Security permissions using the Subinacl tool and then try performing an In place upgrade and see if it helps. For information on how to reset security permissions using Subinacl, you can refer to the following MSDN blog:</div>
<div><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2006/09/04/739820.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2006/09/04/739820.aspx</a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you back up all your data before you begin.<br />
Refer the following link to back up your data.</div>

<div>If this also does not help you, I would suggest you to perform a Custom Installation of Windows 7 in the computer. Refer the following link.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</a></div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Refer section: reinstalling Windows 7 to obtain information on how to reinstall Windows.
<div>If you need to perform the installation using the Windows 7 installation disc, follow the instructions in Using the Custom installation option and formatting the hard disk.</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows 7 if possible, even if you're reinstalling Windows 7 on a hard disk partition, and you have personal files on a separate partition. For example, if you have encrypted files,
 you might not be able to access them after reinstalling Windows. A custom installation replaces the current version of Windows 7 and all personal files.<br />
Refer the following link to back up your data.</div>

<p>Hi James</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hide- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The settings I was describing let you hide Cortana and search box completely in which case if you right click on the windows icon and left click on the word search near the bottom it will bring back the search box and Cortana for your use
 once and then it disappears again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show Cortana Icon - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Show Cortana icon or round circle does the same when clicking on the circle as the description above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These choices both hide the search box and Cortana so you don't inadvertently bring Cortana up but the search box is still available for your use with little effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explains it better.</p>

<h2>            MP4 won&#39;t work in Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>I copied a video I recorded on my phone to my computer and tried to add it to Movie Maker so I can edit it and upload it to YouTube. I've done this many times before. However, it is now coming up with a message that says "double-click to fix. The file might
 be corrupted or in a format that Movie Maker doesn't recognize." I downloaded another media player that someone suggested and tried to play it. The image appeared but stayed frozen and the audio did not play and lasted for only 10 seconds (it's about a 4 minute
 video). Is there some codec I need to download or something I can do to make this work in MM or does it sound like it corrupted during the transfer?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Kay, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />I did learn the hard way, more than once, that I should have contacted the maker's support in case of down the road issues. So even though I am a very experienced Windows troubleshooter this is what I would do with a new computer.
<br />
<br />Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact System Maker's Support and the seller. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jump lists is an extra generation feature for navigation to files, and applications in Windows 10 like in the earlier versions on Windows. Since there was a recent update applied, it reverted your personalization back to
 default. You may just enable the option back in Personalize. </span></p>

<h3> drunk samurai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to process Service request, What can i do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox One caved in last week. It refused to get to the Green screen and i got the error code "E303 00000000 8007042C" So i scoured online for a solution, tried them all, but to no success. from best i can tell i've got a faulty Hard Drive (bad clicking
 noise coming from the console) Anyway, i tried to process a service request. at first i couldn't even get to service options screen. it just kept saying error, making me go back and re-type the "what best describes your problem" Eventually i get past that
 and onto the screen in which you fill out our address etc. But when i try to move onto the next step, i get another error screen. and it puts me all the way back. I've tried this on 4 different days, each day the same problem. i just want my Xbox serviced
 and back to normal before the warranty runs out.<br />
<br />
Some extra info: The Error code i get when i try to move on with the service process is (Correlation ID: 1099b5cd-b679-4ec6-aea2-4bf07244054f)<br />
The second error i get is simply (</p>
<div>
<div>An error occurred. Please try again.</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>An error occurred. Please try again.) (I've tried again about 50 times now)<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
</div>
<p><br />
<br />
Any help on what i can do would be really, really good for me right now :) This things got me stressed out. Thanks in advance&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<h2>            Explorer View setting must be done twice to be persistent</h2>
                    <p>I have a folder open in Explorer with some files showing. I choose View | Medium Icons and my view duly changes to show my files as medium-sized icons. I then click on a second folder and then click back to my original folder. I now see my files showing
 as Details. I once again choose View | Medium Icons, my view now shows my files as medium-sized icons, and after I click on another folder, and then click back to the original folder I see my files correctly as medium-sized icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does it take 2 times of setting the View for a folder in Explorer for the View setting to be persistent for that folder ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modifying the view settings on your Windows File Explorer can make your files organized. To set the specific settings that you want to apply to the folders, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Set the global folder options. </strong>To specify the settings that apply to all folders, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel, </strong>and then double-click
<strong>Folders Options.</strong></li><li>&nbsp;On the <strong>General </strong>tab, click the options that you want.</li><li>On the <strong>View</strong> tab, click the options you want.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To reset all folders to default settings, click <strong>
Restore Defaults </strong>on the <strong>General</strong> tab or on the <strong>View</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Use the same view settings for all folders. </strong>You can apply the same view settings to all folders on your computer except: folder icons, pictures, toolbar, settings, or folder task. To apply the same view settings to all folders, follow these
 steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Locate and open the folder that has the view setting that you want to use for all folders.</li><li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Folder Options.</strong></li><li>On the <strong>View</strong> tab, click <strong>Apply to All Folders.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Yes,</strong> and then click <strong>OK.</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To reset all your folders to the default view settings, repeat these steps, but click
<strong>Reset All Folders</strong> in <strong>step 3.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us informed for further assistance.</p>

            <p>So there is a system-wide default, which I could change system-wide if I desired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should I have to change from the system-wide default twice, rather than merely once, in a folder to have the setting become effective ? In my eyes this is a bug in the way Explorer works. I change from the system-wide default setting in a folder to what
 I want, click on another folder, go back to the first folder, and now the system-wide default is back. Why should this ever happen ? It is only when I change the setting in a folder a second time does my setting take effect for that folder. It does not make
 sense to require the end-user to change from the system-wide setting in a particular folder twice before the setting is effective for that folder.<br />

            Hi, have you tried restarting your console completely (unplugging for 1 min and plugging back in) and restarting your PC? But yeah, it should be tracking the achievements on both devices, is this what you're referring to?&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/tracking-achievements-in-your-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/tracking-achievements-in-your-game</a>

<p>Hello Shh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need both for achievements to work. Have you tried signing out completely on the Xbox app. Power down the PC, then sign back in. You can also check on
<a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">true achievements</a> see if they are unlocking.</p>
