<h2>            Skype video call with text</h2>
                    <p>When a friend and I are on a video call everything we say using voice appears as text. How do you stop that.&nbsp;Also, it appeared that someone else was on the line. When either of us was not speaking a text conversation appeared. The friend who I am talking
 to did something but doesn't know how to undo what was done.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t sign into my Xbox account.</h2>
                    <p>I can't sign into my Xbox Account. I can't do anything except attempt to sign in or try to go to settings or restart. When I go to settings My xbox shuts off after about a minute. When I try to restart everything freezes on a black screen. &nbsp;The only thing i can do and have tried is a hard restart. I hold down the button until it turns off and then remove the power cable. Nothing is working and I have tried to contact support however since I am part of the Xbox Preview program they can't help me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is an odd situation. &nbsp;Maybe try the opposite connection that you are using (wireless try ethernet, etc.) Maybe even try removing the game information from the xbox and connect it again. I will try and find some more information to help out and post
 it. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>Hi StringingDAVID<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best bet here is to check the storage device for Borderlands 2 &amp; delete any files you see called Title Update. &nbsp;Once you do that &amp; launch the game again it will download the update again which should get it working properly. &nbsp;Let us know how it goes,
 we'll be here for any further questions.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Bitlocker problems but perhaps more</h2>
                    <p>I recently sent my Asus Vivobook S14 to the service center for repairs (Motherboard). It came back to me with an request for the Bitlocker recovery key. I went through the guide on how to retrieve it. My Microsoft account however did not have my Asus notebook
 linked to it and hence i was unable to retrieve the recovery key. I am 100% sure this was the account connected to this notebook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing that it is too late to try add it to the account at this point, i tried to reset the computer. This did not work either. I have tried clicking on every option on the screen to no avail. Please advise. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can you access the account you thought was linked to the laptop on another device.? If so look in OneDrive and see if it contains a BitLocker key.</p>
<p>Did you setup BitLocker or did the laptop come with BitLocker enabled from Asus. If it was from Asus then perhaps you can check their documents or ask them for help.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that it wont allow you to sign-in as it's asking for the key. Changing the motherboard means a different device as far as Windows 10 is concerned so if the service centre was Asus then they should help with your problem.</p>

<p>I have tried to log in on a seperate computer, unfortunately it still shows a lack of the locked out notebook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that ASUS was the one that set the bitlocker as i have recollection of ever doing so. I'm in line at the ASUS service center as i am typing this. Hopefully they can figure something out on their end without having to reformat the Notebook.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus or other security software&nbsp;that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription
 that has not expired, contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows
 10.</p>

I strongly suggest you avoid using third party Antivirus utilities until Windows 10 is released to the general public. Antivirus utilities require intimate access to the heart of Windows, new versions tend break a version of a AV utility not specifically designed for it. Since Windows 10 is going through rapid development, even third party Antivirus utilities that might offer support in another build might break in a future build. Lets take a quick look at enabling and updating Windows Defender."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

    <title>Media streaming is not turn on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffrey yeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media streaming is not turn on</h2>
                    <p>OK I have posted this issue several times.</p>
<p>The last 2 Windows update is interfering with media streaming from my PC to my Xbox.</p>
<p>My Xbox was able to detect my PC as I set it up as a media server so that I can stream movies from my PC to my Xbox to watch on my tv but after an update about 2 weeks ago, it won't show up anymore.... not on my console or my mobile phones.</p>
<p>And the latest update I got just now, I thought it will fix the problem but instead, now I totally cannot turn on media streaming. When I click on the "Turn on media streaming" button it just turn grey and nothing happens.</p>
<p>So now this is probably the 4th or 5th time I am asking.... pls fix this problem Microsoft... pls come up with an update that actually fix stuffs.</p>

<p>Thank you for the late reply.</p>
<p>1. My windows version is 1803.</p>
<p>2. Clicking on the "Turn on media streaming" does nothing. It just turns grey for less than a second and back to its original state... no matter I restart my computer a gazillion times.</p>
<p>All of the methods that you suggested I had found on the web and tried already and none of them helps.</p>
I'm telling you it is the October windows update that broke this feature and Microsoft needs to roll out a fix on this. It happened before and it is happening again.

<h3> icek.aizen  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m unable to change default file associations. The association always reverts back to what it was.</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 64bit.&nbsp; I'm unable to change the default file associations for .exe and .ini file (I haven't tried other file extensions).&nbsp; I've tried making the change by choosing "open with", selecting the desired program, and checking the "always
 use the selected program to open this kind of file".&nbsp; I have also tried it with the "Default Programs/Set Associations" option in the Control Panel.&nbsp; No matter what I do, the association reverts back to what it was before (Notepad in the case of .txt and .ini
 files)<br />
Any suggestions are appreciated.<br />

            Thanks for your suggestion.&nbsp; I tried the Microsoft FixIt but that didn't help.&nbsp; Then I remembered that I had installed and uninstalled a trial version of UltraEdit v. 18 on my computer.&nbsp; This program associates itself with a variety of file types.&nbsp; I reinstalled
 the trial version, making sure that it was set not to associate itself with any file types and then uninstalled it again.&nbsp; Now everything works fine.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>Try with the methods below and check if it works.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to go to the device manager and right click on the device
 so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for&nbsp;your mouse&nbsp;from the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer to see
 if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If doesn't work, I suggest you to run
<strong>System File Checker</strong>, which will check your system for missing, corrupt or damaged files and attempt to fix them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please refer the article on “How to run System File Checker” and check if that helps.<br />

<h2>            3D Builder reflected screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm currently working in a computer lab and we are preparing 3D builder to teach our students and several of our computers have this odd issue where the screen is reflecting on a diagonal. We didn't change any settings on the computers that I know of and
 the program works on most of our computers. We have tried repairing and resetting the app from settings and the program is up to date. Could someone tell me what is going on and how to fix it?</p>

    <title>remote access trojan, DNS and cache poisoned - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> default_user88525  say:</h3>
<h2>            remote access trojan, DNS and cache poisoned</h2>
                    <p>I have tried everything I can imagine to fix issue and nothing works. Level 2 Microsoft techs, both remote and in store were unable to fix. I have what must be a Remote Access Trojan that infects all Windows OS as well as OS x, Linux, iOS, Android. In every
 case the original TrustedInstaller or other name of built-in admin is immediately replaced, this can be difficult to see at first as the change- on Windows- will be from "default" to "default user". All of the admin accounts I have created on PC lose their
 admin status though they are still labelled admin. The inability to have even an owner level admin account results in loss of use cmd.exe, i.e. I cannot run System File Check, Check Disk, or Net User. When I run the app cmd.exe it open to C:\User\users\name
 of account instead of the response I used to get of C:\Windows\System32.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very few people who have looked at problem and recognized it for what it is have unanimously stated that the following programs are infected BIOS, Master Boot Record, and Guid. I've also been told - by the same techs who have seen the severity of issue-
 that restoring PC to factory settings does not change any of these by way of explanation that no amount of factory restore have changed problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-downloaded Microsoft Office so many times that I am no longer allowed to download program. I have purchased a total of 9 installations pf Office and do not have it available on any PC. I honestly do not care what is lost in terms of data. I just
 want to fix issue and block it from ever happening again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened on every computer I have purchased over the past 21/2 years. The remote hacker(s) (Alternative Data Stream software &nbsp;such as Glasswire have detected 14 different streams/packets with no ip address or false ip address. At one point I caught
 a glimpse of the files changed and the corrupt files (in some cases, had actual names as part of the driver name. All native drivers are replaced with different drives and the rollback function is grayed out,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried taking ownership of infected files and when I actually have managed to do so, have been thwarted because the user has inherited permissions and simply makes a new version of itself. The infected files have NT level permissions so the the few
 programs that are capable of detecting the infected keys, programs, files throw messages such as "folder is locked and cannot be scanned" or "Registry Key, program, file" has NT level security and cannot be removed by software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be impossible to express the degree of gratitude I would have for anyone who could help solve this problem,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of windows 10 laptops that have cost me a fortune in anti-malware, repair, etc. Every time I have gotten them back (including 2 that were remotely accessed by level 2 techs as part of 2 annual maintenance packages I purchased through MSFT
 for $150) and quite a few others that were taken to the closest Windows store. The repair packages came with a $ back guarantee. In both remote cases the techs looked at the laptops and could not figure them out - it turns out to be a remote accessed Trojan
 and&nbsp;when neither of the repair techs could fix the issue both promised new OS (then Windows 7 64 bit now Windows 10- neither new oS was ever received, not surprised in case #1 as tech was arrogant and "accidentally" hung up on me. The 2nd level 2 tech was
 more gracious and followed up about OS but as I told her then and still remains true, I never received either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RAT infecting the Windows OS are far beyond anything Windows built in recovery and reset options are capable of repairing. The MBR and .exe boot files are all corrupted so that any amount of reset will not help aside from getting the symptoms to subside
 for a couple of weeks,. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the diagnostic start up attempts using bootrec.exe commands and none will run on the machines. I am completely handcuffed unless I can get a complete OS with all boot files included. This was my understanding of the conclusion I had from
 both techs who looked at PCs multiple times before concluding the work was beyond them. I do not think it is reasonable, however, to expect me to purchase 7 new OS in order to get the laptops I purchased with windows pre-installed and no media aside from the
 reset/recovery option which has never worked, I would like MSFT to propose a reasonable solution to this problem. I am of course, hand cuffed by the difficulty in contacting MSFT, they require every iota of knowledge about me and refuse to publish any way
 to contact them about legitimate customer service inquiries, please advise.</p>

            <p>None of the reset options on my HP Pavilion laptop help because those folders/partitions are also infected by RAT that makes A/V programs worthless. I have about 6 PCs 5 Windows 10 (truthfully it's really double that but was too embarrassed to admit. HP
 claim they have complete installation disk for this situation but they do not help at all. Is there anyway to get the installation disks for all my PC since I've paid for program and the only installation has been them is corrupt one I'm using now. Windows
 remote ( 3 different level 2 supervisors could do nothing and promised to send me new OS that had new boot partition. Paid for two annual service contracts, all stated after lever 2 inspected that the best they could do was to send me new disk- none of them
 ever appeared so I basically purchased a service with a money back&nbsp; guarantee if couldn't fix. They couldn't fix and never received promised 3 OS disks. So, I suggest never using Windows tech support.. Since Windows has 10 ways to get to you &amp;&nbsp;get no ways
 for you to get to them. Brought 10 laptops to Windows store&nbsp;in Corte Madera, CA. Refused to give me OS disks, restored PC wit same infected&nbsp;&nbsp;boot partition intact and corrupt but arrogant Windows store staff refused to believe it was not fixed. Very little
 knowledge in staff, seemed like received a 2 week course in Windows &amp; orders to act arrogantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for whining about Windows competency and lousy support. Can anyone tell me how to get new OS for the PCs I have. If I don't do all of them then (I'm told) it will simply re-infect boot partition. I've been told that it's a version of Zero Access named
 Sirefef. Thought problem might be solved by new Avast MBR repair software but unable to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both HP and Windows promise new OS disks in these cases but neither are inclined to help. If anyone knows how to get bootable disks from Windows= for approx. 10 corrupted OS - I would forever grateful.</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.

<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you resolve your concern, what we suggest is to perform a clean install and ensure that your antivirus is always on.&nbsp; You may download an
<strong>ISO</strong> file of Windows 10 on this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks for reply but I have downloaded so many .iso images an the trojan on every PC I have refuses to allow them to run. The drivers are replaced and the dvd drive is no longer recognized by computer. USB drives that have had portable version of .iso loaded
 onto both Fat and NTFS formatting are (in ways I do not know) prevented from running, sometimes because the drive is converted to RAW, other times I try to install from .iso and it starts but when it arrives at "select file with signed drivers", it stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered the driver issue at many of the recovery media I've used. There is no indication of which drive among</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery: Partition built into C:\</p>
<p>C:\ The corrupted collection of drivers and programs that caused this</p>
<p>D:\ The usb with portable .iso. (one would think that the "signed drives" requested would be on here but &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've searched every file</p>
<p>X:\ Boot ( Since the RAT that has destroyed PCs also infects the boot, MBR and every other bare bones &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;system file. I can't imagine this working</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, absolutely none of the choices listed removes the error message and allows me to choose Next to continue process. I do not know whether .iso image is as effective as he bootable recovery disks that came with PCs until MSFT figured out a way to save
 $.02 on every PC sold while ignoring that they were further lowering their horrendous support with usual callous disregard for how decisions affect end users. I sure wish that the 12 PCs I have that do not work would at least get a chance at a full bare bones
 re-installation, on an infected PC, the full reset is useless as MBR files as well as some others still remain ready to re-infect the next installation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some PC manufacturers claim that if your so totally in pain they will cough up bootable installation disks but I've tried HP, DEll, Acer and others w/o successfully getting a single disk. I was actually promised 2 of them by MSFT whe a year repair contract
 did nothing to fix problem but neither ever got sent to me. The priveleges of running a monopoly that allow complete indifference to consumer wishes or well-being.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, I know you didn't cause any of MSFT's horrendous customer service and I do appreciate suggestion. &nbsp;I have , however, already tried everything possible - including the "$ back guarantee" repair contract w/ MSFT on 3 PCs none were fixed, no
 $ was ever returned. Bootable OS windows 10 Pro 64 were promised but, of course, never delivered. If you could give me a hint on how to get the recovery disks I need, especially the 3 promised by level 2 techs, I'd hate Satya a bit less.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried this many times on an assortment of RAT infected PCs that keep all my files hidden and read only as well as informing me that I have insufficient permissions to even open the folder to look at the file. I can often get access to a file briefly
 but if I assign it to one of the administrators created by me when I got the PC that adminisitrator than becomes the user that is controlled by Remote Access allowing me a window of about 24 hours to access that file, key, drive, folder, program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a work around to every object, group or User &nbsp;telling me I have insufficient permissions to access object by using your method but assigning ownership and full control to "users" thinking that this would allow everyone to access. ( and removing
 some permissions from "system, admin, creator owner, trusted installer" as these Users to are generally corrupt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this occasionally cause the entire C:\ to tell me I have "insufficient permissions. Honestly, with a PC infected by the RAT I've been dealing with, I feel like I would be much, much better off with no administrators and all standard users (The
 built-in admin gets shortcuts broken and is replaced by similarly named (default vs, default0) by remote a***holes* by time Windows sets up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any workaround suggestions ( they need to be work around as the RAT has given itself NT permissions and taken any admin privileges from my user accounts so it is not something that anyone has been able to fix. I sure would like to have the $6,000
 in PCs; $4000 in Macs and too much in other OS, I'd love to hear it as any suggestions within the normal parameters of OS repair are useless.</p>

            <p>Since I have spent a fortune on trying to fix problems stemming from the UAC (on infected OS) I've concluded that if it were possible to leave a built in admin strictly to monitor processes but aside from that, disable the UAC (and do whatever else is required
 to keep PC from establishing any hierarchy with the ACE, that would probably be the best solution to the horrendous 3 years of problems I've had with a remote access trojan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a single tech - including the best Windows has to offer - has come close to fixing it. Most denied the possibility of its existence until about a year ago when more ppl. started reporting it on MSFT forums. The infection changes all of my admin accounts
 to standard while it infects registry keys, replaces all my drivers, tweaks my disk management so DVD player is neither shown nor recognized and most flash drives are converted to useless RAW.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as there is any kind of hierarchy among users, the owner and admin accounts attempted to be created will have the least permissions available. I cannot access documents, pictures etc. due to "insufficient permissions" There are two object "names"
 beneath the GUI names given by MSFT. From what I can tell, the correct MSFT files are normally called something like S-10-15-5-0. Some administrators retain these names but most are named S-D-15-20-21cf8-ef6p3-bb465-with a few more 5 character groups fo;owing
 the example I started. From what I understand, MSFT never has names with as many characters as a Windows activation code - if I am wrong here, or anywhere, please correct. If I give ownership of anything, say System32, to a user I created with a short, presumably
 MSFT allowed name. My remote peers simply change the oddball name to whichever account I have tried to give the most power to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try a workaround that included giving all priveleges to Users, thereby giving each individual user in Users folder access but that backfired as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to summarize, I have a RAT that no tech or software program or remote tech has ever been able to come close to fixing. Most don't even know what I'm talking about. If I let go of the battle of "who is sysadmin" and make all accounts, even hidden accounts
 and completely disable the UAC. There should be nothing left to dictate whether I have sufficient permissions to access anything I save. Since I try to save all important info in the cloud. It seems like I may as well let the Chinese and Russians play with
 my PC, stop trying every new malware removal tool to take back and simply declare anarchy on my hard drive I'd be better off that I currently am. Suggestions welcome. except please don't give me the standard Windows way to fix it because Windows is incapable
 of fixing it. I'll go thru the process that seems to work on paper in Windows World but in the reaL WORLD WILL spend an hour and end when I get to a grayed out "save" button or similar. 3 level 2 windows techs tried to fix a year ago when I wasted $159 on
 MSFT money back guaranteed fix. No fix, no $ back, was promised 3 new OS since they couldn't fix . &nbsp;None of the OS ever were actually received but the lie made me feel better for 90 seconds.</p>

<p>I did not realize that the .iso images were "bootable". I have likely misunderstood the problem given that. I have tried to download an iso image multiple times, first to my hard drive and then to flash drives and dvds. I have taken each step because I was
 unable to run the earlier suggestions. &nbsp;I have not been able to run a new copy of Windows 10 from either my hard drive or from any removable media. In each case it feels like the RAT is actively blocking my ability to do so. On my hard drive, I get the error
 message that some files required are missing, on removable media my PC is unable to read or access the iso files downloaded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is related but many potentially helpful security programs have been blocked when I have been unable to download the .exe files. They are only allowed .htm or .jpg extensions, .exe files extracted from ZIP files have been hidden or moved
 with shortcuts left in desktop unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed quite a few w3.org domain cookies, js.script etc. These seem tied to RAT issue though I don't understand how. I've experienced address bar info beginning w/ https:// to have different headers inserted in front of https:// address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I have difficulty distinguishing cause v. effect and from what I've read, RATs often leave multiple ports open for other malware to enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for lack of specificity but much of this is beyond me. I have lost any capacity for administrative user despite usernames still shown as "admin". I have tried changing the command prompt with cd C:\Windows\System32 but sfc, chkdsk and net user
 options still unavailable because "must be administrator to run". Again any help appreciated.</p>

            Hi  Ys_Chua 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I recommend that you do a manual update for this KB. To know the KB number - Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; See which updates are getting installed. If this information is not available here &gt; Click View installed update history to see which updates have been installed.
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)

<p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried as suggested. But the problem still persists.</p>
<p>However, this becomes even worse as I can't roll back or do anything now because all the update history is being wiped off when I check in either system restore or the previous version of window.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for all the advice and comment.</p>
<p>I've found the root cause. Iobit Advance system care service messed up this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply go into msconfig, and disable the advance system care service.&nbsp; Restart and check for the latest KB, it will install as usual and boot into window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this help! At least work on my PC, as a Iobit Advance System care user.</p>

            I'm glad my solution help. I've spent days on troubleshooting and go through a hard time like what you did, with many times of system restore. Lucky me found the cause at the end.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, it can't even load into safe mode to uninstall ASC when coming into this "black screen" problem.&nbsp; You may try a system restore to rollback, then proceed with the solution posted by me. Hopefully, it can solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P/S:&nbsp;There is a new patch with latest KB superseded KB4497936.</p>

<p>Hello Mark_N113,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have indeed purchased a subscription for Skype for Business and opened an account on Office 365.</p>
<p>But, I was unable to install Skype for Business and I have more or less gave up on the whole thing. (The process of changing my domain name was too complicated to follow, etc..)</p>
<p>If the problem I have with Skype (basic) is due to me trying to install Skype for business, then I need to ask a few questions before deciding to keep my subscription with Skype for business.</p>
<p>(1) if I use&nbsp; Skype for business, do the people I call or make video calls with, have to have Skype for business too or can they simply have Skype (basic)?</p>
<p>(2) can I keep both Skype for business and Skype (basic) running on the same computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking again at the differences between Skype(basic) and Skype for business, I think Skype for Business is not for my size business (small).</p>
<p>Skype for meetings looks interesting but seems to only be available in the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall Skype for busines but I was not successful. So,&nbsp;how do I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards.</p>

<p>Hi Froggy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better help, please let us focus on the initial post. The version information (12.13.257.0) you provided, it seems to Skype (basic). So, please send your Skype account (or Skype for Business account) to us via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>, we will help to confirm if you are using Skype (basic) or Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile. About the questions you asked, I will help to answer it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: if I use&nbsp; Skype for business, do the people I call or make video calls with, have to have Skype for business too or can they simply have Skype (basic)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Skype for Business, you can call or make video with the people who don’t have Skype for Business, Skype for Business and Skype (basic) can communicate with each other. You can add Skype (basic) users as contacts (you should enable external
 communications and public IM connectivity):</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: can I keep both Skype for business and Skype (basic) running on the same computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can.</p>

<p>hi there, I checked my messages on Xbox live and it sent me the code for fallout 3 with my pre-order of fallout 4. However when I tried to redeem it i get a message that it has already been used and to try a different code? Help please.</p>

<p>Sounds like you may have redeemed the code and not realized it. Check under your Ready to Install list from your Xbox One to see if Fallout 4 shows as available for you. </p>

    <title>Seriously microsoft this console is pathetic.... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Seriously microsoft this console is pathetic....</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;seriously ive had no end of issues with my console... It seriously is a piece of ***.... I`m in the UK and am contacting watchdog about the disgrace of a BETA console yous are selling here...</p>

<p>So far here has been my problems....</p>

<p>Got my console the day after launch, had it 2 days and the controller broke... The left thumbstick developed a clicking/ sticky/ grinding sensation when tying to play.. brought it back to GAME UK who straight away replaced it without even asking for a receipt..
 (suspect there have been a few returns)... Got the new controller and bought it home.. happy days.. for a little while anyway,.. 2 days later the exact same thing happened to the new controller.. I just put up with this time for a week or so but when I knew
 I would be near GAME again I brought it with me for another replacement... bought a new game while I was there...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Got home with the new controller and new game.. put the game into the drive to install it.. and you guessed it.. the drive is no longer working.. Seriously??? &nbsp;YES !! Back to game yet again (twice in one day.. Yesterday) &nbsp;and get the console replaced...
 come home and set it all up again, download fifa, forza and install my discs all over again.. finally last night I got to play it for an hour before bed...</p>

<p>Stuck the xbox on again tonight for a few games of fifa.. and youve guessed it.. the left thumbstick is broke again... so in 3 weeks Ive have 3 controllers break, alone with my consoles drive dying...</p>

<p>This is absolutely pathetic microsoft... Yous have released a sub par rushed console with should still be in beta stage...&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guy in game yesterday offered me a refund or an exchange.. I`m wishing I had of took the refund and got a ps4... Im going back tomorrow to see what he can do for me as this is not fit for purpose.. I already did another thread about how poor the spec
 and quality of the one is compared to the ps4 but decided to stick with it as other members had said software updates should improve the box.... However they do not fix cheaply manufactured controllers nor blu ray drives... Its time to say goodbye to xbox
 one... I`ll keep my 360 but this is utter tripe and its going one way or another</p>

<p>I actually feel like a bell end,.. the game guy will be thinking here comes this *** again looking to return his xbox after having 2 controllers and an xbox one replaced,.. were on first name terms in the shop Ive had to go there that many times&nbsp;</p>

<p>After I have returned it I`m gonna hang around the forums for a week or 2 as I expect them to get very busy after christmas... gonna be a lot of disappointed kids getting up to this *** which will break in no time....</p>

<p><span>Hi Legal Status – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Message you may experience:<br />

<br />
<br />
MessageBox TEXT_DATA: <br />
Network Error:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Windows has detected an IP address conflict</span></p>
<p><span>Another computer on this network has the same IP address as this computer. Contact your network administrator for help
 resolving this issue. <br />
More details are available in the windows system event log.<br />
<span><br />
<br />
<strong>Why do I receive this message from Windows®?</strong><br />
You experience a message as this one when a couple of PCs are connected<br />
to a network. Each PC has an IP-address, however, when two PCs have each one<br />
IP-address that is identical to the other, and then there may be a problem. Windows®<br />
then notifies one of the clients about this, and requires that the administrator make some<br />
changes on the network settings. This can be an issue with the DHCP on the router.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution:</strong><br />
Check <em>Dynamic Host Configuration Host Protocol</em> (DHCP) settings on the router.<br />
Check each IPv4 address on each PC connected to your network. <br />
<br />
<strong>Another thing to try:</strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Click Start Menu and in the Instant Search type “Command Prompt” then<br />
right-click and left-click Run as administrator. <br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Type the first command </span></span><strong><span>ipconfig /release</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>and
 press <strong>Enter</strong>. <br />
<strong>3.</strong> Type then the second command </span><strong><span>ipconfig /renew</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and
 press <strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Explanation:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
The fist command will send a DHCPRELEASE message to the DHCP server to release the current<br />
DHCP configuration and discard the IP address configuration for either all adapters, the second<br />
command Renews DHCP configuration for all adapters. <br />

            <p>The problem with the disappearing items in the quick access occurs every week after I do my weekly repair and backup session. I followed the instructions above and the quick access shortcuts again disappeared after the latest repair/backup session (yesterday
 8-19). I need additional troubleshooting to fix this.</p>
