<h2>            Invalid Partition Table Windows 10 clean installation from MS USB</h2>
                    <p>My hard drive crashed on a Gateway system which was running Vista. &nbsp;I tried to reinstall Vista but the updates were driving me nuts so I bought Windows 10 Home. &nbsp;With new HDD installed containing the partially reinstalled Vista, I tried to boot to the USB
 and I get &nbsp;Invalid Partition Table and the boot stops. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

    <title>I have an Artist-wise collection of Hindi old songs. I want to burn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.krishna mohan  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have an Artist-wise collection of Hindi old songs. I want to burn them to dvds with all data like singer&#39;s name, film&#39;s name, composer&#39;s name, year of the song etc. Can i Do that&#63; if so how&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My OS is Windows 7 original with all the latest updates. And Windows Media 12 is running. I have a DVD connected to my machine.
</p>
<p>I thought I can make Albums and transfer all the songs according to the singer for my own use and thus save space in my HD. But on burning, only the track no is shown. I want Singer, Film, Year, &amp; Composer details in the DVD track. Is it possible?</p>
<p>Thank you, MOHAN</p>

<p>Yes, that's a limitation. The file name will appear as track numbers only but when you play the DVDs using Windows Media Player, you should be able to see all the information again.<br />

<p>You may follow the section "<em>Use media information to arrange files in folders on the disc</em>" from the article mentioned below.</p>

<p>We have the XBL family account. I am really hoping I am not expected to buy DLC for each gamertag. We bought the Undead Nightmare pack and it works fine on the main accounts but does not show up for the other accounts. On the other accounts it brings up
 the page to pay for it again.</p>

<p>are all the gamertags on the same purchasing console?</p>
<p>if so yes they can all use it </p>
<p>if seperate consoles then please read the family faq</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q: If I purchase an Xbox LIVE Arcade game, does it belong to everyone in the family?</b></p>
<p>A: Purchased content such as games and movies are licensed both to the console it was purchased on, and the individual Gold member that purchased it. So if, for example, your child were to buy an Xbox LIVE Arcade game on your home console, anyone on your
 console can play it. Additionally, if they leave for college, they could recover their account on another Xbox 360 in their dorm room and be able to play the game when logged into their account from that Xbox 360.</p>

<br />
<br />I was battling with one of my machines booting to USB last week, and after trying every which way, I finally reset BIOS to default, and viola! 
<br />
<br />It may be a shot in the dark, but let’s give it a try and we’ll go from there!

<p><span>Hello DanielKarlsson2,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it is not possible for a regular Skype user to join a meeting for Skype for Business as it is using a different application. With this being said, booking
 a meeting is also not possible. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you elaborate on your query regarding the power point file? Are you trying to send the file or share/view the file during a call?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will wait for your reply.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 tablet, turn off screen while keeping tablet on&#63;</h2>
                    just got a new windows 8.1 tablet ( omni 10 if you need to know for some reason ) and i keep finding myself wanting to turn off my screen while keeping the tablet from turning off or sleeping. i usually us my tablet to download OS updates for my android
 phone, or other large files, but whenever i push the power button the tablet goes into "sleep" mode and stops downloading everything. the only solution i can find is to keep the screen on, but id rather not do that to keep it from killing the battery faster
 that it needs to. also cant find anything in the power options about screen power off timer... only sleep timer :/&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same issue as MagicJello. I did just get my Asus Transformer T100 with windows 8.1 and just discovered this problem. It is most obvious when listening to music for example by using Spotify. When doing so I do not want it to go to sleep mode but
 of course it is ok for the screen to be turned off to save battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I set that the computer should never go to sleep. I can then go to advanced settings and change after how long I want the display to be turned off. But when I do so, and close the power settings window, and then open the settings again I can see that
 the option to never go to sleep mode has been changed to the same value as I set the time for the display to be turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be some sort of bug. Can it be fixed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 7 there were under power options different options for when the display should be dimmed, when it should be turned off and when the computer should go to sleep mode. I can not understand why these options have been reduced to only the option to
 go to sleep mode.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. It just frustrated me no end. I want to listen to streaming music in a browser over lte while in the park. I get the station up and running and then &nbsp; SLEEP!! No matter what setting I choose the damn thing sleeps. As stated by others
 the only option is to keep everything on, including the nice power hungry screen. In fact even just turning down the brightness leaves you in a hole, as then you cant find the controls to interact with the gui again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not a very well thought out scheme it seems. Either that or bad interface, points of confusion and function duplication in control panel versus tablet computer settings. Hmmmm very frustrating over all.</p>

            <p>Same problem with my Windows 8.1 Thinkpad 10. "Sleep" and "Turn off display" are both the same thing! It's frustrating if you want to listen music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft want to compete with Android? - Keep dreaming... They can't even fixed this very basic problem. Should have an update in the next business day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, as temporary fixed, I set the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\CSEnabled to 0. This will disable the sleep function and turn-off the display instead. The disadvantage is I need to shutdown my computer if I want
 to turn it off.</p>

<p>Does it have any sense of multiple monitors then?&nbsp; Win-P.&nbsp; If so, you could use&nbsp;

            <p>I just paid a BIG chunk of money for a Surface Pro 3 and can't even listen to music with no screen light in the room. &nbsp;What is the point of having separate settings for sleep and display if they are tied together? &nbsp;I don't think the majority of users want
 there screen on when they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to stored music</li><li>Streaming radio</li><li>Downloading large files in off hours that are not metered</li><li>Doing backups</li><li>Many other tasks within applications</li></ul>
<p>But we should have the option and Microsoft needs to stop making these decisions for users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the on the list to fix? &nbsp;Just a yes/no and I'll make my decisions based on that.</p>

            <p>Why are you needing to rename Malwarebytes&nbsp; to update it ? </p>
<p>If the program is running while trying to rename the driver this could prevent you</p>
<p>from changing the name ( normally a suitable error message would show, but not always)</p>
<p>Did you click on <em>Continue</em> when the message pops up (worked for me) ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal procedure with AV's would be for the program to do an in place update (I also updated the</p>
<p>data base just now with no problem). If that is not happening, uninstalling and reinstalling would be
</p>
<p>the most common alternative.</p>

<p>There is no option to continue.</p>

            <p>I agree with everything that has been said here, you should not have to rename a file in System32 to be able to upgrade MalwareBytes. With that said, if you want to rename the file, you will have to take ownership of the file, it can be a tricky thing to
 do sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ek5gmtjmjf6d49r/InstallTakeOwnership.reg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click HERE</a> to download a reg file from my DropBox Account, double click it and select Yes to merge it with your registry. This reg file
 will install 'Take Ownership' onto your right click menu and take the bother out of taking ownership of files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all you will have to do is right click the file and select 'Take ownership' a dos window will open and the process will be automated. Once the process finishes you will be able to rename the file</p>
<p>
</p><p>One warning though, be careful which files you take ownership of . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this Helps!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad that helped...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never fully understood why that is either... One of the possible reasons is that there is a "Administrators (ComputerName\Administrators)" account that can end up in place of your user name..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've lost track of how many times I've needed to modify the Permissions and\or Take Ownership... The newer Preview Builds seem to be getting even worse... I've had multiple software installations that have been Denied Access to create a new folder in Program
 Files, or to access the one that was there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to make some rather detailed modifications to the Permissions to get them to install... At one time, selecting "Run As Administrator" when installing was good enough, but that is not always the case now...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Where&#38;&#35;39&#59;s the truly wireless Xbox One headsets&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My PS4 has the pulse elite wireless headset and it sounds great. Truly wireless with great bass and mids.</p>
<p>why isn't there a truly wireless xbox one headset? Why do they all have to daisy chain to the controller?</p>
<p>not a big deal for games because you'll be using the controller, but for TV / Netflix, I don't want to have to lug around the controller just to watch some movies And not disturb my neighbors in this thin walled apartment.</p>
<p>IIRC The digital out heasaets don't get chat audio? Ie the truly wireless ones that connect via optical port.</p>

<p>whats so hard about making an official TRULY wireless headset? It can be USB based for all I care, I just don't want to be tethetred to a controller.</p>
<p>wires are not "next gen", nor are double A batteries, but that's an entirely different manner. I still prefer Xbox one over Ps4</p>
<p>any news on a truly wireless headse that isn't $200+? One that gets chat audio and game audio, along with volume sliders for both, like the pulse elite?</p>

<p>the more I read about the lack of truly wireless (and affordable) headsets, the lack of 1080p, games for gold being a joke, xbox live costing more than PS Plus and not offering nearly the same value, the more I'm regrettiing my day one edition purchase.
 I was burned out on shooters years ago and I'd rather browse on my iPhone than play titanfall. It does nothing for me.</p>
<p>about the only thing I prefer on Xbox over PS4 is the controller, UI, some exclusives and software. PS4 game clip sharing is ***. "xbox record that" is amazing , PS4 game sharing is absolute *** and it often has error codes when trying to share. Sony software
 is pure crap as usual.</p>
<p>but this still doesn't change the fact that there's no truly wireless (affordable, not $250 Astros) headsets for Xbox one. Wires in my lap is not next gen..</p>
<p>Im not an audiophile but I would love a truly wireless x1 headset that may or may not work with chat. I paid $120 for my pulse elite headset for my PS3, and now it works for PS4 flawlessly. One headset for two systems and it's truly wireless, comfortable,
 and affordable.</p>
<p>surely MS can release something truly wireless, with their billions of dollars.</p>

<p>not a troll thread just disapponted with my X1 as of now. Sub par hardware, overpriced, Kinect doesn't work half the time; I'm not loving it at all. Which is hard for me, since I don't like playstation that much. The software is *** and the controller sucks,
 especially the triggers. But its undeniable that it's clearly the better (and cheaper) system at this point, even with garbage sony software and servers.</p>
<p>TL;DR, where's my truly wireless headset?</p>

<p>you are not ranting or raving. you're just speaking the truth.I own 5 Xbox 360 s.I stuck with them through thick and thin because I thought they had a better gaming console.which they did.but still that many gaming consoles that's b*******.so for all my
 hard work and loyalty this is how I'm repaid.a ridiculously crappy console that is bugged out in glitch in every way possible.this isn't next gen.the Xbox one doesn't do things the Xbox 360 used to do.you cant even send a voice message to a friend.you can't
 look up people that you were recently in games with and the whole navigation menu was ridiculously hard to use.Xbox one doesn't even come with chat capability.and then if you do want to chat the charge you 25 extra dollars for an adapter to fix their f***
 upand. if that wasn't bad enough the adapter doesn't even work.I have tried tirelessly to get my a 50 Astros to work with no luck.I know that some people have gotten their headsets to work I'm happy for you.long story short I should have bought a PlayStation
 I'm actually considering selling my xbox on Craigslist for $400 so I can buy a Playstation</p>

<p>Obviously you(AnimalSet869897) are not a patient person even when the 360 came out it was glitched just as bad as the 1 then they perfected it, as of right now my experience with the 1 is far superior to my 2 360s especially my kinect (i love this thing)
 i hope you have realized since the 4 months you posted this rant of yours to just give things time cause every software glitch you just mentioned is fixed. Now as far as the chat adapter i will agree with you and i agree with Roughstack Ms needs to release
 some type of news regarding a truly wireless headset be it one like the xbox 360s just for chatting or third party manufactures</p>

<p>@Roughstack</p>
<p>You say wires areny next gen yet virtually every wireless headset on the market is either complete garbage or is not properly designed for gaming. Companies trick you with things like Wireless, VSS, Game Specific Audio Profiles, etc, etc, etc but if you
 have ever heard a real set of cans, you will see that these gaming headsets by Sony, Turtle Beach, Tritton, Astro, etc are not made for performance because they are all of a closed back design.</p>
<p>Don't understand what I'm talking about? The headphone company Grado explains.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of over-the-ear headphones: open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Most headphones are closed-back, meaning that the outer part of the headphone cups have a hard enclosure that fits snugly around the entire ear. Open-back
 headphones do not separate your ears from the outside world. Designed so sound is able to resonate from the rear of the speaker diaphragm, the unique design of open-back headphones reduces distortion and sound coloration that is often associated with closed-back
 headphone sets. Open-back headphones are able to not only produce a wider soundstage, they also deliver a more transparent sound.</p>
<p>Why Open Back Headphones are the Best Choice</p>
<p>Closed-back headphones make music sound like it is coming from inside your head. Open-back headphones allow sound to pass through the back of the ear piece, creating an open, accurate and natural sound. This soundstage seems wider and has more presence.
 That extra air flow is able reduce the effect of sound "bouncing around" inside closed back headphones - creating a more natural and realistic listening experience, while also increasing the accuracy of the audio.</p>
<p>Not only does the added airflow increase the sound quality produced by open back headphones, the design also provides more comfort for the listener than the box-like experience of closed back headphones, which can get hot and even sweaty.</p>
<p>Due to the accuracy of the sound created and the experience provided to listeners, open-back headphones are the first choice amongst musicians, professional audio engineers, as well as avid video game players. The accurate, real-life sound created by open
 back headphones allow gamers to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source. They allow sound engineers to accurately mix and master music and they provide musicians with a wider sound stage and a more transparent sound.</p>

<p>So I guess what I'm trying to say is, before these companies focus on a completely wireless headset, they should first develop a proper headset to begin with instead of pulling the wool over everyone's eyes with flashy gimmicks and quality that comes from
 Toys R Us.</p>

<h2>            Animate CC draws straight lines automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having this problem where whenever I try to draw on Animate CC it will&nbsp;identify my first stroke as a straight line. I am not talking about a line created upon impact by Adobe Flash (a problem I have too faced). Animate CC simply pretends that my first
 stroke is a straight line, though I can choose the direction of it and the brush goes back to normal after a short time. It is practically impossible to draw like this, and help would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>I am using Adobe&nbsp;Animate CC, a wacom tablet and microsoft Surface.</p>
<p>Thank you for any advise.</p>
<p />

    <title>Boot time 18 sec on ssd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrehsu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot time 18 sec on ssd</h2>
                    So I bought an Asus S550CB about three month ago, and when I first got it, it boots up around 12 sec (it has a hybrid hard disc). Then about a month ago, I did a windows re-install, and now it boots in around 18 sec. So I am wondering if the system re-install
 relocated my OS to the HDD instead of the SSD.
<div>PS - I have Kaspersky internet security installed, will that affect the boot time?</div>

    <title>Microsoft&#39;s Violation of Consumer Rights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s Violation of Consumer Rights</h2>
                    
<p>This post is primarily intended to bring visibility to an issue I believe needs to be resolved before any more consumers get screwed out of their money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the history: I purchased an Xbox 360 Elite in January of 2009. It was pretty awesome. I had hoped that by this most recent installment of the Xbox console, the hardware problems that have been plaguing owners of xbox systems would have faded away.
 For the most part, I was not disappointed. My Xbox 360 Elite console worked very well for two and a half years. In May of 2011, I experienced the dreaded Red Ring of Death... my heart stopped. It was my first Xbox and I had no idea what to expect... did my
 data disappear? Was I still in the warrantee? Surely I'd have to shell out the money for a brand new Xbox. Nope! Little did I know that Microsoft extended the warranty for Red Ring of Death issues to 3 years, since it had become such a common problem and was
 the source of so much negative publicity. Luckily, I was covered. I sent my Xbox in, it came back three weeks later repaired and ready to go! They even included a free month of Xbox Live to make up for the time I couldn't play my console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friends of mine had told me about their Red Ring of Death issues and how their consoles got Red Rings again pretty soon after getting repaired. So I decided I'd avoid that issue and went out to the store to buy myself a brand new Xbox 360 Slim. After all,
 they advertised it as whisper quiet in their press releases and it was Kinect ready, should I ever want to buy one of those. So I shelled out the $300 USD for the new console, hooked it up, and watched some Netflix. Couldn't be happier with my experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...until 6 days later when the ethernet port stopped working. At this point, I was a little frustrated. I take meticulous care of my consoles and couldn't believe that I had purchased a console with hardware that stopped working after only 6 days. It was
 still within the return period, so I whisked it back to Best Buy and requested they replace it for me. They did- no problems. A bit annoying to have to give up an hour and a half to get there, but whatever- I had a new console in hand and didn't have to pay
 a dime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.... until 28 days later when the new power supply started making the worst sounds when the console starts up..... Now I was pretty frustrated. Here I was on my 3rd xbox in two months and there was ANOTHER hardware issue. I mean, these noises were AWFUL.
 Not only were they distracting, but I'm sure given time, they'd prove to be the symptom of some issue that destroys the console. Who knows? Maybe the sound is indication that it's improperly converting the power from the outlet? I'd rather not risk losing
 all my data or melting a disc, so I figured "better to get it fixed!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was beyond the return period, so I couldn't bring it back to Best Buy. I called up 1-800-4-MYXBOX. I had had a pleasant experience before, and I figured it would be smooth sailing this time too. After all, I only had it for a month before it stopped working
 properly, so I figured there'd be no issues getting it resolved. Wrong. I phoned Microsoft and told them the problem. They said "No problem, we'll get that replaced for you, sir."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait for it..... "You just need to pay for shipping to send it to us and we'll send you out a new one once we get it, free of charge." To which I responded, "Wait, I have to pay for shipping to replace a defective piece of hardware that's only a month old?
 How is that free of charge?" The woman I spoke with agreed to connect me to a supervisor so I could talk to them about the issue. Dante and I talked about it and I informed him that I didn't believe I should have to pay a dime to replace a month old defective
 product. If it were a year old, I'd say ok. But I just bought it, and it's already not working properly. The issue was only compounded by the fact that this was my third xbox in 2 months with serious hardware issues. Dante informed me that he doesn't have
 any power to override the policy and provide me with a free shipping label. I believed that was the case, but asked if he could forward my call to someone who does have the authority to override it. He tried to tell me there was no such person in all of Microsoft
 that had that ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No one? In all of Microsoft?" I said. "There's not a single person with that kind of authority? What about Bill Gates? I'm sure he could do it if he were so inclined. If that's the case, then clearly there is SOMEONE. I'm just asking to be forwarded to
 whoever is in charge of your department so I can discuss the issue with them." Anyway, long conversation later - he told me he would leave a message for the individual above him and I could expect a call back to talk about this with them. "When should I expect
 the call?" I asked. "24 to 48 hours," he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.... two weeks later. No phone call. Not even so much as a follow-up call from Dante or someone from his staff. I called 1-800-4-MYXBOX again. This time I spoke to a new supervisor. She put me on hold for a little while as she attempted to figure out what
 the issue was and how it might be resolved. I assume she was speaking to her superior. She came back and told me there was nothing she could do and that she's sorry no one got back in touch with me. I explained to her that, according to the warranty that came
 with my Xbox 360 S, I believed my consumer rights were being violated. The language of the warranty is thus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"4. Microsoft's Responsibility</p>
<p>a) After you return your Xbox 360 S or Accessory to Microsoft, Microsoft will inspect it.</p>
<p>b) If Microsoft determines that the Xbox 360 S or Accessory malfunctioned during the Warranty Period under Normal Use Conditions, Microsoft will (at its option) repair or replace it, or refund the purchase price to You. Repair may use new or refurbished
 parts. Replacement may be with a new or refurbished unit."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd go on, but there's no point. Bottom line is that there is no language in the warranty whatsoever that claims the consumer is responsible for covering the shipping costs to get a defective item replaced. I explained this to Julia, the supervisor during
 the second call, and told her that under Massachusetts General Laws (and most state laws, for that matter), there are Express Warranties (which I just transcribed) and Implied Warranties, which apply to every product sold anywhere ever. Implied Warranty laws
 basically say, in the simplest terms "If you buy toaster, it should toast. If you buy a TV, it should display a picture." Basically, if you buy something, it should do what it's supposed to do, whether explicitly outlined or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this press release, (http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/jun10/06-14e3umbrellapr.mspx) Microsoft claims that the newly designed Xbox 360 S console provides a "whisper-quiet" experience so not to disturb the tension of games or movies. In my
 opinion, given that it was implied that the console and its components should operate in a "whisper-quiet" manner, the console is not performing as it should and the defective power supply should be replaced at no cost to the consumer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my belief that forcing the consumer to pay for shipping in order to replace a defective product (ESPECIALLY one well within the warranty period) is a violation of my consumer rights. Despite the fact that I would not have to pay for the item, having
 to pay shipping in order to replace it is, in fact, a cost. It is a cost that I don't believe I should have to pay considering I spent 300 dollars one month prior purchasing the unit.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is *** consumers first by manufacturing the world's most notoriously defective hardware and second by charging consumers ANY amount of money to replace them. I understand these forums are intended for people who need answers, but this post is intended
 to create results. I demand results. Years ago when the first Xbox 360 users complained about CONSTANT Red Ring of Death issues, Microsoft caved. They extended their warranty to 3 years and offered free shipping, free repair/replacement, and a free month of
 xbox live. If you feel that Microsoft is violating your consumer rights by maintaining a policy that requires the consumer to pay ANYTHING to replace a defective item, respond to this post and let's turn up the pressure.</p>

<p>Wow. How stupid are you. Paying shipping for a defective model does not neccescarely mean that you are paying that company to replace something. It means you are paying the people who are transporting your merchindise to not damage it. I really don't care
 what the laws say if someone isn't going to use them to their common sence. I have the Xbox 360 model. The second model that came out. I am on my 3rd year of owning it, I keep it on almost constantly,&nbsp;<strong>[mod removed]</strong> and still no problems. No
 cooling unit attached, and I can hear it running, and trying to play the game. It may say silence, but eventually there will be noice. Not every product, person, or fictional religious being is perfect. You should of just kept your first xbox considering you
 most likely wouldn't of had another problem with it. Then again you just wanted another reason for calling microsoft for the attention so no one else could get through.</p>

<p>I believe the claim "whisper quiet" falls under "puffing", referring to advertising something a product cannot provide. Otherwise, any item ever claimed by it's manufacturer to be the "world's best" would be sued into bankruptcy unless it held a position
 in the Guinness book.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any payment you would be making to return your system is to UPS (or FedEx, or the delivery service), not Microsoft.</p>
<p>Next, let's see something - of the odds of an xbox breaking are 1 in 10, then the odds of getting 3 in a row are 1 in 1000. Now, there are MILLIONS of xboxes, so inevitability, some people will land in that small group that only gets broken ones, and assumes
 they are ALL broken. You are simply a very unlucky person. :(</p>
<p>Finally, Bill Gates retired years ago.</p>

<p>A store return policy does not override your consumer rights. Inside of 12 months your first port of call is with the store you bought the item from if it proves to be faulty.</p>

            <p>We definitely understand your frustration, and we apologize for the experience. However, a few things to note from the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-360/troubleshoot/warranty/xbox-360-new-warranty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 S Console and Accessory Warranty</a>:&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The warranty mentions: "&nbsp;<em>After You return Your Xbox 360 S or Accessory to Microsoft, Microsoft will inspect it." &nbsp;</em>This does not mention that Microsoft will pay for the shipping of the Xbox 360 S or Accessory.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The warranty also states: "<em>MICROSOFT’S RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR OR REPLACE YOUR XBOX 360 S OR ACCESSORY, OR TO REFUND THE PURCHASE PRICE, IS YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY." </em>&nbsp;This does not refer to paying for shipping, but rather the replacement of the actual console or accessory as being the remedy for a malfunction unit.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you purchased the console in the United States, the warranty is administered by the laws of the State of Washington, regardless of where you live. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>Finally, this thread is construed as a "sign petition" type of thread, which are prohibited on the Xbox.com Forums, and as such this thread or any other threads of this nature will be locked. The <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/forum_faq/f/6/t/36181.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Forum Guidelines</a>&nbsp;that all users agree to when they use the forums state:&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>21.&nbsp;Thou shall not to start any "Sign petition" threads, or "Poll" threads. Please use the boards to start conversation about ideas or thoughts on Xbox Live or games. Starting a discussion is a much more meaningful way to get get a response from the community.&nbsp;<br /><br /></em>Again, we apologize for the frustration, but we hope this can help clear up any confusion. :)&nbsp;</div>

<p>Recently, after identifying the new pictures and apparently importing them, a window comes up that asks, "Are you sure you want to cancel importing?" There is no easy solution that I have found to close this window. I have to open the task manager and "End
