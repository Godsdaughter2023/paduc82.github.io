<h2>            Your own Shepard action figure &#40;in your likeness&#41;&#58; who wants to get in on this&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>For awhile now I've been thinking how awesome it would be if I could get a custom action figure made of my male Shep and my Fem Shep; I got my male Shep to look a lot like me (I'll admit it...he is trimmer...), and I made a pretty kick-@@@ FemShep that I'm
 proud of.</p>
<p>It bums me out that they only make standard Shepard stuff, though. If you've made a custom shep, I'm betting that you could never identify with the standard Shep, I mean, how could you?</p>
<p>So, does anyone know of a place that makes custom Sheps? If not, who wants to try and get some sort of internet-grassroots campaign going? If we can get thousands of names behind a request to some toy maker (my friend told me that some company does in fact
 make custom figures for WoW, so maybe them?), I think we could do it. If there's a market, they will come.</p>
<p>I've spent dozens&nbsp; - nay, hundreds! - of hours playing BioWare games, and though&nbsp;KOTOR and Jade Empire are&nbsp;near and dear to my heart,&nbsp; no games give you the ability to shape your character and world as much as ME 1 &amp; 2; I would love to have a little nerdy
 keepsake of the characters I've spent so much time with.</p>
<p>So, you guys want to start a campaign? No harm in trying, right?</p>

<p>Oddly enough the reason I've not bought a lot of Mass Effect merchandise is because it features the default Shepard and in all my plays of the two games I've used him once in each title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to get my Shepard's made into an action figure, or even a poster for my wall. The ideal of course would be a custom cover for the game featuring my main female Shepard.</p>

<p>Custom Shepard posters would be cool. The one thing Bioware did do that really got my attention, was the replica DA swords they did, through a third party. Awesome. &nbsp;Havent got one, and its a different game to the one being discussed, but BW merchandise
 nontheless.</p>

    <title>A Salty Rant - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Salty Rant</h2>
                    <p>Let me start this crybaby session&nbsp;by saying that I am not an angel on XBL. I have been prone to trash on enemies and some teammates in game, but the sensitivity of the banhammer system is a bit insane to me. I logged on this evening only to recieve a message saying that I've been comm banned for 1 day (It's actually a few hours longer than that, but I digress). Apparently I have been sending messages that are considered "Bullying." Again, I can agree that I'm an asshat online, but it isn't out of pure hatred and salt. Most of the time, it's simply a joke or a play on the game, though I understand that the whole "It's just a joke, y u haff to be mad" thing is not valid, so let's move on.</p><p><br /></p><p>I think this is a failure to press a point. The last 3 conversations I had (outside of my friends list) were positive, all 3 times of which I had messaged the person that they did well. ("How does your back feel from carrying so hard?", "It's nice to have a good teammate," etc.) I

<p>Thanks for the info, and yes, I know that you agree to terms and codes and such when you make an account, just like every other website and program you choose to join/download. I'm not new to this, though you seem to have a this demeaning attitude. This can only end well.</p>

<p>Yep, there it is. Cool so first thing; yeah I read them. You missed my point entirely. My goal wasn't to say "Oi I did nothing wrong and deserve the world!"&nbsp;It was a critique of the punishment system, though you must have missed that part&nbsp;from the view on your high horse. I'm thoroughly aware of microsoft's code of conduct and Terms of Usage. I&nbsp;was simply saying that I think that the system needs work in the effect of warning players, the punishments given, and the lack of a point to the punishment, as they have no real value.</p>

<p>O rly?&nbsp;You mean I SHOULDN'T break the rules constantly and get comm banned over and over and over again?&nbsp;Who would've thunk it?</p>
<p>Thanks, but no thanks. Maybe stop acting holier than thou and actually be helpful. First step, actually read what's in someones post. Have a good one, man!</p>

    <title>Ruined SD Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ruined SD Card</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 laptop fried my SD card. The card was a SanDisk 8GB microSDHC plugged in through a Kingston MicroSD adaptor. When I formatted the SD card, it showed 126MB of free space instead of the 8GB written on the SD card. It worked fine on a Linux computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought it was just reading it wrong, but when I rebooted my PC it still read 126MB. I tried it in a Nintendo 3DS and got the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do. I need these SD cards for a computer to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same happened to a different 32GB SanDisk MicroSD on the same computer</p>

            Open Disk Management and view the SD card. Hopefully your SD card will show unallocated space. Format that, then remove the partition and extend the 128mb partition to take up the whole card.

            It loaded in safe mode, and&nbsp;I see there is unallocated space, but when I click the&nbsp;existing partition, the "expand volume" button is grayed out. So is the "new volume" option when clicking the unallocated space. It's formatted in NTFS format. I tried reformatting
 it with and without checking "quick format". I also tried restarting Disk Management and rebooting the computer. Any&nbsp;ideas?

<h2>            Computer goes into power save mode and won&#39;t come back on.</h2>
                    <p>My computer, while playing games- like World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, or Borderlands 1or2- randomly goes into power save mode and no matter what buttons I hit it does not come back.&nbsp; I have to hold down the power button to shut it off then turn it back on.&nbsp;
 Why is it doing this and how can I make this stop?&nbsp; It has been happening for about a month now-better date to go by was when Diablo 3 came out.&nbsp; I tried bringing it to Best Buy for the good ol' Geek Squad to look at it but all I got was them tossing numbers
 at me about getting a new graphics card, a new computer and what not.&nbsp; I have had this computer since June 2009.&nbsp; Does anyone know what the problem is?&nbsp;

            Also would like to add, say if I am playing a game and I walk away for a little bit it does the same thing.&nbsp; Browsing the internet or what not does not cause it to do that.&nbsp; If the internet is up or not it just goes into screensaver.&nbsp; It seems to only
 happen-at least so far-when a game is active.

<div>But yesterday it went into the mode and never came back from it. &nbsp;I tried manually restarting the computer and nothing, It is acting like it is in permanent sleep mode-i say sleep mode because the power button like goes into a slow on and off. &nbsp;I have
 tried making power option changes and nothing seems to work. &nbsp;I even tried scanning for viruses-just in case cause you never know-and still nothing. &nbsp;It used to just happen when I played games but it started happening regardless. &nbsp;And as I stated now it just
 won't come on anymore. &nbsp;At first I thought it might be the monitor but after yesterday I see it is not. &nbsp;Usually the buttons on the keyboard can be responsive but not all the time. &nbsp;Sigh, I don't know what to do.</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try to start the computer in safe mode followed by the clean boot to see if any software installed in the computer is conflicting with the system files.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Perform safe mode</span></b></p>
<p><span>Safe mode, starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes</span></p>
<p><b><span>Start your computer in safe mode with Networking</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Step 2: Perform clean boot</span></b></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Article below describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows 7 by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to reset the computer so that

            <p><strong>Can you really upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>In truth, Windows 8 does not support a direct upgrade from Windows Vista. This means you will have do a custom install, which means, any applications or drivers you currently have installed will have to be reinstalled. You might likely need updated drivers
 for some hardware. Windows 8’s built in upgrade compatibility wizard should help you determine what is compatible and needs to be removed before proceeding with the upgrade. Migrating from Vista to Windows 8 will preserve your personal files and settings though.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to reinstall your copy of Microsoft Office and Thunderbird:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I would love some of those too, but either my pc doesnt generate them cause its fine for a short while after a reinstall, or it crashes into a bsod and it doesnt make a .dmp file, or the system files are so corrupted that i cant boot into windows anymore
 to get the .dmp files uploaded and have to reinstall windows, had two ready before the most recent failure that are now in format heaven</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant bake bread if the oven is broken</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on getting it stable enough to actually do some testing? Because the file corruption happens after multiple clean full format all drives installs, are we even looking at drivers at this point or are we looking at hardware, sofar ssd and memory
 report themselves to be fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill have a look tomorrow on another clean install and run the verifier as soon as I get out of the windows setup so that it is the bare bare essentials and hope it'll produce .dmp's and let me upload them before it dies again</p>

            Ssdutility.exe is the OCZ vendor utility to log any errors that may happen due to the ssd, this wasnt installed before when the files where corrupting the first couple of times, i'll remove it but is there any other information to go on as it shouldn't
 be the culprit but more likely a victim of whatever is going on as the problem existed before the program was installed, on a other note no alerts where found on the ssd even during file corruption, there was a firmware update for the ssd that I have installed
 and will continue testing tomorrow to see if that made any difference

            Hi, probably your computer is Waiting for you to say something, like YES for example, if you say and the computer can't&nbsp;understand, it means your microphone&nbsp;is not working, in this case and if your computer is not showing the mouse on screen you need to
 reboot your machine, this way probably the next time you boot the machine the mouse will appear and you can proceed normally.

<h2>            Black screen on Graphical Boot Menu &#91;Dual Boot&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I have somewhat non-standard installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSD1: Windows 10 (1)</li><li>SSD2: Windows 10 (2)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>It was working fine for almost a year. User could select OS via Metro Boot Menu.&nbsp;<br />
Recently one of Windows (1) got Creator Update.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Today graphic boot menu only shows black screen. I can still select what windows to boot using arrows and hitting enter (blindly), so it's kinda working. However it's super inconvenient and I would like to get graphic boot menu back.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have 2 monitors if it's matter. &nbsp;Fast boot is turned off. EascyBCD shows no errors in bootmanager, metro menu is active. Both OS works fine when loaded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions what could cause this and how can I fix it? Is'it boot menu/windows problem or monitor/graphic drivers maybe?</p>
<p>

    <title>My Laptop Is Being Weird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukas seibert  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Laptop Is Being Weird</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the new windows update yesterday. After it was finished I was greeted to the login screen. I logged into my desktop and everything (the icons, folders, etc.) were where I left them. Just some new apps like windows edge and the windows app store
 seemed to be pinned into my taskbar. I quickly tried removing them with a right click, but nothing happend. I began spamming the right click on my mouse (https://www.amazon.com/HV-MS672-Ergonomic-Soothing-Colors-Buttons/dp/B00KKAQYXM) but still the popup slide
 never came. I thought my mouse would be broken but when I tried right clicking on my desktop the white list of options showed up. I then tried to figure out what the heck was happening but only found that all of the pinned apps in my taskbar wouldnt respond
 when I right click, EXCEPT the Windows Logo, The Search Thing, And The Task View. At this point I was VERY confused. My rightclick in my main Browser (Google Chrome) also works just fine. I did try restarting and Ive tried it 3 times but it still wont respond...
 Help me please. I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>

            <p><span>Hi Sylph,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the above description, I understand you are unable to login after installing Anniversary update on the computer. Please reply to a few questions asked below for better understanding and
 further assistance on the issue:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you try logging-in using on-screen keyboard?</span></li><li><span>What happens when you try to login? Do you get any error code or error message?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to non-updated or incompatible keyboard drivers installed on the computer. The issue might also occur due to changed keyboard language on the computer after installing
 the update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Use on-screen keyboard to check if the issue is due to non-updated keyboard drivers or changed
 keyboard language on the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Use on-screen keyboard at the login screen:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on the <strong>
Ease of access</strong> icon located on the bottom right corner of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
on-screen keyboard</strong> option and type the password.</span></li><li><span>After typing, click on the icon located next to the password entry box and check if you have typed the correct password.</span></li><li><span>Press <strong>
Enter </strong>and check if you are able to login into the user profile.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If able to login,
<strong>update</strong> the <strong>keyboard drivers</strong> manually from <strong>
Device manager</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + X </strong>keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>
Keyboards</strong>, right click on the keyboard driver and select <strong>Update this software</strong> from the context menu to update keyboard drivers.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the update to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the update is complete, close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li><li><span>Also check if the keyboard language is set appropriately by navigating to
<strong>Settings</strong> (Press <strong>Windows logo + I</strong> keys on the keyboard) &gt;
<strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Region &amp; language</strong> (from left side panel) &gt;
<strong>Languages</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, check if similar issue persists on booting the computer in
<strong>Safe mode with networking</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select appropriate options to boot the computer into
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong></a><span>.
<strong>Reboot</strong> the computer to exit from <strong>Safe mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>refer to the article on </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe

 is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

                    I am using Windows 10. I have a second monitor for use with my laptop. I connect them using an HDMI cable. I set the second monitor as the main display, because I use that more often. The issue I am having is when I put an application into fullscreen it
 doesn't cover the whole second monitor. It's fine when I have both of the scaling (in Windows settings) set to 125%, but I dislike how large it makes things on my second monitor with that setting. I have the second monitor set at the 100% scaling. Both screens
 are 1080p.

    <title>How to remove arabic from desktop menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deji_o  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove arabic from desktop menu</h2>
                    I recently downloaded some icons for Mozilla Firefox. However, I noticed that once i changed the icon of mozilla to the third party one I downloaded, whenever I right click the desktop and the menu pops up; some options in arabic. It is usually the Graphic
 options &nbsp;(including the drop down menu) and Graphic properties. I installed microsoft safety scanner and ran a full scan but it showed up clean and my Norton has not picked up anything either. The only thing i can think of is to refresh the system but I want
 to avoid that at all costs. Is there anyone who can help me?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to remove desktop icons of Mozilla which get created by its own. So the issue could be if there is some viruses/malware or there is corruption with Mozilla Firefox application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to uninstall the application from the control panel and run safety scanner&nbsp;to check if your system is affected by viruses/malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For uninstalling an application you may refer to the article mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-change-program#uninstall-change-program=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)"><strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong>
</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to run a full scan using
<strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong> (MSS) to make sure that the Computer is virus free.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The
<strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong> is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing
 antivirus software.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:

            Hi gemini-jo,<br />
<br />
Even though you’ve installed the drivers from the Dell for both multimedia audio controller &amp; PCI simple communications controller you’re still facing the problem.<br />
<br />
As a first troubleshooting step, I would suggest you to run the driver installation program in compatibility mode<br />
<br />
Check out the link for the same: <strong>You cannot install a device driver by using its installation program in Windows Vista</strong>
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927524
</a><br />
<br />
If it did not work, then I would suggest you to go through the steps below in finding the right drivers.<br />
<br />
Example for your<strong> PCI simple communications controller</strong> :<br />
Go to device manager by clicking on start and typing devmgmt.msc in the start search bx. Click on the pci simple communications controller, go in property and then go in details.&nbsp; You will see a code like for example PCI/VEN_8086&amp;DEV_27D8&amp;SUBSYS...<br />
The VEN code means vendor and the DEV code means device:<br />
<br />
Search those codes in the following link:<br />
<a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com
</a><br />
<br />
Now, you should get the name of your hardware.&nbsp; From there you can search for a driver download for your hardware.<br />
<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly </strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly
</a><br />
<br />
Post your results back.<br />

<blockquote>I used the cleanup utility to uninstall all versions of .NET Framework.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Did you use the the Windows Uninstaller Cleanup Utility or the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool?<br />
<br />
Did you read <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a>?<br />
<br />
The proper resolution is as follows:<br />
<br />
Step #1 =&gt; Before doing anything else, write down what .NET Framework versions are currently installed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed and whether service packs have been applied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785</a></p>
<p>Step #2 =&gt; Now see <strong>Resolution Method 2</strong> in this related KB article:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a></p>
<p>After running the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool, reinstall all .NET Framework versions (but only the ones you wrote down in #1 above) manually using the download links on the page then run Windows Update manually to install security updates for same.</p>
<p>NB: If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1) using the tool, reinstalling .NET Framework 3.5 will also install .Net Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2; then Windows Update will offer .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1), reinstall your .NET Framework versions in the following order:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. .Net Framework 3.5, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. .Net Framework 1.1, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. .Net Framework 1.1 SP1</strong></p>
<p>NB: KB923100 references this page: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Step #3 =&gt; Check-in at Windows Update and install any critical security updates offered.</p>

            Hi John, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the second command window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume D
<br />
<br />In the second command window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=D
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

<h2>            NAT is Open but can&#39;t join multiplayer games or parties</h2>
                    <p>I haven't been able to join multiplayer games or parties since I was able to change my NAT type to Open. It used to be strict, but I did some port forwarding and utilized my router's DMZ setting for my Xbox and my NAT has been Open since then.</p><p><br /></p><p>If I try to join a multiplayer game in For Honor, it'll connect me to a lobby of players, but right before the game starts, it says everyone has left the session and replaces everyone with AI. In Halo 5: Guardians, I try to join a co-op campaign or a multiplayer match, but it won't even connect me to a game.</p><p><br /></p><p>Everything (Xbox One, modem, mobile phones) except my router uses IPV6, my router is apparently IPV4, so it uses NAT, but since mine is Open, why am I experiencing these problems? Is it because I am using the DMZ on my router? Did I forward ports I wasn't supposed to? Please help!</p>
