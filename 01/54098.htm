The steps I am using are very simple.&nbsp; I am first placing the sd card in the correct slot on my Lenovo computer.&nbsp; When I do this the&nbsp;skydrive program recognizes the sd card and the photos I want to import appear on my computer screen.&nbsp; At this point I click
 on the&nbsp;import prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when I receive the error message.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to import photos from other sources&nbsp;&nbsp;into skydrive, but not from an sd card.&nbsp; The skydrive troubleshooting is of no value in solving this problem.&nbsp; frustrating!!!&nbsp; I was used to
 Windows Media with my old computer.&nbsp; When I went to download Windows Media I received a message that the program was not to be trusted.&nbsp; HELP!

    <title>chkdsk error &#40;stage 4&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            chkdsk error &#40;stage 4&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I was running chkdsk and it just froze at the beginning of Stage 4 (File Verification Stage)</p>
<p>only way to restart Laptop was to remove the battery.</p>

                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Did you schedule your chkdsk to run on the next system reboot or did you run it from Recovery Console?</p>
<p>I prefer to run chkdsk from the Recovery Console so I can watch it run and see the results and decide what to do next based on the results.</p>
<p>Are you troubleshooting some issue or just running chkdsk for practice?</p>
<p>If chkdsk gets to Stage 4 that means the /r or /f switch was used either by checking options in XP or from a manual initiation.</p>
<p>During Stage 4, chkdsk will attempt to read and verify every sector on the volume and remap and mark as bad any problem sectors.</p>
<p>A chkdsk /r can take a long time to finish depending on the speed of your machine, the size of the volume, the number of files on the volume and the number of issues found/corrected.&nbsp; It could run in minutes, it could take hours or it could take days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you run a chkdsk /f, that will take even longer and is accompanied by a special reminder from Microsoft:</p>
<p>A chkdsk may take a long time to complete or it may appear to be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to go
 backwards sometimes.</p>
<p><em>WARNING: When Chkdsk detects problems with the file system and attempts to repair the damage, data loss can occur.&nbsp; Microsoft does not recommend running Chkdsk with the /f command-line switch unless you have a full backup of your hard disk. (paying attention
 to the wornings from Micrsosoft</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't recall in recent memory seeing chkdsk hang forever.&nbsp; It either finishes eventually or complains and aborts.&nbsp; It is a risky to interrupt it during Stage 4 or Stage 5.</p>
<p>If you think it really does hang, you should get the hard drive diagnostics from your hard drive manufacturer and test your drive as it may be failing.&nbsp; If you do not know the manufacturer of your hard drive, you can figure it out.</p>
<p>If chkdsk ran as part of your sytem reboot, the results will be in the Event Viewer, so you may want to look there and see what happened.</p>
<p>When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty from something like a power failure) or you chose to run it yourself, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application
 log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk log and any problems after chkdsk has run.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>First check if there is any yellow bang mark in device manager, if there is any yellow bang mark.</p>
<p>then I recommend you to update the drivers and see if it makes any difference. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance,and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the assword or provide confirmation.
<br />
2. In Device Manager, locate the Device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
3. Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Try to follow the below provided link to Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly and check for the issue.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If there is no yellow bang mark then you may try Uninstalling the driver from device manager and check if it resolves the issue . To do that follow the below provided steps:<br />
i.&nbsp; Click Start, type devmgmt.msc in search box and hit enter.<br />
ii. On the “Device Manager” window, Select the device<br />
iii. Right Click on the device and click uninstall<br />
iv.&nbsp; Restart the computer once the driver is uninstalled,let the system install the generic drivers and check for the issue.</p>
<p>You may also try checking the manufacturer's website and update the drivers.<br />

<p>I'm new to The Elder Scrolls Series. My brother has played since Arena and knows a lot about The Elder Scrools. At first, the game is hard to get into if you only played so many RPGs. The game can a challenge for some. (Like myself) I need some tips and
 tricks though. Tell me what I need to know below.</p>

<p>Personally, i think you should take time to explore. Dont dive straight into the main quest, when i played it for the first time I took my time to get to know the game and explore the world. You'll get into the swing of things soon enough :D</p>
<p>As for specific tips and tricks... go to the waterfront in the imperial city and stay at the inn there.</p>

<p>I good thing to start with is going to the Arena in the Imperial City. You can see different kinds of enemies, and get some spending money for later. Plus, if you become Grand Champion, people like you some more. There is really so much to do in this game.
 And as Payne said, go to the inn at the Waterfront. I hear that they have wonderful entertainment :)

<p>Take everything Azure says with a grain of salt, he's one of the most massive trolls on these forums.</p>
<p>That said, don't take Alchemy, Athletics, Acrobatics, Mercantile, or Speechcraft as a Major Skill and just take the game as it comes. Don't rush and do the main quest, do it very slowly, ideally finishing it by ~level 18-23.</p>
<p>DO NOT GIVE AZURA'S STAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL ASK YOU. GIVE SOME OTHER ARTIFACT TO HIM THAT YOU'LL NEVER USE; AZURA'S STAR IS ONE OF THE BEST ITEMS IN THE GAME.</p>
<p>If you're into older games, give Morrowind a try. It's the third game in the Elder Scrolls series, and is much better from a lore, narrative, and RPG perspective. The landscape is also unique, alien, and beautiful, and people still have massive arguments
 about certain parts of the game's Main Quests on the official forums, to this day.</p>

<p>[/quote]I choose a custom class as a Mage, I recently y joined the Mage's guild and did one of their quests. I do have problem with level up system as this game a SERIOUS patience. I also am working on my Bade skills and others. I was originally going to
 do Morrowind, (My oldest brother still has it and it work on the Xbox 360.) but recommended Oblivion over the simple fact that in Morrowind they don't guide you as much, and it's easy to got to a VERY dangerous place at a low-experienced, low-level character
 and/or player.</p>

<p>The levelling system is one of the few things that Two Worlds has over Oblivion. If you wonder too far in Two Worlds at a low level then you're looking for a cooking! But in Oblivion, the levelling kinda takes away the pleasure of being a strong, high level
 character. The new armour you have access to soon becomes boring and useless.</p>
<p>That said, i've still yet to purchase Two Worlds II, so can't comment on that, but it's certainly true for the former.</p>
<p>With regards to AZURA's STAR. No truer statement has been said. It's an amazing item in the game, and the main quest (stupidly) seems to lead you down the path of sacrificing it. So someone rushing would not think twice, or someone who is not as well travelled
 wouldn't. I certainly fell into the trap on my first playthrough.</p>
<p>Keep it, and use it!</p>

<p>The level scaling in Oblivion takes away from everything. There's no point in leveling up, because it'll only change what the game looks like, more or less, which is the exact
<i>opposite</i> of what leveling up should do. You never have to be wary of where you go or what you do, because if trouble comes, you'll always know that depending on what your level is there's a short list of what kind of trouble you'll be facing and it won't
 too difficult to deal with. And on the rare chance you do fight something challenging, let's face it, as long as you haven't be slacking you can just run backwards, swing your weapon, and cast heal on yourself until it dies. You're stuck fighting enemies that
 are more or less on par with you, <i>forever</i>. You will never be able to scoff at futile attempts to attack you, nor will you ever legitimately fear a particular foe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's the same thing with loot, depending on your level there's a short list of what you'll find. Once you get a full loadout of current level equipment there's no point in doing any more treasure hunting because you already have what you need for the
 time being and the game literally does not let you get anything better than that at your level. There's no sense of wonder or exploration, and that's a big part of what killed the game for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully that changed (somewhat) with FO3, and hopefully the scaling will be more like New Vegas when Skyrim comes out.</p>

    <title>SSD Functions Strangely - 100&#37; hang, read&#47;write ever few - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eradicturtle  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD Functions Strangely - 100&#37; hang, read&#47;write ever few seconds, spikes to 30&#37; &#124; Caused by Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Samsung 850 Evo 120GB back in the spring, and it initially had some problems but it seemed as if they were resolved. The first problem I had with the drive was its tendency to hang at 100%, with no actual reads or writes being performed. I sent
 the entire machine in for a diagnostic, but no problems were detected. The SSD was replaced with a new one, same kind and size, and the problem happened a few more times but then never happened again. Recently, the drive has decided to return to siting at
 100% while actually doing nothing. It only happens for 20-45 seconds, but can become very annoying. The drive does seem to calm down after quite some time, but it still seems rather peculiar, because if it was trying to load something such as the operating
 system, wouldn't it be something more consistent than a small amount of data being loaded every few seconds?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I have found that the SSD seems to randomly read/write small amounts of data in a 3 or 4 second interval, even when there isn't anything being loaded or run on the PC besides the operating system. Haven't had this kind of experience with HDDs
 at all, so I figured it was a little strange. Maybe some kind of page file or something along those lines? (Since this began I have moved the page file to my HDD and off of the SSD but to no effect). Upon looking at the system event log, I noticed that the
 system was trying to issue a reset to the SATA port that the drive is connected to, possibly bad SATA port or something?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Nilay Rupera,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When your laptop battery is no longer working normally, there’s a chance that the battery itself or your motherboard has a static charge. In order to make it work normally again, you will need to discharge it. To do this, follow these workarounds:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1 - Discharge your battery:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Shutdown your computer.</span></li><li><span>Remove your laptop batter temporarily.</span></li><li><span>While it was removed, press the power button for 15 seconds to drain it.</span></li><li><span>Re-attach the battery again and start your computer.</span></li><li><span>Once started, press <strong><span>Windows + X</span></strong> and click
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand the <strong><span>Batteries</span></strong> category.</span></li><li><span>Uninstall the <strong><span>Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Go to the menu and click <strong><span>Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Wait for <strong><span>Windows</span></strong> to scan your computer for available resources for this hardware.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer.</span></li><li><span>Check if your battery is now charging.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #2 </span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">-
</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Update your BIOS and chipset drivers.
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can check </span><span>your computer manufacturer’s official website and look for the section that is related to driver downloads.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #3 – Replace the laptop battery.</span></strong><span> We would like to know if you have a spare battery for your laptop. If yes, can you test if the issue will still happen to the other battery? If the issue will
 still persist, it means that your laptop is now depending on the AC power adapter and it is now caused by a motherboard issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #4 – Contact your computer manufacturer.</span></strong><span> If you still experiencing this issue after performing the steps above, you may need to request for a service warranty from your computer manufacturer
 (which is <strong>Dell</strong>). They will help you repair your computer for both hardware and software issues or best, replace the battery or the motherboard itself. Visit their support website directly to find their contact details for on-site repair services.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

<h3> madridsevi  say:</h3>
<h2>            skype notifications interrupt windows media player playback momentarily.</h2>
                    
<p>Recently i got my Dell 17r with windows 7. so the computer is brand new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When running playback in Windows media player, it pauses for a second or so when i recieve skype notifications. Other media players EG VLC and real player do not have this problem, so I have narrowed it down to Windows player itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is pretty annoying, Would appreciate any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Microsoft , im typing everything correctly had a wifi adapter plugged in but have since removed it.</p>
<p>I dont believe it matters if my Microsoft password is correct, the computer has no internet to verify it.</p>
<p>I had a digit pin locking it but for some reason, it doesnt work either.</p>
<p>My fear is that the computer was hacked and remotely changed because i cant think of any other explanation.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am having very much the same problem as KeyBristol. I have been locked out of my own account even when the passwords is correct. I have even logged in on my microsoft account from another computer and changed the password, but it still doesn't work! I
 have checked that the internet connection is working, and I see the microsoft account confirming that with tracking of my laptop location, and stating it's online. I have checked that I have the correct keyboard set and capslock is not on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I desperately need to access my computer as it has caused a world of trouble at work, as well as having all my personal irreplaceable data!</p>
<p>I think this is unacceptable, as I didn't want to upgrade to Windows 10 in the first place, and I didn't want to use a windows login, all forced upon me, and now windows has locked me out of my own computer!</p>
<p>I understand this is not your problem, or your fault as a tech support but this is ridiculous!</p>
<p>All the solutions I have seen so far online involve either using a Windows 10 reboot disk or using a third party software. If those are the only ways, will it delete my personal data??</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated, I have sent 2 mails to Microsoft support already and they have just passed the buck to here. Please help, It's been a week already and I need this fixed yesterday. (Sorry for the rant).<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            I just told you that the internet on it does not work. Why would you sit there and suggest to me a solution regarding the internet. It has for some reason been disabled and i have no way of enabling it from the lockscreen. i have tried bit the option seems
 to have been removed. If you are unable to actually assist me, i will just go get a mac or some other software other than Windows. Your help has been entirely uhelpful and im pretty apalled at the robot response from you.

    <title>3D Blu-ray playback on Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            3D Blu-ray playback on Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Book 2 13" 1TB model and according to the spec sheets it is Intel InTru 3D capable via the Intel Graphics HD 620 GPU, which means "technically" it is capable of playing 3D Blu-rays using the frame-packed method. Unfortunately I cannot get
 it to work.<br />
<br />
Up until now I have been using a desktop computer with a GTX 980 connected to a BenQ W1350 projector with PowerDVD 14 and when playing a 3D Blu-ray the projector would kick into 3D mode automatically. Stereoscopic 3D was selected in both the nVidia drivers
 and in PowerDVD 14.<br />
<br />
When connecting the Surface Book 2 to the projector via the official Microsoft USB-C to HDMI converter I just can't get it to work. PowerDVD 14 fails to detect that it is connected to a 3D capable display despite that fact that I go into Display&nbsp; Settings in
 windows and select 3D in the options. I have been converting a couple of 3D Blu-ray discs to ISO's in order to play them on the Surface.<br />
<br />
Anyone tried this or have any ideas? Please no generic responses from anyone who hasn't tried. Sorry for mentioning that but all too often I have seen generic responses that have no relation to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Windows explorer in Windows 10 not loading up&#59; finally shows a BSoD</h2>
                    <p>Hello, After I login to windows 10, windows explorer doesn't load. In fact nothing does. Moving the mouse even a little, makes the 'loading wheel' to start rolling. This most probably happened after recent restart after automatic OTA windows 10 update. It
 finally shows a BSoD. BSoD errors are varying.<br />
e.g. Stop code :&nbsp;<span>kmode exception not handled, IRQL not less or equal</span>, etc.<br />
After many failed attempts, I could somehow use task manager to run regedit.exe as admin, only to see that the winNT&gt;winlogon&gt;shell value was already set to explorer.exe. Task manager cpu shows 100% usage. Just like regedit.exe, later I also ran explorer.exe
 from task manager, to no avail as it too went to BSoD after showing error pop-up:&nbsp;<span>Server execution failed.&nbsp;</span><br />
Later, after doing a restart while pressing F2 key, in advanced troubleshooting options&gt; system restore, initially, didn't show any system restore points, as it said '<span>You need to login with administrator privilege</span>'.<br />
Later trying again, restore point worked. So, after I unlocked my bitlocker protected harddrives with recovery codes from Microsoft.com, it showed 2 restore points but restore failed with '<span>the parameter is incorrect</span>' error for both of them; still
 later, it now shows only one restore point but fails with same error too.<br />
Earlier SFC.exe run using command prompt, was done 100%, but it too errored out with:&nbsp;<span>windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation</span>.<br />
Yet earlier, Safe mode with networking showed Windows 10&nbsp;<span>Build 17134.rs4_release.180410-1804</span><br />
Here in Safe mode too, It was no use trying to use system restore.<br />
I can provide the photos for each of these errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Advanced troubleshooting reboot into command line starts (after asking bitlocker key) as X:/Windows i.e. Boot drive. C: drive is something else. On the boot drive, dir command listing hidden files didn't find memory.dmp file. Repair command too isn't recognised
 as internal or external one. Could this be bitlocker issue? Thanks for looking into this..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have these details, if it's relevant:<br />
Its Lenovo ideapad z580<br />
BIOS VERSION: 5FCN34WW<br />
CPU: i7-3612QM 2.10 ghz<br />
RAM: 16 gb<br />
Windows 10 Build 17134.rs4_release.180410-1804<br />
1 tb HDD is bitlocker protected.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Troubleshooting command mode did not help either:&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>X:/Windows &gt; dir -s -h -r /s /d *.dmp did not return anything</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>At this point I'm not sure what can be done, I just don't yet want to reset windows, lest I lose all my apps and settings. Please guide.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode  
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Skype and Outlook problems</h2>
                    I can't get my outlook and Skype to sync. &nbsp;My outlook is through my school district Office 365 account and Skype keeps me wanting to use my Microsoft account which is different. &nbsp;Is there a way to merge the two so I can have permissions to use the Calendar
 Meeting function using Skype. &nbsp;Really great idea but has become very frustrating. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi rmorwick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not feasible to merge Outlook and <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype</a>. Office 365 has own IM and online meeting services named <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business</a>. If you organization has granted you access to Skype for Business services, you can integrate Outlook calendar and Skype for Business. You can follow the article below to start using Skype for Business:</p>

<p>With any luck, your store folder where all your messages and calendars and stuff are kept will have been retained inside the folder called C:\windows.old. I can't remember the precise details (it's four years since most users upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows
 10!), but I think you're looking for a folder called<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Windows.old\Users\</strong>{your‑Windows‑7‑username}\<strong>AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If it's there, <span>make sure that Windows Live Mail isn't running and then copy the folder</span> to the folder called
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Windows\Users\</strong><span>{your‑Windows‑10‑username}\</span><strong>AppData\Local\Microsoft<br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're told that the folder already exists, select <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Windows Live Mail and see what happens. Don't try and do anything until the program has settled down - you may see
<em>Not responding </em>in the title bar, but it should soon go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Remember that the Windows.old folder will soon be emptied; you may have only 10 days from the date you upgraded to complete this task.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the store folder isn't present in Windows.old, I'm afraid you'll just have to import messages from your backup.</p>
