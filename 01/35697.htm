    <title>File thumbnails not displaying properly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File thumbnails not displaying properly&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My question is specific to video files by extensions of: .avi , .mp4 , .mkv , .flv</p>
<p>On my desktop, I have 1 .avi file. It displays a thumbnail of a still image from the movie. Yet many of my other .avi or other video files do not display a thumbnail of a still image. Can someone tell me why that is, and if possible, how to fix this so that
 all my video files show a thumbnail of a still image of the file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The prior poster provided some good suggestions - see if they work before you proceed with this one.</p>
<p>Also, if you have more that one user on your computer, check out the other user accounts to see if they have the same problem.&nbsp; If the problem only exists on your account, it may be corrupt.&nbsp;<span>To
 fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>If you suspect a virus infection (and that's always possible), I suggest after running a full scan with your own program then download and try Malwarebytss:<span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 see if that picks up and deletes anything different.</span></p>
<p><span>After that, here's a suggestion compliments of PA Bear MS MVP:</span></p>

<p><span><span><em>Otherwise...</em></span></span></p>

            I'd offer 3 suggestions. They are suggestions ONLY.<br />
If you agree to try them, do so in the order they are listed. If one works, stop doing the rest of the list.<br />
<br />
1. Do a full virus scan. Your machine might have caught something.<br />
<br />
2. Do a system file check ( sfc /scannow )<br />
<div>&nbsp;Start button &gt; search box&nbsp; type&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> cmd</strong>&nbsp; &gt; look up, RIGHT click on<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>cmd.exe</strong></span> &gt; click<strong>Run As Administrator</strong> &gt; in that black and white cmd window,
 type at the flashing prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp; &gt; press<strong>ENTER</strong> key.<br />
Note : there is a <strong>Space</strong> between "sfc" and "/".<br />
Sit back and wait. It will take some time.<br />
When done, exit cmd window.<br />
Reboot ( re-start your computer )</div>
<div><br />
<br />
3. Do a disk check ( chkdsk /f/r )<br />
Start button &gt; search box, type&nbsp;&nbsp; cmd&nbsp; &gt; look up, right click on<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">cmd.exe</span></strong>&gt; click Run As Administrator &gt;<br />
<div><span>in the black and white window, at the flasing prompt, type&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>chkdsk /f/r</strong>&nbsp; &gt; press Enter key.<br />
Note : there is a <strong>space</strong> between " chkdsk " and " / "</span></div>
<div><span>The screen will say something like can't do it now but do you want to run it on restart. Click " y " as in yes &gt; press Enter &gt; Exit cmd window.<br />
&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Restart your computer. It will take quite some time. DO NOT shut down the machine. Just wait.<br />
<br />

            Hi Russ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Printer Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

 to the driver from the Canon website.&nbsp; I've gone thru Device Manager and only found the MF3240 under Imaging Devices, which was the scanning program.&nbsp; The trouble shooter program found no issues.&nbsp; I also went to Setting, Devices, Devices and Printers, Add
 a Printer, and it took me to a website of how to do what I just did.&nbsp; While in Devices I also tried to Add Bluetooth or other device, and selected Everything Else.&nbsp; The only icon showing was the MF3240 but it was for the scanning capability.&nbsp; I still have
 the old CDs for the printer but they won't work since their programming was for Window 2003 or earlier.&nbsp; Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and I appreciate your patience.&nbsp; I followed your directions to the nth degree including trying to run the program in compatibility mode.&nbsp; It appears the driver loaded, and when I went to Settings, under Other Devices I saw the Canon
 icon.&nbsp; When I double clicked on it, the only option was to remove it (I didn't).&nbsp; Then I selected&nbsp;"Add Bluetooth or other Device" and selected "Add a Device" and then I selected "Bluetooth" "Wireless Display..." and "Everything Else".&nbsp; None of these discovered
 a Canon device.&nbsp; Then I went to Devices and Printers and tried to "Add a Printer."&nbsp; &nbsp;Since no printers showed up, I selected "The printer that I want isn't listed."&nbsp; Then I selected each of the options from "My printer is a little older. Help me find it" to
 "Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings" and again no Canon or Canon MF3240 was found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also searched for Device Manager.&nbsp; I found Software devices and two MF3240 items:&nbsp; Canon MF3240 and Canon MF3240(Fax).&nbsp; The Canon MF3240 was for the Scanner program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have more suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp; Russ.</p>

<p>For those out there with this same problem, I ensured the Canon printer was NOT on Energy Saver mode, that "Copy" was lit, I then pressed the STOP button for 10 seconds.&nbsp; Unplugged my printer from the computer, waited 10 seconds, plugged it back in and got
 a note that a driver was trying to install.&nbsp; I looked under Settings, Devices, Devices and Printers and had what looked like a copy of my driver.&nbsp; I selected it as the primary, and voila, my printer now works.&nbsp; You may need to unplug your printer from the
 computer first, and then follow the sequences I listed.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; I like my MF3240 printer again.&nbsp; For those with scanner issues, search for Windows Fax and Scan in your search box on your computer (not on the internet).&nbsp; Once you get to Window Fax and Scan
 Desktop Application, you can create a shortcut on your desktop.</p>

<p>Hi Elizabeth,<br />
<br />
It is possible that the game is corrupted or incompatible with your current Windows version. To properly isolate this issue, kindly verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you encounter any error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done to isolate the issue?</li><li>Which Windows 10 version/build is currently installed on your computer? To check, type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search bar.<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>In addition, we recommend using the program compatibility troubleshooter by checking the article below:<br />
<br />

We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Microsoft has no way of knowing whether your game will play on Windows 10, because they didn't write it. Ubisoft wrote the game. If Ubisoft&nbsp;doesn't know - which I don't believe - ask other people in the

<p>Another very foward thinking person gave me some tips on the Compatibility Mode and how to install or check the (reverese) compatibily of any software. THAT was the kind of help I was looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not always a matter of black or white, yes or no... sometimes you can go around the problem to find an answer. It may only be an 80% solution but its not a 100% failure. Not trying is a epic failure. Thanks anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good for you. I don't do 80% solutions. Been there, done that, paid the price. If 80% works for you, go for it.</p>

<p>You've told us nothing about your computer so you can't get a definitive answer. The computer could be infected, you could have a Norton product installed, etc. Here is some general information about troubleshooting System Restore. If that doesn't help,
 please post back with the missing information per the links at the end of this reply.</p>
<p>First see this from <span>Bert Kinney: <a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://bertk.mvps.org</a> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Repair System Restore</span> - The command-line parameter is case sensitive:<br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows XP CD<br />
2. Click [Start] [Run]<br />
3. Type&nbsp; the following command and press Enter "rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection C:\Windows\Inf\sr.inf" [Case Sensitive]<br />
<br />
System Restore core files should be reinstalled. Alternately, you may also open Windows Explorer, navigate to "C:\Windows\Inf" folder and right-click sr.inf (choose Install) (sr.inf shows up as sr in windows explorer).<br />
<br />
<span>System Restore disabled, probably by malware:</span> <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore<br />
In the right-pane, delete the value "DisableConfig".</span></p>
<p><span><span>The System Restore Utility May Be Suspended on a System Drive Even Though There Is Enough Disk Space</span> -<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=299904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=299904</a></span></p>
<p><strong>The First Question Of Troubleshooting:</strong> If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
<strong>The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting:</strong> what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

    <title>Xbox One Controller Desync issues... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webn ragnarok  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller Desync issues...</h2>
                    
<p>For the last month or two, I've been having issues where my Xbox One controller will become completely unresponsive, or have slow responses. I used to think the issue was with Killer Instinct, as the game has its fair share of bugs, however, lately even
 when I'm in the menu, the controller can become unresponsive. I've already purchased a new controller and that didn't resolve the issue. As the issue is now happening in other areas besides KI online multiplayer, I know it isn't with KI. I've already performed
 a soft and hard boot and the issue will get cleared up for a day or so, but then it will come back again.</p>
<p>Should I try a full restore next? I hate to lose much of my content (although my purchases and such would still be saved as it's tied to my account, not the console), but I think this might be my next step, other than calling MS and have them replace the
 console itself.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Ragnarok &amp; Royal, I'm sorry to hear you're having that problem. I've experienced similar issues when playing other games. Typically, I have chalked the slow responsiveness to the console loading / thinking / completing other tasks.</p>
<p>If the unresponsiveness is occurring during actual game play as opposed to while titles or options are loading this sounds normal. If however the latency is happening during actual game play and it is effecting your ability to play, then I would investigate
 further via technical support.</p>

<p>It happens when I play games watch films all time. This is a £500 console I worked hard for my wages to buy a console that is half finished ? Are you telling me it's okay for it to un sync and have problems in menus ? This is supposed to be new gen console
 I did not buy it on the pretence it would be laugh throughout all it's used,</p>
<p>Controller de syncing constantly, taking me in and out of gameplay xbox not recognising disks blu rays and games. This Is not acceptable

<h2>            V1 Console &#40;Xbox live 4 lettered gamertags&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am sorry to say this but basically I am not going to use a boring xbox live gamertag anymore.</p>

<p>I have tried using a 5 lettered gamertag as a minimum, Not found one I like in the slightest.</p>

<p>Please could you let me know if the following V1 Gamertags have been reset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spook </li><li>Soul </li><li>Gold </li><li>Joke </li></ul>

<div>My email adress is <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></div>

<div>Also I have a good idea for this, Why don't xbox live just completely reset everyone's gamertags so when they sign in it asks for a new gamertag?</div>

<div>It would make everything a whole lot easier it will do the following:</div>

<div>
<ul>
<li>Support chat for gamertags would reduce by a whole lot </li><li>People would actually be happy with their gamertag </li><li>Less inactive people meaning servers could possibly run quicker? </li></ul>
</div>
<div>This is a very good idea, for those who would like this to happen comment this for it to happen!:

<p>No one here can tell you if a gamertag is in use or not.</p>
<p>Resting everyones gamertag is a terrible idea,most people are happy with their gamertag so why should thay loose it?</p>
<p>It certainly will not do any of the reasons you posted.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 profiles and startup takes forever - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josealbornoz1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 profiles and startup takes forever</h2>
                    So after installing Adobe Illustrator on my laptop, I started having issues with the slowness of my computer. When I hovered over the taskbar, it showed the loading symbol on my cursor. I chose to restart the laptop, and now it takes like 10 minutes to
 load the profile selection screen, 10 more minutes to load the profiles and after selecting my profile, it just loads for a really long time, and then cancels the loading process to go back to the profile selection screen. Any help would be much appreciated!

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Disable Fast Startup
<br />The first quick and easy fix to solve this problem is to disable Fast Startup of your Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Fast Startup is a default enabled feature in Windows 10. It is supposed to reduce startup time by pre-loading some boot information before your PC shuts off.  It works in a similar manner as Hibernation. But in fact, as many users reported, it’s been causing issues.
<br />
<br />1) Type power option in the search box from Start, then click Power &amp; Sleep settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2) Click Choose what the power button does.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3) Click Change settings that are currently unavailable.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />4) Untick Turn on fast startup (recommended). Then Click Save Changes.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />5) Reboot your Windows 10 and check to see if it boots quickly.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Disable Processes with High Startup Impact 
<br />
<br />Some unnecessary processes with high startup impact can cause slow boot in Windows 10. You can those processes to fix your problem. 
<br />Note: Except for the crucial security software.
<br />
<br />1) On your keyboard, press Shift + Ctrl +Esc keys at the same time to open Task Manager.
<br />
<br />2) Click Startup and find out the unnecessary processes with high startup impact.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3) Right-click on the Process needs to be disabled. Then click Disable and close the window.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />4) Reboot your Windows 10 and check to see if it boots quickly.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />
<br />Engr. Jamshed Muhammad

    <title>Does the Xbox One S actually upscale regular Blu-Rays&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does the Xbox One S actually upscale regular Blu-Rays&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused by this and I've heard conflicting reports.</p>
<p>But, does the X1 S actually upscale regular Blu-Ray films to 4K?</p>
<p>When I play games on my S, the tv lists the ouput as "4K." &nbsp;so, I'm assuming that means the games are being upscaled to 4K.</p>
<p>However, when I play a regular Blu-Ray film on my S, the tv lists the output as "1080p." &nbsp;so, I'm assuming that means regular Blu-Rays are NOT being upscaled to 4K?</p>
<p>I've seen other people online comment that the S no long actually upscales regular Blu-Rays to 4K. &nbsp;It used to but not anymore.</p>
<p>the official support page for the S says that it is supposed to upscale "everything" if the console is set to "4K UHD" in the settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my console on that 4K UHD setting, but it doesn't seem to be upscaling my regular Blu-Rays.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this issue? &nbsp;I'd appreciate your help and comments.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have not tried a standard blu ray on my xbox one s... I'll have to try it. I had that happen with a 4k blu ray, but it only happened on a certain hdmi input. Changed it to a different input and it output 2160p. I doubt that's the problem, but you could
 always give it a shot. That's kinda garbage if they don't upscale.</p>

<p>Knight, Blu-Ray disc's are by default HD only (1920x1080 59.94i) at 16:9 aspect ratio where 4k resolution is considered Ultra-High Definition (3840×2160 60p) at 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;The "upscaling" you're referring to is where it increases some quality like sharpness
 and sound but you can't take a media format that maxes out at 1920x1080 and double it. &nbsp;That would be like trying to take a beat up record from the 60's and match that quality to that of a CD's digital sound from today's artists. &nbsp;I'd grab a U-HD Blu-Ray and
 give it a spin... At least then you'll be getting what you paid for in that console and TV.</p>
<p>If you want some further info on Blu-ray HD vs. Blu-Ray U-HD check out the link below:</p>

<p>completely close the Mail App. </p>
<p>Disconnect from the internet</p>

<p>go to account settings it should then let you open the account settings for gmail and let you remove it.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Bill,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, subscriptions are set to renew on accounts on the date when it was purchased but the charge is taken three days in advance by our system from the payment method linked to it to avoid disruption of the service. There is no option to pay in advance
 aside from the automatic charge by our system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to change the payment method connected to your recurring subscription, you can follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the Manage features section of your <a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account</a>, click <strong>Skype Number</strong> subscription.</li><li>Under your Skype Number, click <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Change payment method</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If your Skype Number expires, don't worry as it will be reserved for your account for 90 days.&nbsp;To reactivate your Skype Number:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in to your account</a>.</li><li>In the Manage features section, click <strong>Skype Number.</strong></li><li>Click Reactivate Settings next to the number you’d like to reactivate, then follow the instructions.<br />

            <p>Green screen capability really requires at least two video tracks (one for the green screen and one for the replacement background). It also requires a chroma-key effect that can turn the green areas of the video transparent so the replacement background
 appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movie Maker has only ever allowed for a single video track and hence has no green screen capability despite years of requests for more than one track (to allow picture-in-picture, picture and video overlays, compositing, green screen, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have been able to "trick" the older version of <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a> into doing green screen as a <a href="http://goo.gl/jLyuG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
custom transition</a> but that's pretty tricky to accomplish and requires some clean-up afterward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have access to iMovie on a Mac, that has green screen capabilities. Another relatively inexpensive option is Nero Video 2016 which has multiple video tracks and can do green screening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A free option is to use DaVinci Resolve Lite (free) which has this capability. Another one I can think of is Hit Film Express 3.0 (free).</p>

<p>Sorry, but phone and chat are the only ways to contact the billing department. They are the only ones who can fix the issue. Try checking your account information at
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> to make sure it has your correct information to fill in the chat areas. If not, you'll need to contact support by phone. 1-800-4my-xbox if you're in the US/Canada. If not, what region
 are you in and I can get you the number?</p>

<p>Access to chat support may not help you Max. I spent my entire morning on chat where they had me reset the Mac address and reset the console, then at the last when nothing seemed to be working the tech asked me to try again and logged off while I was trying
 it out. This was the most underhanded thing I could imagine and leaves me right where I started.</p>

<p>@OckishBuhl. &nbsp;Thanks for your answer!</p>
<p>Why they amke you reset the Mac and console? </p>
<p>I just want my money back... They bill me twice for a game...</p>
<p>I can´t understand, &nbsp;only two clicks and you can buy a game. Now for refund (because Microsoft mistake) I have to spend hours trying they return my money, also the support system seems is not working properly? this is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Hi there maxtol777,</p>
<p>Was the purchase done via credit/debit card tied to your account? If so, are they both showing as pending, or solid charges. If they are showing as pending, one will drop off in a few days while the other will be applied to the card.</p>
<p>If they are both solid charges applied to your account you can call either +54 (11) 5354-0358 or 0800-266-0509 Monday – Sunday: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/</span></a><br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

The CD drive or the DVD drive does not work as expected on a computer that you upgraded<br />
to Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</span></a><br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Wi-Fi networks not showing up after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivdz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-Fi networks not showing up after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My Acer laptop started to lose connection to Wi-Fi after a Windows 10 update I had (no idea which, it started to cause issues before the Fall Creators Update). My Network Adapter Driver is&nbsp;Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapter. I updated it manually
 to version&nbsp;10.0.0.355 in hopes of fixing the issue and it only solved it for a day before the Wi-Fi connections disappeared again. I even tried to uninstall it and allow Windows to automatically reinstall it but to no avail. Also for some reason Windows was
 only able to reinstall it up to version 3.0.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, I can't connect to Wi-Fi, I tried several things I've read on Windows Support and none of it worked. Has anyone been experiencing a similar issue and found a solution?</p>

            Power down the computer.
<br />Unplug it, wait 20 minutes.
<br />
<br />Plug it in again, startup then try connecting the Wi-Fi network.
<br />
<br />You should also try performing a Network Reset and BIOS reset:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.

<p>I restarted the network like you said and it showed all Wi-Fi connections again. However after closing the computer for an hour they all disappeared again so it did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the BIOS I did not try it yet, I was hoping you could explain what this has to do with my network connection before I attempt a reset since I never did this before and I don't want to mess something up.</p>

            You have one of a few options to consider here:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Backup and perform a clean install - you have exhausted everything thats reasonably possible. Sometimes, your system has some unknown underlying issue that creates a blocker for upgrades. Save yourself: time, frustration and just perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Yes, its a chore, but this man made stuff and it ain't perfect and it will never be. 
<br />
<br />Its better for you to have your data and go through the annoying convenience of reinstalling apps and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Backup:

<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Don't both with the upgrade.
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives.

<br />
<br />Option 3: upgrade to another release such as Windows 10 1703 
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<h2>            DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE -- 0x0000009f -- ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I wake up my PC from sleep, it does one of the following things:</p>
<p>- the monitor LED will keep going on/off as if there is no signal.&nbsp; The PC will then reboot after a minute or two</p>
<p>- sometimes the login background appears, but the login accounts do not appear.&nbsp; Num lock button does not work (no keyboard function)</p>
<p>- sometimes there is just a BSOD, as per the above</p>
<p>
</p><p>BlueScreenView indicates it is ntoskrnl.exe, but I believe this is misleading me.&nbsp; Based on these forums, the issue is likely to be a driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have taken the following steps amongst others, but none have worked:</span></p>
<p><span>- Swapped out hardware (Video Card, RAM, PS)</span></p>
<p><span>- Updated BIOS and SSD firmware&nbsp;</span><span>to latest versions</span></p>
<p><span>- Checked device drivers are up to date</span></p>
<p><span>- Disabled power Management on all devices in Device Manager</span></p>
<p><span>- Ran SFC and DISM checks</span></p>
<p><span>- Performed full A/V scan</span></p>
<p><span>- Performed chkdsk on hard drive, but OS is on a SSD</span><br />
</p>
<p>My memory dump file can be downloaded from&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?id=528A0A2662D2D0E3%21556&amp;cid=528A0A2662D2D0E3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?id=528A0A2662D2D0E3%21556&amp;cid=528A0A2662D2D0E3</a><br />

<p>Can anyone help me isolate what is causing this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

            Hi knealewj
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates your Nvidia graphics card device driver as the cause of your system crashes . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<div>Thank you so much for your help.&nbsp; However, this is still a little perplexing to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I originally had a 4 year old graphics card installed.&nbsp; I updated this to the latest Nvidia driver, but the same issue was still occurring.&nbsp; I then installed a new Nvidia GT710 graphics card, and Win10 found some Nvidia drivers for it.&nbsp; Still the error
 persisted.&nbsp; I have now gone to the Nvidia website and found some updated drivers for the GT710 card (dated 20th Feb 2019)... but same issue.<br />
<div>
<p>
</p><p>So 2 graphics cards, with 2 different drivers, but same issue!&nbsp; Is there an old driver that is stuck in the system somewhere that is causing this issue to persist?&nbsp; Or do I have other hardware that is faulty (motherboard)?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for that information.&nbsp; In addition to the initial efforts, I have now focussed on the graphics side of things.&nbsp; The steps taken so far include:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disabled all Power Management on devices in Device Manager</p>
<p>- Disabled Link State Power Management</p>
<p>- Installed latest Nvidia graphics driver</p>
<p>- Uninstalled all Nvidia applications except driver</p>
<p>- Disabled Nvidia Services</p>
<div>- Uninstalled old AMD Catalyst drivers and software from previous graphics card<br />
<p>- Enabled hidden devices in Device Manager and made sure there was no other legacy graphics devices<br />
- Ran MalwareBytes scan.&nbsp; Nothing of significance was found, just a handful of PUPs that were unrelated... quarantined anyway<br />
</p>
<p>Despite testing each of these extra steps, the issue remains.&nbsp; If the issue was on one graphics card, and all traces of that card have been removed, and a new graphics card with clean driver installed, I would suggest it is not a graphics card issue...&nbsp;
 Do you have any further suggestions?</p>

            The crash is due to Nvidia only. But driver is updated to latest 20-Feb-2019 now. Try removing it by DDU. 
<br />Use DDU to uninstall current graphics driver completely and restart your computer

<p>Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have booted into safe mode and removed both the AMD and NVidia drivers using DDU.</p>
<p>I removed the network cable and used Device Manager to find the drivers from the extracted driver files.</p>
<p>I put the computer to sleep and it still doesn't wake correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again removed the Nvidia drivers</p>
<p>I booted into Windows and used the NVidia utility to install just the drivers.</p>
<p>I put the computer to sleep and it still doesn't wake correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this might be leading us astray.&nbsp; The original graphics card was originally causing these issues.&nbsp; Installing a new graphics card with new drivers is still causing the same issues.&nbsp; So although the minidump files are pointing to the graphics driver,
 I don't think this is the actual issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are your thoughts moving forward?</p>

<h2>            Pen writing with TypeCover attached</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to use the handwriting input even with the TypeCover attached to the surface?</p>
<p>Looking into the settings, I only found the options "when the keyboard isn't attached" and "only in tablet mode" for the action "when I tap a text field with my pen, use handwriting to input text", but not an option like "always".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there isn't an option to enable this, could someone tell me why? I don't always want to remove my TypeCover to use handwriting.</p>

<p>Hi RC1262Scorch,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, we don't have the option to always enable the "handwriting to input text
<span>settings</span>" on the Surface device. This options are design only if the keyboard is not available. Currently the setting that we have are this two options,</p>
<p>"<strong>When the keyboard isn't attached</strong> and <strong>Only in tablet mode</strong>" we will post an update once available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
        </p>
