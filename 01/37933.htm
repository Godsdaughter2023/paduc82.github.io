<p><span><span>Hi
<span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=2026brewster&amp;referrer=http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/thread/553bb5d3-4b0b-46f1-98df-3ae13268aafd&amp;rh=58SW3iRszMls9ktKURmLQvWJAnzUyIhNlNquTJmCAJ4%3d&amp;sp=forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>2026brewster</span></span></a></span><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would recommend you the below methods:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Boot the computer in safe mode and
</span><span>check if the computer performance has improved.
<span>These options load a minimal set of drivers. You can use these options to start Windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Steps to boot the computer in safe mode environment are</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Restart the computer</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Start tapping F8 key</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>You will get advanced boot option window</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Using the arrow key select the option “Safe mode”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the performance has improved then some third party software might be causing the issue, boot the computer
 in clean boot and check which third party software is causing the problem. </span>
<span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or<span>&nbsp;
</span>click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>then click Disable All.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>vii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>viii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 keeps changing from Public Network to Home Network without prompting</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: My laptop is being connected to a big blue question mark labeled unknown and then to BRCM_ROUTER even though I don't have linksys router&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to add screen captures: </p>
<p>&nbsp; This is what I see: http://screencast.com/t/68kS5iDLtg</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is what I'd like to see permanently: http://www.screencast.com/t/ympyVaC7w</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, first I should let you know that even though I use this laptop that I am contacting you with exclusively at home, I set my network location type as Public so that I am invisible to network discovery (off). I also do not allow file and printer sharing.
 When I noticed the following changes listed below happening, I turned Media Streaming off (had I known it was turned on I would have turned it off earlier, but the event listed below prompted me to look deeper into my security and I found it on.) Anyway, one
 day recently I noticed that my network location type was listed as Home. I only noticed it because I was having internet connectivity issues, even though I was being listed as "connected" and all the bars were lit up showing I had a strong signal. I have no
 idea how long it was like that, I just know that I did not change my network location type to Home. When I clicked "See full map" while I was still under Home, I noticed that on my Network Map it showed this laptop I am using being connected through a green
 line to a big blue question mark listed as "Unknown" and that big blue question mark being connected through another green line to an image of a router that is listed as "BRCM_ROUTER" (instead of "Actiontec" or "Actiontec GT784WN" or even my network name "emna225")
 which in turn is shown as being connected through a green line to an image of the world listed as "Internet". I have since changed my network location type back to Public and have been checking frequently to make certain that it has not changed back to Home.
 Before I first changed from Home back to Public I checked the network map which is when I saw what I described above, hours later when I switched back to Home to see if the question mark was back, I checked my network map and everything looked normal when
 I was under Home. I could see my computer being connected through a dashed green line to an image of a router listed as "emna225" which was connected through a solid green line to a world image listed as "Internet". Every now and then since that first day
 however, when I have intentionally been switching to Home to see if the blue question mark listed as unknown is there on my network map, it has always been present no matter what time of day it is or even if I am home alone. (I have two roommates whom I do
 not know very well, but we do all use the Actiontec, however. The router is set to WPA/WPA2 security but since we share the use of the router they do have the pre-shared key that allows them to connect to the internet via the router. No matter which of my
 roommates (one has iPad and Amazon Kindle Fire, the other uses Acer, Dell, and only Windows-based software) are home or gone I only ever see my laptop being connected to Unknown and that in turn to BRCM_ROUTER when I intentionally switch from Public to Home
 network and then check the network map.) Also, I have noticed that internet connectivity has been very slow even though most of the time this happens all the bars are lit up and I am listed as "connected". Sometimes, as has happened twice as I am typing this
 message to you, the internet connection just stops and in the Network and Sharing Center it shows I am disconnected as it tries to re-establish a connection (it says "Identifying"). My questions for you: [#1] Does this mean that someone (anyone) has hijacked
 my router and/or computer and is able to know/view the personal information I type in such as banking information, and passwords for paypal, ebay, amazon, hotmail, gmail, etc.? [#2] As far as my general internet browsing, is it possible that whatever the unknown
 (?) is, that is connecting to my laptop is monitoring the sites I visit while online like a keylogger program? [#3] Even if I am public and not showing up in the network map because discovery, etc. is off, can the websites I have been visiting and passwords
 I have been typing in even be visible to the possible hacker connecting to my laptop via unknown? I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL, but I enjoy my privacy. I have never knowingly/intentionally allowed remote access/remote desktop to my computer, so this http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-winapps/how-do-i-disconnect-brcm-router/d7d25bba-da12-4de6-a704-ea9f654a1a69
 didn't help. Thank-you for your time and any help you can provide. </p>

<h2>            Net use map drive is working with built-in admin account only</h2>
                    <p>I currently have&nbsp;a windows&nbsp;7 PC that I use <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
net use</span> in cmd file to&nbsp;map drive&nbsp;to Windows server 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works if I use&nbsp;built-in admin account/password but I've tried another account that's in the administrator group&nbsp;on the server and I get errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NET USE X: \\IPADD\c$\inetpub\ftproot&nbsp;password /User:adminuseraccount</p>
<p>NET USE X: \\IPADD\c$\inetpub\ftproot&nbsp;password /User:server\adminuseraccount</p>
<p>
</p><p>After tweaking the net use command a number of ways,&nbsp; the 2 following errors are what I'm getting for the most part:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System error 1219 has occurred.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the</strong><br />

</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System error 5 has occurred.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Access is denied.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at many searches on this but can't get this to work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp; one thing I'm thinking of doing is changing the built-in admin name and password.&nbsp; Is this a safe thing to do?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Maya,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This error message might occur if there are issues with Windows components such as .Net Framework or Microsoft Visual C++ which are required to run the game. Also, compatibility of the game with Windows 8.1 could also be one of the other reasons for
 this issue. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is the issue specific to Rollercoaster Tycoon?</span></li><li><span>Which version of the game are you trying to run on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>As far as compatibility of the game with Windows 8.1 is concerned, some of the versions of this game are not compatible. Refer to the link to get the details:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=RollerCoaster%2BTycoon%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=RollerCoaster%2BTycoon%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might also choose a different v</span><span>ersion of Windows from the drop down menu and check if the game is compatible.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to reinstall .Net Framework and Microsoft Visual C++ and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the methods:</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong><span>Refer to the link to download and install the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package from Microsoft Download center:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40784</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before running it, Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and choose <strong>
Programs and features</strong>. Check if the Microsoft Visual C++ package is listed within the list of installed programs. If yes, right click on it and choose
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Then, locate the setup for the package that you have just downloaded. Double Click on it and follow the onscreen instructions to install the program.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Proceed to the next step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>.Net Framework 4.5.1 is included on Windows 8.1. Let’s turn off and turn on features for .Net Framework version 4.5 as well as version 3.5 from Programs and features to troubleshoot the issue.
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the steps below to Disable and Enable the .NET Framework.</li><li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>W</strong> and type <strong>Windows Features</strong> in the Search Field.</li><li>Select <strong>Turn Windows Features on or off</strong>.</li><li>In the window that opens, uncheck the <strong>.NET Framework 4.5</strong> and select
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Also, uncheck the box for .Net Framework 3.5(if it’s checked). If it’s already unchecked, check the box.
</li><li>Restart the computer.</li><li>To enable it again, follow the steps ‘<strong>a’</strong> and ‘<strong>b’</strong>.</li><li>Check the box for the .NET Framework 4.5 listed there and select <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>To get a detailed description on the steps listed above, refer to the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443(v=vs.110).aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if you receive the same error message. If yes, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the list shows the version that you are trying to run is not compatible, run the game in Windows compatibility mode and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the folder that has the .exe file for the game. Right Click on the setup file and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box which states “<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>”.</li><li>Select the version of Windows on which it worked earlier or it is listed as compatible at compatibility center from the drop down list.</li><li>Click on OK. Double Click on the application file and check if you are able to launch the game.</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows Live Photo Gallery&#58; Are people tags, captions, and descriptive tags maintained when copying&#47;moving photos&#63;</h2>
                    I am wondering if people tags, captions, and description tags are maintained when copying images that have been tagged using Windows Live Photo Gallery.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, if I upload files to Skydrive, then download to another computer, will the tags be maintained as long as I have signed in to Photo Gallery?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I move my files to a new or second computer, will the tags also be maintained in this instance?</div>
<div><br />

            <p><span>Hello Jordan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the above description, I understand keyboard buttons
<strong>f6</strong>, <strong>f7</strong> and <strong>f8</strong> have stopped working which are sound controlling keys.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you facing the above issue on a laptop or desktop keyboard?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any hardware or software changes on the PC?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if other keyboard buttons are working?</span></li><li><span>Did you try updating the keyboard driver?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to some of the hardware components conflicting with the operating system installed on the PC. The above issue may also occur if you have made any recent
 hardware or software changes to the PC which is causing the keyboard to not function normally.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>Run the <strong>
Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check if any of the hardware components is missing or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases will fix the same to enhance the performance of the system.

<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows </strong>logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong> and select the top most search result<strong>.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
View all </strong>from left side panel of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Hardware and Devices, </strong>click on <strong>Advanced </strong>option and check
<strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>Close the window after troubleshooting is completed and check for the status shown on the window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists,
<strong>update</strong> the <strong>keyboard drivers</strong> manually from <strong>
Device manager</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + X </strong>keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>
Keyboards</strong>, right click on the keyboard driver and select <strong>Update this software
</strong>option from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the update to complete.</span></li><li><span>After updating, close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>

<h3> erm8 pistolero  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows Store PC version of Resident Evil 7 has frame rate issues.</h2>
                    <div>
I just bought an Xbox One digital copy of Resident Evil 7 for Xbox Play Anywhere(meaning I can cross buy the game on Windows 10 Store with no extra charge). I just noticed that my Xbox One version of the game performs significantly better in fps when my Gaming
 PC is much more powerful than my Xbox One console and has good enough specs to run RE7 at a smooth frame rate. My PC was able to run Outlast just perfectly fine at at slightly higher than 60fps and that game is nearly at the same graphic and frame rate level
 as RE7<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions on how to fix the frame rate issues of RE7 Windows 10 Store version(for those who have the Xbox Play Anywhere digital version)?</div>

            <p>Outlast, or Outlast 2 ?</p>
<p>The system requirements for Outlast 2 are not as high as for Res 7. Oranges and Apples similarity, actually.</p>
<p>You did not list you system specs, but ....</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Minimum </span></em>requirements :</p>
<p><em>Outlast 2</em> -&nbsp; 1GB VRAM NVIDIA Geforce GTX 260 / ATI Radeaon HD 4xxx&nbsp; - 4GB system RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Res 7 </em>- ( 2GB VRAM)&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD Radeon R7 260x&nbsp;&nbsp; - 8GB system RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- The main reason for lag is too low a frame rate. Too low a frame rate is most often due to
</p>
<p>inadequate hardware for the settings selected by the user in the games setup (assuming the hardware</p>
<p>meets the minimum requirements, which btw still does not always guarantee decent performance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You cannot compare two XBOX games with the PC release of the same games. A lot of games that are
</p>
<p>ported from console to PC are only basic ports that would have similar requirements, but the better
</p>
<p>games have more graphics enhancements for the PC which can ramp up the requirements considerably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Res 7 PC release is barely off the press, and may still have some bugs. Check out some Res7 specific forums</p>
<p>for details of what issues the game may still have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Note that Windows Store is only a retail outlet controlled by MS. Games bought through the Windows Store
</p>
<p>are no different that those on retail disk, or those downloaded from Steam, EA Origin, UPlay or other</p>
<p>game download sites.</p>
<br />
<p>[ EDIT: I just had a look at the Windows Store and see their idea of System Requirements does not</p>
<p>show the necessary hardware requirements.&nbsp; Typical sneaky MS.</p>
<p>It's no wonder so many people are having problems with games they download from the Window Store. ]</p>

            My graphics card is a GeForce GTX 960 with 8GB of RAM and my CPU is an i5 6402p @ 2.80GHz. I'm pretty sure Resident Evil 7 should run fine at 60fps on my PC with those specs.

            <p>Fair enough, the game should run well on a GTX 960, but when your OP does not include the specs we have to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if you can expect 60fps though. The standard&nbsp; GTX960 VRAM configuration is 2GB,
</p>
<p>which it the minimum VRAM requirement for Res 7, and which may come up a bit short if using max settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Similarly, 2.7GHz is the minimum cpu speed.</p>
<p>If your model 960 has 4GB there should be no problems running the game with max or very near max settings.</p>
<p>Depending on how much the game relies on the cpu.</p>
<p>- If you run usage monitors on the cpu and gpu, it will help determine if you are using too high settings.</p>
<p>You can monitor cpu use through Task Manager. GPU-Z&nbsp; will monitor all gpu functions including VRAM use.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GPU-Z Video card GPU Information Utility</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, I don't know what settings you are using, but...</p>
<p>- Try reducing your Anti-aliasing first.&nbsp; AA settings use exponentially higher amounts of VRAM with each</p>
<p>higher level, so simply dropping from 4X &gt; 2X, or using FXAA vs MSAA&nbsp; instead can help a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- V-sync is one option that affects different games differently. V-sync can be somewhat system intensive.</p>
<p>Some games will tend to lag if using V-sync if the frame rate is below 50 fps, and anything below say 70fps</p>
<p>does not generally benefit from using V-sync anyway. </p>
<p>However some games benefit from V-sync even below&nbsp; 50 fps,&nbsp; eg- FC3 has some tearing (on vertical objects</p>
<p>such as power polls ) without V-sync which is removed if V-sync is enabled.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>- I don't know what quirks Res 7 may have, but some games have a single graphics option that can
</p>
<p>significantly reduce frame rates, eg - Saints Row the 3rd has a lighting setting that takes a much bigger hit</p>
<p>on max than the next option down. With this game motion blur increase significantly at fps below 60 as well,</p>
<p>so when tweaking settings keep this sort of thing in mind .</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have not already, do pop in to a Res 7 specific forum. A quick search reveals article headlines such</p>
<p>as ...</p>
<p><em>" <span>Players are reporting crashing, framerate issues, network problems and more. Some of these are a cakewalk,
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>only a few clicks away from a fix."</span></em></p>

    <title>Major issues with KB3000850 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Major issues with KB3000850</h2>
                    <p>Hello support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I installed the KB3000850 update last night and have been dreading it ever since. I am unable to access parts of the desktop as they simply do not launch for e.g my computer, my keyboard lighting no longer works, start-up programs not loading. i am unable
 to system restore as it requires the machine to restart and it just sits on "restarting" for over an hour or until using hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Avast internet security which i have tried numerous times to uninstall as many avast users have reported the issue is semi solved when doing this but it doesn't fully un-install as i am unable to restart the pc without having to hard reset it
 (hold the button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the normal route of sfc /scannow which returns the following message "windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations" I hope this means windows itself is "ok" and this is just a minor bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use a system restore point which was made 10 hours prior to updating to the KB3000850 but i either receive the following message of "Windows is unable to boot" or "something went wrong please use a restore point and pray for the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to uninstall the update through uninstall programs &gt; updates but it gets to 99% and says the task can't be completed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had issues in May with the 355 update when that was rolled out been unable to install it correctly for over a month until it was patched. I simply can't wait 30days of leaving my Pc running 24/7 unless i use hard shutdown option all the time. Is there
 anything i can do with providing logs for MS tech guys in finding and resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a full format is the only option what do i do? My pc was a custom pc which came with a OEM windows 8 key do i contact the system builder to provide me with a cd / flash drive as i never received one just the OEM MS genuine sticker on the side of my corsair
 case. System builder was - www.scan.co.uk&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Spec's are (if it helps in diagnosing issues)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel core i5 3570k</p>
<p>16gb corsair ram</p>
<p>EVGA Nvidia 660TI&nbsp;</p>
<p>256 SSD (used for OS)</p>
<p>1TB HDD for work stuff</p>
<p>Corsair H80i cooler (thank god the software isnt required to load for it to function correctly)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pulling (what's left) of my hair out trying to remove this update as things worked perfectly before and i had been gaming most of the evening until windows update said "updates are ready".... Lesson learned... wait a few days next time for issues to
 be solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we discussed a way to get rid of this update here:</p>
<p>http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2mosdg/anyone_knows_whats_update_for_windows_81_for/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, what worked for me was:</p>
<p>
1) Hard reboot.<br />
2) Invoke Advanced boot options by <span>
hitting F8 immediately after the BIOS screen. If that doesn't work, you can try</span>&nbsp;holding SHIFT and selecting "Restart" on user login screen.<br />
3) In advanced boot options select last System Restore

            <p>Hi Smeyo42,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been following the thread on reddit after googling the Kb number. I will try the Hold shift option and see if it will allow me to do anything but my trouble is it completes the restore then gets stuck "restarting" in an endless loop until i hard reset
 the machine and then that unleash's a bunch of problems of it's own lol. Ah windows update patches.... they do test my patience and sanity lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some insight or anything i can provide MS to find a way to solve this issue</p>

            <p>It seems that this issue is caused by <strong>KB3000850 in combination with Avast Antivirus</strong> - as you already mentioned. That gives you some more possibilities to resolve it. I can think of additional 2 right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hard reboot, try to invoke the blue "Choose an option" screen<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><span>hitting F8 immediately after the BIOS screen, or by&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">holding
 SHIFT and selecting "Restart" on user login screen. Then:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1) Select "Troubleshoot"/"Advanced Options"/"Startup setting" to enable Safe mode and try removing avast in safe mode</li><li>Option 2) Select "Troubleshoot"/"Advanced Options"/"Command Prompt" and try removing avast via command promt</li><li>Oprion 3) [from above] Select "Troubleshoot"/"Advanced Options"/"System Restore" and get rid of the KB3000850 by restoring windows to state before update</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope some of this works for you...<br />

            <p>Yea i was planning on trying these tomorrow as i've lost patience after dealing with this problem for the last 24hrs. Hopefully the more people speak up having this issue will force either MS or avast to correct the issue in the long term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your responses so far Smeyo, i just want the issue resolved in a timely manner instead of a blame game between avast and ms since the responce given by Avast has been zero up until now =/</p>

            <p>@Gav_B11: thanks for pushing MS to look at this riddiculous update.&nbsp; I have experienced the same issue last night and almost wanted to throw the computer out the window considering it took forever to install only to screw up everything.<br />
At one point I was almost certain my hard drive is toast since even opening up System or using Winrar would slow down to snail's pace and the HD light was almost solid.&nbsp; I checked right away in Task Manager and Avast32 process was just hogging the drive.&nbsp; It
 must be some compatibility issue where Avast if fighting against the introduced update changes/features.&nbsp; Or maybe it's something to do with x86 vs x64 architecture. I am running Windows 8.1 x64 Pro with Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote the same msg on Avast's forum just to get the voice heard:</p>

            I spent the last 2 hours with a girl from imcrosoft operating my computer remotely. she just finally told me that she was suspiscious that it is malware but I use advanced systemcare pro daily and I have no malware. She said my only option was to pay $150
 and they would ship me a windows 8 install dvd and give me a 1 year warranty on it, all because I am a user that got their $15 windows 8 promotion when it first came out because they gave it away for $15 to people in a very brief time frame that had bought
 a system with windows 7 on it. all because I do not have that windows 8 key she wants $150. And i do not ever recall getting a key in my email after upgrading all that time ago. so basically she wanted me to pay $150 to fix a problem that microsoft just caused
 with their update<br />

    <title>Surfact RT charger LED flashes once - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sz_zs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surfact RT charger LED flashes once</h2>
                    <p>When I connect my charger to Surface, the LED in the connector blinks once and then goes off immediately again. The tablet is not charging, so by now it is totally flat and when I try to switch it&nbsp;on, I only get a white "flat battery" sign (probably soon
 even that will go). I tried another (same type) charger, and got the same result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I contacted support, but they could not help either. I am in a non-launched country, so the local MS service cannot help either.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also searched the web, but could only find the same error once, in the comments of a post. The solution was there to replace the device.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I asked the support what to do, but they best guess was to take it to a different country and leave it at a service there. If they cannot fix it, I can go back and get a replacement. Needless to say, that is a bit expensive exercise to do. I also asked the
 CSR to check with a supervisor if they could use a courier service, but for three days no reply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone in the community know if I can send back a faulty device to some address? Alternatively does anyone know if some home-fix can be applied?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Don't worry about it. Its a common practice on Microsoft community websites. When they (the
<b>Community Stars</b> et al) don't have the answer they'll just put you in a loop or give you a dangling carrot. I hardly get a useful answer on this community. I have seen many excellent questions and feedback; ideas, issues, bugs etc. on Microsoft community
 about Windows Live (and other products) which never get resolved because there is no way to follow up. At the maximum, they will ask you to attach a file in private section and when you do that, they will never get back to you.. you are supposed to forget
 about it.. <br />
<br />
Like other communities (Stackoverflow etc.), I wonder why can't they just silently transfer the question under other tag with a brief notification, rather than posting such a useless reply, wasting space and making this boring community even more boring?<br />
<br />
Looks like Microsoft have outsourced Microsoft community, MSDN social forums and Microsoft Connect to some third party customer service to copy-paste the ready made replies. You file a legit bug-report about Internet Explorer on MSFT Connect website with steps
 of reproduction, attach files and other details, chances are they will close the issue as non-reproducible. In my observation, hardly 20% of the bug reports get resolved status among which 70% of the times the bug is not actually resolved and making people
 crazy in comments! For how long people will give them feedback in these circumstances?<br />
<br />
So this is Microsoft "caring" about their products (let alone caring about "people").. Or perhaps its just because Windows Live and Internet Explorer are free products..<br />

            <p>Hi Leon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to&nbsp;assist you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long have you been having this problem?</p>
<p>Did you make any changes prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may be fixed by a simple restart of your computer. If the issue persist, I would suggest you to run an SFC scan and check if the system files settings are corrupted which can automatically be fixed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select <strong>Command prompt admin</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” (no quotes), and then press ENTER.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also </span><span>I suggest you to run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available.
</span></p>

Click&nbsp;<strong>command prompt (Run as administrator)</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>&nbsp;key after each command:

<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help. Something even weirder happened the day after I posted my above question.&nbsp; Not long after I posted my question, I just...tried something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that when I choose my desktop background under the display settings in the control panel, I use a location called DesktopBackground. Here's something I noticed: for each computer that did not sync my background, it did not have this file location...so
 I just created:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\User\HomePC\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\RoamedThemes\</p>
<p>DesktopBackground</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to create the RoamedThemes as a folder and then inside that folder...DesktopBackgrounds as a folder.&nbsp; I did this just an hour after I posted my question above. I didn't think it would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well...almost 24 hours after I did that on each of the computers that was not syncing...then the background started syncing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain to me what happened...and how the heck my layman's idea made this work? I'm so confused and baffled...lol...</p>

    <title>Glitched out Windows 10 tiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wast3dgen0cides  say:</h3>
<h2>            Glitched out Windows 10 tiles</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago (or possibly even earlier as I haven't tried to move around the Windows 10 tiles for a while or customize them in any way), my tiles, both live and not live, started to glitch out. Whenever I tried to move any of them around, they would disappear
 off the screen completely, and as I tried to drag that tile, it would only appear again when I let go of the drag, but it'd pop up in the same place as before. If I hover that tile over any of the other ones, it would end up just making that one disappear
 too and the same thing would happen when I let go of the tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to restart Windows Explorer, remove all of the tiles off of my home screen in case one of them was glitchy, and I still had the same issue no matter what tile I tried to pin to my Start Menu. I tried to delete the app items from the Windows
 folder as suggested, but nothing seems to work. I want to recustomize my tiles after adding new stuff but I can't until I figure out how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have really enjoyed Windows 10 and have actually had no issues with it since I installed it, so I hope there's a way to get around this issue so I can continue using my computer freely again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are pictures to include for clearer reference.</p>

<h2>            computer will not list available wireless networks</h2>
                    
<p>My computer used to list all available wireless networks that I could choose from, but now it does not list them or allow me to search for available networks. I am in a location where I know there is a wireless network available, however, my computer will
 not show it or any other networks unless I plug an ethernet cable in to my computer. Then it connects, but still will not show wireless options. Please help!!!</p>

            Look for a switch on the computer's case that turns wireless networking on and off.&nbsp; Check the computer's User Manual to see if there's a keyboard combination, like Fn+F5, that turns wireless networking on and off.

    <title>Second Monitor Colour Calibration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike nelson pedde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second Monitor Colour Calibration</h2>
                    <p>Hi There: I have a Dell XPS 15 2-In-1 with a Radeon™ RX Vega M GL Graphics with 4GB HMB2 graphics card and a 4K screen. I also have a 27" LG monitor (27UD58-B) with a 4K screen. AND, I have an X-Rite i1 Display Pro puck and software. Now the Dell doesn't
 have an HDMI port, but I have both a Dell dock that connects via USB-C and has an HDMI connection, and I have a USB-C to HDMI 4K 60Hz cable. Choice of cables doesn't seem to matter.<br />
<br />
Calibrating isn't the issue. I have recently generated profiles for both the laptop screen and the external monitor. If I use only the laptop monitor or extend the displays, I can go into Display Settings and choose the .icm colour profile for the Dell screen,
 but no matter what I can't choose a profile for the LG screen. There's no option available to do so. I went into the Device manager and checked, and Windows is showing it as a Generic PnP Monitor. I bought the LG monitor for colour critical work (Affinity
 Photo, Lightroom, etc) so how do I enable the colour profile for this screen? And before anyone suggests it, I've already updated all of the drivers, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike.</p>

            Hi, Mike,
<br />
<br />IS the profile set as default?
<br />
<br />1) Navigate to ‘Control Panel – Appearance and Personalisation – Display – Screen Resolution (or Adjust resolution)’. On Windows 10 it is easiest to simply type ‘Colour Management’ into the (Cortana) Search Box at the bottom left of the desktop and skip to step 4.
<br />
<br />2) Click ‘Advanced Settings’.
<br />
<br />3) Click on the ‘Colour Management’ tab and press the button labelled ‘Colour Management…’
<br />
<br />4) Ensure the ‘Use my settings for this device’ checkbox is checked.
<br />
<br />5) Press the ‘Add’ button and then ‘Browse…’ to the ICC profile you just downloaded. Press ‘Add’ then ‘OK’. Note that if multiple ICC profiles are listed you will have to set the desired profile as default by clicking ‘Set as Default Profile’, too.
<br />
<br />There is a Display Profile Utility which allows you to Store multiple profiles and switch between them. It's freeware.

<p>Hi Pat: Thanks for taking the time to reply. A safe, healthy, happy and prosperous New Year to you and those close to you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn't work. I understand that since I have a single graphics card with a single output I can't use two display profiles simultaneously, but that's okay because when the external monitor is plugged in I turn off the laptop display anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the images below I set the two screens to Extend, and set the default profile for both screens to the .icm for the LG screen. If I click on the laptop screen (1), it shows the LG profile selected. When I click on the external screen (2) there's no option
 to select a profile. If I choose to display only on 2 I get the same result - no profile option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop screen selected:</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

                    <p>Original Title: Help determining crash cause</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this was a BSOD of death, but a few minutes ago I came back to my PC and the screen wasn't picking up a signal and was just black. It wasn't asleep. Turning the screen off and back on did nothing, so I just hit the power button and went to
 event viewer to see if I could find a cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bugcheck:&nbsp;0x000000c4 (0x0000000000001001, 0xffffe000055451e0, 0xffffe0000177b010, 0x0000000000000000).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if that will help because it could just be an error for me turning off the PC at the power...and not properly shutting down, but I can't see anything else in event viewer which might have caused my screen to do that</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was still running, but the screen was not, and it was fine after the reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciated if anyone can help me understand...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Do you run the <span>Driver Verifier tool on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue can be caused by the video/display drivers. Other possible causes include antivirus/antispyware/security programs and memory.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Driver Verifier monitors kernel-mode drivers and graphics drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. It can subject the drivers to a variety of stresses and tests to find improper behavior.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the Microsoft KB article for more information on </span><span>Bug Check 0xC4:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Bug Check 0xC4: DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION</strong></span></p>

            <p>Thanks. Can't believe I didn't check before, but I do have the turn off monitor and sleep options set to never. It happened twice (not recently about last week) but I was able to move mouse and &nbsp;the screen came back as if it were asleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll run verifier now. Not sure if I mentioned it but the display/PC does lag sometimes when opening new applications, would that be another indicator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: and it's a custom PC, i5 CPU, HD7790 graphics, 8gb RAM. Only a couple months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I was having some other issues before and after completely reinstalling drivers I turned on Driver Verifier. I actually still have it on atm, I just never bothered to turn it off. I read that most people leave it on for 24 hours to detect issues, I've
 had it on for over a month now no issues (apart from those in OP, last week). I'll add I haven't had that issue again since I updated windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm, while I have you, what could be causing my PC to slow down? This was in the last couple of days. Like I said before, opening some applications, even task manager, can sometimes take between 5-10 seconds. It's random also. That's with no other applications
 running, apart from kaspersky security. The CPU &nbsp;and DISK usage are normal</p>

            <p>I sometimes dabble in bug checks just to see if I can see a reason.&nbsp; This is what I see in the dump file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Probably caused by : atikmdag.sys ( atikmdag+9e43b7 )</em></p>
<p>I don't run any ATI devices, but you might check this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be an older driver you might check for an update.&nbsp; Because it is old, does not mean it is necessarily bad, but is suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>scmndisp.sys Jan 2007&nbsp;</em>perhaps a Network driver from Neutral Wireless Solution</p>

            <p>I'm not sure exactly what you are suggesting I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the lagginess and freezing only really starts to occur around 8+ hours, and around 12 hours gets pretty bad. Not constant, but when I try to open new applications etc theres a discernible lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was only watching something in windows media player, and it took like 5 seconds to open task manager, and disk was being used 100%. Service Host: Local System and System were the processes causing this supposedly but both were below 1mb/s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Mahesh, I don't really have the time to start my PC in safe mode and wait around until it starts lagging etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had a BSOD or crash since the update. I am more worried about fixing the issues above atm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I went through devices in device manager and looked for updates for CPU, GFX, HDD, and a lot of other things and it all seems to be up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could cause the lagginess and brief freezing I am experiencing?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Poor performance and other problems can be the result of disk fragmentation, disk errors, corrupt system files, unnecessary services running, too many browser Add-ons/toolbars, failure to clear browser cache, not enough RAM, bad hardware components,
 etc. Incompatible browser extensions and add-ons can impact system performance and cause compatibility issues such as application hangs (freezing). As you use your system it becomes filled with more files/programs and has a natural tendency to slow down and
 behave oddly so cleaning and regular maintenance is essential.</span></p>

            Thanks for ask that but all depend on Microsoft. We Ambassadors do not have the tools or means to help in this matter as we are just volunteers. But new game are added every day.

<p>I would love to see the PGR games come to backwards compatibility of maybe possibly them releasing a new game altogether.
</p>
<p>Many of the programmers who worked on the PGR games along programmers from many other driving games are now working on the Forza Horizon games.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not as simple as you might think.&nbsp; Games have licenses, these licenses apply to in-game cars, music, even real racing venue's.&nbsp; If the publisher (in this case, Microsoft), doesn't renew these licenses then the game can't be sold digitally.&nbsp; If it can't
 be sold digitally, then it is unlikely to be made backwards compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The licenses for all of the Project Gotham games have expired and the game has not been available for some years on the Xbox Marketplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly doubt this will become BC.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
        </p>
