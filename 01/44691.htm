    <title>Adding adult to Windows Family - clicking link in invitation not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding adult to Windows Family - clicking link in invitation not working</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded our two PCs to Windows 10 and converted my login and our children's&nbsp;to Windows accounts. I have successfully added myself and our children as a Family, with me as an adult and them as children. However now I am trying to add my wife as an
 adult, it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After mine and the kids' accounts were setup, we&nbsp;then converted my wife's login to a Windows account and she did the basic signup. After that, I added her to the family (I can't remember if I did that online or through Windows settings). She received the
 invitation and clicked it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking the invitation she was asked to sign-in. It then said 'we need some more information about you' and took her to a form where she entered name, date of birth, country of residence, etc. Then it seemed to lose track of the invitation process,
 so&nbsp;she went back to the email and clicked the invitation link again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it showed the 'Family' page, but not confirming that she had joined the family, just saying she needed to add children to her family. This feels like the wrong thing to do, so we have left that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead I went to the online family settings and tried removing and re-inviting her. It removed her from the list OK, but when I tried to add her again, it said 'They're already part of your family.' Clicking the invitation again does nothing different.
 In Windows settings it shows her as 'Adult, Pending'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me sort this, please?</p>
<p>

<p>Hey there Skullsies! I'm sorry to hear you are having issues connecting to the Wi-Fi with your S consoles. There may be an issue with the internal adapter that needs to be addressed, but lets try some basics first to see if we can determine a cause.<br />
<br />
First, try resetting your console's network settings. You can find steps at the top of this guide (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/error-cant-access-internet-problem-connection-978953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../error-cant-access-internet-problem-connection-978953</a>).
 Don't worry about any other steps below that.<br />
<br />
If you are still unable to connect, try a wired connection. Does the console connect OK? Finally, you can try connecting your console to a different network entirely to see if the same Wi-Fi connection issue occurs.<br />
<br />
If it seems after all this that your console can simply no longer connect to wireless, your console may need a repair, which you can
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">set up online</a>. For now, try out these tests and post back with what you find out. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            KB3205386 &#47; KB3210721 We couldn&#39;t complete the updates, Undoing changes, Don&#39;t turn off your computer</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometime late last year (I can't remember when this started) I had a Windows Update that automatically installed and it resulted in an error.
 &nbsp;This has continued until now and I have been avoiding fixing due to time restrictions it but now must be rectified. &nbsp;In my update history the failing updates are listed as
</span>KB3205386 and KB3210721.<span>&nbsp;The problem occurs as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Windows update installs the update and requires a restart - If I try to shut down the computer it will install the update and restart.</span></p>
<p><span>2. The restart configures the update up until 95-100% (not sure which number it stops at).</span></p>
<p><span>3. The screen then says "We couldn't complete the updates, Undoing changes, Don't turn off your computer"</span></p>
<p><span>Steps 2. and 3. take a long time, I haven't timed it precisely but I would estimate 2-3 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I cannot shut down my computer without going through this process and the other day Windows scheduled the installation and I was not able to change
 the scheduled time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have read many forums trying to solve this and have conducted a number of processes to solve this problem:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Viewed the Installed Updates and uninstalled both&nbsp;KB3205386 and KB3210721.</span></li><li><span>Run </span>
<span>Command Prompt as Administrator and entered:</span>
<span>Command Prompt as Administrator and entered:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>net stop bits</span></li><li><span>net stop wuauserv</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Opened the Services console and Disabled and Stopped Windows Update</span></li><li><span>Browsed to&nbsp;<span>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>folder and deleted all the files
 and folders&nbsp;</span>inside</span></li><li><span>Downloaded the stand-alone package for both updates from the&nbsp;</span><span>Microsoft Update Catalog<span>&nbsp;website,
 saved into C:\updates</span></span></li><li><span>Disabled my internet connection</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">In msconfig (System Configuration) Services tab disabled all non-Microsoft&nbsp;services</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Restarted</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Run&nbsp;</span><span>Command Prompt as Administrator and entered:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">wusa.exe C:\updates</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">\[updatefilename].msu</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Waited for installation, installation says it is finished and requires a restart.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Click to Restart.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Check the update history, it displays that the update failed.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>At this point the same process occurs in steps 2. and 3. of the error listed at the beginning of this post.</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried&nbsp;KB3205386 first and then&nbsp;KB3210721. &nbsp;Neither have worked.</span></p>
<p><span>If anybody has suggestions where to go from here it would be highly appreciated.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a very similar problem with update KB3210721. The update has been freezing completely around 11%. I've left the PC alone for an hour or&nbsp;more each time, without any progress or animation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The system also froze repeatedly when I initially upgraded from Win 8 to Win 10. It was resolved by installing the upgrade from a flash drive. Do you think a similar method would work? If so, how could that be done for an update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Technical Support, showed the rep this thread, then&nbsp;walked through disabling the AV and installing the updates using a mounted Windows ISO. But, I ran into the same problem, the process froze at "Working on Updates 17%".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restoring the system, Win 10 Setup had the following error message: "0xC1900101 - 0x20006 The Installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during the REPLICATE_OC operation"</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/t/s!AvYzzZH8_SE7lGZNSt-FOOs6pKXU</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think it might work if I burned the Anniversary Update ISO onto a disk or thumbdrive and tried to install directly from boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try tech support when I have time next week. Thank you for your help.</p>

 do I stop this from happening so I can use the program again? TIA

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting.&nbsp; From your issue description, I understand that you want to activate 8 cores in the CPU.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are you running 32-bit or 64-bit operating system?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<div>Check if you can enable all the processors from advanced boot menu.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Press Windows Key + x from the keyboard-&gt;type msconfig-&gt;Click on Boot-&gt;Advanced Options-&gt;Check on Number of Processors-&gt;Now select the Processor that you want to activate-&gt;Click on Apply-&gt;OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can now restart the computer and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the above step fails, I suggest you to check in the BIOS options to see if you can enable 8 cores.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>BIOS Disclaimer: </strong><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If nothing works I request you to get in touch with the hardware manufacturer. The processor cores activation should be under the hardware manufacturer's support.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Hope this will be helpful. Incase if you still have further queries please reply with more details and we will be happy to help you.

<p>
</p><p>Win+x brings up a menu, and you can't just start typing "msconfig".&nbsp; Instead it should say:</p>
<p>Press Windows Key + x from the keyboard-&gt; Command Prompt -&gt; type msconfig ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also faster just to search for msconfig.</p>

<div style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">

<p><strong>Comment</strong>: Back when I had Win 7, and still now with Win 10, my understanding is/was that a USER account MUST be created in order to share files between computers in a household WORKGROUP. So, for example, if I have files stored locally on
 the desktop computer in my basement office, say, certain Documents or a huge Music collection...and I want to access them from my laptop in the bedroom, I must create a WORKGROUP, and each computer in the group must have a USER account on it that is given
 access to the Workgroup. Maybe I'm wrong, but that was my understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: If the above is correct, how do I overcome the nuisance this creates in File Explorer, whereby to access any of my USER documents on whatever computer I happen to be using, I have to navigate to Local Disk (C:), then "Users", then
 My Name, then Documents, rather than just going to This PC, Documents which is readily, easily, VISIBLY accessible on the left-hand side of the Explorer window as soon as it's opened?</p>
<p>It seems like an unnecessarily onerous DIGGING/DRILLING task. Is there some way to make a User/Document folder easier to get to?</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.<br />

            Hi msinport ... The This PC is just a visual shortcut that's why you have to drill down to the folder to actually get to it.
<br />Meaning it's like creating a shortcut on your desktop to a program.
<br />But the program lives in c:\programfiles\....
<br />What you could do is create mapped drives to your users folders.
<br />That would be easier.
<br />See links.

<p>You are largely correct as far as implementing a user-level account and password file access scheme.&nbsp; The one fact you may have missed is that you do NOT have to log into that shared account in order to share files...you just have to log into the folder
 you shared using that account credentials and saving that in the accounts you prefer to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the style of sharing I set up on my home net also, after running into an intractable problem of getting Homegroup to "sync" across a network switch.&nbsp; An aside. I suspect that was the real reason Microsoft yanked Homegroup out of the Win10 Fall 2018
 version, but that is only my speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back at the ranch, I set up sharing my music collection this way...I have one OLD computer (running Windows 7, and can't even be upgraded to 8.0 or 8.1, as it is 17 y.o. and counting) that I use as my file and print server.&nbsp; So, first, I logged in as Administrator
 on this Ancient One, and created the account I wanted to use for sharing. pairing the&nbsp; account name with a password.&nbsp; Then, I shared the music folder on this computer to EVERYONE, but I require those users to log onto the server&nbsp; with that "shared" account
 information.&nbsp; I also shared the attached printer to use this same account.&nbsp; My third step was to then to go to each of my other computers and used File Explorer (all of my "client" computers are running Windows 10) to find my "server" computer on the network,
 then drilled down to the shared items.&nbsp; When each computer first connects to a resource shared on the "server" in this way, it should prompt for the account and password that was set up for sharing.&nbsp; Enter those, and click "remember my credentials" before
 you hit enter.&nbsp; That way, even after rebooting. you shouldn't be required to enter them again.&nbsp; and since the printer was shared using the same account, simply clicking to connect, and maybe installing the printer driver does not generate a second prompt for
 the log in info.&nbsp; All done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things bear watching.&nbsp; First, the account I created has never been logged into on any of my "client" computers.&nbsp; I DID create the same account with the same password on each, but I'm not entirely sure it was necessary.&nbsp; So I've three computers
 with basically empty profiles for that account.&nbsp; Secondly, I did make sure the same WORKGROUP name was used on every computer, Without that, I don't think I'd have been able to "discover" the "server" computer, even though it is physically sitting on the same
 network wiring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using this method gives you at least a couple of options, as far as "ownership" of the music files.&nbsp; You can limit the shared logon account to just reading the shared folder, which makes you have to add music only on the computer from where it is shared,
 or you can give that account read and write access, meaning any computer logged in can add music to the shared folder. &nbsp; I would reserve full access privileges to only the "server" computer, as a precaution.&nbsp;
<span>Just a heads up.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>FSX is such an old piece of software that I doubt if many of the current MS employees even remember it. &nbsp; You have no chance of getting any refund for it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you explain further about your problem: &nbsp;"FSX has completely disappeared" after re-installation? &nbsp; If you have re-installed it and the installation completed and has taken you to the end of Disk 2 (and also requesting you to activate it), then the
 whole FSX Directory will be located in Program Files (xxx) (default). &nbsp; Can you find it there and if so, it should be about 14 GB in size?</p>

                    Hi, I just bought 2,500 + 300 fortnite bonus with my email (I bought it for xbox but I play it for the computer), when I bought it, everything seemed to work, but when I went to my account with the same email account xbox in my epic games account there
 were no v-bucks in it. And that made me very annoyed because I was going to buy my battle ticket today and unfortunately I could not because the v-bucks did not come to my account and it seems that somehow it will not come. I've tried everything but nothing
 works, does anyone know how to solve it?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to check with the Printer Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in<br />
their forums (if any). You may also need to check with those same functions at the Router Maker.<br />
<br />
The Printer Maker should provide specific installation instructions and support.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            Hi Rubert 
<br />
<br />Then new look to the lock screen is called Acrylic and it has divided users as to whether they like it or not. There is however no setting for turning that on or off, though there is a registry fix . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />On the PC that does not have that acrylic look and feel on the lock screen:
<br />
<br />1
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. and build No. of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />2
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon non your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Personalization - Lock Screen
<br />
<br />What is the background of Lock Screen set to, is that Picture, Slideshow or Windows Spotlight?

<br />the acrylic look on the lock screen is affected by the transparency setting.
<br />settings -&gt; personalisation -&gt; colours
<br />transparency affects.
<br />if transparency is turned on, it will be like looking at the lock screen picture through the bathroom window.

<br />
<br />The group policy editor is not available in Home.
<br />if you have Pro, click start type gpedit press enter
<br />on the left navigate to computer configuration -&gt; administrative templates -&gt; all settings 
<br />in the right hand pane, double click on show clear logon background.
<br />
<br />however, if you want the acrylic, blurred look you will want to set this as not configured or disabled
<br />
<br />the only other suggestion i had was to use the registry edit, Andre's link has the details on that.

            Unfortunately, the Registry Key is to disable it. I want to "enable" it. Any idea as how to do that or has someone else on here an idea or better, the answer. Once again, not to disable but enable the Acrylic.&nbsp;

<p>Here's what I'm looking for after trial and trial and error then bingo! All I had to do to to see the Acrylic on bootup with my picture in it was this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In System / Personalization / Lockscreen was to turn this on, "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Show lockscreen background picture on the sign in screen</span>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>That does the trick. Turning this off and rebooting and the Acrylic is not there booting up. Turning it on and it's there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the instructions given to disable this in the Registry says to create a new Key and name it System. Trying to do that a bit back and Windows won't allow one to do that because it says there is already a Key named System. I'm not sure if those
 were instructions given before Windows 1903 but it sure doesn't work. I had to delete that attempt from the Registry.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Tabs</h2>
                    I have recently installed Windows 10 and am having issues with its tabs. I used to be able to drag tabs over the home page and hit them against the sides of my screen to split them in half. Now i can only drag tabs once they are minimized and they no longer
 change size when hit against the side of my screen. How can I fix this?

            Really, by design?&nbsp; Previous operating systems did not force you to have a giant wall clock at all times, this is a feature that was added in recent Windows versions.&nbsp; Why on Earth would you make it "by design" that the customer should not be able to disable
 this new feature?

<p>Whilst your reply points out that this is not possible, I would expect this setting to be optional and not forced upon us. I, and many others, await the update that gives us, the end users, the option to disable this if we wish. It cannot come soon enough.</p>

 have to use&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)"><strong>Windows 10 FeedBack Hub</strong>, which is an application you have to install, apparently, in order to provide MS with feedback. &nbsp;They want
 you to install an ap to give feedback. &nbsp;That is a bit on the ridiculous side in my opinion. &nbsp;If you don't care what the customer wants or thinks, it would be nice if you'd just say so, instead of setting up one hoop after another to jump through, and then
 just ignore customer opinions anyway.</span></p>

</p><p>Is this some sort of standard response that gets used instead of saying "we didn't add that basic feature because we ran out of time, but we will ad this basic, obvious feature to possibly be incorporated in future versions, we value your customer inputs,
 and don't believe in having an authoritarian approach to handling out customer requests and questions."</p>

            It is not helpful, because the answer, in poor English, demonstrates and arrogant attitude. &nbsp;The date and time display is large and unattractive and can interfere with those like the questioner and myself who have corporate screens to display on machines
 that are not currently in use.

<p>What have I tried? I've tried forwarding the various ports that it is recommended to do, have enabled UPnP (and disabled it, but the problems persist regardless), have cleared alternate MAC address, have made a static IP address for the Xbox, have reserved
 aforementioned address on the Sky-router webpage. None of these things, individually or in conjunction with one of the others has had any effect on the above problems. I restarted my router between each change made to ensure this.</p>
<p>What country do you live in? I live in England, in Yorkshire</p>
<p>Modem/Router brand and model number: I think I have a gateway, I certainly only have one device connected to the phone lines. It's the Sky SR102</p>
<p>How many consoles are connected? Until last week, my 360 and my One. I disconnected my 360, but there was no change on the One.</p>
<p>Wired or Wireless? Both were wireless. Now the One is still wireless, and as the router is downstairs, wired would be difficult.</p>
<p>UPnP is currently enabled.</p>
<p>My NAT type is strict and my network is behind a firewall.</p>
<p>My ISP is Sky.</p>
<p>Please help, ask if there's any information I've missed.</p>
<p>-Morgan</p>
<p>Edit: Problems caused by this include not receiving notifications of people coming online, not receiving party or game invites and being unable to hear other people if I join parties. I can join and play in multiplayer games OK in Destiny.</p>

<p>That is a gateway , and (according to the reviews I just read about it) not a very good one , gateways in general have a hard time with upnp , wired is the only way to go in my opinion but to each his own , cable is pretty cheap and easy to fish through
 walls and ceilings in most cases... </p>

<h2>            Suggestion for a few games for backwards compatibility.</h2>
                    
<p>Poker Night 2 by Tale Tell, Space Marine by THQ, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 1 - 3 by Bandai Namco. I figure that the last two are not likely to be added. The first though is done by Tale Tell would still sell on the Xbox One. Poker Night 2 is a fun game that
 is both relaxing and fun to play. I hope that these games get added. Anyway, thank you for looking at this post and considering it.</p>

    <title>bluetooth mono with mic enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kanezfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            bluetooth mono with mic enabled</h2>
                    
<p>I have searched for an answer to this problem a long time, but no luck.&nbsp; I've only found people with the same issue but no solution.</p>
<p>I have the rocketfish RF-MAB2 stereo headphones.&nbsp; I have no issue with getting them working, and can hear music in stereo, video games in stereo, movies in stereo.&nbsp; The problem is when I turn the microphone on the headphones on.&nbsp; As soon as I do, the headphones
 revert to mono, one channel.&nbsp; This happens both when I turn the microphone on in the windows sound mixer, or when I enable the microphone in ventrilo, which I use to talk to people when playing world of warcraft.&nbsp; It's not just that the sound goes from stereo
 to mono, but the sound quality becomes terribly muddled, worse than listening to music on AM radio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not exclusive to these headphones, as I've read posts from people with motorola and sony hardware with the same problem.</p>
<p>Help?</p>

            Hi Mark,
<br />Can you please give us a little more information? Are you referring to web notes in Edge, other apps (which ones please)? If it is not Edge web notes you are referring to, can you try the highlighter in Webnotes in Edge and advise if that works or not?
<br />
<br />Also, are you saying that you have two Surface Pens and two SP4's and you swap pens and neither pen highlights on either Surface? 
<br />
<br />Does pinch and zoom still work on your Surface Pro 4's? And by latest update, do you mean the Fall Creators Update or the last cumulative update? Please run
<br />
<br />winver
<br />
<br />and reply with the OS Version and Build Number shown. 
<br />
<br />Hopefully we will be able to figure this out, but it may take a few exchanges of information.       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I don't use Edge or web notes.</p>
<p>It's in apps.</p>
<p>In all the apps that I could highlight before, I cannot do so any longer.</p>
<p>When I try to highlight, it changes the page. Just like when I use my finger to swipe the screen.</p>
<p>I can tap individual words with the stylus and each word highlights.</p>
<p>It will not allow me to highlight more than one word at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife and I each have SP4s. Her stylus was able to highlight until this morning.</p>
<p>She's not sure if any updates were installed overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her stylus does not highlight on my tablet and vice versa.</p>
<p>My stylus&nbsp;highlighted on her tablet until this morning</p>
<p>Pinch and zoom works on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what updates were installed, but it was Windows updates.</p>
<p>The problem with my tablet started about 3 weeks ago so I uninstalled all updates&nbsp;from October and November. When that didn't correct the problem, I reinstalled the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update that took about an hour, again I don't know what one, seems to be when the problem began. I had no issues prior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to help me. As you can tell from my reply, I am not very tech savvy.</p>

            OK, it sounds like you updated to the Fall Creators Update if it took an hour. If you type
<br />
<br />winver
<br />
<br />and the Cortana/Search field, what build number does it show? 
<br />
<br />Please supply the name of the apps that you are using where you can't highlight. If we can duplicate what you are seeing in one of the apps, it would make it easier to provide advice. We do know that the Fall Creators Update changed pen behavior and what you are describing sounds a little similar. 
<br />
<br />Take a look at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3225908/windows/windows-10-digital-ink-all-the-improvements-with-the-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3225908/windows...</a> which describes some of the changes in general. Some people don't like the changes, though. 
<br />
<br />If I use Word 2016 with the Pen and selected Pens from the toolbar and then highlighter, I can use the pen and drag over test to highlight "free form", but if I don't select Pens and highlight, then only one word at a time is highlighted. Please tell us specific app names?
<br />
<br />As I said, we will get to the bottom of this if we can.

            Does Microsoft plan to update their most recent update so that I can choose what I want my $99 Surface Pen to be able to do? The Fall Creators update turned my surface pen into a mouse I do no need. It would be nice to highlight like I did before the update.
 Any info on this would be appreciated.

 skipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know some of my photo folders are huge +500 photos but it shouldn't randomly skip photos.</p>

    <title>Feedback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rafficus iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Feedback</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft,</p>

<p>We need to talk. This whole Xbox One thing is getting out of hand. I've been following the Xbox One for some time now and all the statements thrown around. I've read statements from employees saying you want feedback, as you're willing to listen. So here
 you are: feedback.</p>

<p>I've been a 360 gamer since launch and bought the original Xbox on launch as well. Xbox has been my franchise and preference for years. I write this with my PS3 in storage collecting dust, much like my PS2 did when I chose my Xbox over it, and I have no
 regrets about it. Over the course of time, I've had two of my three Xbox 360's stolen, while my PS3 (which used to sit right next my 360 before it was placed in storage) remained lol. The Xbox flagship is where I like to game and where I'd like to remain.
 Problem is, everything I'm hearing about the Xbox One is disconcerting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I know you think this isn't a sprint and the numbers will speak volumes once it's released, but I really don't believe the launch will go well. Here's why:</p>

<p>1. DRM: When you force someone to do something, they will either a) do it grudgingly and you'll deteriorate a relationship, or b) they'll go somewhere else. Yes, it's a solid argument that if we have a WiFi connection it's not so hard to connect every 24
 hours; but you're missing the core issue. The issue is forcing it on us by telling us we cannot play our games if it doesn't connect to the internet once every 24 hours. If the consumer spends money on your console, which is more expensive than the competitor,
 and is spending $60 on games, plus the Gold membership monthly rate, it is somewhat of an insult to tell us we cannot use our games, which we spend good money on, if we don't abide by the DRM. The fact Sony garnered wild applause and cheer when they announced
 the PS4 would be DRM free should be very telling about where we stand on this matter. This policy needs to go.</p>

<p>2. Used games: I don't buy used, because I buy new to support developers to continue franchises I care about. However, others do. They do so because they want to game and continue to game, thus they go the used game route because a) cannot afford to continually
 buy new, or b) like to try before they buy. Placing more restrictions on a seemingly restrictive gaming platform doesn't do favors for this console's image. I understand the need or want to cut the middleman out (Gamespot), however used games also means more
 chance for Gold members.</p>

<p>3. Kinect: Once again, the restrictions are suffocating you. People are upset this piece has to be connected or else the console does not function. This becomes an even bigger issue when fans take a step back and say, "Well, if this wasn't tacked on, the
 game would undoubtedly be $100-150 cheaper." And there's also rumor the Kinect will monitor the individuals in the room and pitch products based on the collected data? An evolutionary marketing step, yes; a welcomed intrusion into our gaming experience, no.
 This piece is doing more harm than good currently.</p>

<p>4. Cost: Your console is more expensive than your competitor, we're still being charged for Gold, new game prices may rise, and used game prices are for certain going to rise with the fee. The cost is a turn off. I do not want to shell out half a thousand
 dollars for reasons 1-3, when the PS4 is cheaper and it's technology is superior on a side by side comparison. At this point, I'd be buying your console solely for brand purposes and fan loyalty.</p>

<p>I'll leave it at this. Microsoft, I love the Xbox franchise. I loved it when it was introduced and I've spent countless hours with my 360. I really, really want to like the Xbox One, but reasons 1-4 are just a complete turn off. As of right now, I am not
 pre-ordering this console and will wait to see if you listen to the feedback from several fans and critics. The Xbox One currently is not appealing due to those chief complaints. Fan loyalty and word of mouth, once Xbox's greatest strength, is reversing and
 now harming it due to all of the negativity enshrouding the Xbox One and it's features/restrictions. Fan loyalty and word of mouth is what drives your sales, motivates Gold membership when it was free on PS3, and kept gamers on a console that wasn't technically
 on the same level of it's competitor. You need to regain those two factors, or else launch will be rocky. I will continue to enjoy my 360 and wish the best for the Xbox One. I hope this does not come off as harsh or scathing, I am simply a fan who is worried
 about the direction of the next-gen Xbox.</p>
