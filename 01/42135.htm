<h2>            How to add tags to all file types using Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 8.1, but this is probably relevant to all versions.&nbsp; Using Windows Explorer, I want to be able to add user-defined tags to various files that are in a variety of formats. Microsoft says it can be done from the Details Pane, and that seems
 to be true for file formats JPG and DOC.&nbsp; But the Details Pane varies according to file format, and tags do not seem to be available for PDF, PNG or MHT files (that's all I've checked so far).&nbsp; A single value tag (on or off, yes or no) would be sufficient,
 but a multi-value tag would be ideal.</p>
<p>
I would have thought there would be an easy solution, but I've not had a reply to a similar question in another thread.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; A workaround?&nbsp; An add-on?&nbsp; I've considered using the Read-Only attribute, but that is a pretty unsatisfactory solution.

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Karthicka.&nbsp; I&nbsp; really am surprised that this issue has not come up before so that someone has developed a workaround, an add-on or an app that will allow some sort of tag to be added to files of all types.&nbsp; Anyone, please?

<div style="margin-left: 1em">
<p>-Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with random BSODs which seem to happen whenever I use YouTube or Vimeo.</p>
<p>At first I thought the problem resided with Adobe Flash, and I uninstalled it, but that's not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this? I have below the Event ID from the latest BSOD. Hopefully someone from Microsoft can enlighten me on what the BugcheckCode and parameters actually mean - or how I can "translate" them into something I can understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling this is about a driver or something.</p>

<h2>            error log to use to track internet connection</h2>
                    <p>Is there an error log or something similar in Windows that will allow me to see the history of my internet connections?&nbsp; My internet connection is turning on and off a lot.&nbsp; I think the problem lies with the ISP (with Windows or my router), but I'd like
 to see if I can document the problem.&nbsp; Is there any capability in Windows to do this?</p>

            I was not able to find the sort of error log or diagnostic tool that would allow me to pinpoint the source of internet service interruptions.&nbsp; However, I was nonetheless able to convince the ISP to take a second look (and not insist the problem could only
 be in my laptop).&nbsp; The modem was swapped out and the problem disappeared.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you able to use any other USB devices without any issues?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Try running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check what it has to say.<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Check with the device manufacturer about its compatibility with windows 7. You may try installing that device’s software/driver in compatibility mode and check if this help.<br />

<p>I've encountered the same problem. One thing that has fixed it for me was going directly to the store and looking for the game there. Installing it from my games&amp;apps didn't work but directly from the store did. Sadly I haven't had the same luck if the game
 has been remastered, seems like they would rather you buy the new version.</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed clarification. Based on my test, it shows participants who are active. For example, I added A, B, C, D and E five people to a meeting, and assume all these participants are
 muted now, the fifth person E will show at the bottom of the screen since he is the last one came in. But once he talked, he will replace one of those who isn't talking in the main screen. So this is how it works, it use participant who is talking to replace
 the one who is not talking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And unfortunately there is no workaround to manually set the participants you want to display in the main window. So as you already did, sending us a feedback would be a good way to let us know how
 you want us to improve our products. We appreciate your continued interest in Microsoft products and services.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

            <span>I know its being a while
 since this question was raised and I’m sure everyone concerned found its own answer. But since I searched for an answer my self yesterday and could not find anything reasonable I thought I post my solution here … for future reference …</span><br />
<br />
<span>First thing first, it’s possible. Yes you can install the same printer twice
 with different printer preferences for each (don’t let you tell otherwise, even from Microsoft employs). Secondly, yes &nbsp;Windows 7 makes it a bit confusing, because it displays only one instance of the installed printer in its Control Panel Printer section
 (Microsofts wisdom) … anyway here is how to do it. </span><br />
<span>I assume you have installed your printer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Go to [Control Panel] -&gt; [Devices and Printers] and select [Add a Printer]</span><br />
<span>2. Now select [Add a local printer]</span><br />
<span>3. Select the set port of your printer in [Choose a printer port], commonly
 USB001 etc.</span><br />
<span>4. In [Install the printer driver] select your printers Manufacturer and Model</span><br />
<span>5. [Next]</span><br />
<span>6. In [Which version of the driver do you want to use?] select [Use the driver
 that is currently installed]</span><br />
<span>7. Enter a name for this new printer reference in [Type a printer name]</span><br />
<br />
<span>So, what we have now is a new printer reference, a reference you can see and
 select in the [Print] window printer selection [Name]. What we have to do now is to setup this printers individual settings</span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Go back to [Control Panel] - [Devices and Printers] and select your printer
 (clicking)</span><br />
<span>2. Select [Customize your printer]</span><br />
<span>3. In [Select a printer] select your printer the same way as you would in the
 [Print] menu</span><br />
<span>4. The [Print property] window pops up and you can set your individual printer
 settings here</span><br />
<br />
<span>Voilà, confusing but easy, happy computing …</span><br />

<p>I do this all the time.&nbsp; The Devices and Printers folder stacks multiple instances on the same device on top of the first device (since it's the same hardware device).&nbsp; If you have Pro or Ultimate you can use the UI created by the spooler team, printmanagement.msc,
 to manage your local printers.&nbsp; The old printers folder from the spooler team is also around but it's really hidden.</p>
<p>this command will launch the Printers folder (no Devices allowed)</p>

            Hi,
<br />you need USB-3 compatible drive and connect it to USB 3 port.
<br />USB 2 provides up to 30-35MB/s or ~100MB/hour.

            Hi Adrian
<br />
<br />You are copying 135GB of data from your external drive to your hard drive, is that correct?
<br />
<br />If so, it depends on the type connection on that drive and on your PC
<br />
<br />If both are USB 3.0 that will transfer over pretty fast, it may initially say 3 hours, but it will not take anywhere near that long
<br />
<br />If you are using USB 2.0 or 1.0 on either end, that will take a lot of time
<br />
<br />There is no utility that will make the transfer faster, you are limited by the capabilities of your USB ports . . .

<p>To backup and restore files consider making backup images with third party software:</p>
<p>Acronis, Aoemi, EaseUS, Macrium, Paragon, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are free and pay versions depending on your needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option is to plan the copy and paste overnight so that a substantial portion is accomplished while sleeping.</p>

<p>Others have answered the copy speed being dependent on hardware such as USB 2.0 vs USB 3.0 etc.<br />
But I also wanted to suggest a utillity that will make keeping the files in sync after the initial copy.<br />

<p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>HDD isn't fast. Consider SSD drives.</p>
<p>The speed is dependent if you have several large files(faster) or many small files(slower).<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Nothing works&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Nothing works&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here is a list of issues I have experienced since my update to Windows 10:</p>
<p>1) Task Manager does not open 90% of the time. Instead, it shows as a blank window for 15 seconds, clicking on it causes it to stop responding completely.</p>
<p>2) The task-bar's search function is non-functional, I cannot right click on taskbar icons although blank spaces seem to work as do left-clicking on the icons.</p>
<p>3) The start menu doesn't work no matter what I do.</p>
<p>4) Windows explorer works, but barely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 1: In addition to the previous details, the Control Panel, PC Settings, Device Manager, Program and Features and other built-in system features are non-functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, I can open Firefox, hopefully Skype, Warframe and all my games work too.</p>
<p>I was on Windows 8.1 prior to the update and I have tried no solutions so far. I don't intend on reinstalling the operating system, and I've restarted five times so far. If I have to uninstall a large amount of data, I'll prefer to be directed on returning
 to Windows 8, because the new operating system is not worth reinstalling nearly a Terabyte of information that might not be re-creatable.

            PC Settings still does not open. Unfortunately I cannot test a new user account in order to fix the issue. Warframe, one of many games I play, seems to open the launcher correctly. Perhaps I can manage with just opening from the taskbar.

            <p>At the moment Windows 10 has been a major letdown. It appears to be Windows 8, but with altered icons and even less functionality due to the majority of problems received upon installation of the OS. I'm going to try to remedy the solution myself by performing
 a system refresh if possible with the limited functionality of the computer at this time.

<p>Although I can admit that the computer runs substantially faster in what does work.</p>

            I couldn't get the menu to work or many of the tools in the tool bar. I reset the default browser to Microsoft Edge. Now it works. If I set Chrome as my default browser, the menu aspects stop being clickable. Leave it to Microsoft to be product oriented.

<h2>            Controller&#38;&#35;39&#59;s micro-USB port already broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Xbox for a little while now. &nbsp;I am gentle with my controllers and no damage has come to them. &nbsp;However, without warning I was playing and charging my controller at the same time when the Xbox suddenly advises me that my controller was no longer
 connected.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the charging cable failed when it was gently pressed upwards (causing the plug tip to go downwards inside the controller) and the entire port was very loose.</p>
<p>I've tested this now with three cables, all do the same thing so it is definitely a busted port. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing has happened to this controller to be broken so easily!</p>
<p>Why sell something called "charge and play" if playing while it charges breaks the bloody controller?</p>
<p>I would like an answer, if not a replacement...</p>

<p>I actually found a charger that energized made for the controllers that takes the usb out of the equation entirely. &nbsp;It charges the battery through a tiny hole in the new battery panel lid that it provides. &nbsp;Saved me from having to buy new controllers. &nbsp;You
 can't charge and play at the same time...but it doesn't break in a few months. &nbsp;I will say I emailed Xbox about it and they were actually willing to replace my broken controller though...as long as I paid to ship it to them first. &nbsp;Just some info for ya there.</p>

    <title>Computer Keeps Going to Sleep Even Though Sleep Settings Are Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keenstrife  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Keeps Going to Sleep Even Though Sleep Settings Are Off</h2>
                    <p>Basically I've been having problems with my new laptop where it will go into sleep mode while I'm using it. All of the sleep and hibernating settings are off, but for some reason the computer still goes into sleep mode. It also seems to go into sleep mode
 faster when I'm playing a game. If it was going into sleep mode while I wasn't using it that would be one thing, but it's going into sleep mode while I'm using it. I've tried changing multiple settings and no luck. This is an extremely frustrating problem
 that I would appreciate any help I could get with it. Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>I have the exact same issue on my Surface Pro 3. Only this issue wasn't there until last week's windows 10 update was installed now the tablet goes into sleep while I'm using it every 5 - 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incredibly annoying and I honestly do not know what is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution you give doesn't make a lot of sense unless one of the updates changes the drivers. Since the surface is self contained my assumption was that Windows 10 would know all the devices and be using the correct drivers to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how to proceed.</p>

            <p>This is not a graphics card issue. Mine did the same thing, I had to do a restore to fix this issue, Mine isn't sleeping any more. Must be a update issue. Search How to Restore Windows 10 and it should fix the sleeping problem.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When
 I went to settings, power and sleep everything was on never. I then clicked additional power savings and edit plan setting window all was never and still was going to sleep. I then clicked change advanced power settings and a Power Option window came up with
 Balanced, required password on wake up with YES on both Battery and Plugged in which I couldn't change. I just did a restore to last build on my laptop and it fixed mine. NO SLEEPING now. I even checked the Power Option and it now has NO instead of YES. This
 problem must have something to do with the latest updates as I didn't have the problem before. &nbsp;How to restore: click start, settings then Update &amp; Security, then Recovery. I click get build. I hope this will help.</span></p>

    <title>How long can I keep my system on&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markdeedavis  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long can I keep my system on&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have whatever the earliest 360 system would be- or at least, one of the earliest models, white with a Phillips LiteOn drive (Not sure if BenQ). It's hooked up to Live as well as is using an HDMI A/V connector.</p>
<p>I'm wondering how long I can play it without risking a red ring. Everyone seems to have a different opinion on it, so I'm hoping a Microsoft employee could clear it up for me.</p>

<p>I download all of my games to the hard drive, which I've heard helps with heat. The Xbox is elevated by two large dowels so that all of the vent areas have 3 inches of clearance. I tend to keep my room somewhere between 62-67 degrees Fahrenheit, so I assume
 overheating is an unlikely happening. I keep the 360 system horizontal.</p>

<p>Question 1: Would having a fan blowing underneath the 3 inch clearance help at all?</p>
<p>Question 2: With the information provided, how long should I play my 360 before I should give it a break for fear of red ring? I'm hoping for a Microsoft employee to help with one, but experienced community members are helpful too!</p>

<p>Honestly, not even a Microsoft employee can answer this 100%. There is no specific time. People who have experienced red rings (I've had it before) have all had different experiences. It's quite possible you can leave the console on all the time and it never
 red ring. It's also possible it could red ring after 30 minutes. </p>

<p>you can really play it till it dies one time i left my 360 on for 3 straight days so i would do what you want but be warned you could get red rings out of no where sometimes for me when the power goes out i get a red ring.</p>

<p>G'day Mark!<br />
<br />
<strong>Smwutches</strong> has it right. Those red lights are a diagnostic tool, so they won't activate until something goes wrong within the console. They can activate for so many different reasons (hence the number of lights that show up and the various error
 codes that come with them) and there is no way to predict when or if that would happen.<br />
<br />
I've experienced two different types of hardware failures with red lights before I started here - once because I was a young noob and attached the hard drive incorrectly (1 red light with E68 error), and once because I tried playing in a heat wave and the room
 was just too darn warm (2 red lights, ventilation warning, 110+ deg. farenheit with no air conditioning. Whew!). But with better care going forward, I kept the same console running smooth for 5 years before I decided to pick up a new one.<br />
<br />
Some things, like that overheating issue I had, can be predictable. However, it sounds like you're taking a lot of really great steps to keep your console healthy and happy! Keep it up. ^_^ I don't think that extra fan is necessary though, especially if you're
 better at temperature controlling your room than I am!</p>

<p>Not sure how long but as you have it well ventilated I wouldn't worry too much.</p>
<p>I went through 5 white 360's. I used to have it switched on for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Only one of the 5 consoles got the RRoD. The other 4 were replaced for other reasons like the fans making horrible grinding noises or the DVD drive failing.</p>
<p>I would just say that you should install your games to the HDD to prevent the DVD drive from spiining and adding extra heat to the console.</p>

<p>I have the same question as MarkDeeDavis. I have an Xbox 360 E that is 8 months old (it's a replacement). Is it safe to leave it on for about 20 hours without using it? Sometimes I have unsaved progress on a school night, than have to leave it on from 9
 PM-3 PM. The console is placed horizontally on shelf with plenty of fan room, but am unsure if it overheat if I keep it in a space like that.</p>

<p>You should really have started a new thread as old resurrected threads tend to get locked.</p>
<p>The xbox 360s and the xbox 360e don't have the same problems as the old white and elite consoles had so I wouldn't worry too much. &nbsp;I've left mine on for hours at a time in the past and had no problems.</p>
<p>It's still safer to save the game and switch off the console when not using though.</p>

<p>The MRT executive file is located in %System Root%\Windows\System32\MRT.exe.</p>
<p>It can be activated most easily in one of three ways;</p>
<p>1) Double click on the MRT.exe icon at home in its System32 Sub folder.</p>
<p>2) Via Start Button and Run ; enter MRT, upper or lower case makes no difference and click OK.</p>
<p>3) And last of all "my way" Access the MRT.exe icon in System32 (see above if you have forgotten already) right click on the icon and create a short-cut.
</p>
<p>Slide the short-cut icon outside the window onto your desktop.</p>
<p>The icon is now at your disposal for running the mini antivirus search. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution it DOES NOT search inside compressed files or your e-mail attachments.</p>
<p>And I do love the ICON " A window with soap suds and a sponge" as we say in France "très drole".</p>
<p>The search is extremely fast certainly less than a minute and easier than the "Stinger" type searchs ,which take just as long as a normal programme for a limited number of viruses.</p>
<p>The MRT Search Window is self explanatory but a useful facet is the ability to connect directly to MS for more information on a particular virus from the vertical list of viruses.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>lost my desktop - replaced by unnamed folder which can&#39;t be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dasincleve  say:</h3>
<h2>            lost my desktop - replaced by unnamed folder which can&#39;t be deleted</h2>
                    <p>I cleaned my registry and also went through most program related folders to delete duplicate and stray files from a poorly implemented migration to win7. Result... desktop&nbsp;showed up with none of my previous&nbsp;icons, and my c:\users\myname\desktop folder was
 empty except for desktop.ini and a mysterious unnamed folder (hidden, but as admin I show hidden folders/files). Inside the unnamed folder is an exact duplicate listing, and inside THAT unnamed folder is index.dat. I tried to open the index file but system
 can't deal with a file named&nbsp; c:\users\myname\desktop\ \ \index.dat (note single space where folder name should be).&nbsp; I added some files to my new desktop, and they get duplicated in the first&nbsp;unnamed folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equally bizarre: there is also an unnamed subfolder in my username folder (c:\users\myname\ \) and within that is an exact duplicate of my username folder contents including a second unnamed folder which then has an index.dat file with a different date than
 the one&nbsp;on my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also three duplicate Recycle Bin folders within the $Recycle.bin folder, but I'm able to delete two of them (then they appear in the remaining recycle bin folder). The remaining bin is named C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21-3105324091-2479176185-306241784-1000.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The two deleted bins are actually named C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (not 21)&nbsp; which&nbsp;lists a size of 1 KB even though it had full contents when opened... and</p>
<p>C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21-3105324091-2479176185-306241784-1006&nbsp; (same as above except 1006, not 1000). This shows a size of 1,372 KB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line, I'd like to recover all the files and shortcuts that I had on my desktop, and get rid of the pesky unnamed folders. If I hover over the unnamed folders, I see names of&nbsp;some of those lost files, but they don't show up when I open the unnamed
 folder - instead I get a copy of the parent folder.</p>
<p>I can't delete or rename or move&nbsp;the unnamed folders because I get an error message saying I don't have permission or can't because a file is in use by another program, or the file shown isn't there anymore. Another error appears to be due to the folder
 not having a name.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or explanations for this bizarre behavior and how to achive what I want ("bottom Line").</p>
<p>I would prefer not restoring the registry if I don't have to, because I had cleaned out a bunch of bogus stuff.</p>
<p>(I suppose I'm overthinking this because I'm a stubborn engineer and I want to understand how this works.)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>
<p>DAS</p>

            <p>Hi DAS</p>
<p>You did not mention the name of the program you used to clean the registry or remove the duplicate files? Most of these programs are just snake oil and are notorious for causing problems.</p>
<p>You do need to restore the registry. Hopefully the program you used&nbsp;created a backup prior to removing any keys.
</p>
<p>The same applies to removing the duplicate files. There are many common system file names that are used throughout Windows and having duplicate names is by design.
</p>
<p>I would recommend a System Restore back to a date and time prior to when any changes were made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>I used TweakNow PowerPack 2011, latest update. It is stated to be suitable for Win7-64bit on 64bit machine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I used their registry cleaner several times in sequence (rinse and repeat...). I may have been ok, but I looked at all the keys which they marked with warning may not be safe to delete and they LOOKED harmless to know-it-all me so i deleted them anyway.&nbsp;
 DUMB, EH?</p>
<p>Well fortunately the program <u>does</u> create a restore point backup before every run of the cleaner, or any other operation I do with their tools.</p>
<p>Regarding duplicate files... I meant duplicates in the same folder, like FILE.EXT and FILE(1).EXT&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a lot of those because I had the migration wizard transfer old files that I shouldn't have transferred.&nbsp; I think I was safe in deleting most of the
 old stuff, but may have gotten careless and was too thorough. </p>
<p>Will a system restore also restore deleted files? I haven't cleared out the recycle bin, so maybe OK?</p>
<p>What's with the unnamed files and multiple recycle bins???</p>
<p>BOTTOM LINE, I'll start using the way-back machine, but can anyone help me understand some of the mysteries I described? I'm really annoyed that I can't figure it out!</p>

            <p>Yes, i understand that... but why did messing with the registry delete some personal files that couldn't be retrieved when I went back using system restore? I think the clue is the nameless folder(s). I think I lost the registry pointer to the old desktop
 so it created a new (empty) one, and the lost pointer is the missing name for the nameless folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do i apply a name to the ghost folder so I can manipulate it??&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I can't do that, then I'd at least like to get rid of the ghosts and move on without the lost files (nothing critical, anyway).</p>

<h2>            &#91;HELP&#93; I&#39;m unable to buy a monthly Xbox LIVE Gold</h2>
                    <p>Hello there ! (I apologize if my english isn't good)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I decided to buy a monthly Xbox LIVE Gold the 06/21 but an error message appeared, saying that the Xbox LIVE service has several problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error code : 80182300</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I retried, and another message appeared : your Xbox LIVE account is blocked and doesn't accept purchases anymore (or something like this) (**** ?)<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Error code : 80153021</strong><br />
</p>
<p>3) So, I tried to buy it on my PC and another error message appeared : "Refused payment". (Seriously, why... ?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Restart my Xbox : nothing</p>
<p>- Hard restart : nothing</p>
<p>- Reset my Xbox : nothing...</p>
<p>- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Xbox LIVE services are working fine</span>
<strong>BUT</strong> when I test my connection to the services, I have a yellow icon with "Service alert" (that's the problem ?)</p>
<p>- My Microsoft account doesn't have a negative sold</p>
<p>- My purchase informations are complete ; I'm using Paypal and my account doesn't have a negative sold&nbsp;</p>
<p>- My Paypal country and my Microsoft country are the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am supposed to do ? I tried every solutions from the website support so don't send me these links, that's useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping the good resolution of this issue soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 OEM Key not working after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was eagerly waiting for Windows 10 and tried numerous things to get it to work. The way I finally did was to utilize the generic Windows 10 key (<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T)
 but now when I try and replace it with the one that came with my HP desktop it gives me the following error</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I found this thread with a similar error but am unsure if the same solution will work with Windows 10.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Pro 64bit searching for Updates forever - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro 64bit searching for Updates forever</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello,</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I installed Windows 7 64bit Professional on my Laptop last week (clean install after installing SSD), installed MSE, and searched for updates. Some were installed, including SP1; but after that, installing updates always resulted
 in kb982670 failing. I tried the Microsoft Fix it, in both the advanced and the normal mode, but it didn't help. As the failing update is a .NET-Framework-Update I thought that installing the latest version of .NET might make the update obsolete and thus fix
 the issue.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">But – nope. After installing the latest .NET-Framework, searching for updates never finishes. Instead, svchost.exe uses 50% CPU (namely netsvcs, dual-core machine) and ~1.5 gigs of RAM (4GB total), and 8 hours later (the longest
 I tried) nothing happened.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I plan to upgrade to Windows 10 next week when it becomes available, but I can't, because as Windows Update doesn't work the tool for upgrading is not installed. If that worked, missing updates for Windows 7 wouldn't bother me for
 another week, but this way I have to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Any ideas?<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Update: When checking in Taskmanager, I first see TrustedInstaller taking up up to 50% CPU an loading up RAM, after about 30 seconds svchost takes over and TrustedInstaller appears as idle.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Resetting Windows Update Components (https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/kb/971058) does not help, many dlls (including mshtml) won't register and no effect is apparent.</p>

In the end, I even tried an upgrade install, that did not work too (with included Service Pack). After that, I installed an offline upgrade pack with all updates that were released after SP1, and that finally fixed it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Had exact the same issue. Clean install of Windows 7. Installed drivers, updates, SP1. Then checking for updates failed and was stuck (checking for updates was going for 12 hours and without success). I was searching for solution and today I found Microsoft
 tool that helped me. I run the tool, it installed some updates, I rebooted my laptop and 192 updates waiting.<br />
<br />
I tried:<br />
<br />
- manual deleting of c:\windows\softwaredistribution\download<br />
- scf /scannow<br />
- DISM.exe tool<br />
<br />
Nothing helped until today I found this MS tool.</p>

    <title>Workgroup Network Application No Longer Works Win10 Pro 1709, worked - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Workgroup Network Application No Longer Works Win10 Pro 1709, worked on 1703</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small network environment, 3 computers setup in a workgroup setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main computer acts as a server, and the two other computers are clients.&nbsp; On 12/19 all the workstations were upgraded to Win10 ver 1709, because of the Christmas vacation no one tested the client computers to see if they could connect to the network
 application. Now the only computer able to connect to the network application is the host computer.&nbsp; All 3 computers in this small workgroup are the exact same machines, running the exact same software with exception to one of the computers being the host
 computer while the others are the clients. There is no domain in this network, it is a standard workgroup setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the software company that made the software and the settings are setup perfectly, the only difference is the version upgrade from where we were version 1703, to now version 1709. The software company that makes and sells this simple client/server
 software hasn't run into this problem, and the application worked perfectly before the 1709 update, on all workstations, network shares were visible without any problems, however after the 1709 update, network shares had problems being seen and the client
 server application will not launch from the client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked online and many people had the same problem, though they could not see the computer name or share in their network map, I was able to see the network map and share by reinstalling the network card drivers. I reset the network, made sure the firewall
 ports were open, I disabled firewall/antivirus, checked smb, reset dns, winsock etc, repaired the install, made sure network sharing was still setup etc. nothing will make these client computers connect to the main/host computer.&nbsp; I went through all of the
 material that was posted for 'unable to access or see network shares windows 10 1709'. Apparently a lot of people have had this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot roll back, since we were only given 10 days from the install to do it, however only noticed the problem 5 days ago. I tried uninstalling the patches with no effect. The application just will not run, even when going directly to the application
 and launching it.&nbsp; The only thing I haven't tried was completely reseting the computer from rescue CD and running it from a previous version of windows. However I did have a windows 7 computer that I tested running the application as a client and it still
 didn't work. So a windows 10 pro 1709 workstation cannot connect to the application, however can see it on the network, browse to the launch files, but won't launch, a windows 7 PC cannot connect to the application, however the host/main computer running windows
 10 pro 1709 can connect to it since it is running the application.&nbsp; Since the windows 7 PC has the same problem as the windows 10 PC has after the 1709 update, it is fair to say that wiping out the client computers and resetting them will not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help solving this problem. I tried connecting to the network from a wired connection and a wireless connection, reinstalled network card drivers etc. Nothing is getting this application working. Please help.&nbsp; Thanks, Rob</p>
