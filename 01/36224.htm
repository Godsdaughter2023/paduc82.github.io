<h2>            Microsoft Common Language Runtime native compiler high cpu usage</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span><span>I have version 1607 of Windows 10 Home currently loaded on my laptop. For the past few months I’ve had problems with Microsoft Compatibility
 Telemetry running almost constantly and using up around 20% of the CPU. This has been occurring both before and after the Anniversary Update. I decided to disable Compatibility Telemetry to see if that fixed the problem. It no longer turns on and is not causing
 any usage issues. However, I now have a problem with Microsoft Common Language Runtime native compiler running nearly constantly and using up about 20% of the CPU. The 32-bit version usually runs at the same time and has the same continuous high usage. Not
 only this, but sometimes Windows Host Processes (Rundll32) uses up 15-20% while it is running, which can be for several hours. When all the processes are running my total CPU usage will often be over 40% causing the entire computer to slow down so much that
 the programs I am trying to use (particularly web browsers) frequently lock up. The CPU fans also run flat out which is very noisy and&nbsp;my laptop will not automatically go into sleep mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>The first step I took for the issue with Microsoft Common Language Runtime native compiler was to close the process manually by disabling the
 process tree of ngentask.exe which then automatically terminates ngen.exe. This does work but, after a few minutes, ngen.exe and ngentask.exe restart. I have also tried terminating Windows Host Processes (Rundll32) when it is causing issues but it too just
 restarts within a few hours.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>Another issue that I’m not sure is related is that Windows Backup keeps failing. It hasn’t successfully completed a backup since about May.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>I have run system file checker several times but no issues were found. I have iolo System Mechanic Pro and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware free and
 they do not indicate the presence of any viruses or significant issues with the computer’s performance. My sister’s newer Toshiba also has had all the same issues (except for the failed backups). It is running the same version of Windows and also has System
 Mechanic and Malwarebytes loaded. </span></span></p>

</p><p><span>The CLR shouldn't be affecting your CPU usage that much. To further isolate this issue, let's try to manually install the latest cumulative update this month. Also, if you haven't tried it yet. Kindly perform a clean boot to your computer
 and let's see how it will respond.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sherry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed the latest Microsoft updates and performed a clean boot. My computer still has the same issues. In clean boot mode, Microsoft Common Language Runtime native compiler and Windows Host Processes (Rundll32) are still running constantly and using
 up lots of CPU.&nbsp;Windows Backup is also still failing with error code 0x80780166.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What steps should I take now?</p>

</p><p>Hi Sherry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue seems to be a common problem which is reported on many boards. It causes the CPU fan to run constantly as well. I haven't been able to get any of the recommended fixes to work.</p>

            Really need this sorted out. With all the Telemetry going on it should be a piece of cake. Been a LONG time now.<br />

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some reasons why you're having high CPU usage. One of the reasons is when there are updates running on the background. We suggest that you check the CPU performance on Task Manager to see which program or app caused the issue.<br />
<br />
Feel free to let us know if you have further queries.

            <p>Hi, Looks like instead of resolving this, added more issues. My computer is hanging for every 5 minutes and memory utilization shows 99% and mostly consumed by "Microsoft Commom Language Runtime native compiler".</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is not activated after replacing motherboard ..</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I tried flashing my BIOS on my MSI Gaming 3 motherboard today using their lovely MSI Update Utility and it goosed my motherboard completely.. after a bit of googling apparently this happens a lot..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I went to Scan computers and bought another..&nbsp;I've recently upgraded to windows 10 and it was activated, today I had to swap out my motherboard and now it isn't activated.. I know this is a weird one, but if I restore my windows to windows 7 and
 run through the upgrade again will this fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did want to do a fresh install but it's not going to work until I get my key back is it.. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S, I can see both computes when I go into manage my account and their both identical, so I can't remove one in hope it somehow activates the other because I don't know which one is which!</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Right Click on Start icon, then click
<strong>Run (Administrator)</strong>, then type: <strong>slui.exe 4<br />
</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>I've rang the number but it was a bad reception so he told me to try again but it was just the same.. He told me i need my original CD key for windows 7, i've recently moved house and have no idea where that is right now..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me, if i reset windows back to windows 7 and re-start the windows 10 upgrade process, will it activate windows again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing this will be a problem for anybody else if their motherboard dies on them and they haven't had chance to write their windows 10 product key down yet..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: It wont let me revert back to windows 7 because the files needed have been removed.. This is going from bad to worse..</p>

            <p>Is this a CUSTOM BUILT PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you install Windows 7 originally (yourself)?&nbsp; </p>
<p>If so, was it a Full Package Product (FPP)/Retail license or was it an OEM license?&nbsp; (Former would be in a nice DVD case with the sticker attached to the inside of the box; latter would be a cellophane wrapped/cardboard backed set of stuff with a loose sticker
 you are supposed to put on the machine once you install Windows.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming RETAIL licensing: Your issue is pretty specific - so your best bet would be to restore the system to the pre-Windows 10 state using the full system image backup you made to compliment your regularly scheduled backups right before you changed the
 underlying operating system that allows you to run all of your other applications and such.&nbsp; That will be the CLEANEST way to get back to square one and make sure everything is 'updated and working' before you upgrade again.&nbsp; (It is unlikely such a scenario
 would be tested often - although asking here in this peer-to-peer volunteer-based public worldwide web forum was probably your best bet to run across someone who might have experienced this or something similar either in BETA or in the 11 days since the release.)</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem.&nbsp; I replaced the cpu and&nbsp; motherboard and wound up with a Windows 10 that won't activate.&nbsp; Tried all the FAQ stuff and the other stuff microsoft recommended with no joy.&nbsp; I finally wound up calling tech support and was told to I had
 to reinstall everything all over again.&nbsp; My original W98 to W7 tp W10.&nbsp; I was also informed I'd have to do this EVERY TIME I upgrade my cpu or motherboard!</p>
<p>The free upgrade isn't worth it.&nbsp; W10 is designed to make it impossible for people who upgrade their own hardware to have it on their PC.&nbsp; I'm gonna go back to W7 and forget about this mess.&nbsp; There are literally thousands and thousands of folks in this same
 situation.</p>
<p>I can't believe that Microsoft would create an operating system that makes it impossible to work on your own system!</p>
<p>When they stop supporting W7 I plan on going to Linux Mint.&nbsp; I've had a windows machine ever since windows first came out but I've had it with being treated like a thief for working on my own equipment!</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>

<h2>            Skype Bug&#58; Kinect mic nonfunctional for Skype only.</h2>
                    <p>Since the update to Skype on my Preview-enrolled Xbox One, the Kinect microphone does not work with the app. I have the permissions set correctly—Skype is allowed to access my mic in the Settings page—and the Kinect mic works in all other situation, including game chat and voice commands.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>But now when&nbsp;making Skype calls only the video works. No one receives my audio, and occasionally&nbsp;I&nbsp;get an error message saying that my mic isn't working. But it is, just not for Skype, despite all the right settings as I said.</p>

            <p>None of these things are in preview now and I'm having the exact same issue. Nothing I do can make Skype use the Kinect as a microphone. Kinect voice commands work perfectly, so there's no issue at all with the hardware. Skype just does not use it, which makes Skype on the Xbox entirely useless. </p><p><br /></p><p>Is there any solution to this?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 pro retail box version number</h2>
                    How do you determine what version of Windows 10 Pro comes in a retail box. The last update crashed my computer with hardware incompatibilities. It was an upgrade from Windows 7 Pro that was installed from retail purchase. However, during a move the Windows
 7 Pro got lost. I would like to install straight Windows 10 Pro Version 1703 or earlier.

            Hi William.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Always use the latest media from the Media Creation Tool here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />Install tool, open tool, follow steps on download page to create the media.  
<br />
<br />If latest version cannot be made to run due to older hardware or software you cannot do without being already deprecated, I will help you find and install the earlier version and block the latest that doesn't work for you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for doing the best possible Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To creating a new Local Admin account, sign into it, test if the error repeats.  If not move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi William,
<br />You need to find a code of this license on your box, e.g. KW9-00477 or KW9-00500. Different codes mean different versions and languages. Than make a search in Internet for this code. I'm sorry I do not have database of this codes. I suppose Microsoft partners may have one.
<br />If you have access to USB drive you may check file dates.

            Hello William,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Licence obtained via migration are all qualified as Retail even if W7 or W8.1 OEM.
<br />
<br />If your digital licence was linked to your Microsoft account,  you can use the licence of your old PC to activate Windows 10 on a new PC. 
<br />It is called path exception, described in this article
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/...</a>
<br />Additionally, Microsoft provides an exception path for transferring a Windows License after a hardware change. You’ll need to be signed in to the same Microsoft account before making the hardware change and to use the exception path. 
<br />
<br />For that, you need 
<br />- to perform a clean install on the new PC 
<br />- to install exactly the same edition of Windows as on the old PC 
<br />- to connect on the new PC with your Microsoft account and Windows 10 will be automatically activated via the digital licence linked to your Microsoft account. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 is still not activated, 
<br />Select the Start  button &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Activation
<br />Then select Troubleshoot.
<br />If the troubleshooter can’t resolve the issue, you’ll see a link to reactivate after a hardware change. Select it to follow this path. 
<br />For more info, see the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530</a>

<br />Keep me informed.

            <p>If you have a "Retail" product key, yes you can use your product key to activate a 64Bit version of Windows 7. If you have an OEM product key then you can not use that key and must purchase a new product key for the version of Windows 7 you plan to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=====================================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the appropriate Windows 7 .ISO file (must match what your product key version is for)</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 32Bit: <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58996.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58997.iso</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
After downloading the .iso file use ImgBurn or Gear ISO to create a bootable DVD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ImgBurn - In addition to supporting the creation of Cds/DVDs from .ISO files, <br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free. <br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />

(The steps are the same, except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><br />
Note: Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p><br />
====================== Keyless Install ================================</p>
<p>How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p>After you enter user name and password you will be asked to: 'Type your Windows product key', do not enter a key.<br />
</p>
<p>Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p>During this 30 day grace period you can try resolving your problems.&nbsp; <br />
After you are satisfied all problems have been resovled then activate Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>====================== Device Drivers =================================</p>
<p>Go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are Windows 7 drivers, then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, USB, Graphics, Webcam, Etc., and so on.</p>

            Thanks Stuart... that was really helpful. Just one more question, how do you determine if your product key is OEM or retail? I purchased the original windows 7 along with the 32bit CD.<br />

Did it come in a box or in a slim package?</p>
<p>If it came in a green box, its the retail copy, which means, you should have both 32 and 64 bit DVDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it came in a slim package, with only the 32 bit DVD, then its an OEM System Builder license. You can still use the product key to change to the 64 bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium. You can download a copy from the following link:</p>

Note: Always use the slowest burn speed (4x or 2x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

Thanks Sumit,&nbsp;<br />

As I mentioned that everything was working fine before a regular windows update. That's why I asked that may be it has changed some settings.<br />

<h2>            Unable to install java or jre in Windows10 after upgrading from Windows8.1 to Windows10</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got my new laptop with Windows8.1 installed on it. I upgraded it to Windows10 using free upgrade and tried to install java on it. But it failed every time giving error code 1618. On further investigation, I found that this error comes when windows
 installer is already installing something. I tried to fix that but it didn't work. It Startup Type is set to manual always and that LOV is always disabled for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me resolve both issues related to java and windows installer as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate much on this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Anish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to uninstall all the third party security program installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When all the third party security programs uninstalled, enable Windows defender for protection and then place the computer in clean boot and try installing java and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about clean boot, refer to the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned

            <p>Hi Vinod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I have already tried those steps before I posted this issue on this forum actually but it didn't work at all. It seems to me a generic issue with Windows10 and Java; either of them are not supporting each other for sure. To support
 my argument here, I tried restoring factory settings for my laptop and reverted back to Windows8.1 and then tried to install Java. As expected, it worked fine for me there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, it looks like there are indeed some updates or fixes missing in this latest Windows10 edition which doesn't allow you install JRE or any Java update in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to fix this because I am not updating my system to Windows10 until this issue gets resolved and I am holding on 8.1 till then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>Ashish Kumar.</p>

            Hi Stefano
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />If you recently installed January and February cumulative updates for Windows 10 1809, uninstall them to see if it restores functionality.
<br />
<br />Just to confirm, you are running Windows 10 1809, right?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability is restore. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />If that does not help...
<br />
<br />
<br />Please try the steps recommended below to uninstall printer software again
<br />
<br />Option 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter - <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_printer10</a>
<br />
<br />If you are using an HP Printer, use the HP Print and Scan Doctor:
<br />HP Print and Scan Doctor - HP Support
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer
<br />A. Uninstall the Printer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features / Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer's website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers
<br />Reinstall the Printer driver
<br />Reboot the computer

<br />
<br />Some users have been reporting, specific make and models just stop working after either upgrading to Windows 10 1809 or a specific cumulative update under 1809. 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to do as you already did, rollback or try uninstalling the specific cumulative update that triggered the issue.

<h2>            Windows 10 is completely messed up after a random blue screen</h2>
                    <p>I've had no problem with Windows 10 until recently. I wanted to record gameplay of me and my brother playing mw3 just to edit the clip after we were done. So I set up my game capture device and started the software up on my computer then all of a sudden
 I got a blue screen. I've used this device before to record gameplay of my computer games and had no problem. &nbsp;So after the blue screen the computer came back on and was working alright except it is exceptionally slow, none of the modern apps are showing up
 on the task bar , the start button didn't work but I fixed that by going into safe boot and coming back out of that, when I do find a workaround to open the modern app it displays as a path ex: Microsoft.zunevideo(Movies &amp; Tv) &nbsp;but no icon shows up on the
 task bar. The preview pane in explorer is in the middle of the screen and shows up as a application on the taskbar . I've already contacted Microsoft and the woman I spoke to said to reinstall Windows 10 and it would fix all corruption. So I did and it didn't
 do anything :(</p>

                    <p>To cut a long story short I have been using Edge since it came out with Windows 10 and its been brilliant, but the past few weeks I have been getting the same message: Hmm, we can't reach this page. For several websites I commonly visit, such as 3D Warehouse
 for Google, and many more. I have tried everything I can think of to resolve the problem but its now spread to my Windows 10 Laptop, the Microsoft Edge browser doesn't work at all with my home Internet connection, only with a different connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really lost with this, and don't want to go back to using Google Chrome. </p>

<p>My question should really be addressed to the Windows Update team at Microsoft, but has anyone heard when &nbsp;we may expect an update to fix this vulnerability? &nbsp;I can't even find libupnp, much less know how to disable it, though I tried searching
 in Device Manager with no results.</p>

<h2>            Halo 3&#58; ODST for Master chief collection</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible for the free code to be lost? I checked, I've bought the game 11.29.2014 from email receipt, but my first achievement is from 1.11.2015.</p>
<p>How can i check if i actually played it during the free period so I'd be eligible for the ODST campaign?
</p>
<p>There's no message regarding Halo in my Xbox live inbox and obviously there's nothing in the not installed DLC category in my games menu since I've not redeemed anything.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in forums for this issue. If you aren't sure that you redeemed your code, then you'd want to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
check out your Order History in your Microsoft account</a> to see if it was redeemed. There really isn't any way to check in the system if you played it specifically on a Free Play period, sadly, but go ahead and check out the redemption of the code. If it
 wasn't redeemed and was lost, then there would be no way to replace it, sorry to say; however, if you don't find a code redeemed, then you likely downloaded during a free play weekend and just never uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps out.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately as stated before there is no way to track your playtime with specific time stamps to verify if you were eligible for the offer to receive the free campaign for the game on the Master Chief Collection. Even if you were eligible, the offer is
 about 4 years old so there would be no way 343 Industries would still be supporting this promotion. However, we are glad to hear that you are at least still able to play the game through backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will now be locking this thread since no further discussion is needed. Please feel free to come back anytime if you have any other questions or concerns and we would be more than happy to help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and have a great day!</p>

    <title>Win 7 cannot find driver for my new external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nash212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 cannot find driver for my new external hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a Transcend StoreJet 25D2 portable hard drive. When I plug it in to my Windows 7 laptop, it shows that a new device has been found, but then I get an error message that the device could not be installed because a driver for it could not be
 found.</p>
<p>They don't have drivers for this model on the Transcend website. And this same drive is working on my Windows XP pc, which found the drivers itself. I even formatted the drive but it still isn't working with Windows 7. I also tried using the drivers that
 Windows xp is using, which are already on my laptop (windows\system32\drivers...), but that does not work either.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
We don’t have any information about its compatibility with windows 7 on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=Transcend StoreJet 25D2&amp;results=50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows 7 compatibility center</a> website.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>You may try connecting it to different USB ports and check if it gets detected.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Remove and reinstall all USB controllers</p>
<p>To remove and reinstall all USB controllers, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click Start, click Run, type sysdm.cpl in the Open box, and then click OK.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click the Hardware tab. <br />
3.&nbsp;Click the Device Manager button. <br />
4.&nbsp;Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers. <br />
5.&nbsp;Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.<br />
6.&nbsp;Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers. <br />
7.&nbsp;Plug in the Transcend StoreJet 25D2 portable hard drive, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>For further assistance I would recommend you to contact its manufacture. I would also suggest you to check if the manufacturers have released any latest firmware for it.</p>

<p>Hi Umesh. Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>As far as compatibility goes, on the box of the hard drive it says that it is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>I tried connecting it to my 3 different USB ports and get the same problem. It<em> is</em> detected, but just not installed. I'll try uninstalling my USB ports as you said. Just one question though, how do I reinstall them after restarting my PC?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does the external drive show up on windows explorer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>USB controller’s driver will automatically be installed on restart. Also do check if the same external hard drive works on any other windows 7 computer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So I did what you asked - uninstalled all my USB controllers, but now after restart none of them are being installed either, and I'm getting the same message as when I tried installing the external drive: no driver found. Even when I go into device manager
 and try manually updating the devices, it still says it can't find a driver.</p>
<p>NOW what do I do? None of my USB ports are working. I guess this means there's something wrong with the ports????</p>
<p>To answer your questions...the external drive did not show in Windows Explorer and I don't have access to another Win 7 pc to see if it works or not.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to try the below methods, one by one, and check if this helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run windows update.<br />
Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-update</a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Install the latest chipset drivers and check. For chipset driver I would recommend you to contact the laptop’s manufacturer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows update doesn't find any drivers for the USB ports. I downloaded the Intel Chipset Installation Utlity from the HP website but that doesn't seem to do anything. However, randomly some of the USB ports were installed when I restarted, but some are
 being shown in device manager as "unknown devices" The reason how I know those are related to the USB ports is because in 'properties' they are all shown as located on "on Intel(R) ICH9 Family USB Universal Host Controller" but again, when I try to update
 their drivers manually, it says driver not found. Probably because they are unknown devices?</p>
<p>None of my USB ports are working still. Some of my HP programs have also not been working, I think ever since I installed either Norton Internet Security 2010 (even though it was a reinstallation), or IDT High Definition Audio Codec. Maybe the USB thing
 is also related to this?</p>

<p>All the drivers come with Win 7 there are no drivers for WD I have just bought a 2tb WD and it’s not seen by Manage Hard disks can be switched online or anything else as it’s not seen. Yet two weeks ago I backed up to 1 tb drive same
 docking station and now after updates its not seen either. Just took the latest SP1 and it didn’t help. So many people are having trouble with ext drives it means Win 7 has a flaw! No ifs no buts!</p>

            I am as angry as the gentleman before me.&nbsp; I have tried several external drives an not one of them is recognized by Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; Your software cost plenty and I very disappointed that what one would think is something rather routine is screwed
 up. Now I have 5 external hard drives where I have tons of data&nbsp; and I am unable to retrieve it.
<br />
<br />
I do not understand what your software developers do, but they need to get out and get some air.&nbsp; Didn't anyone try a device to see if it work?<br />

</p><p>Who ever have the same problem (can't detect only CERTAIN external hard disk, but still can use other USB for thumbdrive and mouse), Please, DO NOT UNINSTALL every USB controller, otherwise, you can't use your USB at all and hard to reinstall everything.</p>

<br />
<br />Go to settings &gt; sign-in options &gt; scroll down to pin
<br />
<br />Under pin click "forgot my pin" and follow prompts.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, use this guide here to recover it from the lock screen: <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/18/windows-10-tip-recover-pin-password-lock-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />
<br />Should be good to go
<br />
<br />Please keep me updated on the situation as I continue to research and find the fix with you!

<h2>            Huge problem with &#34;ERROR 0xc00d002f&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a really annoying error message for my media files. I'm trying to play some videos that are .wmv files but every time i try to play them i get this message,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't play.</p>
<p>Please try again. If the problem continues, visit www.xbox.com/support to check for guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>0xc00d002f</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked xbox.com/support as well but I still couldn't get this issue resolved. I also tried to change the file type to .avi and .mp4 but still the same message appears. I also tried other media players like Windows Media Player, MXPlayer, and VLC which
 lead to the same result. I also made all the updates necessary to the players and the laptop. I've literally tried everything I could think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's anyone out there that can lend me a hand I would really appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            any real answer to this issue, in other words, can you make suggestions to fix my computer rather than copy the file and take it to another computer???

    <title>Restoring Windows 7 image to a different drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foxache4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring Windows 7 image to a different drive</h2>
                    <p>Every week or so I use Windows 7's built-in 'Back up and Restore' to create an image of my local drive, which is then saved onto an external USB hard drive. Yesterday I bought a new (bigger) SSD to replace my existing one and am trying to restore the image
 of the old SSD to the new one, but what I thought would be a 5 minute job has so far been the opposite.<br />
<br />
If I boot from my Windows installation DVD using 'normal' BIOS, I can get as far as choosing the image I want to use before I get an error message saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Windows cannot restore a system image to a computer that has different firmware. The system image was created on a computer using EFI and the computer is using BIOS".</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then boot from the DVD using EFI I can only get as far as clicking the 'Restore Windows from image' option after the setup files load, at which point I get an error saying that the recovery disk is incompatible and to try another disk.<br />
<br />
Out of interest, I tried booting from BIOS and restoring the image to my old SSD and that worked fine so I know that the image and the installation DVD are both ok.</p>
<p>Surely there must be some way to do it, as the whole point of being able to restore from an image is that you can do it to a different drive not just the same one??</p>

    <title>Setting to connect public wifi network only when a secure network is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> medroc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting to connect public wifi network only when a secure network is not avaiable</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 10 in my laptop. At my home, my personal wifi is a password "protected" secure connection. But my PC always connects to public unsecure wifi network when equally strong my home wifi network is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at present, I select to forget the "Public" network in my PC, so that it defaults to my home network. But when I go out, I have to manually connect the "Public" network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want it to connect to saved secure networks by default and only connect to public wifi when no saved secure networks are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not find any setting that will help me change this behavior.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooters did not find any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no problem in connecting to a network or internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 wifi networks available with excellent strength range. One Wifi network (say Network A) is a secure, home wifi network. Another Wifi Network (say Network B) is a public wifi hotspot. Both are in range and with excellent strength. Both networks
 are set "Connect Automatically", so when I am outside my home, I can still be online with Network B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At home, I expect my PC to connect to Network A only. But, Network B is always connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, I uncheck "Connect Automatically" for Network B. But when I am outside, I should manually connect to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish there was a setting to set preference in network, or say first connect to Secure network and then to unsecure / public networks.</p>

 contacts. I cannot reproduce the problem you are mentioning. If you are experiencing issues make sure they are not related to 3rd party plugins, programs or drivers causing FireFox, web content, or your system to behave oddly.

<h2>            Ring or notifications in headset and speakers&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased a headset for my Skype calls. The problem is, with the headset plugged in I can't hear when someone calls me unless I am wearing the headset. Is it possible for the ring or audible notification to come through my speaker and when I am
 on a call the audio comes through my headset? Thank you.

            Hear, hear. This is a common feature in telephony programs. Very bad decision to remove it. Means I miss Skype calls all the time now and people end up calling me on the phone instead.

            Microsoft you really need to bring this feature back to Skype.&nbsp; The external ringing of calls is essential to not miss calls.&nbsp; My headset is always plugged in so it is ready to answer the calls quickly.&nbsp; If there is noise in the room it is hard to hear
 the ringing through the headphones sitting on the desk.

            I am trying to figure out why they removed this feature in the first place. Did they just think it was superfluous?...that no one was using it and they could save a few lines of code? Had they just introduced some feedback/echo canceling feature that they
 were so proud of, they thought no one would want to use headphones for calls anymore...or they wanted to push us to throw out our headphones? Whatever the case, why antagonize their users by forcing them to change their ways of doing thing? Do they just want
 us to stop using their product and go to some competitor? I really don't understand it.<br />
<br />
If anyone at Microsoft who works in development on Skype sees this, or anyone who gets to make product decisions, then this is for you: YES, a lot of us would like to have that feature back. I have almost completely stopped using Skype for messaging and online
 calls, as the latest versions of both the classic version of the app and the Windows 10 native one make it too hard to know when I get a notification. I've just given up and moved to something else.<br />
<br />
So if that was your strategy...to get everyone off Skype so you can finally stop supporting it, it's worked on me. If not, then for the classic app please put the feature where notifications can go to one audio device and actual call audio can go to another
 back in. For the new Windows 10 app, OBVIOUSLY make it so that notifications can be heard when Skype is not the active window, and also obviously include the feature for using different audio devices for notifications and for calls.

</p><p>I have tried your new version of Skype several times hoping you would fix this issue. I cannot wear my headset all the time so I have to hear when a call comes&nbsp; in. In your classic version I am able to do this by setting the notification to my PC speakers
 and the actual call to my headset.&nbsp;<span><em><strong>Why did you take this feature away?</strong></em></span>&nbsp;That is a very bad decision.&nbsp;<strong>Are there any plans to rectify this situation
</strong>or do I need to research other programs to utilize for voice applications?&nbsp; And by the way the Turtle Beach headset from your list does not help with this situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft is now using one code base for Skype on a technology called React Native. Hopefully, they have the ability to tweak the code to support a "Ring On" feature for Windows. Another solution would be to ring on all audio output devices that are detected
 on the Windows system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people use headsets with a secondary audio output so this is a must have feature.</p>
