            Hi Nina.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />Check also in your Downloads folder and type into the Search box Avira to see if there might be a file or download on the PC that is being found by the buggy Windows Upgrade Assistant.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</span></strong><span>and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows </strong>
key from the keyboard, type <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> and select <strong>
Run as administrator.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>

<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Set-PhysicalDisk -FriendlyName &lt;diskname&gt; -Usage Retired</span></strong></p>
</li></ul>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span><span><span>(If the pool is clustered, you will need to run this command on the cluster node which has the cluster resource for the pool online.)</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to performing step 5, you must wait for all active repair jobs to complete. To monitor the status of repair jobs, type the following command:
<strong>Get-StorageJob</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Type the following command: <strong>Remove-PhysicalDisk -FriendlyName &lt;diskname&gt;</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Physically disconnect the old disk.</span></p>

            Hi jin2015,
<br />
<br />That is a recovery partition that should not be in view, this is a common issue that arose after the 1803 April 2018 Update. You will need to remove the drive letter and mount point in DiskPart in order to do this. The volume will be intact, but it will be out of view so you don't have to worry about it, especially after going through this process.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run. Type in the following: diskpart
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the new DiskPart window:
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />select volume NUMBERHERE
<br />...or: select volume LETTERHERE
<br />
<br />remove letter=LETTERHERE
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please do let me know if this fixes it.       
        </p>

            Hello Hazelhay,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;Did your microphone come with any software? &nbsp;If so, did you use the disk to install the software? &nbsp;If it didn't come with any software you can go to logitech's website and download drivers for your device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have already installed the software as well as your device. &nbsp;Check in control panel, sounds, and ensure that the input device is not set to internal, but instead set to your logitech device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also try checking your device on another system. &nbsp;This could prove that the device is or is not defective.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let us know if this information did or didn't help to resolve your problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

    <title>MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN - a SCAM&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melissamize  say:</h3>
<h2>            MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN -   a SCAM&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN - A SCAM??</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I too purchased this plan, and my credit card called me immediately saying it was being billed outside of the United States, saying Microsoft was an American company within American borders. They were calling to ask me to be sure this was the REAL
 Microsoft company. I said I felt like it, but now questioned it, seeing this was the only time my credit card company ever called me, interrupting a sale, being flagged by them as a SCAM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I went ahead of the transaction, over the next year. Then I paid again for a second year. But although I had some doubts, was confused as I called the real Microsoft in America, who only found this online... warning on internet search 'it could be
 a SCAM'. So they said they felt they may be recommending the Microsoft Assure Plan and selling it as a product not theirs. And this company talked me in to purchasing another program called TREND MICRO MAXIMUM SECURITY as an anti virus program. When you call
 the Microsoft program, they even recommend it, but say it is not "theirs" but what they recommend and what they are selling right now. That raised a red flag with me too. Why would they sell a product not theirs?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Late last year, a man called me (all heavy accents) saying I was on a list for this program, and if I did not pay I would immediately get several viruses on my computer, as my subscription ran out. I record all my calls and warned whoever this is,
 he was committing a crime in attempts to threaten me to give him money, or else attack my computer (or lie with that threat). I told him not to call me again. Then several months later, someone again with a heavy accent called my home demanding money, saying
 they were Microsoft for the same thing. I laughed and said I already reported them to the police, and told them it was illegal for them to call me as we are on the NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY, and DO NOT CALL LIST for our state.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The man got mad and said he refused to stop calling me as I said he was a SCAMMER. I said it is true, he is a scammer if he is demanding money "or else he would put my computer email on a list in order to intentionally get viruses." He then called
 me 5 times in the hour. I recorded the calls and called police. The police man laughed at the man, saying HE WAS A SCAMMER, and put it in his report in the event I should get my identity stolen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then in Dec. 2015, I was having problems with my computer. I called the same tech support line, but this man demanded $150 from me saying my outlook email was out of date, and they did not support that anymore. I told him that is not why I was calling,
 I paid $150 for the support program, and $150 for Trend Micro which was only causing problems with my computer - and tempted to REMOVE. So he was not going to get a dime more from me. I just needed him to do his job of removing spyware, malware, viruses etc.
 on my computer, which I already paid for a 1 year subscription. He said he refused since my outlook was not updated, and likely causing problems. I hung up on him and called again getting a nice young woman (all heavy non-American accents).
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>She was helpful and&nbsp;said I had over 800 viruses on my computer, and laughed at me. I said she was laughing at&nbsp;their product they sold me, the&nbsp;lousy Trend Micro they sold me that did not help. Of course, the reply was they can not protect from all
 viruses. I said I had been helped 3 weeks earlier, cleaning up my computer with them. So apparently if at that time they removed over 1,800 items off my computer, and 3 weeks later there was 800 more, then what they sold me is not removing anything - not a
 single thing, instead of the line they feed you (can't protect from ALL, should be changed to can't protect from ANY.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The "Assure Plan" did work and clean up my computer, better than two American big box store computer places I took my computer to (which deleted my photos and everything was lost on my computer). But who do we believe, when people write in saying
 this is a scam, then others write in saying it is a real Microsoft service?? And then I get phone calls demanding money for hostage, in exchange for NOT releasing my email to intentionally receive more viruses, malware, spyware, etc.?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Coincidence?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don't know if any of these are related to Microsoft, or how the scam man got my name, phone number, and email address (twice). But I really question it all now, when my computer is not working. Could this be some country looking for not only personal
 info, but government secrets, like what Hillary Clinton found out sending her government server to a private company to manage? These people take over your computer from a remote location.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I found out the real Microsoft was recommending this, but did not know anything about it, and when they 'googled it' found the words SCAM related to it. So what do we believe when Microsoft does not know what their employees are recommending?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AND SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE US THE REAL MICROSOFT CUSTOMER SERVICE TELEPHONE NUMBER? I called a local store who got it from their geek squad. They said they too sold the support, but did not know anything about it. When they googled it, they were the
 ones who were shocked, seeing the words "scam" attached (many times over). This was the real Microsoft, per the local computer sales store. So Microsoft was selling something, that my credit card company "red flagged" as a scam, and I only later found out
 others question is a possible 'scam'. Who do we trust, when the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>thank you for your much needed help!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have Windows 7 that was upgraded to Windows 10 by a tech support rep from this shady company, Microsoft or not.</strong></p>

            <p>IF THIS IS THE REAL MICROSOFT (ASSURE PLAN), then why are you outsourcing your work to non-American's who can't speak clear English???&nbsp; This was another "red flag" to me.&nbsp; I have spoken to people over the last 1-1/2 year from the Microsoft Assure Plan as
 phone reps, identifying themselves as being outsourced from 4 different countries, ALL NON UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are plenty of tax paying Americans, especially American military Veterans who want and need good jobs. So (if this is the real Microsoft) why don't you hire English speaking tax paying Americans, instead of outsourcing to non-American countries and
 staff, who hold the service we already paid for&nbsp;as 'HOSTAGE', in exchange for $150 more??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And is this the same people calling my home, saying our subscription has ran out, demanding more money... "or else release our email addresses and ip address in order to (intentionally) get MORE VIRUSES, MALWARE, SPYWARE,..." etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who is the company and people we are giving direct access and remote control over our computers, in order to assist us?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are calling themselves MICROSOFT.&nbsp; So the real MICROSOFT needs to speak up and expose these people IF THEY ARE NOT RELATED, AND IF THIS IS A SCAM PROGRAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS MICROSOFT ASSURE PLAN ($150) a real plan sold by the 'real' Microsoft??&nbsp; or a SCAM???</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY IS MICROSOFT REMAINING SILENT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM, SOLD UNDER THEIR READ (TRADEMARKED)&nbsp;NAME???&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT HAS STOCK HOLDERS WHO NEEDS TO LOOK IN TO THIS.&nbsp; IF THIS IS NOT THE REAL MICROSOFT, IS THIS A NICHE WHICH IS MISSING AS A SERVICE WHICH SHOULD BE SOLD TO USERS? PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT THIS PLAN.&nbsp; IT IS NOT UNTIL AFTER THEY PAY THE MONEY,
 DO THEY BEGIN TO WONDER IF THIS IS EVEN THE 'REAL MICROSOFT' THEY ARE DEALING WITH.&nbsp; IF NOT, WHY IS MICROSOFT ALLOWING THIS TO GO ON???</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY ARE CUSTOMERS THE ONLY ONES SPEAKING PUBLICLY ABOUT THIS?? WHERE IS THE MICROSOFT THE PEOPLE TRUST, REGARDING THIS ISSUE??</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I apologize for the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, I would also suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run
 the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that Microsoft DOES NOT contact customers by telephone this way.&nbsp; The only time Support Engineers from Microsoft contact customers by phone is if the customer contacts Technical
 Support first and requests that we call them</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>

            <p>I was hacked yesterday. Have Windows 10/windows Defender. Tried to buy refrig. filters online. Got Black screen with error message purporting to be from Microsoft saying my computer was in danger from malware. I was not to proceed online but was to call
 an 1-800 number for help.&nbsp; Which I did much to my regret. My computer was completely taken over by the Indian accented "helper." He was in my security settings, files. Everything! He down loaded an app that sent all my info to him via "Rescue by Log Me In.
 "&nbsp; He also downloaded an ad blocker "Adblockerplusie" for IE.&nbsp; He wanted $211/year, $600/5 yrs for a "Lazarus" program for added security. When he asked for my billing address I hung up&nbsp; and shut off computer.&nbsp; I ran full Defender scan that did not show ANYTHING
 WRONG. I deleted those apps from my downloads/recycle bin. When I chatted with Microsoft security (also Indian). He recommended I run daily Defender scans. Also
<strong>suggested I buy Microsoft&nbsp; Assure Plan at $149/yr. &nbsp;I felt I was being scammed again!
</strong>I declined. </p>
<p>So far computer seems to be running fine but I worry about what info the hackers got.

</p><p>NO ONE is answering the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DOES or DOES NOT Microsoft offer a plan for their customers called Assurance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a yes or no question and surprisingly I can't find the answer on line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know SEVERAL people that have this "plan" but most do not sound legit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if it IS legit, you SERIOUSLY need to retrain your people in other countries... because they don't have a
</p>
<p>clue of what they are doing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not, maybe Microsoft will just answer the yes or no question here for us.

            OEM versions of Windows--those that come installed on new PCs--are supported by the PC manufacturer in accordance with their agreements with Microsoft.&nbsp; This means that these versions, as opposed to retail versions, will get only very limited support from
 Microsoft.&nbsp; The so-called Assurance plan is indeed a Microsoft offering intended to provide service to customers who have OEM versions of Windows.

            <p>So you are saying that newer computers need the support over older computers.&nbsp; But most of what I read don't describe newer computers buying the plan.&nbsp; In fact, I have an older computer, and have the Assure Plan.&nbsp; Only after the second year when Windows
 10 came out, one of the assistants working on my computer install Windows 10 on my Windows 7 older computer.&nbsp; So frankly, I don't know which version to claim anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And every single assistant gives up cleaning my computer, due to the high number viruses taking so many hours.&nbsp; Sometimes in the evening they don't answer their phones.&nbsp; At other times, I can get help around the clock, BUT NEVER ONCE FROM AN AMERICAN, or&nbsp;WITHIN
 U.S. BORDERS!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a real Windows plan, then Microsoft should claim it publicly.&nbsp; And if it is not, then Microsoft should let customers know (especially here), and start a service like what this plan offers to customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Microsoft sell and recommend an anti-virus that is not theirs?&nbsp; The M.S. Assure Plan reps sells and recommends competitor products to Microsoft for anti-virus.&nbsp; If the Assure Plan is a real Microsoft Plan, why would they NOT sell their own M.S.
 product, recommending &nbsp;non-M.S. competitor software instead?</p>

<h2>            Watch Dogs gamestop code</h2>
                    
<p>So I got the palace pack code from gamestop printed on my receipt, I follow the instructions on the receipt to redeem the code and realize its a ubisoft code. Did anyone else get a ubisoft code or a standard 25 character code? Because I have no option to
 redeem a ubi code when I select "redeem code" in the watch dogs additional content menu.</p>

<p>This appears to be a problem with codes given out by GameStop. A quick search on Google shows PC/PlayStation and Xbox owners are all experiencing this problem with GameStop passing the buck as usual.</p>
<p>Xbox codes should all be 25 digits long. I'd be surprised if Microsoft was allowing uPlay codes to be redeemed against the system.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 crash minidumps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danglingpointer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 crash minidumps</h2>
                    <p>On my desktop computer, Windows 8 is crashing after every few hours, when I revoke it remotely after some inactivity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, yesterday I was connected via RDC on my laptop. I had opened 4 projects in Visual Studio 2012. I went to sleep and both laptop leaving both laptop and desktop running .. waste of energy :&lt; ... Next morning, when I tried maximized RDC window,
 the it crashed and RDC showed the disconnect dialog. I rushed to other room and it was dumping memory with sad face on screen. After the restart, I had to repair VS2012 pro installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just now, while I was just browsing the web on it remotely (mostly TechNet and Sysinternal websites to diagnose this issue), it crashed again. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the folder containing the minidump files: <a href="http://sdrv.ms/T5ziU4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://sdrv.ms/T5ziU4</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please tell me&nbsp;what's going wrong? </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing to post in the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>I understand that the Windows 8 is crashing. It would help if you could let us know about any changes that you made to the computer prior to the issue.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you refer the link and follow the methods from the knowledge base article.</p>
<p>Windows hangs or freezes</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By change if you mean have I installed software, then yes I installed Visual Studio 2012 pro, Windows 8 SDK, Windows Phone 8 SDK, Office 2013 and couple of Windows Store apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw similar questions on Microsoft Community website. Most of the times people are asked to post the minidumps (which I did) and it turns out to be a hardware&nbsp;driver or buggy/clashing software&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I don't know how to detect the bug from the dumps, would you please take a look and see if you can&nbsp;find any anomaly&nbsp;logged&nbsp;in those dump files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Apprecuate your responding but there is nothng in Gregs Link that addesses 1903,&nbsp; and it is old info going back to 2015 and the most recent reply was in Late 2018 # 79.&nbsp; The problem is with the most recent release and the Media to download&nbsp; 1903.&nbsp; Microsoft
 even admits the problem and did make an update but it did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I had 1903 Preview as as insider and it ran great, Who knows how one can screw up a program to run a finalized version for the General Public.&nbsp; Only Microsoft.&nbsp; This is a repeat
 of the Fall 2018 release that wasn't finally corrected until like January of 2019&nbsp;

<p>Ok, sorry a larger drive did not work but just in case, using something larger than 32 GB will not prove anything since the largest partition size is 32 GB for Fat 32.&nbsp; I may have just been lucky with my four installs and I have no idea why mine worked,
 but the 32 GB partition size is relevant in several areas with Win 10 so just possibly it is acceptable for that reason only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the larger drive did not work then my first two systems had to be installed first by a direct download and update and the second one I copied the .iso file and mounted it on that system and ran the update from there.&nbsp; If you were to use Rufus to set up
 your drives, since it uses two partitions, neither of which is the full 32 GBs, it may also be subject to
<em>my </em>perceived limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, this problem is limited to the Installer and not the basic build.&nbsp; But since you ran it as an Insider, the install must have worked for that so possibly they made some change the Insiders did not see.</p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Skype&#58; People could see me but I couldn&#39;t see them</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a regular Skype user but I recently faced an issue I was pretty sure I didn't have in the past: I couldn't see my contacts when making video calls while they could see me. Some other Windows 8.x apps like the Camera or Movie Moments didn't cause
 me any problem though.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>I have a 6 years old Sony Vaio VGN-CR31Z PC - not supported by Sony under Windows 8.x - that somehow drove me to **** with regard to finding the appropriate drivers to make it work as expected under Windows 8.x in 64-Bit mode. The main reason is that Sony
 doesn't provide any 64-bit driver for this computer and many others that are too old ones - I can't blaim them for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BIGGEST CHALLENGE I HAD</strong></p>
<p>With regard to my needs the biggest challenge with this PC was to find the right video driver (it has an ATI Mobility Radeon x2300) that works under Windows 8.x in 64-bits mode given that AMD - who owns this ATI chipset - stopped maintaining drivers for
 this kind of video cards years ago. After some investigations and testing I finally found one.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPGRADE TO WIN8.1</strong></p>
<p>When I upgraded to Windows 8.1 I decided not to use the above ATI driver anymore but the Microsoft basic video driver that provides the same screen resolution as the ATI one I found. I thought I would be fine with the MS driver and I was... until I started
 to make video calls with my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>After thinking about this "Skype" video calls problem I remembered of the video card driver change I made during my upgrade to Windows 8.1. Although I wasn't sure this could be the root cause of my problem I reinstalled the ATI video driver and this fixed
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
<p>I don't have enough expertise to say - for sure - this problem is due to the video card, to its specificities, to its implementation by Sony and/or to something else but the one thing that is obvious to me is: you can expect the same kind of behavior with
 a different PC and/or a different video card if you don't have the appropriate video driver and Skype has probably nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>I'm not going to roll-back to Windows 8.0 to verify this but I'm convinced that I would have had the same problem under Window 8.0 without the specific ATI video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lz. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 April 2018 Creator Update breaks Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 and Intel 82579LM network adapters</h2>
                    <p>I have a few Dell E6420 laptops with both the Intel 82579LM and the Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 NICs. &nbsp;I just updated one of the laptops to the latest April 2018 creator update and now neither card works. &nbsp;They both show as connected but it says no internet.
 I've tried multiple wireless networks as well as multiple wired connections but I'm getting the same issue. &nbsp;I've tried uninstalling the driver via device manager and rebooting. &nbsp;I've tried downloading a new driver from Dell but I get the window that tells
 me the most current driver is already being used. &nbsp;Has anyone else ran into this and if so could you be so kind to share your solution?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recovery disks are not able to do&nbsp;the work involved in the Microsoft solution to your problem</p>
<p>You need to use a Microsoft&nbsp;produced Vista DVD for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>There are various methods to reinstall Vista</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Windows Vista download available from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>To reinstall Vista using their Recovery Disk/s, you Boot from the 1st Recovery&nbsp;Disk they supply&nbsp;and follow the Manufacturer's instructions to reinstall:</p>
<p>You will have to change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD Drive 1st in the Boot Order:</p>
<p>How to change the Boot Order in BIOS:</p>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs, and replace product manuals"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

<h2>            VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE &#40;nvlddmkm.sys&#41; - nVidia GT 240 - 341.74, 341.81 - Windows 10 crash</h2>
                    <p>
</p><div>As many others are, I'm getting massive <strong>VIDEO TDR FAILURE (nvlddmkm.sys) crashes on Windows 10.&nbsp; Restoring a system image of Windows 8.1 fixes everything, but I'd like to use Windows 10.
</strong></div>
<div>The video card is an nVidia GeForce GT 240 running driver version 9.18.13.4174, 341.74 as provided by Windows Update. That version of the driver is not available on the nVidia website for some reason. Again, this driver was provided by Microsoft's Windows
 Update as something that is supposed to be compatible with Windows 10. I've deleted the drivers, used a driver cleaner and reinstalled the Windows Update provided drivers a few times. Removing the drivers completely prevents the crashing (but that's no way
 to work). </div>
<div>
<p>It seems that the video card is overheating, but I'm not sure if that's the only reason for the crashes. I'm&nbsp; sure it's the drivers.&nbsp; Sometimes the BSOD says
<strong>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (dxgkrnl.sys) as well.&nbsp; I have tried using </strong>
<a href="http://gaming.msi.com/features/afterburner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MSIAfterBurner to underclock the GPU to its minimum speed and set the GPU fan to 100%. That has not prevented the crashes, but seems to have reduced the frequency.</a></p>

            <p>Nvida updated a bunch of video cards yesterday, but I did not see the gt240 as having a new driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might do a news search of Lenovo+bios and read about the Lenovo bios in the news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its a laptop, you need to feel the intake air duct and output air duct and see if air is flowing. You can also use smoke to look at it. Note the air duct on laptops is usually on the bottom of the laptop, and if not on a desk, but being held in the lap
 the air intake duck is usually blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to reinstall thermal paste on the gpu and take apart the computer and manually remove any blockage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it is a laptop, this is a huge, huge job. Need the service manual and a micro screwdriver set. Avoid if at all possible !!! Would take you a week if you have never repaired a laptop before. A very tedious complicated&nbsp;job.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right about Windows 10 it is a great OS and worth installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has to work harder during an install, so if the gpu had dried up themal paste and clogged air ducts, this would push it over the edge to overheat.&nbsp; Any cpu intensive program would cause it to overheat if there was a problem before install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;I would download OpenHardware Monitor (0.7beta...free) and&nbsp; let it run for realtime gpu/cpu temps and see just how hot it was getting, and determine if you need to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Maybe wait on nvida a few days for a new driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplug and replug both the router and cable modem. The cable modem takes about 5 min to reset. Confirm correct internet operation.</p>

            <p>Thanks. It isn't a laptop. The MSInfo output is included in the ZIP file I linked to (but I understand not wanting to download all my DMP files). Right now the GPU temp is around 47C and holding steady. As mentioned I've underclocked the GPU to its minimum
 running speed and cranked the fan speed to 100% to keep it cooler. The fan is definitely spinning as I can hear it and see it through the window in my case. :)&nbsp;That has reduced the frequency of the crashing.</p>
<p>I've installed Windows 10 on this PC twice and when I restore to a Windows 8.1 image, the video card works perfectly fine. It doesn't overheat. So that indicates to me that it's not a hardware failure.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted in a thread <a href="https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/854531/geforce-drivers/gt-240-windows-10/?offset=4#4637896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
on the Nvidia forums</a> too in case they read that.&nbsp; Hopefully somebody is working on another driver update.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Try running the driver in windows compatibility mode:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>These are drivers automatically installed by Windows Update in Windows 10. There is no Setup program to trick into running in compatibility mode.&nbsp; They are provided by Microsoft &amp; NVIDIA as being WHQL approved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downclocking the GPU makes the crashes less frequent, but they still happen kind of randomly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So another work-around that I'm trying is to open the Device Manager (as administrator), and then right click the GPU and disable it.&nbsp; That will load the default Microsoft Display Adapter driver instead of NVIDIA's drivers.&nbsp; So far no crashing, but of course
 I also don't have any Open CL, CUDA, etc. hardware acceleration support which is annoying, but not as annoying as random freezing and BSODs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also considering buying an AMD Radeon video card to replace the NVIDIA since clearly NVIDIA is not ready to support Windows 10 properly.</p>

            <p>The GT240 came out in 2009. It is possible that Nvida will not be able to update it, on the other hand they might be able to run direct x12 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time a new OS comes out, Linux,apple, ect the hardware drivers have to be built, and some equipment become obsolete. Sorta like ide hard drives and cd-rom being replaced by sata.</p>

            Installed the new <strong>NVIDIA GeForce driver version 341.81 </strong>released yesterday.&nbsp; Did the whole clean-install process to make sure it was done right.&nbsp; The new driver worked for about 1.5 hours and then had another
<strong>VIDEO TDR FAILURE (nvlddmkm.sys)</strong>.&nbsp; So obviously that didn't fix it.&nbsp; I'm back to disabling the driver completely in the device manager and using Microsoft's default display adapter driver which is at least stable.

            Hi WIlliam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out? If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate. We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            You said there was a key on a label on the laptop?  Was this from Windows 7 because that's the last edition of WIndows that had a sticker on the PC with the Factory OEM Product Key.  Windows 10 has it embedded in UEFI firmware.  
<br />
<br />But somehow a Volume License key was introduced, otherwise you would NEVER have that error message.

            Hi William
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            Hi William10A
<br />
<br />It is likely that your friend installed a Windows 10 licence volume licence version and that is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis or it is a cracked version of Windows
<br />
<br />your only option to get back to genuine activated Windows 10 is to clean install Windows 10 Home . ..

<p>That is what&nbsp;we found among the community. Give it a shot and hopefully, it does help.</p>

<br />Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>

<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

<h2>            No progress with &#34;This device cannot start. &#40;code 10&#41;&#34; when trying to install DVB-S2 card.</h2>
                    <p>Asked a Q yesterday about this.....but made no progress.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Established that the device <strong>is</strong> compatible with Win 10</li><li>Also that I have <strong>Win 1709 (OS Build 16299.402)</strong></li><li>Correct device drivers selected.</li><li>Card in question was working a few days ago without problems in another Win 10 'new build'</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>....so all ducks are in a line!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of Googling found this link:</p>
<p>https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-deleting-the-upperfilters-and-lowerfilters-registry-values-2619225</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this worth a go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm delving into new areas here, and not particularly confident!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Kev, 
<br />
<br />It’s still early, and I’m only on cup 1.5 of coffee, so I apologize if I missed it here, but what is the card in question? Seems like you’ve been doing some digging on a fix, and I’d love to try to help if possible. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>Hi Charlie</p>
<p>
</p><p>....I'm a coffee fan too!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a <strong>TBS 6922 DVB-S2</strong> card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was quite happy in Win10, on my old i3/P8Z68-VLX system for 5 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Built 1st 'new' system last week (i5/H310M S2H)....all good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went for a&nbsp; board with more connectivity....and so 2nd 'new' system<strong> (i5/B360 PRO VDH)</strong> is the combination I'm having the problem with!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Performance and Health (in Windows Defender Security Centre) identifies a driver problem for the device....but troubleshooter fails when attempting to fix.</p>
<p>Troubleshooter kindly suggests I follow 'other options'....but doesn't indicate just what they might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p>
<p>Kev/Leeds/UK</p>

            You’re very welcome!
<br />
<br />So here is where I’ll start, because I think it’s our best play. You obviously know your stuff, and you’ve gone through all the normal troubleshooting steps. I’ll assume you have the latest drivers installed for the card as well. 
<br />
<br />The April Update is right around the corner...Like days from pushed. That may clear up this issue. I don’t know how froggy you are, but we could get you signed up to be an insider, and you could down the update now if you’d like. 
<br />
<br />I guess my next question is were you planning on installing that update right away or not? I’m not trying to push it on you if that wasn’t part of your plans. 
<br />
<br />What do you think?

<br />"Had the problem for days, updating drivers, uninstalling and reinstalling for days. Finally found the problem in msconfig, boot options, advanced. Uncheck the PCI Lock box and restart. Three devices started working again."
<br />
<br />click start - type "msconfig" and hit enter
<br />
<br />Click Boot - Advanced, and is PCI lock checked? uncheck, reboot and give it a shot!

            Awesome! :) 
<br />
<br />Ok, so we're going to circle back around here, and try to delete the upper and lower filters, cause "what the hell" 
<br />
<br />First, we need to identify the GUID for your Device. click start - type device manager - open it up. Find your Tv tuner driver. Right click on it. Click the details tab. drop the field down to "device class guid" and document the number, (photo below)
<br />
<br />Now - click start and type "regedit" 
<br />
<br />Navigate to here - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class
<br />
<br />Expand Class - and look for the GUID that is assigned to your tv tuner driver. (this may take a minute)
<br />
<br />Click on it when you find it. In the results pain, you'll find UpperFilters and LowerFilters.
<br />
<br />Right click both of them and delete. Close out of the registry, reboot, and let's see if that works!

<br />
<br />Let's hope this works!

                    I have two subscriptions. They are both past due. I only want to continue one of them and delete the other. When I go to update my payment info, it automatically makes me pay for both. How can I update my payment info but only renew the one subscription?
