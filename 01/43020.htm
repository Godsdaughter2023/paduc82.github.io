<h2>            Ethernet connection not working because of PC</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/331e8029-82f4-4498-a790-cc4ede154417?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/331e8029-82f4-4498-a790-cc4ede154417?upload=true" /></a>I
 need help to fix the Ethernet connection. I tried to connect it to other working cables and it still doesn’t work, I believe it has something to do with the
<strong>computer</strong>, any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT (SOLVED):<br />
What I did this morning was that I <strong>disassembled my PC</strong> and looked through the Ethernet port, I noticed a bit of dust or string and took it off, though, I don't think that did anything,&nbsp;<br />
after examining, <strong>I assembled the PC and replugged all my wires</strong> and was down to know that it was probably still broken,&nbsp;<br />
little did I know when I plugged in the Ethernet cable, the lights came up, I knew that now it was working again!<br />
<br />
This post is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>EDIT:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When troubleshooting, it says that my ethernet cable is not properly plugged in or the cable is broken when it appears that the cable is working.</span></p>

</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a pending update to Windows 10 1803, </p>

<h2>            Unable to connect Bluetooth Headset</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to pair my bluetooth headset (Plantronics Black Beat Go 2) to my Samsung laptop (NT270E5V-KD1S).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded the required bluetooth driver from Samsung web site, but installing didn't go complete.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I do have the Bluetooth Icon thingy on the task bar, but no pairing.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I wanted to delete the driver file and redownload.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But now deleting from the Control Panel (Add or Remove Programs) didn't work,</div>
<div>so I just deleted the file from the Wallpaper. (Maybe this was a mistake?)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, on <span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Add or Remove Programs list, I still have</span></div>
<div>Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless Software for Bluetooth(R) Technology</div>
<div>&amp; Atheros Bluetooth Suite (64).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But when I try to remove it,&nbsp;</div>
<div>it says it cannot find "Atheros Bluetooth Suite (64)".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get the same message when I run the Driver file from the Samsung web site.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I looked up "Atheros Bluetooth Suite (64)" at Atheros' web site,</div>
<div>(<a href="http://qca.qualcomm.com/resources/driverdownloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://qca.qualcomm.com/resources/driverdownloads/</a>)</div>
<div>but I don't know which one to download.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally, last thing I tried,</div>
<div>I downloaded Atheros drivers from two other sources (I saw from some threads on this community)</div>
<div>but both of them said it was already installed on my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope this is enough description of my problem...</div>
<div>I hope anyone can help me out.</div>
<div>I really badly want to pair the headset... so frustrated.</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Hello,
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. We will be glad to help you.</div>
<div><br />
I have understood that you are unable to connect Bluetooth headset.</div>
<div><br />
a) What happens when you try to search for a Bluetooth device? Does it give any error message?<br />
b) Are you able to connect other Bluetooth devices?</div>
<div><br />
I would recommend you to follow the steps given below:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Download and run this Microsoft Hotfix to check if that solves the problem.<br />
<strong>Bluetooth devices do not work correctly on a computer that is not running Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980396</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Check and make sure the Bluetooth support service is started</strong>.</div>
<div>Follow the steps given below:</div>
<div>a) Click on Start.</div>
<div>b) Type Services.</div>
<div>c) Search for <strong>Bluetooth support service.</strong></div>
<div>d) Right click on it and click on <strong>Start.</strong></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Please refer the following Microsoft articles.<br />
<strong>Add a Bluetooth or other wireless or network device: frequently asked questions. Refer “Why can’t I connect my Bluetooth device on my computer</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/add-a-bluetooth-or-other-wireless-or-network-device-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/add-a-bluetooth-or-other-wireless-or-network-device-frequently-asked-questions</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Change settings for Bluetooth enabled devices.</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-bluetooth-device-settings#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-bluetooth-device-settings#1TC=windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Connect to Bluetooth and other wireless or network devices</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/connect-to-bluetooth-and-other-wireless-or-network-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/connect-to-bluetooth-and-other-wireless-or-network-devices</a></div>
<div><br />
Try to follow the steps given and let us know if it is helpful.</div>
<div><br />
Thank you.<br />

            <div><br />
<div>Thank you so much for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I had no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 1:</div>
<div>it tells me: The update is not applicable in your computer</div>
<div>
<div>Method 2: it was already checked as "started"</div>
<div>Method 3: I had already checked all the articles, and followed the tips.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for your questions,</div>
<div>when I try to search for a Bluetooth device, nothing happens.</div>
<div>I don't have any other Bluetooth device so I cannot check whether other devices pair with my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My laptop supports Bluetooth services with a built-in adapter (otherwise I need to get a dongle, right?) and it is on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm thinking... it may be because the driver wasn't set up properly.</div>
<div>So I want to delete what I installed and do the installing again.</div>
<div>But I cannot get rid of the driver...</div>
<div>I think this may be where the problem begins...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I contacted Atheros to see what drivers I need to download from their web page</div>
<div>but they told me to contact the laptop manufacturer...</div>
<div>Is that the only way I can get further help?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again!!</div>

<div><br />
<div>Answers are as follows:</div>
<div>- Windows 8.1</div>
<div>- update was completed after i saw the update prompt on my pc, so via windows update settings</div>
<div>- i have verifed that Microsoft office programs and adobe CS5 package are no longer on my pc by looking in program folder, searching and trying to open files. No luck.</div>
<div>- Microsoft office 2013</div>
<div>- purchased as an extra with my dell laptop in aug 2014. I have the receipt</div>
<div><br />
<div>Normally, i would try reinstalling CS5 and office from the installation discs but they are in storage in Australia and i am living in the UK. I would never have completed the update had i known this deletion was a possibility. I was happy with Windows
 8.1 and use office and CS5 on a daily basis and this update has rendered my computer somewhat usless. &nbsp;Microsoft has always been reliable but this is a genuine disappointment.</div>

<p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various methods of transferring files on a computer. Examples are: moving or copying files via network HomeGroup, transferring to an external hard drive and copying them to a new PC, or uploading to OneDrive then download it to a new PC (requires
 a stable connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy multiple files at the same time, but it is not recommended since transferring files in one operation at a time is more efficient than doing it simultaneously. For us to answer your question regarding with transferring files, we’d like to know
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your method of copying your files</li><li>The size of the files you are copying</li><li>If you are copying from/to a HomeGroup network</li><li>If you are using a wired or wireless connection</li><li>The setup of network that you have (Local area network or Wide area network)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We’re looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>WiFi Adapter is driving me crazy. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nakashimakyousuke  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi Adapter is driving me crazy.</h2>
                    <p>This started about 5 months ago (I never ever came upon an issue as irredeemable as this in all my 13 years of computing), I have no idea whatsoever what triggered it, as I tried to figure it out with Clean Boot and I didn't so it's probably Windows itself,
 My WiFi Adapter started going crazy, it started losing connectivity suddenly, with only a "Limited" indicator under the WiFi Network, At the beginning, it was easy to fix by just restarting the WiFi, but then it started getting worse and worse, until the WiFi
 ceased to work at all, and to fix it I either had to hibernate/sleep/restart to get it back. it usually happens when I close the laptop lid for some reason. when looking at the device manager, it displays a "This Device Cannot Start (Code 10). This Device
 Does Not Exist." error, when trying to Scan for hardware changes it would disappear completely from the device list, appearing only as a hidden device with a code 45 error (disconnected from laptop?). After a month I managed to fix it and keep it permanent
 somehow (I think by deleting the device and drivers and reinstalling a re-downloaded one.), but then I discovered it was only temporary. A month later it started again. Now worse, and now escalating to BSODs with "DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (rtwlane.sys)"
 errors (That was when I figured it must be device-driver related, but I'm not sure), BSODs only happen rarely though, but it did happen several times, and now nothing I do can fix it, I even tried to solve it like last time. Nothing. Now It's driving me crazy
 as every time I try to go online it could get disconnected any minute, sometimes it doesn't for a while, sometimes too frequently, sometimes it wouldn't be fixed at all unless I reinstall drivers and do other random fixes, I tried literally hundreds of solutions,
 installed dozens of drivers, and even messed with Windows files (I didn't destroy anything. I promise.), I don't have a restore point back when it was alright because back then everything was so perfect that I didn't even need to fix any errors. I tried contacting
 HP and Tom's Hardware about this and none gave me a (permanent) solution, so I decided to come here. If anyone does respond, please request any and all info you need and I'll provide, and please keep me posted.<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

<p>Hello Nakashima,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could better check and provide a more established resolution. Please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your computer's configuration prior to the issue?</li><li>Do you have other devices connected to the WiFi? If so, does the same issue happens?</li><li>Have you tried updating the driver through the manufacturer's website? If not, you may check the manufacturer's website to have the appropriate driver for your device.
</li></ul>
<p>Since you've mentioned that you're also encountering Blue screen error, you may check this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot blue screen errors</a></strong> for possible troubleshooting steps.<strong> Blue
 screen errors (Stop errors)</strong> can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. This can be caused by both hardware and software issues.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response. </p>

            I don't remember making any particular changes to my configuration except a few updates and downloaded programs which I checked for viruses beforehand.<br />
I don't have any other adapters, just my RealTek WiFi Adapter and the wired PCIe Family Controller which isn't connected.<br />
I tried updating it with many several drivers, including the one from the manufacturer's website, the one from HP (My laptop manufacturer) and also from various online services and even from Windows's update service itself (although it refuses to update my
 driver now with the latest Windows update due to a *80070003" Error, I don't know if this issue is connected to the WiFi issue or not.<br />
I tried analyzing my blue screen through bluescreenview but I honestly didn't understand what the .dmp file was trying to tell me, so I will check that link.<br />
<br />
Thank you for responding.<br />

            Update: I mentioned earlier that I tried isolating the source of the problem using clean boot, which didn't work.<br />
<br />
I tried something new and it did work. Just one more step left.<br />
<br />
I booted my laptop in safe mode with networking, the WiFi network stopped disconnecting immediately, which indicates that there is something wrong with one of the Microsoft services, now the problem is, I don't know which one is it, if you could, I hope you
 can provide me with a method to isolate it through safe mode.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p>Thanks for getting back to us. Since after booting your PC in safe mode and the issue doesn't persists, you can eliminate the default settings, basic device drivers and services as possible causes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you're right. Drivers are also being updated when you install Windows Update, it will be automatically downloaded and installed. Since you already tried installing Windows Update and you've encountered an error, you can try to resolve it by running
 Windows Update troubleshooter. This will automatically detect and resolve problem with Windows Update. To do so, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>View by: Small icons</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>System and Security</strong>, select <strong>Windows Update</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instruction.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks for replying. I have tried what you suggested about Windows Update troubleshooter, it made a few changes and marked issues as "fixed", however, when I tried to update again, the same error (80070003) appears.<br />
</p>
<p>Yes, you are indeed right, basic device drivers and services are confirmed NOT to be the cause, but never the less, I can't keep running in safe mode forever, now I tried to restart Windows normally and the issue returned, this is definitely a non-basic
 Microsoft service, however, I don't know which one. and that's what I'm trying to figure out.</p>

            Hello wakylin,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Are you using&nbsp;a Sony computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so I suggest visiting the link below for support.&nbsp; However if you are not using a Sony computer I would suggest scanning for spyware and malware.&nbsp; Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
<br />

    <title>Phantasy Star Online 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Phantasy Star Online 2</h2>
                    
<p>So far they have only announced this for PC but I am hoping that they release it on Xbox 360 as well. PSO was my favorite game on the Dreamcast and my first real online gaming experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the trailer...&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf1fCB60Nss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phantasy Star Online 2 Trailer</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/yf1fCB60Nss?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/yf1fCB60Nss?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can go to <a href="http://pso2.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pso2.jp</a>&nbsp;and check out some screenshots and the trailer. And if you click the blue rectangle near the bottom it takes you to a page where you can send a message to the developers. I sent a message
 begging them to release it on consoles (^_^) (The first box is for your name and the second box is for your message. The button underneath sends it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope they consider releasing it on consoles since that is where the PSO series got started. PSU was ok but for me it did not compare with the enjoyment I got from PSO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this doesn't turn into a PC vs Console battleground. PC players should already be happy. They get PSO2 guaranteed!

<p>I have been keeping an eye on this. It is hard for me to believe that they would have this game not be on at least one console, since the series has always been on consoles, with the exception of blue burst expansion. I only fear that this game is only using
 the name and the game will not be as similar to pso as I want. I dont want it exactly like it at all but I do want 4 player split screen and a challenge mode.

<p>Until I actually play PSO whenever Gamefly decides to send games that are of relevancy to me, no comment. But hopefully there will be more games like FFXI and Shadowrun that let you play with PC gamers, I think that's a good...crossover bonding experience
 for 2 different platform gaming communities.</p>

<p>I would most definately consider playing this game if it were made available to the consoles. The graphics are sharp, colorful, and very Phantasy Star-like. I love the way they do the artwork for the characters and it looks like an rpg grinder's paradise.
 The environments look lush, almost painterly in a way. I wonder if the 360 could handle the intensive framerates PSO2 will generate.</p>

<p>The Wife &amp; I were completely addicted to PSO when it was on the Dreamcast. We played that game regularly for damn near a year. It was the reason I bought a second Dreamcast. Then, just as it started to lose it's grip on us, Sega decided to start charging
 to play, so we stopped playing altogether. I would be extremely interested in PSO2 as long as I don't have to purchase a Hunter's License to play online. Hopefully it comes to a console, but I'll take it on PC just as well.</p>

<p>Well I think it would be silly to forget about how in terms of server longevity, the console versions of the Phantasy Star series have always outlasts their PC counterpart.</p>
<p>I'm very excited for PSO2 I really liked PSU and I felt it took the somewhat dull combat of PSO and gave it some spice. &nbsp;However I was really let down by the removal of the MAGs and the new rare weapons system implemented in

<p>I agree. The Mags were one of the coolest parts of PSO. Playing online, a great deal of the conversation was always about the Mags. What did you feed that Mag... That Mag is awesome... I want that Mag... Etc, etc. Without them, the game simply wouldn't be
 the same. In a lot of the same way, I can't play any new Sonic games without the Chaos.</p>

<p>Honestly, it would only benefit SEGA if they brought it to Xbox 360. If the monthly subscription was replaced with an online pass, Sega would make more than enough money (alot of people say the game is worth buying if they didn't have to pay the fee every
 month). Some other ideas(too many to list) would make it perfect for consoles. </p>

<p>Sega would love to bring this game to the 360. They probably already tried to make it happen. Microsoft just isn't having it. Seriously, you think it's just a coincidence that no MMO's have come out for the 360 in over 5 years? You think none have been made?
 MS experimented with MMO's back when the 360 was still new. And the outcome was, Microsoft now hates MMO's and no more will be coming to the console.</p>
<p>The only possibility for us to get a MMO is if Microsoft develops and publishes it themselves. And that's a very thin possibility. I'm talking...Calista Flockhart thin. Microsoft doesn't even care to give us decent exclusives. An MMO isn't even a thought
 for them right now, unless maybe it's a Kinect MMO in which you and your team need to swat away giant blocks from falling on a princess of some sort.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello Face not working</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 6 that's been working fine.&nbsp; I recently upgraded to the 2019 spring update ver. 1903.&nbsp; Windows Hello Face was working after the update, but a couple of days ago was reporting a problem whenever I logged in.&nbsp; It reports that "Windows
 couldn't find a camera compatible with Windows Hello Face."&nbsp; However, the camera works fine.&nbsp; Both the front and rear cameras are working fine and the device manager doesn't show a problem with them.&nbsp; Does anyone know what's going on? &nbsp;

            Barb Bowman!&nbsp; You are a genius!&nbsp; I uninstalled the Microsoft IR Camera rebooted twice and that seems to have fixed the problem, I think.&nbsp; The message is gone from Windows Hello and I was able to log in without entering my password.&nbsp; So, I think I'm good.&nbsp;
 I don't have a "Surface Camera Windows Hello" or any part of that text in my system devices, or elsewhere that I can tell.&nbsp; But as long as it's working, that's fine with me.&nbsp; Thanks very much for your help.&nbsp; And your speedy response as well! &nbsp;

                    Typical Microsoft I try to upgrade to Windows 8.1 from 8 on a Dell M4700 and get some useless error code that when search on Bing doesn't turn up anything. Please tell me how to install the upgrade. It offers me a 'Try again' button and "Cancel' button.
 The try again button results with the same issue and the cancel button does nothing. I reboot and still get the same error after seconds of starting the update. Aggghhh user experience = terrible.

<div>Is it possible to delete the previously downloaded data and start with a fresh install? The cancel button should really delete the previous data but again it does nothing.</div>

            Getting the same problem on a clean windows 8 install. All updates installed, no anti-virus installed. This seems like a dead end with a useless error code and no explanation at all.

            Hello Microsoft, This didn't work what else can I do?? This is very frustrating. If I had an Apple computer I could just go to the apple store ... but since I have a windows computer I'm just stuck with no answers and what seems like no efficient way to
 get any! Aggghhh

    <title>Error 0xc0000225 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidcant&#250;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0xc0000225</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a 2-year old HP Pavilion x360 running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has been down for the count for around two weeks and fortunately, I haven't needed to boot up my computer as I have recently finished school. When it went to rest, I could not "wake" it by pressing one button or move the mouse; I had to do a
 force power off. Upon booting it back up, I was greeted with an Automatic Recovery blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a good idea to do this, but considering that I was in a bootloop, I gave it a shot. I disabled Automatic Recovery upon startup and when I rebooted, I came across a message that read:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your PC/Device needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operating system couldn't be loaded because the system registry file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \WINDOWS\System32\config\System</p>
<p>Error Code: 0xc0000225</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose one of the options below to address this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Esc for recovery</p>
<p>Press Enter to try again</p>
<p>Press F8 for Startup Settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering my error lies in System32, I realize that the problem is critical. At least now I have a directory. No, I didn't delete System32 to make my PC run faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing Esc gives me some options, but none have worked so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've tried resetting the computer entirely, but that doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've tried doing a system restore, but cannot restore to a point where the computer did not have Windows installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've tried rolling back to a previous version of Windows to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've tried installing the Windows 10 ISO on a USB drive, but my computer does not detect the USB in the port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I possibly do from here? How could I get back the essential Windows 10 files?</p>

<p>Hello guys. I bought an xbox 360 slim in US for my cousins in the Philippines. I bought a used one since it is cheaper. My only problem is the power supply. In the Philippines, the voltage is 220V while 110V in US. I want to buy a power supply that is 220V
 but I can't find an original one. Where can I buy this 220V power supply that are made by microsoft? Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting Tips To Solve Common Problems When Windows 7 Does Not Install <br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and fix them.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Disable all security software: anti-virus, firewall etc. Remember to enable afterwords.
<br />
3. Make sure your computer has the most recent drivers and BIOS. Updating the BIOS can be risky, only do this if nothing else works.
<br />
4. Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse before installing. <br />
5. If using a video card and the computer has integrated video use that and remove the video card.
<br />
6. Unplug your computer from the internet, if you have wireless disable it. <br />
7. RAM (memory) - reduce the amount of RAM. 1GB if installing 32bit, 2GB for 64bit, then replace RAM if the upgrade is successful. Also if you just added new RAM make sure it's compatible.
<br />
8. If you have multiple hard drives remove all except the one you're installing Windows 7 on, then replace after Windows 7 is installed.
<br />
9. If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD try burning it again at the slowest speed possible. It's also possible the download may have errors, you could try downloading it again.<br />
10. If you clicked on "Upgrade" to start the install make sure you are taking a supported upgrade path. You can NOT do an in place upgrade: A) XP to Windows 7, B) changing bit type ex: 32 to 64 bit, C) changing languages, D) downgrading editions ex:Vista Ult.
 to 7 Pro, or E) Vista Home to 7 Pro.<br />
<br />
11. Disable Startup Programs: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Click Start, type MSCONFIG in the Start Search box, and then press Enter. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK User Account Control permission and enter password if any <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If using XP: Click Start, click Run, then type: MSCONFIG and click OK. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) On the General tab, click Selective Startup. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Right below Selective Startup, uncheck the "Load Startup Items" check box. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click the Services tab, click the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box, then click Disable All.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click OK, then restart the computer. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) Attempt the upgrade again. <br />
<br />
(NOTE: if the upgrade doesn't work and you continue to use XP/Vista turn your security software back on, then also return to MSCONFIG and on the General tab, click "Normal Startup" then click OK to exit.)
<br />
<br />
12. Check your RAM (memory) for errors. May take awhile, only do if nothing else worked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart the computer. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Boot from the Windows 7 DVD. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Choose your language, then click Next. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click on "Repair your computer" then select the operating system to repair.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click the Memory Diagnostics link on the System Recovery menu. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) The computer will restart and your memory checked for any errors.<br />

<h2>            Disable &#34;All Apps&#34; option from start in Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    Hi Team,<br />
<br />
As part of our application, "All Apps" option has to be removed from start for a specific user and this has to tweaked from registry/group policy.&nbsp;<br />
I could able to disable "All Apps" by creating a DWORD "NoStartMenuMorePrograms" with value 1 in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\". &nbsp;But, this is not working in Windows 10 Anniversary Update (version 1607).<br />
<br />
how can i achieve this in Windows 10 Anniversary Update? Please help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<h2>            After Windows Update, now getting erratic speaker mute &#40;flickers on&#47;off&#41; and sometimes erratic mouse behaviour</h2>
                    I noticed a couple days ago that after restarting after&nbsp;a Windows update (a few weeks worth of updates at once) on my old Dell M60 laptop that when I hit the mute button it would just start flickering on/off continuously but stays ore on that off.&nbsp; I restarted
 it and it still gave this behaviour so I shut the laptop down and decided to look at it later.&nbsp; Today I had a friend email me about their desktop PC stating they have the same issue.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else been experiencing this? Identified/fixed?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Get the latest sound/audio driver and if no newer re-install the same one. Please use the manual instruction<br />
as outlined below.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound driver often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the version you<br />
installed is there, if not repeat - reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it<br />
does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Photo Gallery viewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gcgc77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Photo Gallery viewer</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>I've just upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;When I go into photo viewer it automatically defaults to showing photos by date, which is fine. &nbsp;However I've organised by photos by folder directory, eg "Dad's birthday", "Trip to the Park" etc, and I can't see how I can
 set the photos so that it groups them by directory. &nbsp;It seems to ignore the directory structure and just looks at date taken. &nbsp;I find this frustrating. &nbsp;Can anyone help me toggle the settings to "folder" view.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does this behavior happen in Windows photo gallery app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is by design It will not take the directory structure it will just show you the images based upon the sort order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Photo gallery and in the View tab try to change the sort order (Example: Name, folder etc...) To check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>

            <p>The issue was in relation to "Photos" rather than "Photo Gallery".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In "Photos" why would Microsoft "by design" not take the directory structure. &nbsp;If I wanted all my photos stored by date I would just put them all in one big directory. &nbsp;The problem with this "solution" is that it's impossible to find photos unless you remember
 the date you took them on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion on "Photo Gallery" is quite interesting as it highlights another fantastic feature of Windows 10: it's stopped this app (and Movie Maker) working completely. &nbsp;The error message is that it's missing a MSVCR100 dll file. &nbsp;Having gone round
 the web looking for solutions, I reinstalled this file. &nbsp;Then I was told that&nbsp;MSVCP100 dll file was missing. I've replaced this one too. &nbsp;Only to be told that&nbsp;MSVCR110 dll file is missing...... As much as I enjoy this game of find the file that Windows 10
 has removed, I don't have the luxury of spending hours fixing IT issues..... so I'm spending my time reminiscing how easy it was under Windows 8.1 to view a photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have the energy I will start to find and replace the other missing files, and see where we get to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not happy.</p>

            You can only restore to Win 8.1 if within the 30 day period. Or by using your original media but that would be a clean install.

                    <p>I am getting frequent BSDs just after first start up of Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; When Windows restarts all seems to be normal again.&nbsp; Have been keeping continuous boot logs and have found that after each BSD the driver asyncmac.sys is not appearing either as loaded
 or did not load.&nbsp; When the computer then restarts each time this driver is showing as loaded as the last item on the boot log.&nbsp; I don't understand the significance of this but as it has occurred about 7 or 8 times quite consistently I am suspicious this may

<p><span>Are you referring to BSOD (<b>Blue Screen of Death</b>) in your post? If yes, then what is exact message on BSOD?</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer is restarting after the BSOD then I would suggest you to use

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>asyncmac.sys is a Windows file. Check if the issue persists in safe mode (Step 1). If the issue does not persist in safe mode then,
 perform clean boot (Step 2) on your computer.</span></p>

<p>if he is on Xbox, you should also set up a pass key for purchasing so that you would need to input the key every time before making a purchase, even when the account is logged in.</p>

    <title>My Programs and Features List Won&#39;t Listen to Me. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mermaid.exe  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Programs and Features List Won&#39;t Listen to Me.</h2>
                    So a while ago I downloaded this really awful game center called GTArcade. It's basically a bunch of mobile games released for PC and I got really bored of it and wanted them gone. So I uninstalled all the games and the application itself using the Programs
 and Features list only to come back later and see that GTArcade was still on the list with no icon. I tried to uninstall it again with a response of: "An error occurred while trying to uninstall GTArcade. It may have already been uninstalled. Would you like
 to remove GTArcade from the Programs and Features list?"<br />
<br />
Of course I want it gone so I click YES. Then another box appears and says: "You do not have sufficient access to remove GTArcade from the Programs and Features list. Pleas contact your system admin."<br />
<br />
This is a huge problem as I am my system admin. I did some research and found that if I go and search the registry I can force remove it from there and erase it entirely. One problem with that solution. It didn't appear anywhere in the registry. I'm really
 confused and want this crap off my computer. If you can help please reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks a Bunch!<br />

            Hi Mermaid.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if you can uninstall the game in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.
<br />
<br />If not try enable the hidden Built-In Administrator account used only for emergencies following one of these methods: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>.  Sign in and try uninstalling using it. 
<br />
<br />If you can do this it may mean your Admin account is corrupted, so you can create a new Local Admin account, sign into it, move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mermaid
<br />
<br />Try this registry edit . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
<br />
<br />On the left in the Uninstall folder, you will see a list of sub-folders, one for each item in that Add/Remove program list.
<br />
<br />Click each sub-folder in turn, when you find the folder for GTArcade, right click that folder and choose Delete . . .
<br />
<br />That should remove it from the Add/Remove Programs list . . .       
        </p>

            Yes, I've already tried to edit it directly from the registry. It doesn't appear. Maybe you misunderstood what I was saying? The program is fully deleted from my computer but I am unable to remove the name from the list. It says I am unable to remove it
 from the list even though it confirms that its gone.

            Sorry Greg, maybe you misunderstood me. Its not a game it was a really crappy Hub kind of like Steam. The computer recognizes that it is in fact deleted fully and doesn't appear in the registry. It just won't let me remove it from the Programs and Features
 List. I'm not sure how else to explain my problem.

            Programs and Features is being phased out and may not survive another version.   Is it still present in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features?  
<br />
<br />Check also at C:\Program Files in both folders there.  If it's still there then I would take ownership if necessary to delete it:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>.   That will get almost everything that matters, including most registry keys.

            Yes it does show up there but when I click uninstall (it has already been uninstalled) it just says that windows can't find it and doesn't remove the name. It doesn't show up in either program files folder because it has already been uninstalled along
 with all of its data. I just can't get the name to disappear from Apps and Features (Programs and Features)

<p>&nbsp; The thing is Greg, is that the application GTArcade doesn't appear in the Registry. Only in the Programs &amp; Features list and the Apps &amp; Features list. Thankfully I'm building a new computer soon so I won't be installing this crap again.&nbsp;</p>
