<h2>            Unfortunately the Surface 3 is a not usable device</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after I provide my experiences with the German community, I want to hear your opinion:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p>
<p>I bought my Surface 3 as a student to have a device with Windows and the ability to use a pen for markups and notes. I bought the whole bundle with the keyboard, the docking-station and the pen. My Surface 3 already got Windows 10 pre-installed. I thought
 this would be a good deal, since Windows 10 is made to handle a laptop and a tablet in one operating system. Unfortunately it is not. After several weeks of testing I couldn't identify a single scenario to work with the Surface and have an advantage over using
 a normal laptop. I report this at this community to hopefully get some answers and tips to let me use my Surface properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First Problem: Scaling</strong></p>
<p>OK, this seems to be a problem for a short period (hopefully), but it is very annoying and limits the using time because of eye-problems. The display is very nice and the resolution so high, that only some applications could handle it properly. Most not-microsoft-apps
 looks very blurred. Deactivating scaling in the compatibility menu make the UI look good, but mostly downsize the size of buttons and text to unusable, particular with the touchscreen. I see this is a problem of the applications in the first place, but it
 bounds the Surface on Microsoft-Apps and that couldn't be the goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Second problem: Reading</strong></p>
<p>As a student I (want/have to) read several documents (PDF/EPUB).</p>
<p>1) Reading PDF</p>
<p>Reading PDF is great with Drawboard. This is a nice app, but it does not provide any export of notes and mark-ups. So it is unusable in a scientific way. The Windows-Reader app not even got a markup-function. I would like to use this great pen to mark-up
 and note on my PDF-documents and export them to other apps like Word or OneNote. Other Desktop-Apps got this function but they are not really usable in tablet-mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Reading EPUB</p>
<p>At the moment I don't know any usable EPUB-Reading-App with the mentioned markup and export functions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure this is not the problem of Microsoft, but this is a big usage-limit of this great device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Third problem: Taking Notes</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to tell much about this problem, as this is mentioned so often at this community.</p>
<p>- Can't use the Top-Button of Pen to start Desktop-OneNote</p>
<p>- OneNote-App useless, because it only works with Cloud or SharePoint</p>
<p>- OneNote 2013 can`t use camera to scan documents (leads to BSOD)</p>
<p>- OneNote 2016 got better usability due to the touch-layout but don't even got the possibility to use the camera as a scanner</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Fourth problem: Browsing</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion the Edge is a nice browser for a tablet, but I need my add-ons, so I'm a fan of firefox and the edge is too buggy at the moment and is crashed to often by bigger sites. Again, this is not Microsoft fault, that Mozilla didn't provide a proper
 version for Windows 8.1 or 10 in the App-Store. But in the end, if there are no usable Apps for your device (even it is a good piece of hardware, as the Surface is) nobody will buy and use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Fifth problem: Screen keyboard</strong></p>
<p>The Screen keyboard got three nice modes but the popup function is really bad. In desktop-mode there is no popup if you tap in a text-field. If you activate tablet-mode the keyboard only pops up if you use an App not a Desktop-App. So according to my fourth
 problem:</p>
<p>I want to browser, sitting on the coach and use my FF-addons and doing other things with Apps. I activate the Tablet Mode and open FF. I tab in the address bar and nothing happens. I have to activate the Desktop-mode again and manually open up the keyboard.
 This is not really user-friendly at all.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth problem: Gestures</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion the Surface 3 is a nice device overall. The pen is nice either, but why don't Microsoft includes gesture-options ? It would be so nice to control the device with personal stylus gestures or finger gestures. You have to install an external app
 to get the finger gestures and there is no option to use stylus gestures. In general I think Microsoft missed to include useful features with this great pen. I know this is also mentioned several times, but why can't I change the function of my pens buttons
 ? This is so sad. This great device is so useless at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>At the moment this device is useless. I see no scenario where my Surface is better than a tablet or my laptop. I want to combine both devices with my Surface 3 but in the end I got a nice useless piece of hardware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone please describe any possible scenario how to use this device as a productive device with windows 10?
</p>
<p>Could anyone please share their experience with this device as a productive device ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to use this device more often because I like it, but I prefer using my desktop PC or my laptop atm. This shouldn`t be after buying this 1000$-device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alex</p>

            <p>Hi Dax,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply, but unfortunately Calibre is far away from being useful in Highlighting Text and Exporting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it and the only way is to mark text and copy them to clipboard. Thats really not the way I want to read my text and jump from one application to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope so much, that Drawboard gets new features and supports ePub and export-functions. According to Drawboards User-Hub both topics are "Under Review" (https://drawboard.uservoice.com/forums/251835-features).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I searched for apps and found four possible apps on MacOS. That's weird. I'm really not an Apple-Fan (really not) but they got those apps. And you can choose the best one for you. I would be happy if there is only one App for Windows or Windows Tablet
 that support that features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to use Citavi for the next time. It's much more powerful and therefore a bit slow on Surface 3 but It's the only possible way to get a user-friendly, reading and highlight-experience on Surface 3 at the moment.</p>

            <p>I'm late with my answer, sorry for this. But this is really not what I'm looking for. I don't need an editor for epubs. I need a software especially for the Surface 3 for reading, marking and highlighting. Drawboard is the best one atm and hopefully will
 be better in the future. Nevertheless&nbsp; Windows 10 on Surface 3 has a long way to go to become a usefull operating system as a Laptop, a Tablet and a Stylus Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks, for your answer and your effort.</p>

            <p>You seem to be limiting your search for&nbsp;an application that fits your needs from the curated Store alone; you do know you can install any (windows or linux) software you want on a surface 3/pro 3 don't you? I'd venture to say that if the specific feature
 you want in an epub reader does not exist out there&nbsp; it is hardly a reflection on the surface 3's usability ^^
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many projects out there, with a fair amount of participation by their users - if you fail to find the exact feature you want in any of the currently available,&nbsp;probably hundreds of epub readers out there, you could try to suggest the features you
 want with some of these projects. Or even suggest them&nbsp;to the team behind your current favorite Drawboard from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your aim is to, in a single copy and paste,&nbsp; transplant all your highlighted text into a new document, this is an option I cannot find in the readers I use today either; for this you need to firstly convert your epub into a document usable in Word for
 example and then; </p>

            <p>I am there with ya. I have pretty extreme buyers remorse after getting my surface. I got the keyboard, pen, dongle on the TV with 64GB of storage and it is almost useless when it comes to doing a lot of things.
</p>
<p>Notes are ok, Drawboard is pretty great, but for everything else, it has been a nightmare.
</p>
<p>The absolute worst is that I cannot even browse the web with it. The CPU spikes, memory fills up and it is just slow as hell. Even OneDrive, which used to be great when it would allow for a complete list of files with a check for available online vs offline
 only, is broken with Win 10. It is almost like the device gets worse and worse every day. I now have to turn WiFi off when it sleeps to save battery, but then it doesn't always automatically connect. They keyboard sometimes disappears and needs to be detached/reattached
 and I still have that stupid "power connected, battery not charging" issue. I never had that on any device ever. Not a laptop, tablet, or phone. Now every time I plug it in, I have to check to make sure it is charging properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Samsung tablet and went back to that for pretty much everything. I use the surface to check email in Outlook, and I use Word and Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The part that&nbsp;ticks me off the most is that they are supposed to be using this as their flagship product. It is pushed on the NFL and all over television, huge marketing campaigns, and they are screwing it up. I had faith that Microsoft would focus on the
 issues because of the visibility, but it seems&nbsp;they already moved on. I am sure with the Surface 4, they will talk about how great it is in comparison and leave the Surface 3 folk out to dry.

            <p>Hi puffthefish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply. It's good (or not) to hear, that someone else got the same issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recognized, that browsing with Chrome (or Iron in my case) is OK an my surface. I installed it 2 days ago and it seems to be lightweight and zoomable. It hast a good starttime and somewhat enough apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A realy nice software is EpicPen. It is an open source tool. Feel free to google it and try it. It is in my opinon a good tool for a tablet/stylus windows-device. But it is unbelievable, that this tools are not publish and supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I will leave OneNote, because Microsoft seems to plan to force die ON-users to use their cloud-services. Maybe there is any other free tool to use and has a stylus support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recognized my battery is empty if I dont turn off wifi. This is not a main-issue for me, but it fits to my overall view on this device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant tell that I have the same keyboard-problems. My keyboards works fine and is a good piece of hardware but I got those "battery not charging"-issues with my dockingstation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you are not right with your forethoughts about the further support of Surface 3, but atm nobody talks about Surface 2, so maybe you are right =(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I hope Windows 10 will be a good and usable OS and let me forget those problems.</p>

            <p>That was odd, I posted and it disappeared. </p>
<p>To paraphrase what I said before:</p>
<p>That epic pen app is pretty great. Thanks for the suggestion, it inspired me to have another look at what I&nbsp;can do with&nbsp;the Surface and between Epic Pen and the wireless display adapter adapterI can leverage the Surface for presentations. So I reconfigured
 the Surface for a work tool, put on Telnet, Remote Desktop, VPN&nbsp;and FTP clients. I installed Fing&nbsp;and a&nbsp;Wifi scanner. I already have a USB to Serial adapter, now I picked up USB to Ethernet and it looks like this might become a pretty decent tool for work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there is hope after all</p>

<p>
</p><p>good to hear. I already believe, that in the end this device is good, but it is released to early.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try another great App : Microsoft Journal. It seems to be preinstalled since Windows XP and I never recognized it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Journal is a lightweight OneNote and could maybe help me to leave OneNote.</p>

<h2>            How to change gamertag on xbox.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to change my gamertag through xbox.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tag I want is available, and I try to claim it.&nbsp; The payment form tells me it costs $9.99 (I don't live in the US) and asks for payment information so I try to give my credit card details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the payment form is glitched.&nbsp; The country dropdown is locked on United States and is greyed out - as I said, I don't live in the US so it's impossible for me to provide any payment details and I can't change my tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>after usering a while,</p>
<p>I found either &nbsp;network&nbsp;neighborhood&nbsp;file copy&nbsp;or disk copy speed is very slow.....</p>
<p>if i user surface pro 3 onboard usb3, network&nbsp;neighborhood&nbsp;file copy or external disk driver file copy speed about 110mb</p>
<p>but if i user the usb3 port or giga net port in&nbsp;docking station, copy speed only left 3xmb or even under.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>i try to update the drivers but all report it's the lastest drivers</p>
<p>did i get a broken one, or it's just the docking station's speed..</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span>Open&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Desktop</span></li><li>
<span>Swipe from right and&nbsp;select&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span></li><li>
<span>Choose&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control&nbsp;Panel</span></li><li>
<span>Click on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows&nbsp;Update</span></li><li>
<span>Select&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Check&nbsp;for Updates</span></li></ul>

<h3> edboatright  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Weather Channel and windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>OK, I&nbsp;was running windows 8.1. which has given me a pain in the rear although I worked out some of the bugs and was using some of my old software that wouldn't load without forcing it on to windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally I think that Microsoft should be ashamed
 that they even considered putting it on the market.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I accepted the upgrade to windows 10 and after partitioning my hard drive, copying every thing from c:\ to the new partition, I proceeded to download windows 10.&nbsp; Then windows 10 took over my computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After deciding that I didn't want any part of windows 10 I used the app. to go back to windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Most every thing works except the Weather Channel App.&nbsp; It doesn't show up in my program list that should install it.</p>
<p>I cannot reinstall it, apparently until it is completely installed and I cannot locate the file any way that I try.</p>
<p>When I right click the app, is only allows me to, either pen it to start or unpin it from start, depending on whether it is pined or unpinned.</p>
<p>When I try to open it, It says that the app is faulty and the MS store will try to repair it. This I have tried at least three times which takes several minutes and to no avail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>All of the information that I can find doesn't work and seems to be totally outdated.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>You can't. The folder&nbsp;C:\Users\Guest House is a profile folder that is linked to a Windows account called "Guest House". If you do not like the name then you must create a new account, e.g. "House Guest".</p>

<br />
<br />
Read the directions carefully, then download and use the EXE File Association Fix.&nbsp; You may well have to use the LNK (Shortcut) File Association Fix as well.<br />
<br />
Because this problem is often caused by malware, after your exe file association has been fixed, download, install, update, and run scans with both of the following free tools (you don't need the pay-for versions). Don't run the scans simultaneously. The scans
 will take some time, so start one up and go do a non-computer chore for a while.&nbsp; Let the scanner remove anything that it finds.&nbsp; When you're finished, you can uninstall the scanners if desired.<br />

eSet Online Virus Scanner</a> (you can do this before or after running the malware scans)<br />

                    I attempted to clone my old HD onto a new SDD, but the cloning seemed to fail and the system would not boot into Windows 10 on the new SDD or the old HD.&nbsp; So I had no working version of Win10, and I performed a new clean installation of Windows 10 on the
 SDD (from a Recovery drive).&nbsp; Just now in searching through the file structure on the SDD (the old HD is disconnected), I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">found all my old files and programs under</span>
<strong>"C:/Windows.old"</strong> that must have been created during the cloning.&nbsp; There are zero files and programs carried over to the new clean Windows 10 installation, for example in My Documents or Pictures.&nbsp; Can I simply move all of these cloned file
 copies into the new Windows installation?&nbsp; Also can I do the same with the cloned Program Files, or will they not work because they were not installed in this new clean Windows environment?&nbsp; Normally this would be done via a Backup and Restore process or via
 software such as Acronis.&nbsp; What is the best way to proceed?&nbsp; Thanks!

            You can certainly move your old files from the Windows.old folder, but you cannot move programs that have installers. Programs without installers, that you simply run directly can be moved. Those are few and far between in the Windows world, however.

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since I posted this, Windows Support also replied and concluded something similar.&nbsp; All files such as in Documents, Pictures, Videos, Downloads should all transfer directly into my new "clean" (and empty) Windows 10 environment.&nbsp; However, Microsoft said
 NOT to transfer over the old User Account definitions, nor any of the Program Files, assuming they will work on the new Clean Install!&nbsp; Instead create those replicated User Accounts, and reinstall all the applications that one needs in the new environment,
 one at a time.&nbsp; So I have a bit of work ahead of me!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Warning to anyone cloning a HDD to a new one (either a HDD or SDD)</span>:&nbsp; Once the cloning transfer is done, close your PC down completely (do NOT reboot with two Windows drives both mounted!).&nbsp; Then open your case
 and disconnect the old HDD via its SATA cable and power.&nbsp; Only then, with the new SDD connected as the
 which is what happened to me!&nbsp; So then neither Drive will boot to Windows 10, and you are forced into a clean install of Windows on one of the two drives!&nbsp; And hopefully you had all your files fully backed up on an external HDD, so they could be recovered
 on the new version of your Windows PC!&nbsp; Lesson learned here!</p>

                    I haven't messed with the DPI. Any reason why my screen looks like it's zoomed in or something? The icons on my desktop, the font on websites, the icons on the start/windows tab = all larger than normal. What can I do to get everything back to default

            What resolution do you have it set to? What is the native resolution of your monitor?<br />
<br />
Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Appearance and Personalization. Click Personalization and then click Display Settings. Under Resolution, move the slider to the correct size. If you have a laptop or a flat panel monitor, use its native resolution. Your laptop's&nbsp;native resolution
 will be in the documentation that came with your computer (which may be in a file on the hard drive) and will also be on the computer mftr.'s tech support site for your model. Your monitor's native resolution will be in the documentation that came with the
 monitor and sometimes on the clear plastic protective sheet that came covering the screen.<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />

<h3> dave-san  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Drive does not show in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>My CD/DVD drive has worked at some point after I installed Windows 10 but now does not show up in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the drive very often hence my vagueness about when the problem may have started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to write an ISO to DVD at some point, following prompts from Windows, which didn't work , although Windows did not report an error.&nbsp; I subsequently managed to write a disk using some third party software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in Disk Management, the drive shows up as drive D, as "CD-ROM 0". It shows No Media even though I have a T/P installation disk in the device.</p>
<p>Eject works , so Windows does recognise the hardware and can communicate with the firmware and therefore I believe the drive is still fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Properties, the status is "This device is working properly"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is from Microsoft dated 21/6/2006 version 10.0.15063.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling the device and rebooting - no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried making registry changes advised elsewhere ie</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0"</span><span>
</span><span>/</span><span>f</span><span>
</span><span>/</span><span>v</span><span>
</span><span>EnumDevice1</span><span> </span>
<span>/</span><span>t</span><span>
<span>/</span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>REG_DWORD</span><span> </span>
<span>/</span><span>d</span><span>
<span>/</span><span>d</span><span>
</span><span>0x00000001</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Result : This entry was missing but adding it seemed to make no difference after rebooting</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Removing Upper and Lower filters from&nbsp; "</span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Result: There was no entry for upper filter but there was for lower filter so I deleted that but, again, after rebooting, it made no difference.</span></p>
<p>I have a suspicion that attempting to use Windows to write files to DVD , although it was an option, was a mistake that has affected access to the drive, however I have no idea where to look and it may be a red herring.</p>

<p>Hi Gerard,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>I had already followed the advice in the article "Your CD or DVD drive is not recognized by Windows or other programs". Here are my results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 result : troubleshooter found no problems (!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 result:&nbsp; the device is recognised in the BIOS so no further action seems possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 result:&nbsp; As mentioned before , I did uninstall the drivers and Windows reinstalled the same ones with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4 result:&nbsp; There were no ATA Channels 0 or 1, so could not uninstall them.&nbsp; Neither was there a&nbsp;
<span>Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller</span> , instead there was a specific driver which was approximately called HL-DT-ST DVDRAM_GH24NS95 (I didn't make a note of the name but recognised it as the DVD drive). I deleted this and
 when I rebooted there was a <span>Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller in it's place. This still resulted in no change.</span></p>
<p>Method 5 result: As stated above , I made this change to the registry , rebooted and the result was no change.</p>
<p>Method 6 result: Again, as stated above , I made this change to the registry , rebooted and the result was no change.</p>
<p><span>I have downloaded the firmware file for my DVD drive but when I opened it the text file that accompanied the installation file said&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"</span></p>
<div>=========================<br />
LG Electronics GH24NS95<br />
Firmware Version RN01<br />
=========================</div>
<div>
<p>Never update the firmware if the problem you are having is the drive <br />
isn't seen by windows, won't write with the included software, or other&nbsp; <br />
interface related problems, unless the firmware specifically states it <br />
fixes the problem you are having."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I haven't proceeded to reinstall the firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that the LG GH24NS95 was released before Windows 10 and only mentions that it will work with Windows XP through to Windows 8.</p>
<p>I also note that the last time the drive worked was before the Creators update. Perhaps that had some effect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any further suggestions?</p>

<h3> lb899  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows dictation stuck on initializing &#40;Win &#43; H&#41;</h2>
                    <p>As stated above my dictation window is stuck on initializing (Win + H). I've closed the dictation window many times. I've rebooted my computer many times.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
History:</p>
<p>1. It was stuck on initializing&nbsp;when the feature&nbsp;first went live.<br />
2. After an update or two, it started working.<br />
3. After another or more updates it stopped working, stuck on initializing&nbsp;again.<br />
<br />
I would really like to use this feature again.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>Happy New Year!</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the efforts taken by you in troubleshooting this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you aware of any changes made to the PC prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you have the latest updates installed on the PC?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Using Windows dictation feature converts spoken words into text on your PC. It's possible that the feature turns off automatically when it doesn't hear
 anything.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods one by one to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Method A: Make sure that you have the latest version of Windows installed on your device. To check this, open the Settings screen, select System &gt; About.
 Install the latest update if you are prompted to. ‘<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17154/windows-10-keep-your-pc-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Keep the PC up to date</span></a>’</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Dictation is available in US English only. To use it, your PC needs to be connected to the internet. To dictate in other languages, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17208/windows-10-use-speech-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>Method B: Your keyboard language should match the language of your Windows. To check this, open the Settings screen, click Time and Language &gt; Region
 &amp; Language. </span></p>
<p><span>To isolate the issue, create a local user account. Follow the steps in ‘<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Create

            Hi Susan, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi,
<br />Updating to Windows 10 1803, the latest feature update should resolve your issue.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            I would first try installing the latest cumulative update for Windows 10 1709 manually: 
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4103727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Sea...</a>

<br />
<br />2018-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x86-based Systems (KB4103727)
<br />
<br />64 bit
<br />
<br />2018-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4103727)
<br />	
<br />
<br />
<br />Follow instructions to install manually:

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

            Hi Susan, I am really sorry to hear that, it is possible there is an incompatibility between your system and the latest updates.
<br />
<br />With regard to trying again and choosing delete files and apps, it may work, it may not, no-one can be sure what will happen with these updates, sometimes hey run so smoothly and other times, hey completely wreck a system
<br />
<br />I have long since turned them off as I need my work station fully functioning at all times . . .

<h2>            Where do i buy legit windows 10 &#38; office license key in Malaysia for cheap&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
In my area there are no official Microsoft stores and such in order for me to find as cheap as possible keys but definitely genuine and not taken from frauds, stolen, and such.<br />
<br />
I am currently using these sites for finding Windows 10 &amp; Offices keys:<br />
<br />
Shopee Malaysia:<br />
shopee.com.my<br />
<br />
Lazada Malaysia:<br />
www.lazada.com.my<br />
<br />
The problem is there are so many windows 10 keys that are claimed legitimate and ranges from (Typical Minimum, MYR5/USD1.21) to&nbsp; (Typical Maximum, MYR50/USD12.1). Chatting with them wont help to ease my mind either.
<br />
<br />
So I need ultra-crystal clear clarification on this matter which brings me to this,<br />
<br />
Are these super cheap keys legit? I dont know which ones are legit. Some advises and hindsights will be very helpful. Thank you.

            Hi ThisPC02
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer to your question - you cannot buy legit licences cheaply
<br />
<br />if a licence is legit, it will not be cheap - that is how you judge the legitimacy of a licence for the most part . . . though not always
<br />
<br />If you see a retailer selling a Microsoft product significantly cheaper than Microsoft can sell it for, then there has to be something wrong with that, it is as simple as that
<br />
<br />What they are selling are volume licence keys, those will initially activate and will within a month automatically de-activate, because those licences need to be re-armed from a company Key Management Server on a regular basis - which you will be unable to do 
<br />
<br />Because those are volume licences, you will then need to uninstall that version of Windows after you purchase a proper licence and re-install Windows again . .. 
<br />
<br />Believe me - it is not worth it!

            Is it possible to run the program with Command Prompt as an administrator? I have this same issue, though Its ONLY on external drives, and running with Command Prompt (AS ADMINISTRATOR) Worked for me, I hope it works for you!

                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 7 where I had a problem with a ghost user account.&nbsp; I hoped the upgrade would solve it but instead is has got worse.&nbsp; Every time the computer goes to sleep I have to restart the computer or the login says invalid password
 even though there is only one user.&nbsp; I have told the computer to stay awake for now, but that is not ideal.</p>

            <p>For anybody else experiencing this issue- it may also be due to an automatic sign in issue.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>--CAUSE--</p>
<p>The "invalid password screen" is caused when you have set your user to automatically sign in to windows, and you change your password.<br />
<br />
--SOLUTION--</p>
<p>1. Open "netplwiz" from the run command</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click on the checkbox that says "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer"<br />
<br />
3. Restart machine and see if your problem has been solved!</p>

</p><p>Thanks to the people who offered suggestions on here.&nbsp; I checked with Samsung and they were very honest, and let me know that they don't yet have device drivers to support Windows 10, therefore to use the touchpad I would need to roll back to Windows 8.&nbsp;
 I've done this and the laptop is working well again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware that there is only a limited window in which you can roll back easily.</p>
