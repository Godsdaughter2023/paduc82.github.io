<h2>            Entire Wuaserv &#40;Windows Update&#41; File Missing from Registry&#47; Missing From Services&#47; Missing as A File in System32</h2>
                    <p>Now, this has been a bit of a pain in my ass. I've had this issue for quite some time now (a few months, to be exact) and am now unsure of what to do after doing the following:</p>
<p>- DISM checks</p>
<p>- SFC/ scannow&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows Update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>- Running BITS&nbsp;</p>
<p>- A Full-On System Repair</p>
<p>- Many Similar Things (etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to keep it quick; I got a virus which I believed had deleted many essential .dll files involved in certain Windows XP packages. I have tried alot in terms of trying to fix this issue, but have done so to no avail. I am now at the point of considering
 backing-up my files and doing a clean reinstallation of Windows 10. However, just because I don't want to go through that hassle, I want to see if someone has any suggestions for me, as I am still up for trying new things. Help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for those that're wondering, trying to update Windows produces the error message "(0x80070424)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Transfer file list with additional info to excel</h2>
                    <p>I have some picture files in a directory. With Explorer I can list the files and by adding columns like picture size and horizontal resolution this additional data data is displayed.</p>
<p>How can I transfer the complete list, with the additional columns, to i.e. excel, or .csv?</p>
<p>Explorer should be amended to contain a meny item "export list" with various options!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. </p>
<p>This works but only partially. For folders with a few files it is ok, but for a folder with 171 picture files there is missing data for 76 of the files. In most cases the date is missing, in some the pixel size or the resolution. They are in all cases visible
 in Explorer. I could not see any common pattern for the files with missing data. In many cases the date info was missing in every second row. Also the pixel size is in the form "?6657 x 4400?" which requires the substitution of the questionmarks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to improve the process?</p>

            <p>It seems to me that the missing items start after ab 24 rows, or after the rows that are visible in the Explorer window. After reading the readme file it is actually how SysExport is supposed to work, only exports the visible lines but not the whole list.
 So I have to make the export separately for each part of 24 rows in the list. </p>
<p>I suggest Microsoft includes an export list possibility in Explorer at earliest convienence.</p>

            <p>No missing data here, but I can confirm the question marks around Dimensions, and the
<em>Remove question marks</em> option doesn't seem to work properly in Win10. Dropped the developer a note but not sure if/when the issue will be fixed.</p>
<p>

ExpPrint</a>, <a href="http://www.softwareok.com/?Download=Q-Dir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>In ExpPrint there is no option to include the dpi of an image. In Q-Dir I could not find any way to include non standard columns at all. What I need is definitely the pixels size and the dpi info so that i can calculate from what size of the original the
 image is made from. Also the date is informative.</p>
<p>OK, the current project now got ok with SysExporter but in a rather cumbersome way. I repeat

            <p>OK, yes now in Q-dir I can get the additional columns from the list. But exporting works correctly only for the visible lines of the list. Date and image size is blank för the reminder of the list. Or is there some setting somewhere that could correct this?
 Tried to print to .pdf but in the resulting file there are no tabs or other divider between columns. Spaces yes but not very helpful.

<p>Works properly here with a folder containing ~500 images. I added the columns I wanted and then scrolled down to ensure all the data had been extracted from the files and the columns were populated fully (Explorer also takes time to extract file metadata).
 Then I exported as XLS and it opened Excel automatically with all the data.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Cover Keyboard issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rittertj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Cover Keyboard issue</h2>
                    <p>Worked fine for years. I went to use it today and no letters or numbers show up wherever I want type onscreen. Mouse pad word fine. This is a pro cover so it has lighted keys and the lights work fine including the keys that control the dimmer. Now the weird
 part...the onscreen keyboard has the same issue. You type and nothing inputs...everything is normal except the letters don't show up. So I tried restarting, reinstall the driver, two key reset, nothing works. Except the onscreen keyboard will start functioning
 if I do a hard restart. That is until I attach the keyboard/cover then all inputs stop again.&nbsp; HELP!</p>

<p>Hi ritterTJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would need to perform further checking to determine resolve this issue. First, check if an update was recently installed that may have affected the performance of your Surface. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>View update history</strong>. Also, check if the keyboard shortcuts will work when performed. Try opening the
<strong>Task Manager</strong> (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) or <strong>Settings </strong>(Windows key + I) or open a browser and see if Ctrl + T will open a new tab. You can also check if the keyboard will work when you
<strong>Copy </strong>(Ctrl + C) a highlighted text and <strong>Paste </strong>(Ctrl + V) it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's reinstall the keyboard language to reinitialize the input. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong> &gt; <strong>
Region &amp; language</strong>.</li><li>Click on the current language &gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Add a keyboard</strong>.</li><li>Choose any language. Once there's at least two languages, you'll be able to <strong>
Remove </strong>the one that's in use.</li><li><strong>Remove </strong>the original language then go back to <strong>Add a keyboard</strong> to reinstall the one we removed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest that you install definition updates and perform a scan <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17464/help-protect-my-computer-with-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">using Windows Defender</a></strong>. If there are no changes, uninstall the driver of the Type Cover in Device Manager.
 Then, detach the Type Cover from the Surface. Cean the connectors using a soft cotton cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol. Let it dry then reconnect it to the Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. Perform a forced
 shutdown once done by pressing the power button for a full 10 seconds while the device is on, then restart it normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the suggestions resolve the problem, please let me know by replying to this post. I will be notified when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can so we can continue working towards a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is that the Touch Keyboard or the real On-Screen Keyboard?&nbsp; Also you could try starting Narrator (Win+Ctrl+Enter).&nbsp; I just noticed that the OSK can be used to enter some of Narrator's commands but not all.&nbsp; E.g. I normally use it in its "Locked Narrator
 key" mode and was able to toggle out of that using just Z on the OSK but could not switch back without using either the real Caps Lock Z or the Narrator settings dialog.&nbsp; I was actually hoping that Narrator might tell me what keys I was using but no luck there.&nbsp;
 Oops.&nbsp; There is a Narrator setting about that which I normally leave unchecked.&nbsp; So, it would be possible to hear your typing using the OSK when assisted by Narrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW this is the first time I have seen a report of this problem symptom.&nbsp; More ominously I wonder if you have been hit by the same broken firmware update that others are complaining about</p>

<p>I recently had to change credit cards, and my Xbox Live was suspended. I tried to change the payment option but every time I try to update it with the new credit card, it gives me the error code 80153003. The problem says I need to delete caches but it's
 not working. I tried to update the membership online but my accounts page is an "error, glitch in the system" screen. Am I just locked out?</p>

 that it not bother scanning the&nbsp;entire Type field of all files, instead just look at the first 3 characters with:&nbsp; type:~&lt;PDF&nbsp; but I think it took just as much time as the first search. &nbsp;IOW it completely ignored the current results AND it didn't get any benefit

                    As punishment (won't tell you what he did) I deleted my teenager's user account from my computer.&nbsp; We have windows XP.&nbsp; He somehow got back in, perhaps bullied my youngest into giving up her password and now re-created his account and made himself administrator.&nbsp;

I would like to know how it was done and how I can regain my administrator status and shut him down and fix it so he can never do this again!<br />

            <p>Hmmm!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I have to assume that you <em>are</em> the parent and not actually the teenager seeking retribution on his mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I can say to you is limited by our code of conduct.&nbsp;We are not permitted to assist with cracking passwords for fear of expulsion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I <strong><em>can</em></strong> say this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using XP home edition, the in-built administrator account probably does not have a password set. You can boot to safe mode where this account will be selectable at logon.</p>
<p>To boot in safe mode, keep hitting F8 twice a second after turning on the PC until you get the boot menu where safe mode is selectable by the up/down arrow keys, then hit enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using XP professional, try logging on using the built-in administrator account. You do not need to do this in safe mode (though you could if you want). If your normal logon screen is a user icon display hit ctrl-alt-del twice to get to a text
 input logon. Enter Administrator as the user name and try a blank password.</p>
<p>See also <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321305</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 does not recognize gamepad as input, so the screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff heikkinen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 does not recognize gamepad as input, so the screen constantly goes black</h2>
                    
<p>Unlike Windows XP (don't know about Vista), Windows 7 does not seem to recognize that there is input occurring when I use my gamepad. For this reason, my screen goes black every few minutes, like it would if I walked away from the computer entirely. How
 can I get Windows to recognize the gamepad as an input device, the way it does my keyboard and mouse?</p>
<p>I am aware that I can just turn the screensaver off, or remember to touch the mouse every few minutes. But those are workarounds, not solutions.</p>

            <p>I just want to clarify step 2 for everyone because it left me scrathing my head for a minute. Ignore the actual gamepad listed in device manager and expand Human Interface Devices. In this list you should see HID-compliant game controller. Right click select
 properties then continue at step 3.</p>

            <p>It depends if the computer's unique ID which is stored at Microsoft notices the drive change. Sometimes it does and sometimes not.<br />
Even if it requires activation, and will not do so automatically,you can always use the Product Activation Wizard and the Automated Phone System to Activate.</p>

<p>Hi Debbie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer offline status is your printer’s way of telling you that something is wrong with the communication between your computer and your printer, so one of the first things to check is your printer’s connection with your PC. Here are a couple of things
 you can try:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Power off, and then power on your printer to restart it. Wait for a while for it to be fully ready.&nbsp;</li><li>Check your printer connection. Check your printer and make sure that it’s connected to your PC network.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the above steps, I also suggest that you go through this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4015401/windows-10-fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">list</a></strong> of suggestions to fix printer connection

<p>Apologies if I hadn't gotten back sooner since I was out of the office. Upon further research, it seems like Windows 10 no longer supports this specific printer. The Windows 10 operating system relies on the driver released by manufacturers. If the printer
 manufacturer did not release an updated version of the driver, you can try running the driver in compatibility mode. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver file.</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot compatibility</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot program</strong>.</li><li>Check the box that says <strong>The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won't install or run now</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Windows 7</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. </li><li><strong>Click Windows 7</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Test the program</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 1000 keeps cutting out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 1000 keeps cutting out</h2>
                    I recently got a Wireless Desktop set with a Wireless Optimal Mouse 2000 and a&nbsp;Wireless Keyboard 1000. The mouse works fine and the keyboard appears to be working fine as well when typing normally, as I'm doing right now, but when I use it in games the
 performance is terrible.
<div><br />
<div>When I keep a button pressed down, for instance to walk in a game, the key stops responding after a few seconds. If I let it go and press it again, it works again for a few seconds. This symptom appears to get worse the more buttons I press at once and
 the more active I am with my mouse.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've tried moving the receiver around, and even placing it right next to the keyboard, I've replaced the batteries, the driver tool says the batteries and the connection are good, I've reinstalled the drivers and&nbsp;I've tried clearing the area around my
 desk so there's no other electronics that might interfere, even that didn't improve anything. I plugged the set into my laptop, with the same results in games.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this problem something that can be fixed, or is this keyboard simply not usable in games?</div>
<div><br />

            I've tried all that, it seems the connection, the ports, the batteries, all aren't the issue. I think this particular Wireless Keyboard just isn't capable of handling the amount of input required for gaming, after some research I've found that this is
 a common issue with Microsoft wireless keyboards, and reviewers and user reports clearly state that pressing multiple keys at once is to much for these devices, so I'm gonna bring it back to the store and buy a Logitech.

<p>
</p><p>Normally, you will see the missed calls on your chat or recent tab, but in the event that it is not showing the missed calls on your Skype app, you might have signed in to a different Skype account. Make sure that you are using the correct
<strong>Skype name</strong> (username)&nbsp;to sign in where the Skype number is delivered to. If you are not sure with your Skype name, you can check the<strong> email order confirmation</strong> you received from Skype, it has the Skype name together with the
 details of your order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While checking, there is no Skype number on the Skype account connected to your community profile. It is possible that you might have purchased the Skype number on a different account. We are doing this because we need to check the Skype number if it was
 dialed correctly.</p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I'm extremely sure it's not a matter of accounts.</p>
<p>Especially since the windows notification only popup once I start Skype (as expected since otherwise there is no program to generate the notification).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no longer a recent tab in the new Skype app, only chats and calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa3789a8-7c3e-4811-95aa-2fadbeadc638?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa3789a8-7c3e-4811-95aa-2fadbeadc638?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Though it's sorted by time so it should be visible there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the same again once more, but instead of making a PSTN call to the Skype in number I tried a Skype to Skype call.</p>
<p>Same result, once I start the recipients Skype client I get a windows notification but no entry in the timeline, the last message there is still a chat message from February.<br />
</p>
<p>Upon further testing I now see that the timeline is not updated at all, even when the Skype client is running and receiving calls, answered or not, there is no entry added to the timeline. Only when I make outgoing calls an entry
 is added.</p>
<p>This time the last entry is a missed call from 10:28 today so they should be there only with a huge delay.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid it turned out that this is a <strong>fundamental limitation in the Skype infrastructure</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chat history/call log is <strong>only updated by a running client</strong>, thus if Skype is
<strong>not running, no missed calls will be logged</strong> into the chat/call history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a <strong>second system</strong> that does log missed calls when logged out.</p>
<p>This system shows up <strong>only in the windows notification</strong> when I start the classical windows Skype, including version 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the second system <strong>doesn't talk to the call log </strong>
and thus we only get the windows notification. When the notification disappear after a few seconds
<strong>it's gone</strong>. If you weren't at the computer looking at the screen at that moment you will have no idea someone tried to reach you. So
<strong>auto-starting Skype is a no go</strong> from here on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>second system</strong> although already very limited has further limitations.</p>
<p>These notifications only show up on the <strong>windows Skype version 8</strong>.</p>
<p>They <strong>don't show up </strong>on any other clients such as the <strong>windows 10 store version</strong> or the
<strong>android version</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Worse </strong>is that if you start one of these version before the version 8, the missed call notification is
<strong>consumed without being shown </strong>and when you start Skype version 8 <strong>
no notification is left to show</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a tip for those contacting chat support and share your screen with them.</p>
<p>Sometimes the support personnel closes the chat dialog. This prevents you from keeping a copy of the conversation and giving feedback after the chat is ended.</p>
<p>At the end of the call, click and hold on something, like the desktop, as long as you hold your mouse down they can't click anything and thus they can't close the chat dialog.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for asking this question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you are facing an issue with not able to install Windows Media Player. I will try and help you find a resolution, however I will need to ask a few
 questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any security program installed on the computer? Which fixit did you use? And what are the other troubleshooting steps that you have tried?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> which helps troubleshooting in scenarios when any third party software might be causing an issue
 with Windows. Start the computer in a clean boot state and then try installing Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “<b>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”</b>
 in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>"Clean Boot" had&nbsp;no effect.&nbsp; I get the exact same error at the exact same point in the installation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not make a record&nbsp;of which "Mr. Fix It" I ran.&nbsp; It was at the end of an official Microsoft support thread which I followed.</p>
<p>Since my original posting, I have briefly reviewed a anumber of the *.log files that the WMP installation leaves behind under the "C:\Windows".&nbsp; Several&nbsp;of these log files have multi-hundreds of entries and it would take years to process them all,&nbsp;line-by-line.&nbsp;
 However, I did notice that there are dozens of&nbsp;entries which&nbsp;appear to have been created when&nbsp;WMP-11 installer discovered that I had moved my "My Documents" folder (and all contents therein) to my D:\ partition.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of my other Microsoft Office apps have
 successfully operated with this arrangement since I initially moved the My Documents folder&nbsp;some&nbsp;5+ years ago.&nbsp; I originally did this to keep the&nbsp;"Windows OS" files plus&nbsp;the "My Programs" folders on the C:\&nbsp;partition and then keep all of my personal data on
 my D:\Partition.&nbsp; This simplifies the amount of data I need to routinely backup.&nbsp; Surprisingly, I observed&nbsp;that the installer for WMP-11 does NOT ask where my media is (or will be) kept and I suspect this may be at the root of my particular problem.&nbsp; If so,
 it seems odd that there does not appear to be any Microsoft utilities to completely strip WMP components out of a crashed-installation (such as this) and then re-install the necessary components&nbsp;to correct.&nbsp; From what I have observed from forum surfing, it
 appears my situation is far from unique.</p>

<h2>            Very Strange Error Recently</h2>
                    
<p>Hmmm... So yeah, its been like this for about an hour right now and ive run out of ideas. Xbox live was running perfectly fine this morning and I recently picked up a game Fable III. I started it about an hour ago and when on the main menu where it tells
 me to press start it said that the storage device had been removed either 1) check to make sure its in, 2)Play game (no achievements) or 3) go to dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that error,&nbsp; disconnected and reconnected my hard drive (I am using a 120gb Elite) and still the same error. So I read up online and someone suggested Delete my profile and recover it, which I had done before, but while I was recovering it, about 3/4
 through the progress bar that "Xbox live sign up is currently unavailable, please try again later" and I have been trying ever since this happened, im on my 6th recovery attempt but not expecting a different result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now can not sign into xbox live with my semi-recovered account and I still cant play Fable 3. Any Ideas? Everything was working fine this morning up until I used Fable 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Various factors that affect account management, recovery, or sign-up may cause this error. Try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the Xbox LIVE service status:</p>
<p>On the top of every page of the Customer Support site, you can see the current status of Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>Run the Xbox LIVE connection test for status.</p>
<p>Go to My Xbox, and select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Network.</p>
<p>Select Test Xbox LIVE Connection. When the test is completed, the service status is displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Wait, and then try again later.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender ,windows sidebar properties and windows media player</h2>
                    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideally my windows defender and media was working as well as sidebar properties, but i changed my installation path from drive c:/ to drive h:/. Because i have low space on my on drive c:/. &nbsp;But i changed some of the target of shortcut
 in the properties and the programs worked properly except for the three i am addressing. If i open from the control panel it says windows defender not found as well as sidebar properties and media player prompt "service execution failed" Really tried everything.
 but i hope it you help me solve this. Thank you for your time.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7603965-a878-47dc-a089-582b5d1d7fbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7603965-a878-47dc-a089-582b5d1d7fbd" /></a></p>

<h2>            Notifications Delayed</h2>
                    
<p>My notifications have been delayed on my xbox one since day 1. I will get the achievement but wont get the notification for like 1-2 minutes later. The same goes for messages or. I would really like them to fix this. Its not a game breaking issue but its
 rather annoying, like i wont recieve game invites or party invites untill like 2 minutes larer. Sometimes dont get them at all. It gets rather frusterating. It has got to be on there software side since i know other people that have this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played Valiant Hearts this morning and got 5 achievements but none of them showed up as notifications when playing the game. Tried NHL 15, same thing. Got the achievement but no notification for it. Noticed that my Gamerscore went up, that's how I found
 out that I got the achievements. Anyone else having the same issues?</p>
<p>This just started happening today after the latest update. Before I always received the achievement notification popup instantly.</p>

<p>*****SOLUTION*****</p>
<p>This began happening to me today, November 1st 2014. Usually I can tolerate a few software malfunctions as I usually keep myself occupied with getting achievements. Like the rest of you, I received no notification. I don't know about you, but unlocking an
 achievement without that 'Ping' sound is just not as satisfying.</p>
<p>...Then I remembered a friend had issues with his controller not connecting to his console. He contacted support and they told him how to do a 'HARD RESET'. This has saves my life now.</p>
<p>By HOLDING the power button on your console, you will perform the HARD RESET. You'll know you have done it correctly if the Xbox symbol does NOT flash. It worked for me.</p>
<p>Other issues it solves:</p>
<p>- Stubborn controller connection (Refuses to connect)</p>
<p>- Strict NAT type (Preventing you from joining and/or hearing friends)</p>
<p>- Kinect issues (Kinect is not plugged in ...apparently)</p>
<p>Hope this helps you all out. Let me know </p>

<p>If Bogalo can't tell the opponents by colour and he still does fine I don't really see an excuse to be honest.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Either he's ridiculously poor as a player or he's doing it deliberately, but he's successfully killed a lot of people for someone who isn't good enough to tell teams apart....

<p>Just don't quit anymore games for any reason and don't play with your friend for a few days and the quit ban should reset itself. &nbsp;</p>
