<h2>            I am unable to work with Windows Updates&#47;Windows Live Mail and Store app after updating to Kb2919355</h2>
                    Original title: ABLE TO UPDATE TO KB2919355, BUT...................I get error 0x80073b01 When I go to the Store!!
<p>
</p><p>After the latest updates to the KB2919355 my computer was able to Install that Update.&nbsp; But--when I install that update I can
<strong>no longer connect </strong>to the <strong>Windows</strong><strong>Store App</strong>--can no longer
<strong>Check for Windows Updates</strong>, and my <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> makes me have to
<strong>keep signing in</strong> in order to get my mail.&nbsp; Everything else works however.&nbsp; All the other Apps work--but not the Store App.&nbsp; There's no point in updating if the Update does not work and makes everything else worse.&nbsp; There's no point in updating
 if you can't go to the store anymore.&nbsp; That's the main App in Windows 8 or 8.1.&nbsp; If you can't go to the store you can't get any more Apps.&nbsp; So far now,
<strong>I have updated to KB2919355 four times</strong>, and <strong>four times</strong> within the last couple of weeks, I have had to do a
<strong>Windows Restore</strong>.&nbsp; Yesterday I updated&nbsp;the fourth&nbsp;time to 2919355 and I keep (each time) getting the
<strong>error 0x80073b01</strong> and today I restored my computer for the <strong>
fourth time</strong>.&nbsp; When I restore my computer everything works.&nbsp; <strong>The Store App--I can Check for Windows Updates--and the mail works just like it is supposed to do.&nbsp; I have no problems with Windows 8.1 at all.&nbsp;</strong> I have loved it ever since
 day one.&nbsp; But how many times can I keep Restoring my Computer?&nbsp; I don't want to keep messing it up.&nbsp; Everytime I update--those things which I have mentioned--quit working.&nbsp; I may just have to let it stay like it is--because it works this way.&nbsp; I cannot find
 any solutions for that error 80073b01.&nbsp; I have tried <strong>WSReset.exe--which does not work</strong>.&nbsp; One time I called Microsoft and they took over and ran repairs and scans and after that---none of the Apps would open.&nbsp; That was when I restored it the
 first time.&nbsp; Since then, I will try to Update when they have a newer release of KB2919355--and if it does not work--I just restore my computer and wait for the next newer release of KB2919355 and try it again.&nbsp; I have Windows 8.1 Pro and installed that version
 from Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;which I upgraded to from Windows 7.&nbsp; All the other updates which I have received have all worked.&nbsp; This is the only update I have ever had a problem with.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which antivirus program is installed on the computer? </p>
<p>2. When do you get 0x80073b01 error code? Is it while running Windows Updates or accessing Store?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if the Component-Based Servicing (CBS) manifest is corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to make sure that Windows Updates is working for other dependent applications to run smoothly. Perform the steps mentioned here. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Windows Update troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running Windows Update troubleshooter and check the results. </p>
<p>You might be able to automatically fix some problems by running the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update Troubleshooter</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>:<strong> Run the DISM tool</strong><br />
</p>
<p>1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.<br />
Note If you are using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen. Then, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.<br />
2. Enter command prompt in the search box.<br />
3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click Run as administrator.<br />
4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong><br />
</p>
<p>5. To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.<br />
6. Run Windows Update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: <br />
</strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, you may run SFC scan to check if there is any system corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; Actually everything works just fine when I restore my computer.&nbsp; I have Installed Update KB2919355 Four (4) times and Restored my computer Four (4) times.&nbsp; For some reason this Update does not work properly.&nbsp; The computer works
 just fine without the Update.&nbsp; But I would like to be able to have it work when I update it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do Update it all the Apps work except for the Store App.&nbsp; It will tell me that I cannot connect to the store--that the server might be down or my network connection has timed out with that error code 0x80073b01.&nbsp; Also, I cannot go to Windows Update
 and Check for Updates.&nbsp; I get the same error code when I try to do that.&nbsp; Normally, I can go to the Store and I can check for Windows Updates.&nbsp; But when I install 2919355 I cannot go to the store or update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install that update and go to the store--I have noticed that when I go to Settings in the Store App--that the only thing listed there is Permissions.&nbsp; Normally the Store App should have listed in Settings:&nbsp; Your Account-Preferences-App Updates-Terms
 of Use-Help- and Permissions.&nbsp; But when I install that update it only lists Permissions.&nbsp; So I believe the Update is Corrupting the Store App--in other words, wiping out the store's components.&nbsp; All the other Apps continue to work--all but the Store App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried all the Scans &amp; Repairs, etc...&nbsp; But it works just fine unless I update.&nbsp; Then if I try to fix it it sometimes just makes it a lot worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft Tech ran some scans &amp; repairs and afterwards--NONE of the Apps worked.&nbsp; That was when I did my first Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 other computers with the 8.1 Update and they all work just fine.&nbsp; This computer has Windows 8.1 Pro in it.&nbsp; Also this computer had Windows 7 originally, then I upgraded to Win 8 Pro when it came out and then updated to 8.1 pro when it came out--but
 the Update to it does not seem to work--that is the Store App does not work with that error code 80073b01 and I cannot check for Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might just wait and see if they come out with a revised version again of this update and then try to install it again--and if the store app does not work that time--Restore it again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information provided. The major cause of the issue is that Windows Updates components are getting corrupted after installing this specific update. It looks like you may not have tried the steps that I have provided above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to install the update once again and try to repair it by performing these steps. As you can refer this article which contains the same steps to resolve Windows Update issue. You can ignore the error code mentioned in the article.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: The steps are also applicable to Windows 8.1</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you read in my response to you previously where I called Microsoft and a Tech ran all those scans and did the Repair &amp; Fix It Scan etc...&nbsp; All of those things mentioned above, and after she did all of those things--NONE of the Apps would open after that.&nbsp;
 Nothing worked!&nbsp; So I did a Restore and that fixed everything.&nbsp; All my Apps worked and the Store App works just fine--it's just not Updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I will go to that page and see.&nbsp; I do know that I had previously tried that DISM.exe and it does not work at all.&nbsp; It is unknown--the online thing is unknown.&nbsp; Also I have tried to clear the cache--WSReset.exe and that just takes me to the Store with
 that blank page and that error message about 80073b01.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just went to where you directed me, and I have tried the above mentioned things.&nbsp; After I installed the Update the first time I tried all of those things on my own before I called Microsoft.&nbsp; First I ran the troubleshooter.&nbsp; That did not fix all the problems.&nbsp;
 It fixed two things and said that there were missing or corrupted files.&nbsp; I tried the DISM.exe and that did not work because my computer says the online whatever is Unknown.&nbsp; So I could not do that.&nbsp; The MS Tech did however run all these things.&nbsp; Also did
 the SFC/Scannow etc....Also did the Repair Scan,etc....&nbsp; After those things were done--NONE of my Apps would open.&nbsp; None of them!&nbsp; So I did the Restore and everything worked after that-- except I was not Updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may end up having to put this computer away and get another one later on.&nbsp; I like to have two good computers so that I'll have a Back-Up Computer in case any thing happens.&nbsp; I also have two tablet computers.&nbsp; All of them have been Updated to 8.1 and updated.&nbsp;
 All of them work just fine with the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed they revised the update again yesterday--the 14th.&nbsp; Wonder if that will fix the Store App problem getting corrupted.&nbsp; It did mention about the Updating Problem--maybe that will fix the store app too.&nbsp; It is the same error code for both--that 0x80073b01.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's disable&nbsp;all Microsoft services including all third party startup items before installing the update. We need to know what exactly is causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link to place the laptop in a clean boot state and then start installing the<strong>KB2919355
</strong>update:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the update, if the issue still occurs, you may create a new user account and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Create a user account </span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just did the above except I could not get the msconfig to work properly as you suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a clean reboot and I installed the Update again.&nbsp; In the msconfig the box is already cleared and it will not let me enable them.&nbsp; The hide all Microsoft services
 box is cleared and I cannot enable all.&nbsp; In task bar all of my Startup were disabled and still are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was able to install the Update again for the 5th time now.&nbsp; And all of the Apps that I have tried do work as far as I can see or the ones which I have tried anyway.&nbsp; But the store app only goes to that blank page with that error 80073b01 and if
 I go to Windows Update I cannot Check for Updates with that same error message 80073b01.&nbsp; I don't want to make another MS Account.&nbsp; I tried that the first time I installed this update and I couldn't get my MS Account back.&nbsp; It became a local account.&nbsp; I could
 not get my MS Account back.&nbsp; But thank heavens, after I restored my computer everything worked like it was supposed to.&nbsp; The Store App, My MS Account, everything works when I restore my computer.&nbsp; I don't want another account anyway.&nbsp; I sign into four computers
 with this account.&nbsp; I think there is something wrong with the update and it does not seem to me that it should corrupt the Store at all if there is nothing wrong with it.&nbsp; But of course, it did work in my other 3 computers.&nbsp; They all took the update just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I cannot go to the store again, but I do sign into MS Account properly on the computer.&nbsp; That has not changed.&nbsp; I still sign in the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            I just went on the Metro side again and tried many many Apps and they all work.&nbsp; They all open and I can do the things like read the news, check the weather etc....Play the Games--but I cannot Rate an App because that directs you to the store and the store
 is not there.&nbsp; If this were another App, I would uninstall it and then reinstall it.&nbsp; But I cannot do that because you have to go to the store to download an app.&nbsp; That is what it looks like to me.&nbsp; I need a new Store App.&nbsp; The Store App needs to be downloaded
 again or refreshed.&nbsp; How to do that?

            I just discovered that I cannot sign in to Xbox.&nbsp; It tells me to make sure that I am connected to the Internet and sign in again.&nbsp; It thinks that I am not connected to the Internet although I am.&nbsp; And those other error messages that I got told me something
 similar--to connect to the Internet.&nbsp; At the store it says either the server is down or the internet connection has timed out.&nbsp; Error 0x80073b01.

            I went back and ran the sfc/scannow and typed what it said to make a sfcdetails.txt file and it put it on my desktop--but it is empty.&nbsp; It did not put the corrupted files in the text.&nbsp; I was going to try and do that manually--to fix corrupted files.&nbsp; But
 I cannot see what the corrupted files are because it is empty.&nbsp; After the scan it said it found corrupted files and was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; Also when I typed out what it said to make the sfcdetails.txt it ignored "/c", "[", and "]".&nbsp; And it did make
 the sfcdetails icon on my desktop--but it was empty.

<p>I used this just recently and have I used it with no scope. I have notice NO bullet drop killing guys. I was wonder is this because I used it without scope or is this a usual thing? FYI I was playing Omar **** conquest and could hit guys on A while at

<p>There isn't co-op for 3 which is sooo lame considering they had that mode for 3 on the original Xbox back in the day. &nbsp;I know because I played through it in that mode. &nbsp;I too am upset it's not in this version. &nbsp;My understanding is it's like that &nbsp;because
 this version is based off of the PC version.. which didn't have co-op. &nbsp;They might have done that to easier do the graphical upgrades that they did. &nbsp;Still, so lame. &nbsp;I just picked mine up today knowing all that, but it's still well worth the price. &nbsp;Still
 a lot of fun to be had with it. &nbsp;Hope you keep it.</p>

<p>I can indeed confirm that Doom 3 does NOT have a co-op campaign this time. &nbsp;Doom 3 on the xbox had a co-op campaign, but not on the 360. What kind of terrible, stupid idea was that!!?? Doom 1 and Doom 2 have a 4 player co-op campaign. Doom 3 has no co-op.

<p>So anyway I brought it back to Gamestop for a full refund yesterday. &nbsp;Ended up buying the the Borderlands DLC instead. &nbsp;:tup:</p>

<p>Ouch sorry to hear that man. &nbsp;My only question is did you buy BFG for just co-op? &nbsp;If so there are many other games better suited for that. &nbsp;Doom 3 even without that mode has a lot to offer and then some. &nbsp;I agree it's a huge disappointment though. &nbsp;The
 developers messed up on that aspect, but this collection is better suited played alone. &nbsp;More creepy that way.</p>

<p>Yes that was the main reason I wanted Doom 3 was to play through the co-op again. &nbsp;I owned it on the original xbox and loved the co-op mode for Doom 3. Played through it many times with friends, family, and randoms. &nbsp;I just simply could not believe Doom
 3 didnt have co-op on the 360. &nbsp;I also didnt like the fact we could not install Doom 3. If you install it, you cant access Doom 1 or Doom 2. &nbsp;Oh well as you said, there are plenty of co-op games out there. &nbsp;In fact there are actually at least 136 co-op games
 for the 360. I have played almost all of them.&nbsp;If you like co-op make sure you check out Borderlands 2.&nbsp; Easily one of the best games so far in 2012.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>It's not lame, but that particular aspect is disappointing indeed. &nbsp;Doom 1 and 2 still have co-op, and 5 games for $40 with some of them having a new look and new features makes it well worth it. &nbsp;It's not my intention to be rude, but next time you may want
 to do some research and verify what game modes something does or doesn't have. &nbsp;I found out well before the release they wouldn't be including co-op for Doom 3 (taking it away), but still knew the purchase would be a good one for me. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, they've stated in the interviews that Doom 3 BFG wouldn't have coop. I don't think it really matters anyway. In my opinion Doom is a solo experience. Having two people speed around in tight, narrow corridors ruins the experience.

<p>Ug. &nbsp;I am so tired of people complaining about the lack of co-op. &nbsp;Doom 3 was originally on PC and is fantastic. &nbsp;This is one of my top buys for the year because it's one of my favorite games. &nbsp;The Xbox version was a horrible watered down version of Doom
 3 and the co-op campaign was even shorter. &nbsp;I understand if you enjoyed the co-op but if you missed this game on PC and only played it on Xbox then you are missing out by not playing it.</p>

<p>However, I uninstalled unknown programs that may have caused the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried signing in as another user, I still see KUIKDELIVERY Domain. What I did is just disconnect from the domain. And after I signed out and signed in, the said domain was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the Disconnect option, go to SYSTEM&gt;ABOUT.</p>
<p>The disconnect option (link) must be below the Organization information.</p>
<p>

Firefox ? No, really, browsers are largely subjective. A lot of people swear by Chrome, but<br />
a lot of people swear <span style="font-style: italic">at</span> Chrome. The same with IE and Firefox, but I've used Firefox for<br />
about nine years.<br />
<br />
Other considerations are your internet connection stability and speed.<br />
Try running <span style="font-style: italic">Speed Test</span> ( type that name into your search engine ) to verify if you are getting<br />
good speeds. Do this after the browser drops out as the internet server you are connected to<br />
may slow down during peak periods.<br />
For example, my broadband speed will reach 20+ but will drop to just under 5 between<br />
6-8 PM on occasion. This is still a high speed and not likely to drop out,&nbsp; just an example of
<br />
how much a connection can vary.<br />
You would have to get down near dial-up speeds (or should we say slows) before having<br />
drop outs due to lack of speed, in most cases. <br />
The other possibility is quality of the line from the exchange to your house. <br />
Old copper cables can also cause dropouts<br />
<br />
From what I've read Facebook has frequent problems, probably for similar reasons, but in this<br />
case it would be their own servers straining under the load of heavy traffic.<br />
<br />
Also be sure to have Adobe Flash and Shockwave&nbsp; and other browser 'plug-ins' up to date. -<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry - I am very disappointed from Windows 8. In Windows 7 i can stream media to my LG Blue Ray Home Cinema System. Using Windows Media Player. In Windows 8 i cant. All my android Devices can. And i can stream from Windows 8 to my Android Renderer.... .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all Metro Apps wont see it as a device for playing Video, Photos or Music. So a Win8 Tablet is useless for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This fact, that Windows 8 will not see my LG Media Renderer, keeps me away from buying a Windows 8 Tablet yet. It must be possible to stream to ALL DLNA Devices. My android Tab can handle this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope MS will investigate in this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Andre</p>

<p>Ok, I am trying to do this one small simple step at a time.&nbsp; I am trying to do the following steps from the instructions above:</p>
<p>
Add a contact from an email
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On Start, tap or click <span>Mail</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click a message and then tap or click the name of the person who sent it or any of the recipients.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Add contact</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Add any additional info (if possible) and then tap or click the save button

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can tap a person name on an incoming Email.&nbsp; Unfortunately the little box that comes up Does Not have a Place to "Add Contact" to People</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue how to make this work?</p>

<div>
<p>To import/export vCard, please follow these steps: <br />
1. Open your Windows Live Mail. <br />
2. Sign in to your email account. <br />

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied my Contacts folder from my old Windows Vista PC to my new Windows 10 PC. The contacts were in the "contacts" folder in mail on the old PC and they are now in a folder labelled "contacts" on my new PC. Each of my contacts is saved as a file
 of the ".contacts" type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(My old Vista PC actually stopped working. I had to copy the contacts folder&nbsp;over from an external back-up; I can no longer directly access the contents of my old Vista PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new mail programme in Windows 10 uses "People" to access contacts, but I cannot make People find, see, use, copy or import my Contacts folder or its contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new computer is:</p>
<p>Acre Aspire T3-710</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 6400 CPU</p>

            <p>Hello Santosh Rai of Microsoft,</p>
<p>I posted a detailed description of the issue as you requested on 13th March 2016. It is now 5th April and I am still waiting for your response.</p>

            <p>It seems that the problem described is very common and very clear i.e. a person has a file containing contact information from another computer (csv or other common contact format etc..) which they wish to import into a Windows 10 PC for use in the email
 app they are using there e.g. Live Mail, Mail, Outlook etc..&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I have managed to glean, it seems that Win10 uses the&nbsp;"People" app to hold contact info , so the issue is how to import contact info into People from a contact file loaded onto the same
 PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it so hard to understand this problem and answer it, especially as every product mentioned is Microsoft ?&nbsp; Furthermore, why has Microsoft made this common requirement so obscure in the first place ?&nbsp; PS: I have exactly the same query currently, as
 do 14 others who registered it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 not genuine after 5 years&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I've been using&nbsp;my MESH computer with Windows 7 Installed for around 5 years now (likely closer to 6) but recently the screen becomes black and in the right corner of the screen it says this copy of windows is not genuine windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked online and can't find out how to fix it apart from a temp fix on youtube</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer did not come with an instillation disk as was installed by the manufacturer. The computer does have the Windows sticker with product key which I have attempted to enter but keep getting error messages. I've run the Genuine diagnostics tool (which
 seems to show the same product key as sticker)</p>

                    When I do a driver scan, it shows that I have 1 outdated driver still on system.&nbsp; How do I remove this?&nbsp; Once it is removed will that allow me to watch videos on YouTube and other web sites without them stopping and starting again.&nbsp; The driver is under
 the heading of&nbsp; 'Intel (R) High Definition Audio HDMI, sound,video and game controller'.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Those driver updating programs always seem to fail and cause strange issues.</p>
<p>Check with your System maker (motherboard maker for custom built systems) - then check with<br />
Intel downloads.<br />
<br />
For Sound drivers :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<br />
Intel - Downloads<br />
<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx</a><br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click<br />
Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure<br />
on Lower Left of that box.<br />
</strong><br />
In Control Panel you can also look for an Audio Manager along with the Sound Settings.<br />

<br />
For BIOS and general driver updates :</p>
<p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />

<p>How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

                    <p>Windows 10 installation error- Original Title</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to install Windows 10 for months now and keep getting the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is running Windows 8.1 and it is fully updated. &nbsp;It is an HP laptop with a Core i7 processor. it is a little over a year old, and has plenty of free hard disk space, &nbsp;a touch screen and 16 gb of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation completes the copying files and the installing features &amp; drivers sections, both at 100%. &nbsp;Then with the total installation showing 75% which is just after finishing the features &amp; drivers part, the computer re-boots and immediately displays
 a message that says "Preparing Automatic Repair" &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that happens the computer displays a screen with an option to restart or go to advanced options. &nbsp;I have gone to the Advance options screen and am offered 5 choices: Continue, exit and continue windows rollback; use a device; use another operating system;
 troubleshoot; or turn off your pc. &nbsp;I have only gone to the first choice and it rolls back to my Windows 8.1 system. &nbsp;I have tried this with the download windows 10, using the internet, and I have also downloaded and ISO file and burned it to a DVD, then tried
 upgrading with the DVD, with no internet connection, and I always get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code displayed is as follows:</p>
<p>0xC1900101-0x40017 and it says "The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during BOOT operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also disabled my anti virus program, I did a registry scan and clean-up, and I have uninstalled programs which were very old and incompatible with Windows 10 and still the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the free upgrade expires this Friday and I need so help to get this upgrade completed while its still free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

These errors mean that the Windows 10 installation failed after the second system restart. They’re likely caused by faulty drivers or software. Here are the known drivers and software that cause these errors:</p>
<p>SteelSeries - Mouse and keyboard manufacture. The SteelSeries Engine is not currently supported in Windows 8.1. This causes issues when you try to upgrade to Windows 10. For more information, see the SteelSeries FAQ.</p>
<p>NVIDIA - Video card manufacture. Make sure that you have installed the latest video driver.</p>
<p>ESET - Antivirus and security-related products. See the ESET knowledge base to learn how to safely upgrade to Windows 10 with ESET products installed.</p>
<p>Trusteer Rapport - Credit card fraud protection software. Trusteer recommends that you install the available Windows 8.1 updates before you upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>McAfee - Antivirus and security-related products. McAfee AntiVirus 8.8 Patch 3 is confirmed to be incompatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>The following solutions can be used:</p>

This parameter lets the Windows 10 setup program check for available driver updates during the setup process. See

<h2>            Green screen of death, fix did NOT work</h2>
                    
<p><span>Good morning Internet friends,</span></p>
<p><span>So I recently tried to watch Netflix but kept getting the green screen the straight to the black screen treatment. I tried a few times, same result. I tried the hard shutdown where you hold down the power button for 10 seconds.
 Same result. I tried unplugging for a whole 24 hours and going through the motions again. Same result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I did the internet searches and came across the USB method of installing the update offline. Followed these steps 4 maybe 5 times but to no avail. Oddly enough the update would stall at 66 then go back to the black screen of nothing.</p>

<p>So now the dreaded wipe everything out to factory defaults. At this point I'm ok with it because I just so happen to be out of the warranty period. Now I'm starting to think the folks at Microsoft are criminals. So I select the wipe everything out to factory
 defaults option, nothing happens, straight to black screen of nothing.</p>

<p>Had 2 x360s with red rings of death. Now this supposed next gen console has *** the bed. After almost 10 years with xbox and live dating back to halo 2, I'm done. Unless you guys over there make this right, and I'll give you the chance to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>$135 to repair something YOU broke, get serious. My xbox one was working just fine a week ago. my live account renews sometime in September, you can count on it that I will be cancelling that unless the console is fixed at no charge. Not so much as shipping.
 You want me to keep paying the live, buying another madden or call of duty, well ball is in your court. Otherwise I'll take that $135 and go buy an N64, mine last almost 20 years before breaking.</p>

<p>Anyone who has other possible solutions, I welcome your insight. Anyone that knows of a better way to deal with this, also welcomed.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening, have a good one!</p>

<p>Regarding your problem a thought occured have you tried holding the joystick find button and eject at the same time then holding the power button untill you hear two bleeps this should take you to a recovery screen. The joystick find button is on the left
 side of consul just right of the usb port. What ya got to lose.</p>

<p>Hey stubedoo,</p>
<p>Yes I tried this, it brought me to a screen with 4 options. Start console, restore to factory settings, update offline with usb (this option was not selectable of course) and shut down console.
</p>
<p>When I clicked restore to factory defaults it just went back to the black screen after saying preparing console.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam HD-5000 Webcam - windows call button only works with windows live messenger version 8.14 or later.....</h2>
                    I have installed my Lifecam and am able to view video/audio on it.&nbsp; However, when I want to launch a video call, I press the call button and receive the following message....."windows call button only works with windows live messenger 8.1 or later....do
 you want to install now?"&nbsp; I have clicked yes/install several times and the program doesn't seem to install.&nbsp; I have windows 7 with McAfee antivirus/firewall, which I've disabled, but with no results.&nbsp; I am able to chat via messenger, but video call is not
 an option. I google'd windows live messenger version 8.1 and tried to download it, but it said I already had a newer version installed.&nbsp; I'm getting frustrated with the plug and play that won't work for me.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which application are you using with Microsoft Life Cam?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did it work fine before?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, did anything change on your system right before this problem occurred - any new hardware devices installed?&nbsp; Any new software or updates installed?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you try the Life Cam on different USB ports and check?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you check if the device is working properly by testing it on other computer?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response!&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither of these solutions solved my problem.&nbsp; This is a new LifeCam on a 3 month old computer.&nbsp; Video calls haven't worked since I've installed it straight from the box.&nbsp; Everything works, except I'm unable to do
 video calls....whether I press the call button on the camera (with Lifecam closed) or sign into windows live messenger.&nbsp; The video call icon never appears and the button on the camera results in the 8.1 message error noted above.&nbsp; When I've downloaded Messenger,
 the pop up box stating installing windows live essentials 2011 appears, but then goes straight to done, however, never launches, or gives me a list of Windows live messenger in my programs.&nbsp; Windows Live is noted, but only shows Windows live mesh and family
 controls, as well as the lifecam.&nbsp; I uninstalled and re-installed, with antivirus and firewall disabled, but still no luck.</p>

            Just finished with a friend to resolve her problem.&nbsp; I can't say for certain yet that it will work with the latest version of Live Messenger, but we did get it working with 2009 version. After you open Windows Live Messenger and verify in "help/about messenger"
 that you have version 2009, disable the camera in device manager and reboot. Let windows enable the camera and see if it works for messenger then. It did for her and maybe it will for you too.<br />
Good luck! <br />

<h2>            NVIDIA mobile graphics card not seen after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After the upgrade from Win 8.1 to Win 10, my Nvidia graphics card is missing. Windows uses the generic Microsoft graphics driver. Installing the latest (and earlier) Nvidia graphics drivers, as well as the Nvidia Experience software only resulted in an installation
 failure message that says: "no recognizeable devices" or something similar. The graphics card&nbsp;is not visible in the Devise Manager either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My graphics&nbsp; card is a Geforce GT540M. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on getting the graphics card to work again?</p>

            <p>As per your suggestion, I ran the NVIDIA driver installation program for Windows 10 under Windows 8 compatibility mode. The result was exactly the same as executing the program normally:
</p>
<p>The NVIDIA driver installation program launches and runs flawlessly; no installation program compatibility issues with Windows 10. It does the following things in the process:</p>
<p>- It unpacks the driver files and copies them to a suitable folder on my C-drive</p>
<p>- Then it searches for compatible hardware</p>
<p>- Then it reports that no suitable hardware was found and my only option is to click "Finish" and the installation program unloads itself normally.
</p>
<p>Note that my laptop is an Acer Aspire 5750G with its original NVIDIA GT 540M factory installed graphics&nbsp;card. This graphics card was detected and worked flawlessly with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, the problem is that the factory installed NVIDIA GT 540M graphics card cannot be detected by the NVIDIA installation files, whether I&nbsp;execute them normally or under Windows 8 compatibility mode,&nbsp;with Windows 10 as operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make the factory installed Geforce GT 540M graphics card visible to the NVIDIA driver installation files with Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Am experiencing very similar problem with&nbsp;Geforce GT800M (Think that's what it is) on Lenovo C560. Tried to install updated drives (not in compatibility mode) which caused boot to hang. Had to go into BIOS video config to tell it to only the the on board
 intel video chip set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this is no great help, but please be warned updating drives in usual manner may bring further more serious problems.</p>

Can not say that happen for me ran windows 10 for 3 days my Geforce 800M was still not recognised on Lenovo C560 although native intel 4600 I did get to work after some hanging boot attempts. Currently back in windows 8.1, have updated my Geforce drive to latest
 version and considering reinstalling windows 10 but awaiting some response from @MicrosoftHelps before progressing. Also concerned that I'll once again get internet connection issues if I update my realtec drives.

            Me too. I am using a desktop pc with a Zotac GX card. After the update I have no graphics card and nothing showing at all in the Device Manager for a display adapter. The only anomaly that I can see is that I have an alert showing on the PCI Express Root
 Port. It tells me that there are no resources available. I am non-plussed! I find it hard to believe that my card failed at exactly the same time as I upgraded. Any suggestions?

<p>Bumping a dead thread to provide info is understandable if the OP didn't receive an answer, as you've done several times, but why one where the correct response has already been given?</p>

<p>@voteDC @THEOWENKILLER - But that's not my main point of posting so many on the forums. I Just want to help people out , you know. And i know it is annoying to see my GT everywhere so sorry if i annoyed/irritated you guys. But voteDC , you're right. I'll
 just stop posting on old threads and just look at the new ones.</p>

<p>I saw you post on a thread about a week ago where someone asked how you level up on the forums,and your response when you found out how was basically to do as much posting as you can to get your level up.</p>
<p>judging by some of the threads you have dug up over the last week,thats exactly what you are doing.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Notice all of the CAUSE were Windows components which means something else drove<br />
them into Fault.&nbsp;See below about heat, processor, heat sink, and the compound between<br />
them. Be sure to ask the SSD Maker's Support for any known issues as it might need a
<br />
firmware update. <br />
<br />
Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues.<br />

=======================================================<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service)&nbsp;or the System Maker's
<br />
Support.<br />

<br />
</strong>This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is
<br />
"possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory
<br />
and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure
<br />
the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully
<br />
inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>
fatal hardware <br />
error</strong>&nbsp;implication. You may need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy
<br />
or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Check the processor seatting, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and<br />
the heat sink which are common causes.<br />
<br />
There have been a few instances&nbsp;where Norton/Symantec and other antivirus/security

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower
<br />
memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory
<br />
tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Thanks - pretty much what I expected but I was just clinging to a slender hope that there might be something in the DMP files that pinpointed the error more accurately.&nbsp; The system shuts down suddenly with no warning straight to blue screen.&nbsp; I forgot to
 say that I have run system and hard drive temperature checks at different times and they all seem normal - I don't have any overclocking</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check for m/board and ssd updates but will have to reinstall the AI suite that comes with Mboard - I removed it because one post somewhere said that AI suite could cause a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acrive @Hard Disk monitor reports all four drives are OK with temperatures
 between 30 - 40 and fairly constant</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like stripping down component by component and re-seating everything item by item - you would think that by now windows diagnostics would be more accurate!</p>

            Hi  N8.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A Scanner requires the full software package to be installed.   
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Problems activating Windows XP after a repair install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> midas02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems activating Windows XP after a repair install</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows XP on one of my machines ran into trouble due to hard drive corruption. I ended up having to do a repair of Windows using a Win XP installation CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I ran into however, is that it won't accept my original license key anymore (the one printed on the Microsoft sticker on the back of my computer). It was fine before, and have been using that license for years. The only difference I'm aware of
 is that I reinstalled from an XP SP3 CD, where the original version was a DELL issued XP SP2, which of course was later manually&nbsp;upgraded to SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is I do have a valid license, but XP is just not accepting it. Registering over the phone doesn't help either, as I get a voice computer on the line, and after typing in the long installation ID, it is telling me that my copy isn't genuine. So
 is their any way I can get in touch with a human helpdesk agent who can help me to 'transfer' (or whatever intervention is required) my license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Midas</p>

            Hi Ben.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First choose the Device in Device manager, click on Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Automatically.  This only searches Windows Update however which should have already scanned for it unless you have drivers update disabled.  
<br />
<br />Next Update the driver from the Device or PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

    <title>No Video Output at all after Frozen Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryankujawski  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Video Output at all after Frozen Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea if I'm posting my question in the right place, so my apologies if I'm not. Very frustrated right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turned on my desktop today (it's an HP Pavilion Magnesium p6774y running Windows 10), and it had to first finish a Windows update. The update got up to 100% pretty quickly before randomly freezing up. I gave it a while to see if it would start working again,
 but the spinning dots had completely frozen up, and it was clear to me it wasn't going to unfreeze. The only option I had was to force restart the computer with the power button, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon restarting the computer, I had no monitor and no lights on my keyboard. I let it sit for several minutes, and still nothing. I restarted it several times, unplugged and plugged it back in several times, one of those times removing and replacing in the
 CMOS battery, and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an added-on graphics card on this machine because the on-board graphics failed a few months ago, so I tried switching the VGA cable to the on-board output just for the heck of it. Absolutely nothing. Still no display and no lights on my keyboard.
 Note that the computer and monitor were working perfect before this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I really needed to use this computer today.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ryan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Ryan, try reseating the video card, look in the slot with a bright light to blow out any debris clean the contact on the card with a soft brush or pencil eraser, reseat it firmly and make sure any other connections are tight.  
<br />
<br />Try another monitor to compare.

<p>I will give that a try in a few, thanks Greg. Unfortunately, I don't have another monitor to compare, but I might be able to pickup a used one tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just not quite sure, because I felt some heat around the graphics card. Turns out my motherboard's heatsink was burning hot to the touch. I let it cool down and turned the computer back on. It froze on the Windows loading screen this time, and within
 a minute of the machine being on, it was burning hot again. I don't think that's normal.&nbsp;</p>

            Yeah, you may need a case fan or a GPU with one like this:
<br /><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/evga-nvidia-geforce-gt-710-2gb-ddr3-pci-express-2-0-graphics-card-black/5597203.p?skuId=5597203&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ds_rl=1260666&amp;ds_rl=1266837&amp;ds_rl=1266837&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8qjnBRA-EiwAaNvhwCefGxITJ23Wg3J2bIHam_C4QSLVF5ROyUPdTl9Wkjc9Uxgu9i3-lRoCRLgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bestbuy.com/site/evga-nvidia-geforc...</a>
<br />
<br />If WIndows will start then monitor temps with CoreTemp and set it to sleep at CoreMax temp:  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/core-temp-monitor-cpu-temperature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/core-temp-monito...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean all dust out and consider if CPU temps might mean you need to repaste the heat sink.

<p>Thanks for that information!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not, I'm actually running a GT 710, now, in this machine, however this one doesn't have a fan, just a heatsink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did download the program, but I didn't have much time to look around in it before it crashed. At idle with just CoreTemp running, I was between 50 and 56 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put an external fan on the desk and aimed it at the motherboard. I ran it on low and tried to play a YouTube video at 1080p. It played just fine, until I turned off the fan. Within 30 seconds, the computer crashed with the blue screen of death and a wonderful
 buzzing sound from the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't understand why it just now started doing this, immediately following the Windows update. I was having this issue before I installed the GT 710, but I've been running fine with it for the past 3 months. I thought the problem was all in the on-board
 graphics, and the new card fixed it for sure, but I guess not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see if I can pick up an air duster tomorrow, but if it's going to be a matter of re-pasting the heatsink, that's something I'm not skilled in, and I'm not sure if it's going to be worth it to take it to a shop to get that done for a 7-year-old computer.
 Might be time to part with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            If you're going to junk it anyway, then you could repaste the heat sink as a project.  It's not as hard in a desktop as a laptop which requires disassembling a table full or parts first.  If it works, fine you have another few years use, if not you were going to junk it anyway.  There are videos on Youtube to follow.

                    I just discovered that you can cast music &nbsp;to&nbsp;a device such as a home theater receiver from my music library. Can I cast to multiple home theater systems at the same time&nbsp;?

<p>Yes you can! On Windows 10! Right click on your media and cast to as many devices as you want. :)
