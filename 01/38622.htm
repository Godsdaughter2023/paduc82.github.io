<h2>            Why don&#39;t I have a username for Skype through Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    I setup my Skype account but there is no option showing my username.&nbsp; I'm wondering why I don't have any option to display it.&nbsp; I go into account settings and nothing shows up.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the full migration of Skype to Microsoft, the option to create your account with a preferred Skype Name has been removed. The new account creation process will only require an email address or a phone number to proceed. This has been done to make account
 creation easier for new users of our service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign up with Skype using your Microsoft email address or a phone number, you will be given a unique Skype handle which you can give to your potential contacts for them to search you on Skype. The steps on how you can find this Skype handle is listed
 below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><a href="https://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://secure.skype.com/ Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Sign in to the Skype website</span></a>.</span></li><li><span>Scroll down and click
<strong><span>Purchase history</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>The Skype Name of your account will be shown at the upper right side of the Purchase history page, before the Sign out button.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Question Regarding auto sign in for accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goldendomer283  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question Regarding auto sign in for accounts</h2>
                    
<p>I have three gamertags on my Xbox and I'm wanting to set it to where one of them doesn't auto sign in every time I start the system. The tag that is auto signing in is first on the list but I'm wanting to change it to where another tag will come up instead.
 How can that be done?</p>

<p>Turn auto-sign in off for the account you don't want to sign in, and turn it on for the one you do want. You can find instructions for how to do that here -

I had to do a system restore (fortunately I had one from a few days ago) in order to be able to ask this question. I'd try reinstalling the updates but I'd rather not until I know how to fix\avoid the black screen.<br />

Many of the users reported seeing only a black screen or black screen with a moving cursor when logging into their Windows 8 or Window 8.1 device. The root cause appears to be a known issue with versions 2.16.31.75, 2.17.1.22 and 2.17.0.324 of
<em><span>Search Protect </span></em>I would suggest you to try the steps suggested by
<strong>Scott Atk </strong>from the following link:<br />

I'm going to try installing the updates again. I'll let you know if I hit the same problem again.&nbsp;<br />

            Update: I've reinstalled the updates (the same as in the image linked above) and I'm once again met with the black lock screen. Restored the system for a second time and now I'm back to normal.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
From what I can see it's one of those updates which is causing the problems. As soon as it restarts (after configuring the updates) it boots up but the lock screen is black and I can't do anything but move the mouse around,<br />
<br />
Edit: I know in the image the optional update is deselected but I installed that at the same time. After reading a few posts on here I'm going to try installing the updates minus the optional update (KB2984006) as this 'corrected' the issue for another user
 (see bj-ns' post in&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update/windows-81-wont-boot-to-desktop-after-this-weeks/427d8bcf-6b8f-40d3-9522-16f7aeff1bfa">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update/windows-81-wont-boot-to-desktop-after-this-weeks/427d8bcf-6b8f-40d3-9522-16f7aeff1bfa</a>)

            Update 2: That didn't work either. I'm going to try installing each update individually and manually creating a restore point for each one. Hopefully that way I can identify the faulty update.&nbsp;

            Right.<br />
<br />
It seems to be KB2975719 (Important - Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems) and KB2984006 (Optional - Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems) that&nbsp;cause the black lock screen (whether installed separately or together).<br />
<br />
Are there issues with these updates?&nbsp; <br />

<p>Others claim that Ctrl-Alt-Delete allows them to get into Task Manager.&nbsp; However, one actually mentioned typing the password at the blank screen and then doing the Ctrl-Alt-Delete.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yikes.) Previously I would usually suggest using Win-P, CursorUp, Enter,
 as the common hypothesis would be a phantom monitor inexplicably making the real monitor the second of an extended pair.&nbsp; In that scenario hooking up a second monitor often clarified things.&nbsp; After that the symptom description is very vague.&nbsp; E.g. I don't
 know whether Task Manager is showing an explorer.exe--in which case it could be restarted by right-click Restart--or not--in which case it could be started via TM's New... command.&nbsp; In any case, if they get that far there is lots more which can be accomplished.&nbsp;
 Dust off your NT3 manuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;eg&gt;</p>

            I've tried getting into task manager but nothing happened. I tried typing my password, again nothing happened. I also tried restarting with a second monitor (TV via HDMI) and it also showed a black screen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The only thing I can do is move the mouse around. If I stop moving it it resets back to the middle of the screen. The network icon in the lower left of the screen periodically appears for 1/2 a second before disappearing again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other than doing a system restore there is nothing I can do. It even shows a black screen when in safe mode.&nbsp;

<p>What about a Command-only boot?&nbsp; Doing that could at least let you in to get some clues about what is happening via the Event log.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW is this machine's drive accessible by any other computer or partition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you can get that far you could&nbsp;presumably try other boot options such as Low res video.&nbsp; I think that that might mean using a different video driver than normal.</p>

            I too am having exactly the same problem. Even down to the intermittent flashing of the network icon. I too am running Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit with what I believe to be all the latest updates. I just ran the updates and now I have the black screen.

                    <p>This message pops up every time I try to rename a folder, or cut and paste a folder from one location to another. It happens for all folders, except the special user folders like Desktop, Documents, etc. and existing folders in the Videos and Pictures folder
 (not new ones - I cannot rename a new folder made in these folders). I can delete folders, and I can copy them, but I can't restore them (the same error pops up) and I can rename, copy, delete and move all files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything suggested in the Internet - I have run the Windows File and Folder Troubleshooter, chkdsk /f, and sfc /scannow, and nothing worked. The only way I can rename a folder is using "ren" command in cmd.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also worth noting is that I have not tampered with any files or settings - it's only been close to six months since my clean install of Windows 10.</p>

</div>
<div>I have 26 pending "important" windows updates and for some reason, each time i try to install them i get the above error. I've tried stopping the windows update service, renaming the SoftwareDistribution folder and then re-downloading the updates but that
 did not work. I've tried installing the updates individually and that did not work either. I'm at a loss as to what else to try.</div>

<h2>            Snipping Tool is saving images as &#34;HIDDEN&#34;</h2>
                    This is the second time I have the same problem with the Snipping Tool. &nbsp;The first time I used the solution provided by "hippieangst" at one of the forums here (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/cant-find-picture-saved-with-the-snipping-tool/42b94b64-9def-4670-bb95-af36bba52ff4)
 but now I have the same problem and this solutions is not good any more. &nbsp;I can save the images but I cannot find them later (I'm saving them correctly). &nbsp;The search will find the images and open them, if I click propierties, it displays that they are "HIDDEN",
 I'm able to uncheck the option and they'll show up where I saved them originally but there has to be a way to fix it instead of doing this for every image. &nbsp;ANY HELP??? THANKS!

            I fixed it.
<div>Just in case someone has the same problem. &nbsp;I followed the previous advice and chance another of the files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here's the solution:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>
<p>
To prevent any more 'disappearances', change this registry key:</p>
<p>
In McAfee, First disable access protection in navigation /general settings</p>
<p>
1) Open McAfee</p>
<p>
2) Click on Navigation</p>
<p>
3) Click on General Settings and Alerts</p>
<p>
4) Click on Access Protection</p>
<p>
5) Un-Check Use Access Protection</p>
<p>
6) Click on Apply</p>
<p>
Edit the registry:<br />
</p>
<p>
1) Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) and browse to this 'folder'</p>
<p>
1b) type regedit.exe in Windows search (windows start button)</p>
<p>
1c) click yes if asked for permission.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\McAfee\SystemCore\VSCore\On Access Scanner\McShield\Configuration\Default]</strong><br />
2) Locate the entry&nbsp;<strong>ExcludedItem_28&nbsp;</strong>in the list&nbsp;<br />
3) double-click on ExcludedItem_28 and<br />
4) change the value&nbsp;<strong>3|3|*.<em>TMP</em>&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>3|3|*.<em>LOG</em></strong><br />
5) Close the Registry Editor, save your work and reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
Reenable access protection by following the McAfee steps above.</p>

    <title>How to make a damage claim to Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claimant_986  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make a damage claim to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>So my HP was working very well not 2 days ago. &nbsp;I turned it off one night before bed, only to turn it on the next day, and find that it was downloading several new Windows 10 updates. A black screen that I had never seen before told me that Windows was updating
 and "will restart several times." It seemed that the updates were to occur in three stages: copying files, installing drivers and updates, and configuring updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update failed, and now I'm greeted by two blue screens (CRITICAL PROCESS DIED, and WDF VIOLATION) which Microsoft tech support cannot resolve. Long story short, my computer has been rendered unusable by this update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on with Microsoft tech support all day long. I was handled by two separate technicians, neither of whom gave me case numbers. They were both supposed to call me back and they never did. So if I call again, I have to explain the problem again,
 and I have no guarantees at all that they will understand, since I'm trying to verbally explain what I'm seeing on my screen to technicians who are non-native speakers of English. It's a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft must have a claims policy when their products cause damage and a particular consumer is prepared to make a demonstrable case against their products. My question is, how can I contact Microsoft in order to make a claim for compensation. I have
 lost data, from which I drive an income, which I cannot replace. I want Microsoft to provide me some form of compensation for my loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even a million would be "few," relatively speaking, when there is something in the neighborhood of 500 million Windows 10 installations worldwide.&nbsp; One million = 0.2%.<br />

<p>Hello Jespervan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with your games. Are these disc games or digital? Try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> your console. Once on try one game that is backward compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hey there Jesper!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorrry to hear that you'r experiencing issues with your backwards compatible games.
<br />
If the previous troubleshooting has not solved the problem, then I would suggest next clearing your local saved games and then removing and re-adding your account as outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-profile-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to add or remove a Microsoft account on Xbox One</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work however, then the next troubleshooting step that I would suggest is what we call a soft reset.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(<strong>as</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>they
 will be removed</strong>) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Also
 make sure that you select the option denoted </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>reset

            Unfortunately, none of these steps helped. &nbsp;Windows Defender starts just fine. &nbsp;It is just the Health Report that is not available. &nbsp;Interestingly, when I first upgraded to Creators Update, the Health Report was unavailable. &nbsp;The next day, it appeared
 and I thought all was well. &nbsp;However, it has returned to the status of "not available."

            Interestingly, the Health Report is now available again. &nbsp;It seems it appears, disappears and then reappears. &nbsp;Perhaps it is only available for a certain time period following the health scan undertaken by the computer. &nbsp;This is purely speculative as it
 is based solely on my own personal experience since upgrading to the Creators Update.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">with no errors. I can also generate health reports manually using "perfmon /report".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

</p><p>Let's try a different approach. We suggest that you generate a system performance report manually and see if it helps. Press
<strong>Window key + R </strong>and type <em><strong>perfmon /report. </strong></em>After the task has been completed, restart your device and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.<br />

                    My Task Scheduler starting saying it "doesn't exist".&nbsp; I believe that some of it's operating files may have been deleted by error (hopefully anyway, regardless the culprit is being dealt with).&nbsp; What is the best and most effective way to restore the "deletted"
 OS fiels for Task Scheduler?&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I try to use a systemn restore point I know is old enough and then redownload the upgrades that were downloaded in the interim?

<h2>            Found malicious software. How do I remove it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I found a virus on my computer yesterday, did multiple scans but Mcafee and windows defender found nothing. I then did the malicious software removal tool, which noted that it found an infected file but about 3/4 of the way through it froze for about 10
 min then skipped to the final screen stating no threats found. I then ran microsoft security scanner which found and removed a brolo virus that was keeping me from being able to use the internet, but my computer is still infected with something. Its super
 slow (brand new computer), my screen icons keep randomly blinking, and the screen goes black for a second and back on again multiple times (like a long flicker). This is even after I resorted to a factory reset and rescanned with the Malicious Software tool
 but had the same problem. Now it wont even let me download or run microsoft security scanner which found the virus the first time. How do I get rid of this thing? I can't just junk a new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reset the computer I removed all files and cleaned out the drive and re-installed windows. Weird thing<br />
Is though, it deleted and completety reset the computer ( I went through the whole set up process again) but my backgrounds were kept and they keep changing without my assistance to previous backgrounds I had...? How after I wiped all files out? (Part of the
 virus??)</p>

<p>You may be beyond any 'fixing' and a complete reset and/or even a 'boot from external media and clean install' may be your best bet. &nbsp;The worst malware infestations often have so many friends that come along for the ride, cleaning is often a hopeless endeavor.</p>

            Hi, Sir.Debiluk 
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            Hi Sir.Debiluk
<br />
<br />Press and hold the power button on your PC for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down . .. 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Reset, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />From there you can initiate a Windows Reset . . .

            So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />Downloading the ISO already comes with the Windows 1809 updates

<br />
<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

<h2>            can&#39;t log onto internet with Windows 98</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 98 on a Compaq Presario 5240 machine. This machine has previously been connected to the internet using the same provider Charter internet. I'm using a wired connection from the modem to the router and then to the computer. I have used
 another computer on that same wire and it works fine. I also have other computers at the house which are running on the internet without problems. This computer has been sitting idle for quite a few years. It seems to run fine. I contacted Charter first to
 see if there was a set up issue and they ran me through a number of checks but couldn't find anything that seemed like it needed to be changed. We rebooted the computer. There was one small change. Prior to calling them when I tried to get on the internet
 using Internet Explorer the site the computer looked for was my homepage www.msnbc.com. After the computer went looking for www.microsoft.com. In both cases I just get "The Page Can Not Be Displayed" The Charter representative gave me a recommendation to call
 Microsoft. I called and a nice representative listened to my situation and told me there is no longer phone support for Windows 98. She recommended I contact the engineers through answers.microsoft.com so here I am. I look forward to your suggestions. I need
 to find a way to get my digital photos off this computer. It also doesn't recognize thumbdrives looking for a driver. Or external USB connected hard drives. The 3.5 in floppy is working but not the cd.<br />

            Guess that is a good reason to ditch Microsoft and go with Mac. You should tell your phone support not to send people to this website for answers. She said Windows 98 no longer had phone support but that there was email support. I'll never buy a machine
 running with microsoft again however I do still need to get pictures of my kids off this old machine.

            Have you verified that you are getting the proper address/gateway and dns addresses from the router? If not, it could be that the PC is setup with a static address.<br />

            Hi Ilias, that can be done using roughly the same process as answered on your other thread. You need to find the processes or apps using your CPU and if they are not required, then disable them . . .
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) 
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system 
<br />
<br />Click on the CPU column header, so that arrow faces down 
<br />
<br />When your CPU is at a high percentage
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes at that time?

    <title>Xbox LIVE account hacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox LIVE account hacked</h2>
                    About a week or two ago, my Xbox LIVE account was hacked. I never gave out any information to anyone, and I was not phished. I'm not sure if the stolen account was hacked through EA, or Bungie, but I had an account on both websites. When I took a look
 at my Bungie profile on my hacked account, I saw that my recent activity was last seen on the day I was hacked. Is that a sign that it could've been hacked through that website? Anyways, I'd appreciate any form of help. There was $250 charged to my PayPal
 account for various games and a 6000 Microsoft Points bundle. I was able to contact PayPal and they're trying to resolve the issue. I've heard rumors that Microsoft's Investigation Team normally doesn't get most accounts back. Can somebody explain exactly
 what's going to happen please?

<p>It isn't EA or Bungie who hacked your account. It's the fact that you give phishing websites OR other people your E-mail and password. It may also have been hacked if you use the same password for all websites you visit. You may have also given a "friend"

<p>Ignore Mertacus, he doesn't know what he is on about. There is an epidemic of hacking going around at the moment which has nothing to do with phishing or &nbsp;passing details around. I'm guessing you have illicit activity on your account relating to Fifa 12.
 The only thing you can do is to contact Xbox phone support and they will lock down your account for around a month (if you are lucky) while they investigate.

<p>Oddly enough, an old friend contacted me telling me that my account name was changed to Archenemy l666l. If it helps, the account was hacked supposedly from Mexico, and they bought Saints Row 2, Deathsmiles 2, Resident Evil 4, Marvel vs Capcom 3, and 6000
 Microsoft Points. I already contacted MS and the bank, I'm just worried I'll never get my account back. I never played any FIFA games.</p>

 with the good news, now I just need to further protect my profile.</p>

            I have been in touch with Microsoft agents about this. They tried various things, and eventually we found that by rolling back the previous version of Windows 10 the problem disappeared. They say they are working on a fix for this, and that the next version
 of Windows 10 should not cause the same problem. It's strange that they did not see this problem before, though, as Mail is a Microsoft program designed to work with Windows....

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to encrypt my C: drive with Bitlocker. I also want to save a complete system image on an external USB drive. Which shall be encrypted with Bitlocker as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question:</p>
<p>Is is possible to restore a complete system image from a Bitlocker encrypted external USB drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumed experience:</p>
<p>My internal drive brakes and I replace it with a brand new drive. I connect the encrypted external USB drive (with the system image on it) at my laptop. I boot from a Win10 USB-Stick and go to the recovery/restore options. There I'm able to select the external
 USB drive and have to enter my PIN/password to decrypt the drive. Than the restore process starts. After a reboot I'm back at my old environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that the case that will happen?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern, Let me assist you with this.</p>
<p><em>"Is is possible to restore a complete system image from a Bitlocker encrypted external USB drive?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process&nbsp;of your assumed experience is right. Actually the process runs as your&nbsp;expecting but there might be some issues with activation.</p>
<p>Since you are referring to the new hard drive, Windows 10 is registered to the device, not your hard drive. Just install&nbsp;it on&nbsp;new hard disk from the system image and it will reactivate automatically. If not, let us know the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, y<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>our reply is very important to ensure a proper resolution. Please get back to us with the above information to assist you accordingly.</span></span><span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Scan documents to pdf without an active internet connection</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the Surface Pro 6 in School for a while now, but there is one thing that crashes my workflow pretty hard and since I am not able to find a suitable answer I will ask my particular question right here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When in class I would like to scan documents using Office Lens on my Surface Pro 6. The App works pretty good - as long as I have an active internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that is my problem. We don't have wireless LAN at our classroom yet, but even thought I really don't want to depend on an internet connection at all times.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to simply scan documents to PDF right away without an active internet connection and awkward workarounds through the gallery?<br />
Same goes for OneDrive. I would like to just save PDFs into it and then when I am back home sync it with the cloud.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Jan</p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />How is your scanner connected to your machine?<br /><br />Is it possible to connect the scanner direct to the machine? What make is this scanning device.<br /><br />Without a direct connection you will need your network so that the scanned file can be sent to a location

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>I don't use a physical scanner, instead I am using Office Lens, the software which enables me to scan documents through the camera of my Surface Pro 6.</p>

            Sorry bit of an oversight on my side there!<br /><br />A quick search returns nothing it seems Microsoft have designed this application with no offline mode. However people have said that they have been able to save as an image to your machine and then convert the image to pdf<br /><br />Can you try saving as an image does this allow you to do so offline?<br /><br />Let me know how you get on

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yeah I found these solutions some time ago and tried it today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to save the images to the gallery and then export them to PDF from there.<br />
<br />
But that way is somewhat painful because I have to flood my gallery with documents that I don't really need there and the extra step</p>
<p>through the gallery really takes up some time during class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like I will have to stick to that method for now :/</p>

<h2>            Red Dot of Death &#40;RDOD&#41;, XBOX 360 S</h2>
                    
<p>Sad to see that my XBOX 360 S has a RDOD yesterday.&nbsp; No signal from the console to the TV.&nbsp; Bought August 2011 and out of the one year warranty.&nbsp; I've tried all of the easy fixes (hard drive check, power cable check, video cable check, having the console
 rest of thirty minutes)...no luck.</p>
<p>I managed to get the secondary error code with the sync:tray button trick:&nbsp; Error code is 0033 which is "unknown."&nbsp; Reasonably sure this is hardware failure.&nbsp; It's a local repair shop now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really enjoyed the console while it lasted, but I don't think I'll cough up for the new XBOX One when it comes out unless there's a standard two or three year warranty.&nbsp; Anything that costs upwards of $400 should have that kind of warranty, IMO.&nbsp; This is
 a really fragile piece of hardware.</p>

<p>I have successfully repaired my 360 "e" for the RROD. From what I have read the slims are a more a problem in the motherboard itself. Sorry you experienced failure so early in its life :( &nbsp;I am very curious as to what the repair shop finds. Can you please
 update me once you have it repaired? </p>
<p>And to further clarify - repairing your console will not get your console banned. Modding your console which includes modifying the case, internals and then running that console on the service will get you banned. A repaired console will always function
 as it intended. Breaking the factory seal voids your warranty not Microsoft repairing it.</p>

<p>Hey there, official support here.<br />
<br />
We always, always recommend an official repair. &nbsp;While not all unauthorized service (or opening the console yourself) will necessarily result in enforcement action, it will
<em>absolutely</em>&nbsp;void the warranty, and may make the console unservicible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you'll have a good experience with that repair shop, but for future reference an official service is definitely what we suggest.&nbsp;</p>

We're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. What do you mean 'Is there a setting in WLM to prevent my own email address from being included in the "Reply all" addresses?"? Are you saying that your e-mail address appears in the body of the e-mail
 when you select "Reply all" in Windows Live Mail? Let us know.<br />

For us to better understand the problem, please refer to the private message I have sent you as we'll be exchanging information securely. Sign in to this forum and click the red link saying you have a private reply.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen the screenshot that you had provided in the Private Message tab. We would like to ask for additional information for isolation. Please provide the answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using the Default "From" address of your account when you click the Reply all button?</li><li>Did you make any changes on your account and/or on Windows Live Mail prior to the issue?</li><li>Can you verify if the issue only happens when replying to a specific sender?</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, please be informed that we might suggest that you remove then re-add your account in Live Mail as this may reset the settings on it. You can refer to this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will wait for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

            Hi RoseKatrina
<div><br />
<div>The account is registered with the address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but I thought I was sending from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, the alternative address I set up when 'Hotmail' changed to 'Outlook'.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have only one account set up in WLM and can no longer see the "From" field, but now that I look in the sent messages folder, I see that my messages are actually been sent from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, which makes perfect sense. I'd forgotten that it wasn't
 set up as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. (More on that below.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also see now that when I do a 'Reply all', my address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** gets included in the 'Reply all'. So I'm sending to my alternative address, not the address I'm sending from. However, when I look in the account properties, I can't see *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 entered anywhere. In fact, there's very little info at all in 'Account Properties' and I don't know how the program is picking up *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The server properties are:&nbsp;https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/sync.aspx</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have I set it up incorrectly? I removed the account and added it back some time ago, as I was having trouble with other accounts that I'd added to WLM (my ISP accounts). I now have those accounts added to the MS Outlook program instead. My Outlook (Hotmail)
 address is also registered in the MS Outlook program, but as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** rather than *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I remember correctly, when I tried to add *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to the WLM program, it rejected that address. I had to use *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but somehow it's recognising that I have another address - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - and is sending to that when I
 do a 'Reply all'.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope you can make sense of all of that! (I myself am clearer now on what's happening, but still don't understand why.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards&nbsp;</div>

            Hi again RoseKatrina
<div><br />
<div>I seem to have found the problem: if I enter *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as my 'E-mail address' and 'Reply address' in the Properties panel (General tab), 'Reply all' no longer sends to that address. I assume that my outward mail will now be sent from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 I can't tell right now if that will happen, because there's no 'From' field in the email header. I won't know what address I'm sending from until I send an email and receive a reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The downside to this is that if I wish to send or reply using *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I'll have to remove *** Email address is removed for privacy *** from the Properties general setting. Pity there's not a 'From' field in the letter heading, from which the user can choose the address
 to use without changing the properties.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            I'd be happy to help you sort this out, but the forum software obscures every email address for everyone but yourself and forum moderators, so it's impossible for me to make sense of your explanations.<br />
<br />
To be able to have more than one <em>From</em>: address, you must set up more than one account. You seem to have two accounts, probably @hotmail and @outlook. If these are separate accounts - i.e. one is not an alias of the other - then you should add the other
 one in Windows Live Mail (Ctrl-Shift-T) with the default settings. If appropriate, deselect
<em>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing </em>on the account properties
<em>General</em> tab.

            Many thanks for that, Noel. In fact, one address (@outlook) is an alias of the other (@live). Your explanation has clarified the situation for me, thanks. I see now that I can't choose between aliases when sending. The address that I've entered in the
 appropriate fields on the General tab will be the address that I send/reply from. In fact, I didn't have an address entered there at all, which meant I was always sending from the address with which my account is registered (my account login address).
<div><br />
<div>I believe all is resolved. Having entered an address in those fields, there is no longer an issue with the program replying to my own address.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding adding other accounts: I did have other accounts added (my ISP accounts), but since they were also added in my Office 2013 Outlook program, things sometimes became confused, with folders becoming 'undelete-able'. I was able to sort the problems
 out via the ISP's webmail, but they have different versions of their webmail on different servers and some of my traffic was ending up on one server and some on the other. So I deleted the ISP email addresses from WLM and left them in Office Outlook only.
 That's OK: I mainly use Outlook (Hotmail/Live) anyway, as it's permanent, while the ISP may not be, or I could change ISP in the future.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your assistance.</div>
