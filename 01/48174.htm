    <title>Again a problem with the bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nour_aly03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Again a problem with the bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>I recently complained about a problem with the bluetooth on my brand new HP Spectre X360 13-ac003na that my bluetooth was working fine until I tried connecting again with my ESONSTYLE headphones: The laptop states that the devices have paired and that the
 setup is downloading the necessary files to connect to my headphones and then that it has connected successfully but the sound still comes out of the laptop speakers. Later I found out that a problem with the name of Code 38 has occured with one of the bluetooth
 drivers so I uninstalled and reinstalled the laptop and restarted it. After that the bluetooth worked fine. But then I put my laptop on sleep mode and after reopening it a while later, the exact same problem has occured but the only difference this time is
 that the laptop states that all of the bluetooth drivers are working perfectly.<br />
I am very worried and need help. Please.</p>

<p>I feel you bro, i just posted exactly the same issue in another part of the forum a couple of days ago. We should at least be given 10 mins or so notice that an update is coming so we can at least save our game. When this happens in the middle of a grind
 especially, this is so annoying! I just hope you don't get the same idiotic replies to this post as i got, but be prepared lol</p>

<p>Not to sound like an ***, but you could've just selected 'skip it and stay offline' finshed what you were doing and then saved the Game</p>
<p>Then afterwards, simply force the Game to update itself, it shouldn't really affect any of the Game's Save Data</p>
<p>No real need to call it 'Disgusting' either, Overracting much?</p>

<p>There not gonna mention GTA 5 coming to next gen until this current gen GTA 5 sells alot of units then R* will make even more money. If they announced it now alot of people would just wait for the next gen version and not buy it for the 360/ps3.</p>

<p>Any talk is speculative and not from any verifiable official source. However... gut instinct tells me it'll wind up on the next-gen platforms around the time it finds it's way onto the PC. The fact that the game will be being developed for X86 architecture
 and that will mean it'll be a doddle to port it to Xbox One and PS4 &nbsp;means they'd be dumb not to. It'll probably happen though after the first two or three DLC have dropped for GTA V on current gen systems. It'll just be announced and then a month later there
 it will be. Wouldn't bet my house on it, but by that sort of time both systems will have a pretty decent installed user base who'd lap it up all over again with prettier visuals. Capitalism baby... ain't it a bi... ;)</p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW, you can use Laragon Full package which will auto install VC Redist for you.</p>

<h2>            No sound via HDMI output when connecting laptop to TV</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Original title: HDMI Laptop to TV - No Sound<br />
</strong><br />
Up until a few weeks ago it worked well:&nbsp; I simply connected the HDMI cable&nbsp;between my laptop and TV and got both the audio and video on the TV (After selecting the right AV channel on the TV).&nbsp; Now I only get the video.</p>
<p>I have looked through other questions on this forum but have not found anything that works.&nbsp; I am reluctant to change too much, as it worked before.</p>
<p>In my "Playback Devices" I see two devices: "Speakers" (Default) and "SPDIF Interface".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laptop: <span>Packard Bell Easy Note TJ65 Pentium Dual-Core CPU</span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>Windows 7 Version 6.1 (Build 7600)</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>TV: Panasonic Plasma TX-PS42S10B (HD Ready)</p>
<p>Any ideas, anybody?&nbsp; I feel that as I have made very few changes, the fix must be simple.&nbsp; I haven't tried a different cable yet, but I'm pretty sure it's OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BINGO!!</p>
<p>(So I had to go on to JustAnswers.com &amp; pay £28, but I got the answer straight away ... wish I had gone earlier!)</p>
<p>Happy to share, though, for anyone struggling with this annoying problem...</p>
<p>I went on to Device Manager (Start Button &gt; right click on <strong>Computer</strong> and select<strong>Manage</strong>) and uninstalled the device called<span><strong>Intel(R) High Definition Audio HDMI</strong>.&nbsp; Restarted the computer.&nbsp; Connected
 TV with HDMI cable.&nbsp; Right clicked on the little speaker symbol &amp; slected Playback Devices.&nbsp; Panasonic TV shows as a device.&nbsp; Right clicked on it &amp; set as default.&nbsp; I got my sound back &amp; everything works fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems the driver had been updated somewhere along the line and was no longer compatible.&nbsp; Following this process makes the computer put back its own driver.&nbsp; All this time I was looking for a newer driver, and what it wanted was the old
 one!</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, the device in Device Manager is now called<strong> High Definition Audio Device</strong>. No mention of HDMI!</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, if you right click on the desktop you get a wizard to set up the TV interface.</span></p>

<h2>            Scam&#63; - Someone called me today and said that I had to renew my software maintenance or they would block my computer.</h2>
                    Someone called me today and said that they were calling from the Technical Department of Windows. They told me that if I don't renew my software maintenance they will "block" my computer. I asked for a number that I could call back and the number they
 gave me was 1 (614) 388-8814. When I called the person answered "Hello?" So I hung up and then the first person who called, called me back. I was then told that my computer was being "blocked" because I didn't renew my warranty. Is this a scam?

    <title>Slow xp &#40;professional&#41; startup logon and logoff shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a.v.n.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow xp &#40;professional&#41; startup logon and logoff shutdown</h2>
                    <div>On an otherwise normal system, after some time of use parts of the windows system build up extra data stored in various files. I was concerned with the past items list and icons cache/data for the tray becoming too large because it was causing problems.
 In trying to fix the mixed up and or mismatched past items icons/descriptions in right click tray, customize notifications menu, I fixed the problem using a microsoft fix it solution and stumbled upon related fixes that ended up speeding up my logon/logoff
 times.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>1: To fix the past items for the tray icons in right click tray, customize notification properties menu, run this microsoft fix it:</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283084/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283084/en-us</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To do this manually, the procedure is described in web link. However, I did not test the manual method completely because I had deleted the PastIconsStream data by creating a new entry and without deleting the IconStreams data on my own hoping this would
 work before I found the fix it page, and after restarting windows this left all the past items listed, but with folder icons in place of their actual icons. After that, I found the web page and decided to run the fix it tool for this problem and it solved
 it.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2: The reduced logon/logoff times occurred after applying this item, and the related first item, and the third item:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>link:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/132668/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/132668/en-us</a>&nbsp;; although microsoft suggested to Change the data value from its original value to 2000, it was already at 2048 and I changed
 it to 4096. Default is 500 on microsoft.com, but I had first run this microsoft fix it:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_file_and_folder_diag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_file_and_folder_diag/</a>&nbsp;and it may
 have changed this to 2048. I did not check first because I did not know to. Another microsoft fix with a different name but the same four manual menu items that I ran after the first one that also verified the first fix worked was found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813711/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813711/en-us</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3: What I did besides the preceding info to make windows desktop load quicker on startup logon and on logoff shutdown and help windows explorer run faster* (logon went from 10-12 blocks to 4-5 blocks** in task manager's performance tab that shows cpu usage
 history):&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>* <i>My machine didn't have any other loading problems/delays since I installed windows xp pro,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the reason for so many blocks is that I set all services to automatic in administrative tools (two services rereturn to manual and two I set to manual) to
 see how the computer would run, which adds some time to the logon screen processing time (takes about 3-4 minutes total (1-2 otherwise), but I usually wait for the processor light to become idle anyway before logging on because I think there are some processes
 that sometimes occur during/after that time like possibly the two .NET services (Optimization and NGEN), which needs to be set back to manual from disabled after each time it runs (few times a year)) Although I would prefer all on automatic, because I believe
 that windows should by default automatically handle startup and stop states for all services as start, trigger start, stop, and trigger stop, most users do not need to set all services to automatic (export list to reverse changes easily) because windows xp
 is not fully configured to stop services properly when not in use as I believe it should. But if users at least start .NET services if needed plus any other important dependencies, and change nonnecessary items to manual or disabled, this could increase overall
 application performance. Check the services help menu or this these links </i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sys_srv_default_settings.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sys_srv_default_settings.mspx?mfr=true</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349799(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349799(v=ws.10).aspx</a>&nbsp;<i>for
 suggested default startup state lists and expainations..These or&nbsp;</i><i>the basic computer manufacturers default setup (depending on harware/software configuration settings, i.e. things that are enabled or not enabled change the default services startup type
 and start/stop states) might show the logon time reduced to 1-3 blocks</i><i>. There are some service managers on the web that offer useful preconfigurations like gaming, networking, etc. I am using a free utility in Advanced Uninstaller Pro (this software
 contains other useful utilities</i><i>) that can allow me to switch between saved profiles. Another useful suite towards these ends is Free Advanced System Care 6, which allows you to save and revert any changes. However, for my uses, I prefer the default
 computer manufacture basic setup and the default services setups with some minor changes. Other common things I did to improve performance include security sweeps from antivirus/antimalware programs, disk cleanup, careful registry cleaning and defragmenting,
 defragmenting the hard drive, and defragmenting the page file with system internals suite's pagedfrg from microsoft's website, which has further performance information on slow logons/logoffs and startup/shutdown problems including: enabling defrag boot optimize
 function in registry editor at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Dfrg\BootOptimizeFunction by setting the enable value to Y. See:&nbsp;</i><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc784391(v=WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc784391(v=WS.10).aspx</a>&nbsp;,
 and also&nbsp;<i>running the User Profile Hive Cleanup Service from</i>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6676</a>&nbsp;<i>for faster log offs. Also, I noticed
 in task manager (wuauclt.exe) that microsoft update cycles memory for about 20 to 40 minutes, so I switched back to windows update, and turned off updating in microsoft programs like silverlight, which can be done manually now on windows update, and this helped
 speed things up. After that I ran a microsoft fix it found at&nbsp;</i><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/</a>.
<i>There are other common fix its that can be run from your machine, but fix it center beta is currently discontinued, so you have to go to</i>&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/fixit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/fixit/</a>.
<i>Other performance related fixes are found here too.</i></div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>** However, the shorter startup time that lasted for about four startups disappears some time after defragmenting the hard drive and goes back to 10-12 blocks. So, I defragmented more than one time in a row, after about 2 or 3 times the process sped
 up and I got much more ordered pattern of blue bars by compaction that was closer to a solid blue block by around 10 times. This helped along with other things and I was back to 4-5 Blocks for CPU usage history. I also noticed that on normal update speed,
 task manager CPU usage history progresses at one forward click per second. However, this was not true when I had installed compatible but generic intel drivers from intel.com instead of the recommended ones from the computer manufacturer. So, performance is
 effected by the drivers you install on your machine.

            The Maps app could be showing your location even when there's no GPS information based on other sensors like WiFi signal. So it doesn't necesarily mean that it can see the GPS working.

</p>
<p>but the other Problems:</p>
<p>- the app photos don´t start</p>

<p>... some other apps don´t start too - every crahed app start write in the eventwr protocoll the hint:
</p>
<p>By the activate of app .... photos ... error ... the modul don´t found - look at the protocoll Microsoft-Windows-TwinUI/Betriebsbereit &gt;&gt;&gt; I don´t have the protocoll .... I not found it in the eventvwr</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the System with (SFC) &amp; DISM and repair it, I delete and reinstall the apps, - I reinstall&nbsp; and install new the System complete &nbsp;.... but nowhere works
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry - but sometimes I think about to give up and install an "old" win8.1 </p>
<p>
</p><p>what can I do now .....?</p>
<p>

</p><p>..... idea - the source of all Problems is the gnss geolocations sensor - every app (which not will start) check the Location? And when the geolocation sensor not work, the app will Crash?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed the problems ... the way ís "easy":</p>
<p>- delete the harddisk and install win8.1 new</p>
<p>- install all Drivers from Lenovo and update to the last fix Level from Windows</p>
<p>- upgrade to Windows 10 :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thats all &gt; everthing works perfekt, all components running normal and I love the new Win10 on the tablet ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the question </p>

<h2>            I&#39;m getting Error Code 2147500037 when I try to print my homegroup password in WIndows 10</h2>
                    This seems to be a very long term problem which first came up in Windows 7!!!!&nbsp; Simply, the issue is as the title.&nbsp; Windows 10 installation 'broke' my Home group link and has given a very complex password so I wanted to print it off as I reconnected all
 my devices. It would not print and gave an Error Code 2147500037 message.&nbsp; Ideas appreciated....

            OK.&nbsp; So, having look more into it the answer is exactly the same as years ago MAKE IE THE DEFAULT BROWSER. Clearly the Print Instruction in Homegroup is only compatible with IE !!!&nbsp; Sorry to waste anyone's time....

            <p>Excuse me? Windows 10 breaks the Home Group which must now be rebuilt from scratch AND IE is no longer the default browser for Windows 10 since the emergence of Edge.&nbsp; Certain webpages from the outside world that have even yet to get on board with IE11 will
 at least give a message AND a link to open IE when they won't play well with Edge.&nbsp; Why can't Microsoft at least place a link on the Home Group password page to at least open it with IE and print from within.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, for another discussion, but Windows 10 and Edge also "broke" the ability to right-click select print.&nbsp; Even using the Ctrl-P override I cannot start a print job by hitting the Enter key when my printer of choice is already selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For MY satisfaction at least I still know how to use an antique known as a pencil and paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if there is a better way to print from my Surface to the printer hardwired to my desktop (both Win 10) than having to start a Home Group (I used to think just being on the same LAN was enough to share printers)</p>

<p>Sept 10, 2017 - Problem still here. &nbsp;After Windows Creator update IE11 is no where to found on my system. (This has so many other ramifications, but are way off topic for this thread.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However what I find is that when you use the default Administrator account to create a brand new HomeGroup on a system that has no other HomeGroup available you can print the password ONCE, and only once. &nbsp;After that you cannot reprint a password, nor can
 you print a new/changed password for a HomeGroup that has already been setup. Then I also found that trying to do a print screen or use a screen capturing utility such as SnagIt will not work because it is not allowed per GROUP POLICY. &nbsp;Group Policy on a stand-alone
 desktop computer??? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not just remove the PRINT option and be done with it?</p>

<p>Apparently this is a problem going back a while.&nbsp; If the only problem is printing the Home Group password, do a screen capture [Alt] + [Print Screen] and paste into Paint.&nbsp; You should be able to print the screen captured from Paint and stop bagging your
 head against the wall as I've been doing.<br />

<h2>            sony vaio bluetooth driver atheros 8.0.1.305 for windows 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>sequence of events:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. downloaded as an Optional Windows Update the Qualcomm Atheros Communications - &nbsp;Bluetooth Controller - Qualcomm Atheros AR3012 Bluetooth(R) Adapter on Feb 26, 2014</p>
<p>2. A day after, Vaio Update alerted me of an update regarding Bluetooth Driver (Atheros) update version 8.0.1.305 for Windows 8.1 upgrade dated 10/18/2013 212377KB which I tried to download and update but unfortunately cannot be installed. Due to an error
 message.</p>
<p>3. Tried to manually download it from a sony website http://www.sony.co.in/support/download/573583 with&nbsp;<span>File name:&nbsp;</span><strong>EP0000310647.exe&nbsp;</strong><span>File size:&nbsp;</span><strong>207
 MB (217,477,120 bytes).&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately wont update still due to same error message as above.</p>
<p>4. I later found out that I have already installed this update last November 2013 when I upgraded my system from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, Im using a 64-bit processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This problem might occur because the Win32 Cabinet Self-Extractor tool cannot handle the DBCS characters in the user name.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to restart the computer in a
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></a><span> mode to check if any third party
 application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally
 after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>” to return the computer to a Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>
Start</strong> screen.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong>This PC</strong>” without quotes.</span></li><li><span>Right click on it from the list of results and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>
Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings area</strong>, click on <strong>Change settings</strong>.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Change Settings</strong> and then select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. Click on the
<strong>Environment variables</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>
User variables</strong> area, click <strong>TEMP</strong>, and then click <strong>
Edit</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>
Variable value</strong> box, type “<strong>C:\Temp</strong>” without quotes, and then click
<strong>OK</strong> two times.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow steps 4 through 6 for the
<strong>TMP </strong>environment variable as well.</span></li><li><span>Confirm that
<strong>C:\Temp</strong> folder exists, if not create one.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer.</span></li><li><span>Attempt to install the update again.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the results.</span></p>

<h2>            Device manager</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to get to the bottom of a crash which windows said was caused by a driver. I started my computer in safe mode. opened device manager and then the show hidden devices. As it turns out in my non plug and play hidden drivers there is a driver called&nbsp;
 Security Processor Loader (spldr) which had an error code (code 24). I could notr update manually message said driver was disabled or components missing.
</p>
<p>Through some very good advice I got on this forum, I started in safe mode and checked all my drivers, everything was all good I scanned for virus with temporary tool provided from Microsoft. No viruses
</p>
<p>As I posted earlier I ran the fix it tool yesterday, it referred me to online site but but the character box would not accept anything that I entered to let me go online as recommended by the fix it guy. Anyway there was a folder on my desktop this morning
 titled windows update trouble. I don't understand this language but the words download file internal failed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 3 questions: How do I repair or update that hidden driver Security Processor Loader ( spldr ) ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do with the troubleshooting folder on my deskop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could the fact that I may have downloaded the incorrect BIOS update have anything with all my download and updating problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry about such a long narrative. I have learned so much in the short time I have been a part of these forums. I tell all my friends

<h2>            Many PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA BSODs happening recently to multiple computers</h2>
                    <p>Hey Microsoft community, long time lurker first time poster here. I'm having some trouble recently with multiple BSOD's happening to a number of my users recently. They have all been receiving the same blue screen error message, that there was a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
 seemingly caused by FLTMGR.SYS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially thought it had to do with a problem related to the Intel integrated graphics driver but that doesn't seem to be the case. It's most commonly happening to HP computers (EliteBook 840 G3's, a ProBook 440 G4 and a ZBook Studio G4) but also some
 Lenovo ThinkPads as well (L460 and L450).</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are all running Windows 10 v1803. I can run some reports from our patch management system to get BIOS versions and other relevant data if that would be helpful. I also have some minidump files I can provide as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Here's a link to a folder on my OneDrive with a few minidump files, one from today:&nbsp;https://revisionsolar-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bnolette_revisionenergy_com/EvdCmUNGLgtDl3LGg9I54U0BLK4IGIG3MDX9XILIv1S3gw?e=zTasSL</p>

    <title>Move&#47;expand Windows partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philrosenberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Move&#47;expand Windows partition</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Here is my situation. On my current laptop I originally had windows 7 32 bit. I had this on one partition (100 GB), then all my files on a separate data directory (400 GB). I then needed to use some 64 bit software so I shrunk my data partition (to 300 GB)&nbsp;and
 installed windows 8 64 bit on a third partition (again 100 GB). I also have a 100 MB system reserved partition at the start of the drive.</p>
<p>Now I have run out of drive space so have bought a larger one. I want to transfer my system to this new drive and so I&nbsp;imaged it using macrium reflect. However on my new system I would like to change the boot order and expand the windows partitions. So I
 would like to go from Win7 (100 GB), data (300 GB), Win 8 (100 GB) to Win8( 150 GB ), Win 7 (150 GB), Data (1200 GB). However if I copy the partition onto the new drive like this I cannot boot. I tried booting from my Win8 cd and using bootrec commands, which
 allowed me to boot Win8, but it took a long time to load, saying it was setting up my system, then eventually ended up as a black screen with a mouse pointer. I also tried putting fresh installs on Win 7 and Win 8 on my drive, then overwriting these with the
 backups, but my Win 8 system did the same as before and Win 7 booted to an empty screen which just said this was not a genuine copy of Windows (This is a genuine copy). I've now just transferred the backup to the new drive unchanged, which gives me a working
 system, but not set up in a sensible way as I cannot expand my data partition that is sandwiched between the OS partitions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is what I'm trying to do possible? It seems like what I thought should be an easy job to transfer an image to a new drive, has turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Phil</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not real sure about what capabilities macrium has... can it restore an image to a larger partition?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try formatting the new drive into the partitions you need first, then restoring to them ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done pretty much what you are trying to do, but with only one OS, without a problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used Acronis TrueImage though.&nbsp; I do know that when I have restored images with other software, the machine detected that something had been changed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have this problem with Acronis</p>

<p>That is most likely related to your screen resolution, but may be normal...</p>

            Yes Macrium Reflect can restore to a larger partition, or once I restore it I can expand to the right with Windows Partition Management. However If I try to put the Windows &nbsp;partitions in a different place on the drive then I get all the boot problems
 I described

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't tried having two OS's Dual booting in years... I don't switch much, so I have them on&nbsp;separate drives... I hide the one I'm not using... As a result, I'm kind of guessing...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would think that as along as they are in the same order on the new drive, they should work, as you mentioned... if they aren't modified...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking transferring them one at a time... with the 100MB System partition first, and unmodified.</p>
<p>Then either create the partitions in advance and just select the correct one, or expand it after the transfer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to then change the default OS... You will probably need to use Win 8.1 to make the change... I seem to remember that when Win 8 is installed in a dual boot, it usually takes over the boot sequencing stuff...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my machine, I was actually able to eliminate the 100MB System partition by simply not transferring it.</p>
<p>On one occasion, I had to do a boot repair to get the machine, and another, I had to do nothing... Just turned the computer on, and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, have you tried doing just one OS and it's Data partition, and trying to boot, before copying the second ?</p>

            I have been trying a few different things since posting. It seems that I cannot simply place my partitions on the new drive in the order I want. However I have been able to do a full unchanged restore, which gives me a working system., then move/duplicate
 partitions and edit the boot manager settings to account for them. If I ever get this working I'll post how&nbsp;I did it&nbsp;in case it is useful to others.

            <p>Hi Anyone that cares.</p>
<p>I finally got this working, so here is a step by step guide to restoring backups of your system from an image, but putting bootable drives in a different order. I'm posting it just in case it is useful to anyone else trying to solve the some problem. Here
 goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of my woes were because I was swapping the order of the partitions. As I reported, when I left the order the same everything was okay, but I didn’t want Windows 8, which is the OS I use most as the last partition on the slowest bit of my hard drive.
 I think the main problem was that when booting up, Windows allocated drive letters in the same order as previously. So for example in windows 8 the fourth partition was allocated as C:, which happened to be the Data partition. This meant that all the paths
 hard coded into the registry as C: couldn’t be found and windows pretty much failed to boot. Similarly for 32 bit Windows 7, the C: ended up being the 64 bit Windows 8 partition, which obviously didn’t work well either.</p>
<p>So how do we fix it. Well importantly the answer is in <a href="http://paulski.com/zpages.php?id=2102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://paulski.com/zpages.php?id=2102</a>. The id and drive letter for each partition can be found in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/MountedDevices. Look for Keys \DosDevices\C: and similar. To change which drive letter each partition gets, right
 click the key and select Rename then change the drive letter. How do you know which partition is which? The first four bytes of the value are the id of the drive, the second 8 bytes are little endian representation of the start of the partition, for example
 my first two partitions have values </p>
<p>80 00 00 00 00 00 50 06 00 00 00 00<br />
80 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 19 00 00 00</p>
<p>So the first partition is on drive id 80 00 00 00 and starts at position 00 00 00 00 06 50, the second is on drive id 80 00 00 00 (the same drive) and starts at position 00 00 00 19 00 10. Using this information you should be able to id your drives. In order
 to edit the registry without booting windows there are instructions here <a href="http://4sysops.com/archives/regedit-as-offline-registry-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://4sysops.com/archives/regedit-as-offline-registry-editor/</a>.</p>
<p>The second issue is the boot manager – it too probably expects the partitions to be in the same order. We can edit this with the bcdedit command. Instructions for this are here

<p>So here is a recipe that should work. Fingers crossed. My backup uses Macrium Reflect free, which uses a Linux or Win PE recovery disk. Other image backup software should work too, but you will need access to a command prompt without booting into Windows
 so you will need a Windows 7 or 8 installation media or a Win PE recovery disk of some sort – if nothing else then download the free Macrium Reflect and create a Win PE disk from that.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform your restore putting the partitions in the locations you want and resizing them as needed. I used the Reflect Linux recovery disk for this because it allows you to resize partitions and the Win PE one doesn’t seem to allow this. But make sure the
 Boot Manager partition (the 100 MB System Reserved partition) is in the same location as before – presumably first.</li><li>Boot into your Windows install or Win PE recovery disk. </li><li>Start a command prompt (on the install media I think this is under repair your computer-&gt;troubleshoot-&gt;advanced options, on an existing windows install right click cmd.exe and run as administrator) and find which drive has been allocated which letter by
 changing drive and using dir, Don’t worry, the drive letters assigned in your recovery disk bear no resemblance to that when you boot.
</li><li>Still from the command prompt run bcdedit. You will see all your startup entries, each will have an identifier in curly braces. Change the device and osdevice properties as needed to match the drive letters you just found. The command is bcdedit /set {id}
 device partition=C: and bcdedit /set {id} osdevice partition=C:</li><li>Now enter regedit at the command prompt and click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then click load Hive. Open the first Windows partition’s system database which should be at %windir%\System32\Config\system, give it a name that you will remember like WINDOWS7_SYSTEM.
 Navigate to mountedDevices and rename the DOSDevices entries so that the rearranged partitions have the correct letter. You can identify the partition order by looking at the last 8 bytes of the value which is the little endian position of the beginning of
 the partition. Also presumably the order matches the order from the original system, so if you know your system was C:, D:, E: and you have swapped C: and D: then presumably swap C: and D: here.</li><li>Repeat step 5 for the remaining Windows Partitions</li></ol>
<span>Reboot and all should be well. If not, then there is no point asking me questions because you now know everything I do, but I wish you good luck.

<h2>            SD card reader issue , constantly closing folder</h2>
                    <p>I am just learning Windows 10 from Windows 7 &nbsp;, so far not real impressed &nbsp;, after finding out i can't right click and then copy/paste (whoever removed that feature is a idiot) , i am now finding another weird can't figure out issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i use a USB card reader for my camera sd card to import pictures so i can email them to family/friends , i open File Explorer and start to view the pictures so i can choose which ones to copy , i am looking at the pictures and all of a sudden File Explorer
 closes the folder back to the main folder , then i open it again , and it does it again , it does this over and over about every 15 - 20 or so seconds , if i unplug the USB reader , and open file explorer to look at any other file/folder , it works fine ,
 it only does this with a USB card reader plugged in ( my PC does not have a built in card reader )</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i stop Windows 10 from doing this &nbsp;???, as my Windows 7 PC does not have this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do i need to physically install a card reader into my PC ? , is there a reason why with a USB card reader , that Windows 10 File Explorer crashes , but not with any other USB device (i used a USB Data Transfer Cable to move files from my Win 7 PC to my Win
 10 PC and that worked fine , even though it uses Windows File Explorer)</p>

            <p>I ended up figuring out the issue &nbsp;, for some reason it was not reading the external USB mini card reader &nbsp;, so i unplugged it , restarted the PC , then plugged it in and it seemed to work , i then ended up buying/installing a card reader into the face (where
 the empty dvd/floppy slots are in the front of the case) , this seemed like a more permanent solution than inserting a mini card reader each time &nbsp;, its working fine now</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply....<br />
