    <title>Windows 10 Mail App&#58; &#34;Your Outlook Account Settings are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> capinwinky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App&#58; &#34;Your Outlook Account Settings are out-of-date.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>It appears that the mail app automatically created an Outlook account using the information from my Microsoft Account. This account is not a normal account as I can't delete it and it does not show up with the Account switching button, only if I
 go into Settings -&gt; Accounts. It constantly generates the action center message,&nbsp;"Your Outlook Account Settings are out-of-date."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is probably because I don't have, have never had, and have no intention of having an Outlook account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine this special account is some way to store my email settings so they appear across devices, but I would really like it to stop with this nuance message. Since the Action Center is also the only notification that I've gotten an email, I
 can't simply disable all notifications from the Mail app.</p>

            Microsoft need to sort this problem out. this message appears every day, even though the 'fix' button is supposed to sort it! or is this another additional feature in Windows 10?

            <p>I have tried every suggestion I could find on the internet. Obviously, nothing worked, or I wouldn't be here now. This is a regular, and very annoying problem. Ironically, it only occurs on my
<strong>Microsoft Surface Pro 3</strong> !!!&nbsp; I have two other computers running windows 10, with which I have no problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the best solution is to stop using the new <strong>Windows "Mail"</strong>. Please at least give us an alternative while you get this
<strong>VERY POOR app </strong>sorted.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I'm running into the same issue "Your outlook account settings are out of date".&nbsp; You click on fix and it&nbsp; cycles endlessly.&nbsp; Microsoft, with all of it's technical expertise needs to offer a solid fix for this immediately.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.&nbsp; I've the
 added issue of attempting to type any email and the character lagging about 5 - 8 seconds before they appear on the screen.&nbsp; I suspect this is all related.&nbsp; PLEASE SEND INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX THIS!

            <p style="text-align: left">So I am having this issue and have a work around for my situation which maybe a little different than others:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">- <strong>Situation</strong>: For each person in my family I have an outlook.com account. Each also has a secondary account for email which is NOT outlook.com, In my calendar I want single view across my entire family and as such
 have added all of my families outlook.com accounts to it. I sync only the calendar.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">- <strong>Issue</strong>: All but my own accounts popup with the 'issue with account' error -- so I hit 'fix' and get prompted for a PIN (not password). Well there is no PIN so at that point I am stuck. It seems the PIN is for accounts
 on the PC, not an outlook.com setting for the account.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">- <strong>Work around</strong>: On my PC I added the accounts as login users. Set a PIN. Then used that PIN and all seems to be ok. I may remove permission for that account to login now and see if that stays fixed or not. If so then
 its a pain but workable (as along as it does not come back). Note that the PIN cannot be longer than 4 digits as the 'fix' dialog will not allow longer ones although in PIN setup it can be longer!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">If anyone has a fix better please let me know ...</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Thanks Charlie.&nbsp; Issue is with gopro photos. &nbsp; I have PhotoDirector 8 on my laptop. I haven't used before, but it also won't open the photo, nor will paint 3d.&nbsp; And I just realised that the issue is not that it is a jpg file as I can open a jpg from a
 camera file, &nbsp; But I cannot view any <strong>gopro </strong>photos.&nbsp; I used to be able to, so this is new.&nbsp; I don't know if it is due to a windows upgrade or the photo app or other.&nbsp; thinking I will try a free photo editor app.&nbsp; But will try Kapils suggestion.&nbsp;

            Thanks Kapil.&nbsp; As per reply to Charlie, have realised it is <strong>GoPro</strong> jpg files that won't open.&nbsp; other jpg files from camera or iphone do open fine. (sorry, thought I had checked this ). I tried your suggestion and then restarted laptop but
 no change, still cannot open the GoPro files - displays the message 'it appears that we don't support this file format' .

            Hmmmm, that is odd. 
<br />
<br />Can you attach your GoPro to your PC for me, open up the folder where the photos are, and send a screenshot over? 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + PrntSc and a photo will save within a screenshot folder in your Pictures folder. I’d like to see what it looks like if possible. 
<br />
<br />Also, are you trying to launch the photos directly from the GoPro folder, or are you copying the photos to your PC and trying to launch them? I’d try that if you can. 
<br />
<br />Click start - Settings - Updates and Security - Windows Updates - Let’s see if there are any pending updates that can be installed. If so, install those and then try again. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Further, I downloaded Adobe Photoshop Express- and it also cannot open the files, with the message that the 'the original files appear to be unsupported or damaged'.&nbsp; This is very confusing as I cannot open either old gopro photos i.e. from 9 months ago
 or more recently, direct from the SD i.e. new photos.&nbsp; My gopro is not new (HERO3+) ..&nbsp; any other ideas? &nbsp;

<p>Checked for windows updates - all good, nothing to do. Now last update as of today (prev was yesterday).</p>
<p>I am tyring to open recent photos direct from the SD card.&nbsp; And also checked older photos that are on home network., same result.</p>
<p>p.s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>.. and just double checked again for an update and looks like there is one there now, that didn't show 10 mins ago..&nbsp; - I will do this and let you know if any change</p>

<p>Further update... some progress ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was working on and copied the files to the PC from the SD disk for later editing (hoping can do).</p>
<p>I had a second SD disk in the GoPro - I removed that to copy these files too and noticed:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. the file name structure is different (i.e no &nbsp; ._)</p>
<p>2. I can open and view these photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next question is how - how do I view the other files.&nbsp; 'Something' has put a ._ to prefix the name.&nbsp; I did try renaming a file earlier today as I thought that the ._ prefix looked odd, but I still wasn't able to open.&nbsp; I'm worried about the years of files
 I have than have been automatically renamed somehow ..&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why are Windows 10 automatically updating even though I&#8217;ve - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianiixo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are Windows 10 automatically updating even though I&#8217;ve turned updates off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after the last Windows 10 update (updated in march) DESTROYED my Lenovo G50-30, I turned my updates off. The last updated completely corrupted my boot up so whenever I started up my laptop, it would go straight to ‘choose a keyboard language’ and nothing
 else. I was able to go to advanced options, but it wouldn’t even let me go back to a previous update or even enter safe mode. Windows 10 had rendered my laptop into a piece of crap. Not only that, I lost ALL of my data but I was fortunate enough to get it
 all back by paying £75 to fix my laptop again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I turned all of my updates off, however I have to update windows if I want to shut down my laptop. Instead, I held the power button to turn it off, but it wouldn’t turn off and instead started doing updates. I took the battery out so it would power
 off. I turned my laptop on again and luckily it started up without updating, so I put it in sleep mode until I can back it all up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I prevent the new update from updating my laptop? As a student, I can’t afford to keep paying loads of money to get this fixed an I also don’t have time to waste especially since it’s almost exam season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi ianiixo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows Update automatically downloads and installs available updates as long as you are connected to a network. The issue with keyboard on the last updates are known to us and we have released another update to fix this issue. Since updates are inevitable,
 we can only advise that you create a full backup of your system so you will always have something to go back to in case things went south. Take a quick look in this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">
Forum Article </a>created by Andre Da Costa on how you can create a system image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, assuming you are using a wireless connection, set it up as metered connection. Limiting your data usage will allow you to pause some Windows Update most especially if it's a big update. You can do this by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> &gt; <strong>Wi-Fi </strong>
&gt; <strong>Manage known networks</strong> &gt; Select your network &gt; <strong>Properties
</strong>&gt; <strong>Set as metered connection</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hello Mckeematthew</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so very much for posting this up in the Xbox Forums. I believe this might have something to do as per&nbsp;how you are connecting into the game. Are you loading up the file&nbsp;of player two, and then joining? Are you loading in straight from the title
 screen? Also, are you playing on the same console or over Xbox Live? How about when you try this loading into the second players' world? I'd like to know a bit more detail regarding your experience with reproducing this save data duplication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would please, be so kind as to provide this info, we should be able to better support you and resolve this matter.</p>

<h2>            Achievement not unlocking in Sleeping Dogs</h2>
                    This happened to two of my achievements. Once because I was offline. The second had no reason at all. How do I fix it? This is very annoying as a gamer

            I have had this happen several times through different games. Achievements can sometimes take a day or two to pop(this is because it has to be registered in the server). If it doesn't show up after a while, i would contact microsoft support to see if they
 could look into the matter.

<p>Have you tried right-clicking on the shortcut to the Money program, or the .exe, and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; With the extra privileges that generates you may be able to get the updates and install the updated files.</p>
<p>Otherwise you can comply with the message's suggestion and at least temporarily disable all realtime scanners (security programs, such as Anti Virus, Defender, etc.)&nbsp;that are running on your machine.</p>

    <title>Cursor jumps to a corner of the screen and jitters for a second - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryotto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor jumps to a corner of the screen and jitters for a second</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a problem ever since I got a new Dell U2417H monitor and plugged it into my laptop via HDMI.<br />
I am running Win 8.1 since I got the Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga, with no similar issues ever occurring before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor jumps to an edge or corner of the screen, recently it's been the bottom right corner, always to the exact same spot every time. Then it moves in that area erratically, possibly clicking and then stops after a second.&nbsp;<br />
This has happened even when I had my mouse disconnected, and when I had my pen tablet disconnected. (AKA no external control over the mouse) but it has never happened when I was using the laptop normally, which leads me to believe the issue is somehow related
 to the monitor itself.&nbsp;<br />
It happens once in a while, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes 30 seconds or so. It's not gone to the point of being totally intolerable but it is annoying to say the least.<br />
<br />
It's not related to my hand touching the touchpad while typing because I am using a USB mechanical keyboard, and am nowhere near the touchpad itself. Also hard to believe it's the touchpad when the cursor always jumps to the
<strong>same</strong> location.<br />
I have scanned my computer for viruses and malware, and did not find anything. <br />
Restarting the computer did not solve the issue.<br />
Turning off Enhance Pointer Position did not help.<br />
SnapTo is disabled.<br />

            <p>I had this issue as well with my Yoga when using external keyboard and monitors.&nbsp; Did not happen when using the laptop without those accessories, i.e., typing on the laptop keyboard.&nbsp; After our company IT techs had tried everything to fix it with no positive
 results, an offhand comment by someone made me think it might be an electromagnetic interference problem between the touchscreen and the touchpad.&nbsp; Maybe all that's needed is a simple EMI separator between the two.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well - at the risk of sounding like a tinfoil hat conspiracy nut, I put a sheet of aluminum foil (the simplest EMI shield I could think of) on top of my keyboard and then closed the laptop and powered it on (with external keyboard and monitors).&nbsp; Did it
 a couple of days ago and haven't had a cursor jump since - and the computer has been on the entire time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems to work.</p>

<h3> tomgschu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Arial Narrow Font is missing&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 Professional that was factory installed on a Dell&nbsp; laptop that I purchased in late November of 2009.&nbsp; The following Arial fonts are installed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arial Black </li><li>Arial Bold </li><li>Arial Bold Italic </li><li>Arial Italic </li><li>Arial Regular </li></ol>
<p>I have some software that is expecting Arial Narrow which is obviously not in the above list.&nbsp; Is Arial Narrow not automatically installed as part of Windows 7?</p>
<p>I have/see Arial Narrow on another PC that has Windows XP Professional installed.&nbsp; And, I have/see Arial Narrow on still another PC that has Windows Vista Business installed.&nbsp; Was Arial Narrow installed as part of these earlier versions of Windows?&nbsp; Or,
 was Arial Narrow installed as part of some other application like Microsoft Office which resides on these 2 PC's, but not on the Windows 7 PC?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or insight anyone might provide.</p>

    <title>Wireless mouse is not working after I switched the dongle location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farting santa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless mouse is not working after I switched the dongle location</h2>
                    Hi, I've been using a Speedlink wireless mouse for several months with no problems, however recently I've had to switch the location of my the usb dongle / receiver which the mouse uses to a usb port on the opposite side of my laptop.<br />
<br />
I assumed the mouse would continue to work fine however since switching the location of the receiver the mouse has stopped working, I've tried switching the receiver back to the original usb port and it still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The mouse has no driver discs as it auto installs.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas what the problem maybe, it'd be great to hear from you.<br />
<br />
Cheers

<p>I assume the 1st thing you tried was pressing the connect button.<br />
<br />
Check mouse batteries - they go at the most inconvenient times. Trust me I know.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Does your USB dongle appear in Control Panel-&gt;Devices and Printers? Is there a yellow ! on it showing a problem.<br />
<br />
Go to Speedlink website and see if there any drivers for your mouse there. Install them.<br />
<br />
If you still have problems post back.</p>

            Hi Jetta48<br />
<br />
I've put some fresh batteries in as I thought that may have been the case. I'm not sure if it is appearing within the Device Manager as under USB the devices are not named they're simply numbered if that makes sense, so I un installed each USB item, and tried
 re installing it, but that didn't work either. + no yellow / problems<br />
<br />
As for speedlink i went on the website and found my mouse the "Whizz" and there's no drivers, as it doesn't require them, it was simply plug and play.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?, I think i may have to restore my pc, which is a ball ache

    <title>Media Player App Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exploitedzebra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Player App Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have been using XB One for around 2 months now, and am having several problems with the Media Player app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The main problem is that is regularly crashes when I am plaing music from a 1 TB External Drive. If I open the media player, select the music folder and press "Play All" this will almost certainly crash after a few songs, displaying "Media player has
 encountered an error". At this point I have no control so I cannot submit the error, or close the error dialogue, but can only Go Home, quit the app and start again - needless to say this makes using the Media Player app for playing music at my house pretty
 useless. If I first select a specific album, then "play all" there is no problem, so it seems to be an issue of playing a large collection (maybe 50 GB of music).</p>
<p>2. The second problem is that whether playing lots of music or just a single album, the player regularly freezes for around 15 seconds in the middle of song. A song is playing, then just stops (but the screen displays that nothnig has changed, just no audio
 comes from the speakers). Usually, after around 15 secs this will start again, but sometimes I have to manually Pause and then Play again for it to resume playback.</p>
<p>3. General Comment: I find it very frustrating in this app, that if I press the "back" button while listening to music (possibly by accident), then the app goes back out to the folder menu, and there is no way to resume playing from where I was. Is it likely
 that this app will be updated any time soon to resolve these kind of issues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance, C</p>

            <p>Hey there ExploitedZebra!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the Media Player issue and sincere apologies for the delay!</p>
<p>For issues #1 and #2, there may be a chance that the External HDD is losing it's connection during play. Let's begin by trying these steps here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the menu button on your Xbox One controller and select&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>.</li>
<li>Select&nbsp;<b>Power &amp; startup</b>.</li>
<li>Deselect&nbsp;<b>When Xbox is off, turn off storage</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for #3, I suggest checking out our&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Feedback</a>&nbsp;to see if others have requested this. If so, I recommend showing your support and vote for it, but if you don't see a suggestion similar to yours, I recommend posting it so others can vote. That is the best way for your voice to be heard! :)</p>
<p>If the issue persists after trying those steps, I would then recommend trying a different External HDD and see if the issue persists. Post back and let us know the results! :)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>So I tried your first points regarding problem #1 &amp; #2, and this has definitely made things a little worse. Now when I go into the folder, play all music, select shuffle and let it run, it plays 1 song and then stops. When it stops I have no way to resume
 as pressing play/skip/shuffle again does nothing. I have to exit and come back in.</p>
<p>I will look to put a post on the feedback page you mention, though I feel that I am already giving my feedback here. THe Media Player app released by MS is quite simply terrible, so can you please tell me if there are any plans to update this, with some
 major fixes? This is not just an improvement I would like to see, the app simply does not work properly as intended.

<p>Do you have any update on this? Why is it that MS seem to respond to some of these threads almost immediately, while another I have commented on has not been responded to by MS at all (yet was created on 25th Feb)?</p>

            <p>Hey thanks for trying those steps! For clarification, how many songs does it usually take for issue #1 to occur? If the issue has gotten worse after the steps I have provided, undo the steps and see how long it takes on average for issue #1 to occur. This will help us narrow down the issue further! :)</p>

<p>Hi Mister Beep.</p>
<p>Usually it used to take around 2 to 3 songs before it crashed. After making the change you described it now only plays 1 song then stops completely with no option to start playing again.

            <p>Alright, thanks for the information!</p>
<p>I'd like you to try some very specific troubleshooting steps to further narrow down where the issue lies.</p>
<p>First, let's try reformatting your external HDD by following the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move your media files off of the external HDD so you will not lose them.</li>
<li>Reformat the external HDD to NTFS on a Windows PC.</li>
<li>Move the media files you wish to have back onto the external HDD.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/downloadable-content/uninstall-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall</a>&nbsp;the Media Player app.</li>
<li>Hold the power button on the Xbox One console for 10 seconds, or until the unit fully shuts down.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/downloadable-content/uninstall-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reinstall</a>&nbsp;the Media Player app.</li>
<li>Plug the newly formatted external HDD back into the Xbox One console with a different USB 3.0 cable (if possible) and verify if the issue persists!</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to follow each step in that order! If the issue persists after trying the steps above, the next step will be to try a different USB 3.0 external HDD to see if the issue persists on multiple eternal HDD's.</p>
<p>Try each of those steps above, along with a different external HDD, and post back the results so we can narrow down the issue further and help you get this sorted!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks! :)</span></p>

<p>Hi, first off, thanks for getting in touch. Unfortuantely this is not a very good answer - format you hard drive and start again, or failing that buy a new hard drive?</p>
<p>I have a Transcend 1 GB hard drive, that is formatted with FAT32 as per other threads that say that is the best system for use with XBone.</p>
<p>I do not have 1TB of space anywhere else so will not be able to perform a backup, and am not about to go buy another Hard Drive.</p>
<p>How about MS fix the issue instead?</p>

            <p>Hi Lily BBean, </p>
<p>I see that you get a pop up saying “CAPOSD is missing” at the restart. I will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p>You may download and install CapOSD from this link and check if that helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS029480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS029480</a></p>
<p>Once the installation is done, restart the computer and check the status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p>If the issue persists, then follow the clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.</p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows

<p><b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting,
<b>follow step 3</b> in the article to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3.</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The

    <title>Outlook - Office Professional 2016 - Change Email Password Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evoelise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook - Office Professional 2016 - Change Email Password Not Working</h2>
                    <p>We have recently had to change email passwords with our Yahoo email provider. We know we have the correct new passwords as we can use the web-based mail logins. But we cannot update Outlook to use the new passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the File tab, we select the Account Settings and select the correct account. From the Account Settings dialog that is then shown we select the account and press the Repair... button. We confirm the email account name and select "Let me repair my account
 manually" under the Advanced options drop down and hit the Repair button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the IMAP buttons that are then displayed we can see then edit the password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it never takes the new password entered - it always reverts to the old current (bad) password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c111ab37-fb65-4f6f-b8ff-a5cdabdb4b40?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c111ab37-fb65-4f6f-b8ff-a5cdabdb4b40?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>When we press "Repair" we get the useless message "Something went wrong and Outlook couldn't repair your account". I presume this is because the old incorrect password is still being used, gogin back to the repair form confirms the change of password was
 not done and the old password is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we actually get this to take the new password?</p>

            It is also worth mentioning if we uninstall Outlook and set up the email account from scratch it all works fine. So this proves the email settings and new passwords are fine. But we don't want to do this for all accounts as we lose all the saved data on
 the PCs.

<br />
</span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft community.<br />

From the issue description, I understand that you are getting wifi station ext driver is not digitally signed. I will be glad to assist you on this issue.<br />
</font></font></font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<font>This issue might occur if the drivers are not digitally signed. Make sure that the software has a valid digital signature. You can view the digital signature by clicking the publisher link in the Windows Internet Explorer 10 security dialog box that's
 displayed when you download a file.<br />
<br />
A digital signature is an electronic security mark that can be added to files. It allows you to verify the publisher of a file and helps verify that the file has not changed since it was digitally signed.<br />
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If the file doesn't have a valid digital signature, there's no way for you to be sure that the file is actually from the source it claims to be from, or that it has not been tampered with (possibly by a virus) since
 it was published. It's safer to avoid opening the file unless you know for certain who created it and whether the contents are safe to open.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your response, we&nbsp;apologize for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that,
</span><span>if the power troubleshooter didn’t detect any incorrect settings, then it is possible that the issue is caused by an incompatible or corrupt driver. When the computer goes to sleep mode, Windows
 sends a request to all hardware parts asking to enter sleep mode. But if the driver for a particular hardware part (like a network adapter or graphic card) is corrupt, it might not respond to these requests and may prevent the computer from entering sleep
 mode. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve this, I would suggest you to run Windows update to make sure that you have installed the latest drivers for all the devices.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section ‘To check for updates’ in this article:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezing and frequent crashing with my Alienware M17X R2</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am experiencing frequent freezing and crashes with Windows 10 on my Alienware M17X R2. The crashes happen unexpectedly and the freezing happens when with high usage of the Disk and when initially stating the computer after a crash.<br />
<br />
Looking to try and troubleshoot this issue to find the root cause. Not sure if it is hardware related or if the drivers are causing a lockup. Hardware shows no indications of a failure and has been tested by myself for any errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Here is my last post that directly relates to this issue. The tried suggested solution does not work anymore.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business MAC can not login</h2>
                    <p>We have several iPad Air 2s in our organization.&nbsp; On this particular iPad, I am not able to login. It says 'we can't verify the certificate from the server'. I looked at the Certificate Trust Settings and found 2 certificates;&nbsp; a *.domain.com and inspect.ourdomain.org.
 We should be using the second one. I disabled the first certificate but I am still not able to login. Do i have to delete the first certificate that we are not using? Any other settings I should check?</p>

<p>Hi Herminio,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to install your Root CA Certificate on this device. Please check this following article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2773530/users-can-t-sign-in-to-lync-mobile-on-apple-ios-based-devices-because" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I need gather more information to better understand it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not really familiar with this but I will try to respond to your questions.&nbsp; The Root CA Cert was installed recently by clicking/installing the inspect.companyname.cer file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw, from my original entry, the first cert that I saw was *.exampledomain.com, not *.domain.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do I find out if our Skype for Bus is in the cloud or on premise?</p>
<p>2. I tried it by connecting to our wireless network and to a jetpack</p>
<p>3. version 6.16.13 is what I can see on another iPad right now.&nbsp; The non-working iPad is on another office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks..</p>

            Hi Herminio,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. Based on your description, this problem might be related to the Skype for Business client. In this way, to further look into this problem, please provide us the version of affected iPad’s Skype for Business client. And please confirm
 if you can login to Skype for Business on other devices and clients. Meanwhile, we suggest you try to configure your account in the Skype for Business manually (click advanced options &gt; enter “sipdir.online.lync.com:443” as the Internal and External server).<br />
<br />
Besides, for the question about if the Skype for Business is in the cloud or on premise, you need to contact the admin to get help. And you can contact Apple support to check if there is complicit between two different certifications on the same IOS device.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

            i took out the other cert but still on the same boat. i was going to delete the cert but could not open my gmail to get my cert that I emailed to myself. Found out that I can not even open any website. Tried multiple 'fixes' to no avail.&nbsp;

            Hi Herminio,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. Based on your description, you moved and emailed the certificate related to Skype for Business by Gmail, but now it is disable for you to connect to the network on this IPad. If this is your scenario, for being unable to connect to
 network, as it might be related to your organization network connection policy, we suggest you contact your organization’s IT support for help. Besides, after connecting to the Net successfully, you may need to confirm if deleting the related certificate on
 the IPad is feasible and try to configure your account in the Skype for Business manually by following the suggestion above.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

<p>When you're in My Games &amp; Apps' Ready to Install section, highlight a game and press LB + RB + X.&nbsp; That button combo should show any "hidden" games in My Games &amp; Apps.&nbsp; Not certain if that is your issue, but it's worth a shot checking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I have this happen sometimes as well, and if nothing else works and you can't find a game that you know you own in your Ready to Install list, what I do is I'll just search for it in the Store and you will be able to either Install it or Play it from there.
 Good luck! :)
