<h2>            Windows Validation</h2>
                    How long does it take to validate Windows 7 on a broadband connection??? tried 3x and was still 'trying' to validate my copy of windows 30 minutes later. This all happened while I was trying to create a new windows logon. Had errors signing in so therefore
 did EXACTLY what was said to do with the error message I had and now my computer is now 10x worse! Now I HAVE to validate my copy of windows 7 and now it doesn't even want to do that either. The more I try and fix things as stated by YOUR technicians the worse
 it gets!

            I was trying to create a new user account for my Windows 7 OS. When I attempted this, I received this error message when logging into the newly created account "The user profile service failed the login. User profile cannot be loaded." I looked at the
 the Microsoft FAQS page to find out how to fix it and was told the steps on how to do this. I did these steps and when I logged back into any other account but the administrator account on the Windows 7 PC it would state that my copy of Windows wasn't validated.
 I ended up doing a System Restore to get my computer back to where it was before I received this issue and others associated with the login error I received when creating the account. I am now back to where I started with the login error message and have stopped
 there. Now I do not have the message of windows being validated that problem was fixed after the restore. Now just trying to get the new user account to work.

            I have a similar question - how long should it take for the validation program to run?
<div><br />
<div>My PC/browser have been sat for an hour now on the page saying:&nbsp;</div>
Windows validation in process
This may take a few minutes, do not navigate away from this page
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I'm reluctant to stop it in case it has to run through it all again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason I'm running this is that I've got a black desktop background, the warning message 'Windows 7, Build 7601, this copy of Windows is not genuine'. &nbsp;This has suddenly happened (and is wrong as my copy of Windows 7 was bought from a reputable retailer).</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the response Noel.</p>
<p>I was running the validation in Chrome, but have since tried it in IE9 with the same result - it just sticks on the same 'in process' message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was working up to a separate thread with the results from MGADiag tool, but was hoping that online validation might be enough to clear the problem. &nbsp;Will do that next ...</p>

            <p>My computer is an acer aspire 5253-BZ893 and I have been having issues with it stating that the version of windows that I have is not genuine. I decided after much hassles with my laptop just decided to purchase a new product key. When I follwed the process
 to set up the product key and downloaded the windows updates system it installed it, however, since then it's been having me validate the software system. I started that process at 2pm pst and its now 7:52pm pst and its still validating. It says not to navigate
 away from the page as well. I am wondering if this is a normal length of time for it to validate on a computer, or if I need to do something else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions or could help, I would be very grateful!</p>
<p>

    <title>microphone as line in audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron jacoblampe  say:</h3>
<h2>            microphone as line in audio</h2>
                    I am using a microphone through a <strong>USB </strong>audio interface device (a Steinberg UR 22). As such my system recognizes the microphone input as line-in. This is a problem because I need to be able to enhance the audio, such as is possible with
 mic boosting options etc. However, there are no such options for line-in audio. This is a very expensive set up, but my system reacts to it as a very quiet mono for no reason I can decipher. All attempts to deal with any drivers, updated, troubleshooters and
 settings have so far proven insufficient. Please help.

<h3> michel_mohr  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD on Windows 10, &#34;FPN_LIST_CORRUPT&#34; &#34;DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER&#34;, Wacom tablet.</h2>
                    Hi, I'm having a bunch of trouble on my fresh Windows 10 installation since I started using my Wacom tablet to draw in Photoshop.<br />
If I have my Wacom tablet plugged in and in use, it'll crash about every hour.<br />
For a while it was fine without it being plugged in so I thought I had it narrowed down, but I just had a crash without it plugged in.<br />
<br />
I downloaded BlueScreenView to try to figure out what the problem was, and since one of the errors mentioned 'DRIVER', I figured it was the Wacom tablet driver, but I honestly don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
All the other threads I saw on here, the first question was to post the minidump files, so I'll attach them right away.<br />
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15555199/101115-31546-01.zip<br />
<br />
Is there anyone able to help with this? Microsoft live support couldn't help.<br />
<br />
(fresh install of windows 10, only mouse, keyboard and wacom plugged into usb, drivers updated, windows up to date)<br />
<br />

<p><span><strong><span>Run the</span></strong><strong><span>check disk
</span></strong><strong><span>command for any errors on hard disk by following the steps below:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span><span>Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity
 of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted .</span><strong><span>For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the check disk commands as follows:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong><span><span><span>Press
<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>, then choose <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong> from the context menu.
<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Type in the command prompt </span><strong><span>CHKDSK /X
</span></strong><strong><span>(X is the drive which you want to perform check disk command on)</span></strong></span><span> and press
<strong>ENTER </strong>to scan the disk.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>NOTE:</span></span></strong><span><span>The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule

</p><p>My computer died. It was using Windows 10 (upgrade from Windows 8). I took out the hard drive and put it in a hard drive enclosure. All the data is secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to get the files from the computer via USB. Specifically the stuff from the desktop, documents, and pictures. But I cannot find out exactly where they are. When I click on the user icon and then Wilson, nothing shows up (empty folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter the DOS shell I go to F:\users\wilson\pictures and it comes back as access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to get access to the files?</p>

<div>No. Why not just keep Outlook open (I do, for that and other reasons)?</div>
<div>If you are worried about the resources it will use, be aware that a</div>

<h2>            Convert Child Account to Adult Account</h2>
                    
<p>I am having difficulty converting my son's "child" account to an adult account.&nbsp; I have logged in and made adjustments tot he permissions on the account however when attempting to purchase anything rated M&nbsp;in the store, most recent attempt being Dawnguard
 DLC for Skyrim, I get an error message that says this purchase is not allowed for Child or Teen accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has also been frustrating on the Free Games for Gold promotion since he has been unable to get any of the free games for his gold subscription.</p>
<p>His account is attached this this account under a different email address.&nbsp; I honestly don't care at all about keeping this account since I have my own separate Live account.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
It's not possible to convert a child account to an adult account before the age of 18. The settings you're changing are privacy and online settings. Titles that are marked as Not Rated or M (mature) cannot be purchased by the child. You can purchase them on
 an adult account on the same Xbox 360 console and the child will have access to that content as well on that same console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So there is no point to XBox's child limitations if you can play the game with the child account. I am trying to allow my kids to broadcast a twitch feed, but I can't get access to change the permissions for their account. Even when I include him in my family,
 and set his settings, in his settings they show the opposite!?!? This Child account control is complete garbage, and XBox has no business telling me how I can allow my child to access or display information! If I had known any of this I would have just set
 up the account as an adult. As it is now, he has to wipe out his gamerscore and achievements and start over!? This is RIDICULOUS and OVERCONTROLLING [Mod Removed]!</p>

<p>I'm right there with you. I regret ever setting my son up with a child account. One of the perks of Gold is the Games With Gold selection. This month's 360 game is rated E and yet we are still not able to download it. This is garbage. I purposefully put
 the Gold account onto his gamertag because I don't play online and we still have a 360 as well as an Xbox One and with the 360, every person who wants to play online has to have their own Gold sub. So, from what I understand, I would have to pay another $60
 to convert my account to Gold just to be able to download the Games with Gold games for him to play. Is that correct?</p>

<p>O padrão no Brasil é NTSC. PAL é padrão na Europa. O meu Mass Effect 2 é PAL e o meu Xbox é NTSC, mas como ele é region free, ele roda no meu Xbox. Jogos region free rodam em qualquer Xbox, independente do lugar.</p>

 na DLC , mas eu ainda estou muito indeciso queria uma confirmação se vc descobriu mai alguma coisa posta aqui mano vlw</p>

            Just a brief follow up.....being that I no longer had any resore points, I manually stopped the service and restarted, by clicking "start" button, typing "services"/hit "enter", goto "superfetch", click "stop", then click "start". This appears to have
 worked because i have not gotten any more "Superfetch - Stopped Working" errors........Thanks again for taking the time to assist.......Respectfully, Billy ganoe

                    Hi I been getting this error message "msvcr100.dll is missing". It appears whenever I'm launching up After Effects (After Effects launches and performs normally) however I am unable to launch my Steam games such as "Hearts of Iron 4" when this error message
 appears.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried downloading the version from Microsoft however my laptop doesn't seem to install it. I notice there are a lot&nbsp;versions of microsoft visual c++ if so do I need to remove all versions and install just one from microsoft? Or just delete same year version
 from the lists of many?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you

    <title>AMD Display drivers issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faradaynwonu  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD Display drivers issues</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am using a HP Pavilion laptop.<br />
Model: dv3 - 4048TX<br />
Display adapters are: Intel(R) HD Graphics and AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series.<br />
<br />
I just upgraded it from Windows 7 to Window 8.1 Pro N (64-bit)<br />
after the upgrade, the display drivers updated themselves when I connected to Internet and some features like the brightness buttons started working.<br />
I restarted the PC, but it failed to restart on several attempts and I am prompted to restore it. After successfully restoring to previous state, it boots/restarts successfully.<br />
<br />
I discovered that the problem is from the AMD graphics driver and downloaded the latest AMD driver software from AMD website.<br />
I also uninstalled the AMD graphics driver and tried to install the downloaded one but it fails.<br />
<br />
1. Half way on installing the AMD graphics driver, the screen flickers and finally the PC goes off.<br />
2. On several attempts to restart, it fails until I restore it.<br />
<br />
Please help me on what to do to successfully install the AMD Graphics drivers to have the system work well with the connected features and also have the system boot or restart successfully.<br />
<br />
I have tried these actions listed below,&nbsp; but it's still fails:<br />
1. I have installed all the available recommended and optional updates for the windows<br />
2. I tried disabling the antivirus and finally uninstalled it.<br />
3. I turned the windows firewall off<br />
4. I used the "Intel Driver Update Utility" from Intel website, and it detected and tried to update the Chipset, but the status also indicates that it failed to install.<br />
<br />
I really need help on this issue please.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            I have just purchased a new Lenovo PC with Windows 8 Pro installed. Can't get on with it at all, find it most unhelpful and counter-intuitive and incompatible with most of my favourite programs. I would like to revert to XP as used on my previous computer.
 Is this possible? I believe from the licensing info that downgrade rights exist but the only copy of XP I have was supplied with my previous computer (an HP) and states that it can only be used on an HP unit. What can I do? Do I need to purchase a copy of
 XP? Is it still available? Will the hardware in my new PC be compatible?<br />
Many thanks<br />
Peter Heaps<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a power outage this afternoon and returned to find our computer on with our task bar and ll all icons missing. &nbsp;We can only access our files in Safe Mode and cannot get the computer to return to normal operating mode. &nbsp;When it scans it reports no
 issues or error messages. &nbsp;This happened last year and we took it to a computer shop for them to clean up. &nbsp;I am hoping to avoid a $150 bill this time. &nbsp;What should we do?

</p><p>The above might have occurred if the latest updates for your graphic drivers may have been released or if the computer cannot detect it. However to resort the issue, lets try uninstall the driver and install the latest one from your computer manufacturer
 website. To learn how to do so, refer to the section <strong>How to find and download drivers from the manufacturers website:

<p>It's probably not your headset. It's probably your network connections. I'd head over to the network connections forum and the skilled people who know tons about network connections can help you there.</p>

            <p>I have had similar problems with my 5537 ever since its purchase. Dell finally took the laptop away for their techies to have a go</p>
<p>I purchased a Dell Inspiron 15R 5537 with the AMD Radeon HD 8670M in July 2014 and have had continuous problems with this machine ever since.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The first problem was when switching on or awaking after hibernation and the machine always came up with an error message VIDEO DXGKRNL FATAL ERROR, after Dell taking over remote control of the laptop the error seemed to be ok until all i got was a black screen
 the eventually sent an engineer out to replace the motherboard (I was convinced that it was a software conflict error and not hardware), however all this did was restarted the blue screen Video error once again. I eventually carried out a re-install of Windows
 8.1 as again the screen went blank and the machine would not start until i carried out the install which resulted in me loosing all my old important files but at least the laptop was working again.<br />
<br />
However once again i have found further issues now i cannot get files to transfer from my tablet or phone via Bluetooth to my laptop. Dell once again took remote control of the machine and then told me it was a software issue and my warranty did not cover this
 problem. but once again I have the blue screen Video error whenever i first switch the laptop on and still have problems with the pointer moving around the screen when i am typing This is very frustrating, I have never had a computer with these problems before
 and am very dissatisfied with Dell over this matter, but what made it worse was the telephone conversation I had yesterday with a Technical Manager who explained that my warranty does not cover software issue as the software since receiving my laptop had changed.
 i pointed out that the only changes were carried out by their own engineers but this seems to be irrelevant.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I asked for a refund and return the laptop to which he refused saying I only had seven days from deliver to make this return, I pointed out that my first complaint about the laptop was actually within the seven day period and i would now contact the relevant
 regulating authorities to see what legal action i can take to either get the machine repaired or a refund.<br />
<br />
They are coming to collect the machine carry out a full factory restore which he claims will solve the problem. Incidentally often the machine screen just keeps moving up and down as i look through pages and is happening even as I type this&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no faith that this will work but wondered if anybody else has had these problems and if so what did they do to resolve them?<br />
<br />
My laptop came back yesterday with a note telling me that the Hard drive had now been changed as it was faulty, guess what when I switched it on I had the same fatal error blue screen.</p>
<p>This particular laptop is utter rubbish and they have finally agreed to refund me my money as they cannot solve their software issues.
</p>
<p>I will never purchase another Dell product as they cannot be honest and admit they have issues with this particular configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT</p>

<p>Hey guys, I've been getting this error code ever since yesterday afternoon. I was able to sign into my Xbox 360 account just fine yesterday morning but in the afternoon, I could not get on at all. It keeps telling me to please try again later, and when I
 contact support, they were unable to do anything about it. I was wondering if anyone has any solutions? This is really upsetting, I can't play any of my games unless I am signed into Xbox Live.</p>

<p>hey goldenvixen45 </p>
<p>sorry to hear you are having this issue. As far as I know I have never heard of this error code. however I know it has something to do with the update. so I recommend you delete the update and re download it.
</p>
<p>to delete the update</p>
<p>1. Go to Settings</p>
<p>2. System</p>
<p>3. Storage</p>
<p>once you see all your storage devices you will press on your controller LB, RB, X, LB, RB, X.
</p>
<p>it should then pop up an option to delete update once you delete it the Xbox will restart and of course prompt you to download the new update.
</p>
<p>once you download the new update try signing in again and see if you are able to sign in with no issues.
</p>
<p>if issue still persist contact support once again and ask to have your case escalated, tell them everything you did in detail so that the escalation team can know what to do next.
</p>
<p>hope this helps :)</p>

<p>I've done all of that, even went to Microsoft support and they haven't been able to fix it. At all. Even the advocacy team. They defer me to Windows support and Windows support couldn't do anything because it's an Xbox issue. It's getting really frustrating
 and like what the person said before you, this didn't start until the new update. At this point, I'm wondering if I can just make a new account and transfer all of my dlcs and games I bought on my previous one. I really don't see anyway of getting back on
 my profile again...</p>

<p>If you wish to access your save files, but can't get into your profile, I discovered if you delete the update like ninja081686 suggest, it forces your xbox to stay offline and you can access your profile offline, there for your save files. Just don't redownload
 the update, unless you want to try logging on again. I also discover if you buy dlcs here on the main site and add them to queue for your xbox to download, and then attempting to sign in onto your xbox, you can download the dlcs or games so long as you leave
 the box with the Code:8007007A up. For some reason, I'm logged in when the box is up so I am able to download things still, until I get rid of the error code box and then it signs me off. This doesn't fix anything, but it help copes and allows me to play my
 new Christmas games and dlcs until someone figures out how to fix this problem.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<ul>
<li>What is the complete error message do you receive? </li><li>How long you have been facing this issue? </li><li>What were the changes made before the issue occurred?</li></ul>
<p>You may refer these methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would recommend you to perform clean boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials and check for the issue.</p>
