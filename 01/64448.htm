<h2>            &#92;showplaces shows unkown endpoints</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been noticing my Skype to be a bit laggy, so I checked my endpoints with "/showplaces". I tried it on my android device, iOS and Windows. I can see my own devices appear by logging in and see them disappear by logging out, but there are two diveces
 that seem to be logged in permanently that I have no control over whatsoever. Skype Shows me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>undefined:23/12.1813.286.0/SkypeUWP/- isActive: false, Subs: 0 PushNotification Unkown ID:[object Object]</p>
<p>iPad:1445/8.30.0.50/SkypeX - isActive: false, Subs: 20:PushNotification&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does this mean there are an undefined device and an iPad connected to my skypeaccount that don't belong to me?</p>
<p>Could this simply be an error, does that happen? Or is it certain that someone hacked my account and is permantly logged in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am really worried about this, trank you for any help!</p>

</p><p>We cannot confirm whether there are devices where your Skype account is signed in, but we suggest you to reset your password to make sure that no one else is using your Skype account. Here is the FAQ link:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the Reply! I've changed my passowrd now and tried "/showplaces" again,&nbsp;unfortunately the two devices in question are still there. Does this lean itself more towards an error or actually real devices? If there was someone connected to my account,
 is there any way to find out their Ip?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still hope these are just some old devices still beeing shown as connected, does that happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<h2>            how do i file a formal complaint and speak to someone in charge&#63;</h2>
                    I recently ordered a surface pro 3. Microsoft does not require signatures via ups and the package was "left" at my front door. three weeks later I am still dealing with this. I am out 1500 bucks and am not getting help anywhere. If you call the 1800 number
 they can not connect you with anyone who can help because they aren't given the number to someone who knows what to do. I have been getting emails from a guy and he only reads select emails and only replies to what he feels like replying to. i have told him
 i want a refund and he keeps saying i will be in touch when we can ship out a replacement. he also tried to tell me that ups does not allow for signature required. which is a lie. ups allows for signatures and a signature from a person 21 and older. I have
 never been more upset than I am right now. I have talked to a few other people and they all say that this is pretty typical and that I should realize i am just out 1500 dollars! I want to make a complaint. i want a refund.&nbsp;

            i ordered the product from microsoft. I contacted you guys. I even called your 1800 number and i get the same run around you just gave me. This is the worst service I have ever received. HANDS DOWN. What is wrong with microsoft?? I strongly advise no one
 to buy from microsoft. I should have listened to everyone who said by a macbook air. Now I can not because microsoft is in the process of ripping me off.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Claire_Hs,<br />
<br />
I am having a very similar and extremely frustrating experience with the Microsoft Store Online.&nbsp; I have ordered and PAID FOR a Surface Pro 3 and key cover on 13 Feb. Microsoft Store says it shipped on the 16th of Feb.&nbsp; UPS has not yet received the package
 to delivery.&nbsp; I have called Microsoft Store Support 3 times, and have spoken to 3 agents and a supervisor.&nbsp; My order still has not shipped.&nbsp; I have been told it has been escalated - but I have yet to be contacted by the escalation team.&nbsp; can you pleae also
 send me a private message with suggestions on how to proceed.&nbsp; I am about to call VISA and go through the dispute process to deny the charge.&nbsp; I'd rather get my Surface Pro 3 in my hands.&nbsp; Worst retail experience ever.<br />
<br />
kind regards,</p>

            First we need to make sure the mail app is working.
<br />Go to the search bar and type mail.
<br />If you see it Right click the mail app and select pin to start.

            thank you SarahKong. I can see the option but when I chose it it says it is already installed (which makes sense), but the option to pin to start is greyed out and I cant chose it. So clearly the mail thing is on the computer it has just been moved or
 disappeared. Only occurred after Microsoft forced yet another upgrade on my computer!

            Thank you. The Shell option didn't work but the CCcleaner one appeared to, so it was uninstalled and I reinstalled it. I now have it as an option on my startup thing but cant seem to remember how to get my emails synced to it. clicking on the newly reappeared
 logo it just takes me to the microsoft store. I just don't get it!

            thank you, when I logged in today, the pinned mail icon has disappeared again. but it says it is downloaded, I still just have lost it again. On my settings, my email account is already set up so I cant add an account. I'm just going round in circles now
 and clearly it just isn't going to work anymore. Thank you for your help though.

            i can not open the email app at all. I can find it on the startup search bit but it says it s already installed. it has re-disappeared from the 'recently added' apps. I have a call in with Microsoft but seem to only get through to the US helpdesk not the
 british one. It is most annoying that it has just simply disappeared.

<p>Windows 7__Monitor sound not working__computer__sound__monitor__</p>
<p>My sound is not working with my new monitor.</p>
<p>I threw away my old one because of old graphics, but the sound actually worked on that one.</p>
<p>For some reason when I got my new monitor, the sound stopped working and it has built-in speakers also.</p>
<p>I don't get any error messages saying any problems, but sound is just not coming out.</p>
<p>There is a small hole in the back of my monitor and says "Audio" similar to the headphones input, but that</p>
<p>wire was not included with the package, so I am wondering whats going wrong.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP ME OUT!!</p>

<p>Hello gamer friend,</p>
<p>the problem you are experiencing regards corrupted files left in your system. To solve this issue first you should clear your Marketplace system cache from the temporary data and impeding updates:<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Settings, and then select System.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select Storage, and then select your primary storage device.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select System Items.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select Marketplace System Data.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select Delete.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Restart your console<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>After this you should clear your console's system cache:<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to settings and select System Settings.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Media Player vs VLC vs Videos&#38;Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerome adrien  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Player vs VLC vs Videos&#38;Music</h2>
                    <p>hi. <br />
my pc is running on windows 8.1 and i have certain apps that can play different video/music formats. I have
<em>Windows Media Player, Lenovo PowerDVD,</em> and the windows <em>Videos</em> and
<em>Music</em> app.</p>
<p>And i think it would be better if i would just have one or maybe two player for playing videos and music files.</p>
<p>i am also thinking of installing <em>VLC player for windows 8</em>&nbsp;from the windows store because i've heard that it could play almost all formats of videos.</p>
<p>So, what i wopuld like to do is that, <strong>i will uninstall Windows media player and Lenovo PowerDVD, and install VLC from Windows Store. (Also, i think i'll just keep windows Videos and Music app)</strong><br />
what could you recommend? or if&nbsp;i will uninstall WMP and PowerDVD, is there any removal tool for these apps?just to make sure they don't leave any remnants</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot completely uninstall Windows Media Player form Windows. It’s a part of Windows feature. However you can try turning off the Windows Media Player from Turn Windows Feature on or off. Follow these steps to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Appwiz.cpl</strong> and press enter.</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong>Turn Windows Feature on or off</strong>”</span></li><li><span>Navigate to <strong>Media Features</strong> and uncheck <strong>Windows Media Player.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>To remove Power DVD or any other third party software refer this Microsoft article:</span></p>

<p>With the Windows Media Creation Tool as I have helped&nbsp;support many Windows installations (&gt; 2,500,000 views on my guides)&nbsp;I've noticed the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users do not know what version of Windows they have, the distinction between Pro is easy due to the sticker but the distinction between Core, Single Language and Windows 8.1 with Bing is less clear. I have given instructions for determining the version,
 if the users previous install is up and running but this won't help users who are reinstalling Windows due to it not booting or due to hard drive failure.</li><li>There is no .iso for Windows 8.1 with Bing. These users too need a means of reinstallation.</li><li>There is no direct download link to the .iso, this makes Apple&nbsp;bootcamp and installations from Linux difficult.</li></ul>
<p>Thus having direct download links would help (aswell as the media creation tool which works quite nicely and checks the .iso).
</p>
<p>We need the .iso of Windows 8.1 with Bing.</p>
<p>I would rather one .iso for all versions which would save the user from a lot of confusion when deciding what .iso to select&nbsp;and an official Microsoft&nbsp;utility one can use to make a bootable USB to check what version of Windows their BIOS has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Vista was the best for this in the fact that the installation DVD could install all Vista versions, unfortunately its very obsolete and hard to construct the .iso from the 3 setup files. Windows 7 was also an example but&nbsp;to a lesser extent as the
 .iso had the annoying ei.cfg file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please leave feedback if you have experienced any of these problems or found workarounds for them - my current recommendation is downloading all .isos of your language and going by trial and error.</strong></p>

            <p>I am using Windows Single Language with Bing with came with a lot of boltwares. I need a means of reinstallation. What if my recovery media gets corrupted. The OEM's are taking too much advantage over this. They charge 2000 INR for the recovery disk. ( The
 laptop itself is 20000 INR). Also the recovery disks too contain such boltwares. Most of them trial versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have also turned off Windows defender and it cannot be turned on again. Atleast provide a way to download he .iso files using our serial keys.</p>

            <p>I'd just like to echo this request. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought an Acer desktop PC preinstalled with Windows 8.1 with Bing. Since nearly every computer comes with bloatware I routinely perform a clean install so they run faster and use less disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My initial research indicated there was no significant difference in between Windows 8.1 and the ...with Bing version. But after performing a clean install of Windows 8.1 Core I cannot activate with the key provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an avid user of Microsoft products and am happy to be locked into Bing, but PLEASE provide an .iso of Windows 8.1 with Bing so I can install it clean.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting us know that there are multiple editions of Bing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8.1 with Bing</li><li>Windows 8.1SL with Bing</li></ul>
<p>Hopefully Microsoft update the downloader to support these.</p>

<p>First, the play and charge kit (USB) will not turn an Xbox 360 wireless controller into a wired controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your options are either to buy the USB wireless receiver for Windows: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or to buy a purely wired Xbox 360 controller. If you're going to buy a new one I would suggest an Xbox one controller, as well, as the newer ones have bluetooth and also can use a micro-USB cable (most android devices from a couple years ago use this same
 cable) to make it a wired controller.</p>

 to connecting via the AV cable but don't have that option with the new console. From the bit of searching I've done this seems to be a common issue with Lg tvs not cognising xbox via hdmi. Just wondering if anyone has found a solution as I have a very devastated
 little boy this morning and to be honest am ready to scream at LG if it wasn't Christmas and they were open

<br />Right click your start button and select Powershell(admin) or Command Prompt (admin) 
<br />Type the following hitting enter after each line. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old

            Hi TeaRex, With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h3> ghisirds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Player gom</h2>
                    Hi all, <br />
I have the problem that I can't save the position of the asf video that I have seen until now with Gom Media Player: when I open a very big asf, even if&nbsp; it is on the PC hard disk, it is like opening a buffer that prevent the vision from the point where i left
 the video. <br />
With Avi or Mpg I haven't this problem; I don't see this buffer effect. <br />
Does anyone of you know how to modifiy the asf file to avoid the buffer effect? Or how to convert it to .avi without quality loss and limitated dimension?<br />
Or, more simply, does a Gom player setting exists to avoid this problem? <br />
Thank all of you <br />
<br />

                    <p>So I am trying to find a file. So I open the file explorer. I can't screenshot what is happening cause my computer basically freezes but my cursor and apps still run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after I open the file explorer, I get a buffering cursor. My apps and cursor still work. But I can't click anything. &nbsp;I try clicking something on my taskbar. It doesn't react. I try clicking the file explorer window to make it give me the not responding
 popup. Still nothing. Then for a quick second my screen goes to my desktop. My desktop flashes blue and my taskbar goes empty. This happens for a second. Then everything is normal again. I try restarting my computer and opening the file explorer. Still the
 same problem. I tried&nbsp;opening the file explorer from the start menu and I also tried shortcuts. And I still had the same problem.</p>

            After the scan finished the scan didn't find any integrity violations. Does any of this have to do with my drivers? Because this happened right after I updated my Geforce Experience drivers. I tried reinstalling the drivers but I would still get the same
 problem.

            <p>Thank you for the update, Bobby.<br />
<br />
Since running the SFC scan tool wasn't able to fix the issue, we recommend that you proceed with running the DISM tool&nbsp;to scan the image for component store corruption, perform repair operations automatically, and records that corruption to the log file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this wiki article for the steps on how to perform:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">System file check
 (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM to fix things SFC cannot</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, <span>if a driver that you recently updated is causing system crashes or instability, and if Windows was operating correctly before that change, you can refer to this support article to roll back a driver and for the steps on:

<h2>            can&#39;t reinstall .net 3.5 Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I see in the "answers archive"&nbsp;that this generated numerous issues starting in 2010. But what I have not seen is how it was resolved.&nbsp;I have Windows 7 Pro 64x. I use sharpdevelop 3.2&nbsp;to develop with. I wanted to deploy the product to the customer as a ".msi".
 I decided to use Wix since it is recommended by MS. I noticed that sharpdevelop is no longer providing bug fixes for Version 3.2 so I decided to install sharpdevelop 4.2 which (strongly recommends Windows SDK 7 for Windows 7 with .net framework&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>Long story decided that was too much to soon since I do not seem to be able to get sharpdevelop 4.2, .net 4.5, and Wix 3.6 all working properly to generate a nice ".msi" package for my customer.</p>
<p>Since I uninstalled sharpdevelop and .net 3.5 and Windows SDK 7.1 which is WHAT I'VE DONE FOR YEARS!!!!! to start with a clean slate...</p>
<p>PLEASE, do me a favor and do not tell me that .net 3.5 is part of Windows 7 and you do not need to uninstall/install it, or that I can't uninstall/install it because frankly it is not helpful and after 2.5 days of time loss it is smart alecky. I am not the
 only one that this has caused huge issues with and I have exhausted all my troubleshooting capabilities and I am really frustrated at this point. Please, please, take into account that I while I am not a guru with windows I have done this professionally for
 a while and I have been trying to fix this for 2.5 days and if u really have no knowledge of exactly what I need to do, because you had the same experience and have already fixed it. Then do not reply.</p>
<p>The only real question is if we should not of uninstalled .net 3.5 then why does Windows 7 not prevent us from doing so?</p>

            <p>There are some good "related threads" to the right... BUT, However, this was so easy I was making it difficult... I noticed quite a few threads said just run "windows updates" and then see if its fixed... Well, I clicked on "restore hidden updates" and found
 an update for .net 4 client profile which I had installed previously... I installed it after restoring it from being hidden. Then there were about 8 more updates that followed...</p>
<p>I can now install and run sharpdevelop again and .net 3.5 all the way&nbsp;down to .net 2.0&nbsp;is available. The only indication I had that .net 3.5&nbsp;is available, was that sharpdevelop installed properly this time and it was&nbsp;in the dropdown menu when choosing a
 "Target Framework".</p>
<p>.net 3.5&nbsp;will not be shown as installed, the only thing you will see in Programs and Features is .net Framework 4 Client Profile and .net Framework&nbsp;4 Extended.</p>

    <title>Audio Stuttering&#47;Glitching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budgynana  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Stuttering&#47;Glitching</h2>
                    <p>I have a frustrating problem with my new Win10 Kaby Lake build and random sound glitches. As this is a new system with new components and all the latest drivers this really shouldn't be happening. Please bare with me as I describe what's going on.<br />
<br />
Whilst using the PC to watch/listen to media there are occasional stutters/pops/glitches with the sound - this isn't the worst part. They are completely random and I can't seem to induce it. Sometimes I'm actively working, browsing online, or I can be running
 media fullscreen and not doing anything else - all other apps closed. This can be with media that's streamed, i.e. coming from the network, on local drives, or via a TV tuner card. On other occasions the sound problems will start and then continue rhythmically
 - in a warbling way, like being underwater - until I intervene. This happens system wide so when it starts, it affects every sound playing at that time. The way I have to fix this is by going into the device's properties, and changing the "Default Format"
 to anything but the current setting. So far, no matter the setting that this is left at, this glitching still randomly occurs and has to be kicked by changing the default format and, by default, the only options available to me are 1 or 2 channel, 16 or 24
 bit, 48000Hz, DVD or Studio Quality - others become available if I change the Focusrite elsewhere. Changing from say DVD to Studio instantly stops the warble, like it's restarting the audio system.
<br />
<br />
Currently I'm on a fresh install of the Creators Update, using a i5-7600K on an Asus TUF Z270 Mark 1. I'm not using the onboard sound card, I'm using a Focusrite Scarlett Solo (external USB) and have disabled all other sound devices - e.g. the NVIDIA outputs.
 My previous build, with the Anniversary Update, and a Gigabyte GA-Z270A-Gaming K5 motherboard experienced the exact same problems with both the onboard Realtek sound card and the Focusrite - this was part of the reason I naively got the Focusrite in the first
 place, and then subsequently switched to the Asus.<br />
<br />
I've been researching this and others with stuttering seem to have problems related to Realtek drivers, wireless network adapters, Intel NIC's, or something else. I don't believe these apply as a) I haven't used the Realtek hardware since my first problems
 with the Gigabyte, b) I don't a wireless adapter, c) the Gigabyte had a Killer NIC and not Intel NIC.<br />
<br />
I'm currently running LatencyMon and ISR and DPC counts for Wdf01000.sys, dxgkrnl.sys and ACPI.sys are constantly going up. I have tried disabling both NIC's on this Asus motherboard and no dice, the counts still go up.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have a clue what's going on? Or have an idea of a fix? This is incredibly annoying and is making me wish I never bothered building a new system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the issue further, give more details by answering the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your PC?</li><li>Is it possible to use a wired connection? Check and monitor results afterwards.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly inform us of the status of your concern so we can assist you further.</p>

            <p>This/these are completely fresh installations so the registry is fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are completely up to date.&nbsp; Whether or not they are stable is another matter, but they are compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No make/model as such.&nbsp; Completely self built, and symptoms exist on both Gigabyte GA-Z270A-Gaming K5 and Asus TUF Z270 Mark 1 motherboards.&nbsp; Common items include Corsair RM650x PSU, 7600K CPU, MSI GTX 1060 Gaming X3 GPU, Focusrite Scarlett Solo USB soundcard,
 etc.</p>
<p>

            <p>Identical issue here with me, except I have an Asus Z170-A mobo.</p>
<p>I just purchased an Asus ROG STRIX Z270 mobo and it comes tomorrow. I will see if it's a motherboard problem, or some sort of grounding issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the audio distortion occurs when high CPU usage. Try running Prime95 and then playing something on youtube and you will notice that audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes even with less cpu usage, 50% or so, will cause that issue with DPC latency being high. So far I have no clue how to fix it, and I'm about to see if a new mobo even does it.</p>

            <p>Driver Verifier seems beyond the realms of what most end users should be expected to do but if this problem persists I will give it a go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have now changed motherboards, Gigabyte GA-Z270X-Gaming 7, and after I've tested it for stability I'll be back to seeing if the problem occurs. &nbsp;Hopefully it doesn't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it easier for people to track, this would be my 4th motherboard and I'm working with fresh installations and the latest drivers every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand, and accept, if this is when the system is overloaded and out of resources, but it's not. &nbsp;I'm running with 32GB ram and this occurs when I don't have anything else running. &nbsp;It's just plain bizarre!</p>

            <p>I'm sure it won't happen. Unless there's some weird grounding issue with the mobo/case/psu or something very very odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's just some bad mobo. My ROG Strix comes in today, I'll swap everything out, and immediately test for that.</p>

<h2>            BSOD Increasing Frequency-Next Steps&#63;</h2>
                    Greetings,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've read through a number of threads dealing with the BSOD, but I've not yet found a solution that will work for me. &nbsp;One BSOD a day has increased to several in one use of my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's a link to my mini dumps on SkyDrive (assuming I did this correctly): &nbsp;https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=502C944A89812111!107</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also run the memory test, which was clean just this afternoon.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have DriverView installed but am unclear how and what would be needed uploaded to SkyDrive?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is my second computer build. &nbsp;The first is still running flawlessly, but the second has become problematic. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Symantec Endpoint is the virus software. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What else can I tell you that might help diagnose the problem(s)?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I'll try to answer your questions as best I can and in the order presented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The crashes do seem to occur when using browsers; that includes Chrome, Firefox and Windows IE. It rarely occurs when in specific applications, such as&nbsp;games (Heart of the Swarm, SimCity, etc.). Often the browsers themselves crash.&nbsp;&nbsp; One application that
 will crash fairly regularly&nbsp;is Mozilla Thunderbird. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The only major change to the computer that I can think of was replacing a failed hard drive when the second WD failed early last Fall, but the bsod's have been more recent.&nbsp; I also added a digital camcorder and the supporting software.&nbsp; If you also mean
 software there have been several games added via Steam and individually.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try to keep all drivers up to date using Windows Update and specific publishers support pages.&nbsp; I will say that problems increased dramatically when Adobe started rolling out all the new security patches for Flash.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've followed some of these with no positive results, but will attempt to do so again.&nbsp; I have run the RAM memory test and there were no reported problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For what it's worth I ran all day yesterday without a bsod, while the day before there were 3 in the space of one hour?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for&nbsp;the help.</p>

<h2>            SSD Migration windows 8.1, &#34;Windows cannot access specified file, path, etc.&#34; error</h2>
                    <p>Greeting Greetings friends!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question that I think isn't terribly complicated, but I can't for the life of me figure it out. (I've got an Asus s550cm, i7, 8gb). I migrated the 1 Tb HDD to an SSD with the intention of my OS and frequently used programs installed on the SSD.
 I then removed my optical drive since I never use it, and replaced with with an HD caddy containing my 1 tb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the swap everything worked peachy, except when i run random tools from the search bar (Disk partition tool, device manager, etc.) I get an error "Windows cannot access specified file path....blah blah" and the file path is to my OLD HDD (e.g. the file
 path is E:\ for the different tools, not C:\ like it should be).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: I migrated my HDD to an SSD, and used the old HDD as a secondary drive, but windows is still looking in the HDD for the windows tools found in "windows immersive control panel"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for reading, and if you have any questions or answers I'd be super stoked!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error message can be related to files like svchost.exe, regsvr.exe, spoolsv32.exe, taskmgr.exe, sys.exe, rundll.exe, explorer.exe, csrss.exe, winupdate.exe or even any .exe program file of a software you may have installed on your Windows computer.</p>
<p>Maybe these system files have got corrupted due to&nbsp;malicious infections&nbsp;and maybe&nbsp;your antivirus may have deleted the system file because your PC was infected by one of the malicious programs – the reasons could be many. If its a system file that is creating
 a problem, running the System File Checker might be good idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a few troubleshooting steps you may try to fix the error. But you will have to first ensure that the file is not on a location that is&nbsp; currently accessible, like maybe a network location or an external drive that is not currently connected to the
 PC, etc. Also check that the file has been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1] Check if you have<strong> permissions</strong> to open the file. If required Run as administrator and see if it helps. Else you may have to

<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-3-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="ultimate windows tweaker windows 8">
<p>2] If it is a <strong>shortcut</strong> that you are clicking on to open the file, you may want to check if the target file&nbsp;is still located at the destination. If yes, then maybe the shortcut itself may have got corrupted. Delete it and create a new shortcut.</p>
<p>3] If the file has been downloaded from the Internet, right click on the file and open Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under General tab, towards the bottom you will see classified under Security : This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Unblock</strong>. Click Apply &gt; OK. This should help.</p>
<p>4] You may also want to check if you <strong>antivirus software</strong> is blocking the file for some reasons. If you are convinced that the file is safe, temporarily disable your security software and then try to open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Hope something helps you!</em></p>

<h2>            problem getting Skype on to a Samung Galaxy 3 tablet</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, although I have plenty of Skype credit a'phoning landline and mobile numbers in the UK&nbsp; and Australia only resulted in the screen on my Galaxy S3 table showing "connecting", only to drop out without actually making contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet if I used Skype from my smart phone I was able to get through.&nbsp; So I uninstalled Skyp and, according to Google Play, have reinstalled it on my tablet - only it isn't listed in the "Applications Manager" and neither is there a Skype icon on the tablet.&nbsp;
 Any advice much appreciated.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />
<br />I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />Sometimes there are glitches in the installation / update process that don't pop up an error message so we end up thinking the installation is all ok when it not the case, which can cause strange behaviors as the one you describe.
<br />
<br />May I suggest that you uninstall Skype (from the play store), restart your device, re-install Skype and try again? 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

<p>Howdy Maggie, from gone midnight in a decidedly wet Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of further info: After I discovered a few days ago that I could no long make calls from my Samsung Galaxy 3 tablet (but could from my Huawei&nbsp; smart phone) I uninstalled Skype and tried to reinstall it via the Skype web site, which directed me to Google
 Play Store.&nbsp; I duly did all that was asked, but when the Skype app didn't appear on the tablet, tried the same route again - only for the Google page to tell me that Skype was "installed".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it doesn't show up on the list of apps under Applications Manager, so something ain't right. And because I don't have or can't find it on the tablet, I can't uninstall it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be me, as I am 107 next birthday (well, that's how 70 feels when technology does weird stuff) and very, very far from being tech savvy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if this helps you help me then that would be great.&nbsp; Failing which I could do with an averagely bright 4 or 6 year old to sort things out, but don't know any.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the maxims I directed at my staff was "it ain't no fun if it's too easy" and by that standard, this problem with Skype is side-splittingly uproarious.&nbsp; But I'm having way too much of a good thing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best to you, wherever your end of the rainbow happens to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jim</p>

<h2>            unable to read USB flash drive after upgrade</h2>
                    I&nbsp;upgraded to&nbsp;windows 7 from XP after using easy file transfer to save my settings and files to a flash drive. after the install, when I plug my flash drive into a USB port it shows up as CD Drive E:. When I click to open I get a "Location is not available"
 message box with an error message that says "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error". How can I overcome this to restore my files and setting from the flash drive?? I need the files ans settings but since they are 7 GB I don't know
 of any other way to get them into the computer if I can't read the flash drive.

You might need to redeem it on a different web page". &nbsp;When going to login.live.com, I get the message "We couldn't find your code". &nbsp;I phone GameStop support, and they told me to contact the game producer (Electronic Arts). I phoned EA, and they told me to contact Microsoft. I have since spoken with Microsoft support 3 times. We've confirmed the code I bought is valid and has not been redeemed. In addition, my consoles has&nbsp;been reset and my profile deleted/recreated.&nbsp;I have been able to use a prepaid code for an extension of my Xbox&nbsp;gold account, so I know it's not an issue with entering&nbsp;codes on my console. &nbsp;In addition, I was able to buy a game from the Xbox store

            <p>I too have this exact same issue with the same game. I purchased 4/23/17. Contacted Xbox support, contacted EA and then called Xbox support again. I was eventually transfered to a wonderful&nbsp;Xbox support specialist name Myra. She worked with me on the phone for a long time and ended up escalating this issue. I hope to hear something soon. I have also seen this issue mentioned on EA forum.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have tried redeeming on my Console, Online with my computer and my phones Xbox app.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>If anyone finds out how to redeem this code please respond here!!<br /></p>
