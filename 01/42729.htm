<h2>            Microsoft Mail account - nothing but a pointless app on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 Mail app seems to be rather selective with the emails it wants me to print off!&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, emails from ebay, Paypal AND Amazon won't print off via the Print option within the Mail app. &nbsp;I have 4 email accounts &nbsp;(2 msn and 2 Gmail) and
 I have just spent a whole, boring afternoon, printing the 10 most recent emails off from each of those accounts - just to make sure my printer was, indeed, capable of printing off different email accounts!&nbsp;But more importantly, to see if my suspicions were
 right, that the Mail app will not print off certain emails from ebay, Paypal and Amazon, if these emails&nbsp;are centred around monetary&nbsp;receipt and statement details.&nbsp; My emails facing this problem are those associated to my Gmail accounts, the one that these
 companies are registered to.&nbsp; But I know from a user on here, that he has the exact same problem, but on his msn accounts.&nbsp; It can only be deduced, therefore, that it has nothing to do with our email accounts, but the actual Mail app from where they are attempted
 to be printed from.&nbsp; Sounds unbelievable? Then, try it! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Of ALL the many 30 emails I had received, from Groupon, Facebook, Airbnb etc, which I printed off with no problem, it was only 3 emails from ebay, Amazon and Paypal, that just wouldn't let me to print them off! That meant, I couldn't print off an Ebay receipt&nbsp;that
 was needed that day as&nbsp;proof&nbsp;of an&nbsp;Order Confirmation for Collection from a local store (I had to instead print that receipt off via my dependable iMac!).&nbsp;The PayPal invoice for that Ebay transaction wouldn't print off, and another, unrelated, receipt for
 goods from Amazon, wouldn't print off either. &nbsp;It sounds like some conspiracy!&nbsp; But, as I say, I'm not the only MS Mail user to have&nbsp;experienced this printing problem&nbsp;from the same kind of emails, and No one can seem to&nbsp;find a reason to this, not least a&nbsp;solution.&nbsp;
 The ONLY solution, apart from using my iMac to print, is to not use the Mail app at all, but to print off such emails straight from&nbsp;your browser.&nbsp; Doing this will make life so much easier for you, and you can at least uninstall the Mail tile from your Start
 up screen and give yourself some more space for another tile! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions about whether these emails might be Password Protected and if this could give some kind of explanation can simply be answered with a no.&nbsp; There is no password protection assigned to them!&nbsp; It just looks to me that Microsoft has allowed Windows
 10 to be released without bothering to check whether their apps are actually&nbsp;fit for purpose,&nbsp;before they install them
</p>
<p>So,&nbsp;if anyone has any suggestions as to why the Mail app is selective in what it prints off, or any solutions as to solving this mind-boggling issue,&nbsp;can you&nbsp;please let me know?&nbsp; For the time being, I'll just continue to warn others of Windows 10 limitations
 in regard to&nbsp;its Mail app.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>This problem only persists with printing receipts from paypal, ebay or amazon. Windows mail opens the printer 'channel' ie. the printer symbol comes up on the taskbar but it doesn't send the document to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is probably a fault in windows mail. Find the faulty code, rewrite it and issue an update PLEASE!!</p>

    <title>How to clear driver cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deepannegi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to clear driver cache</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have been facing issues with driver installation. The issue occurs when I try to install my driver but driver installation fails with error 0x800f0203 with the description: "There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.".<br />
"pnputil -e" does not list the driver. So, I am not able to clear it using the command "pnputil -d &lt;oem_xx.inf&gt;. But, after using process monitor, I found that the installation was still using the cache present in the C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository
 folder.<br />
This does not happen always. The one common thing I noticed is that they have the Windows.old folder in their C: which means they upgraded their windows. So far I have seen this with Windows 10 only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the Help.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Docking Station&#58; Multiple issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbrock62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Docking Station&#58; Multiple issues</h2>
                    <p>Apologies in advance for the long post, but this is a complex problem I've been battling for months now.&nbsp; After almost 3 years of nearly flawless service, my Surface Pro 3 Docking Station suddenly stopped working (mostly).&nbsp; Last July I was traveling, during
 which, a number of Microsoft Updates were installed on my Surface Pro, including a .NET Framework update.&nbsp; This could be coincidental, but when I returned, my display port and audio port on the docking station no longer worked; neither did USB 2.0 devices
 although USB 3.0 devices continue to work fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is a rundown of symptoms:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. External monitor no longer works with the display port.&nbsp; The external monitor is detected, but no video is actually transmitted.&nbsp; External monitor works fine plugged directly to the display port on the Surface.&nbsp; I can't rule out a bad cable, but this
 cable worked perfect for years and stopped working exactly when everything else did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. USB ports.&nbsp; All of the USB 3.0 ports work, but ONLY with USB 3.0 devices plugged in.&nbsp; No USB 2.0 devices are detected when plugged in.&nbsp; Those devices work fine when plugged directly to the USB port on the Surface, or into a hub plugged into that same
 port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Audio.&nbsp; This no longer works.&nbsp; I had trouble with audio a couple times in the past, but it was easily fixed by power down the docking station and then reconnecting power.&nbsp; That no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Ethernet. The Ethernet port is not detected when the Surface is docked.&nbsp; But if I power off the docking station while the Surface is connected, the Ethernet port is detected and works fine.&nbsp; The Ethernet port persists if the Surface is rebooted, but not
 if the Surface is shut down or undocked.&nbsp; In those cases, the docking station has to be power cycled to detect the Ethernet port again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried to resolve:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I ran through all the troubleshooting procedures found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-docking-station?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-docking-station?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I contacted Microsoft Support which was a huge waste of time.&nbsp; After determining my device was out of warranty, I was transferred to the paid support desk.&nbsp; They informed me they could walk through troubleshooting with me for something like $30, or
 they could send me the troubleshooting instructions and I could do it myself.&nbsp; I know my way around computers and have done IT support in previous jobs, so opted for the second.&nbsp; I was sent a link to the troubleshooting page I had started with.&nbsp; I asked to
 verify those were the only steps they could perform and was told yes, if those didn't work, then I should replace the docking station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course they didn't work.&nbsp; I tried a couple other things like downloading and running the Microsoft Surface Dock Updater .&nbsp; It is unclear whether this tool works on the Surface Pro 3 Docking Station, but it didn't on mine.&nbsp; It couldn't detect that it was
 connected.&nbsp; I also tried manually downloading and reinstalling the latest cumulative firmware for my Surface device.&nbsp; No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now it gets weird</strong></p>
<p>I decided my docking station was toast, so I ordered a new Surface Dock.&nbsp; When it arrived, I connected it and... EXACT SAME PROBLEMS!&nbsp; Every symptom was exactly the same.&nbsp; I even tried the
<span>Microsoft Surface Dock Updater on the new dock and got the same issue.&nbsp; It just kept telling me to connect the dock, which was already connected.</span></p>
<span>Microsoft Surface Dock Updater on the new dock and got the same issue.&nbsp; It just kept telling me to connect the dock, which was already connected.</span></p>
<p>So I ruled out the docking station as the problem.&nbsp; That left hardware or software issues on the Surface Pro itself.&nbsp; I can't rule out a bad charging/data port, but why would USB 3.0 devices work and not USB 2.0?&nbsp; And why would the Ethernet
 work fine, but only after power cycling the docking station?&nbsp; It also charges fine in the docking station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reluctantly, I ran an in place refresh/reinstall of the OS (Windows 10).&nbsp; It took half of a day, and no change.&nbsp; Same issues.&nbsp; So I went nuclear and wiped the whole computer clean.&nbsp; Did a clean reinstall of the OS, and reinstalled all my software.&nbsp; That
 took two days.&nbsp; Still no improvement!</p>
<p>So now I'm left with two possibilities: hardware or firmware on the Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; As I said, the hardware option doesn't make a lot of sense for reasons already discussed.&nbsp; It feels like a firmware problem to me, but I have no idea if
 there is any way to further diagnose or resolve.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be most welcome.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate the detailed information you've given. As you've mentioned, the problem is more likely to be a firmware issue rather than a hardware issue. Although, a bad charging port is still a possibility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the <span>Microsoft Surface Dock Updater and performing a clean install should've resolved the issue. At this point, it would be best to try using the Surface Dock/Docking Station with another Surface device, verify if same issue occurs and if not,
 a </span>bad charging port may be at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend you run the <strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong>. This tool resolves common Surface problems including firmware-related issues. The diagnosis may take 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer depending on your internet connection
 speed and the repairs that the tool needs to do to fix the problems.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem.&nbsp; For a few months now my Surface Pro 3 docking station has been erratic.&nbsp; When I first switch on my Surface, my external monitor doesn't work and often my Ethernet connection, too.&nbsp; So far, I haven't had any problem with audio.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'm not as IT savvy as "bbrock62" so I've been following a course of trial and error.&nbsp; Most times I redock a few times, and/or reconnect the power a few times, and/or reconnect the display a few times, and usually, eventually everything works.&nbsp; Once working,
 all seems fine until I power off, or leave for a few hours.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This all started early this year, but it's getting more frequent and more frustrating.</p>
<p>I have all the updates on my Surface and haven't been able to find firmware updates for the docking station.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'm a little leery about trying the Surface Diagnostic Tool.&nbsp; Could I loose all my data?</p>
<p>I'd like to know if "bbrock62" has found a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm sorry I didn't reply to this earlier.&nbsp; I forgot to say in my first post that I had run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit when I first started having trouble and it found nothing, but after<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/df9dbcdd-981b-4766-aa69-5f11b24dfa61" title="Voun Tia">
 Voun Tia</a> replied to my message, I remembered I had not tried it after reinstalling the OS.&nbsp; So I downloaded the latest version and ran it and it reported that it could not detect my charging port.&nbsp; Strange because my surface charges just fine with either
 the docking station or power cord, but I'm satisfied this is a hardware issue.&nbsp; I haven't had time to try to replace the port yet, but that is the plan.&nbsp; I'll be sure to post how that turns out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you are at much risk running the diagnostic tool.&nbsp; I think it is worth trying.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>"bbrock62" - many thanks for your quick response.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I followed your advice and ran the Surface Diagnostic Tool.&nbsp; Everything was running at the time, so, as expected, no problems were found.&nbsp; Now I'm more familiar with the tool, I'll try again next time I have no external display etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I had the same issue as you when I tried the Microsoft Surface Dock Updater; -
<span>it just kept telling me to connect the dock, when it was already connected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like my Surface - when it's working.</p>
<p>I'd had it almost 1 year, when it quit.&nbsp; The local repair shop couldn't help and Microsoft just recommended a new (refurbished) one.&nbsp; In desperation I tried it one more time.&nbsp; I put it (rather harshly) in the docking station - upside down by mistake.&nbsp; However,
 when I righted it - it worked.&nbsp; It continued working for several months and when it quit again, I repeated the upside down routine.&nbsp; It worked again and has continued to work.&nbsp; Doesn't make any sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a Surface Pro has problems they certainly are challenging!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again and good luck to you, too.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Windows Update issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem I'm facing</p>
<p>My&nbsp;Windows (10) refuse to find any update. Simple as that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for ways to update manually,&nbsp;only to find&nbsp;out that you can't find&nbsp;all the update releases&nbsp;in one place (there's no full list of releases).&nbsp; You need to search by name (Kxxxxxx), hence you have to know the names.
</p>
<p>Impossible...</p>
<p>You can only find the latest updates (five of them, here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000824/windows-10-update-history-version-1511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000824/windows-10-update-history-version-1511</a>)</p>
<p>and not all the updates released, ie from my current&nbsp;1511, 10586.104 version, to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is that for a long period this PC which I'm trying to update, was not being used (less than a year).</p>
<p>So when I tried to download and instal the necessary updates, it simply can't find any of them.</p>
<p>I don't know <strong>if that's</strong> the reason for not being able to update, but it seems possible to me that it is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I can't update my computer.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I tried with no results all&nbsp;three methods&nbsp;proposed by Annu Signh as shown here:
</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-wont-update/5df5a3ec-9478-4c04-bf1c-b7d8a80e49f2?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-wont-update/5df5a3ec-9478-4c04-bf1c-b7d8a80e49f2?auth=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also runned, with no success (though it found some issues which&nbsp;the tool&nbsp;claims it fixed), the Windows Update Troubleshooter:
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And tried these too: </p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-update-error-0x800705b4/37331a9b-d0f4-4ce8-b408-9b008f20da5b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-update-error-0x800705b4/37331a9b-d0f4-4ce8-b408-9b008f20da5b</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing these methods above, I get this error: 0x800705b4</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: sorry for any grammar or syntax error. English&nbsp;are not my mother language.</p>

            <p>Answer-by-number:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did&nbsp;you do a clean install of Win10,&nbsp;or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;to Win10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Have you ever run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> and/or the <strong>
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10&nbsp;is currently installed? </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press &amp; hold the <strong>Windows Key</strong> and press the<strong>&nbsp;R </strong>
key.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;RUN dialog, type&nbsp;<strong>WINVER</strong> and press the&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong> key.</li></ul>

            <p>The problem is solved.</p>
<p>I visited this page: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/el-gr/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/el-gr/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>in order to perform&nbsp;a clean install&nbsp;of Windows 10.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;system realized that I already run on Windows 10, and&nbsp;prompt me to update to the latest version, which I did, through a Windows Update Assistant, which as I understand&nbsp;has nothing to do with&nbsp;the installed on my PC Windows Update Agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are serious problems with the Windows Update, and it's a shame cause the Software seems to run smoothly (so far).</p>
<p>I had the same issues in Windows 7, on this PC and on my laptop, and I'm telling you, it took alot of effort on my side to fix those problems.
</p>
<p>If you don't mind me saying, the user shouldn't spent so many hours trying to solve problems that usually are the results of Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,</p>
<p>Just for the record, these are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 7 upgraded to Windows 10 (no clean install)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. None of these manufacturers. It's a PC (not a laptop) with hardware of my choise, and original Windows 7 (bought a DVD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No, never.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No, never.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. at the time of the problem: 1511, 10586.104 version (<strong>currently</strong> after solving the problem: version 1607, 14393.693)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for replying.</p>

<p>Very good.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Not that it matters now but...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When (approx. date) did you originally upgrade the Win7 computer to Win10 (e.g., on or after 09 Feb-16, the date Win10 1511&nbsp;10586.104 was released)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the upgrade offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you choose to upgrade manually?</p>

</p><p>I'm not sure&nbsp;but I think it was&nbsp;<strong>prior</strong> to 09-Feb-2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact I think it was&nbsp;around Nov. or Dec. 2015 when I upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm pretty sure the upgrade was offered and installed via Windows.</p>

<h2>            Application windows are extremely zoomed out and unable to be read.</h2>
                    On most downloaded applications (Avaira and AutoCAD for example) certain parts of them are extremely small and unable to be used or even read. I have tried changing aspect ratio and everything like that and nothing has worked. The attached photo should
 explain everything. As you can see, everything is basically shrunk and you cant tell what anything is.

            <p>It looks like the font is set way too big on all apps, so it might be a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the correct Graphics Driver loaded - the most likely source of this issue</li><li>Is your resolution set correctly - right click your desktop, click Display settings, then Advanced Display Settings, make sure your resolution is set to the one marked (recommended), NOTE: if one of the display settings is not marked (recommended) then
 the wrong display driver is loaded . . .</li><li>Check the default size of text on your System - right click your desktop, click Display settings and make sure size of text is set to 100%</li></ol>

<p>Hi Himanshu Dogra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. I can not connect to my phones wifi hotspot after installing pirated version of windows 7 ultimate 64 bit after deleting original version. I read the previous replies of yours. I think, that would be helpful for me also. My laptop
 is hp ProoBook 4430s. Only yellow markup in my device manager are as follows: Base System Device, Bluetooth Peripheral Device, Network Controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hardware IDs are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Base System Device:</p>

<p>Bluetooth Peripheral Device:</p>

<p>It would be very kind of you, if you give me valuable instruction and provide download link of above missing drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry but no Support is given for pirated copies of Windows Operating Systems in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I suggest that you seek answers at the website you downloaded the pirated Windows 7&nbsp;from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you contact HP and order Recovery Media for your computer which they should supply for a small cost, IF Windows 7 was originally&nbsp;preinstalled on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<span>Hi Darkdave,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Have you done any recent changes on the system?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try performing a system restore to a restore point before you were experiencing the issue and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Note: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To perform System restore, you may refer the following article:</span></p>

<p>You mean that you want to *copy* from the DVD or your digital camera? That's not downloading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that that's what you are trying to do, please tell us exactly how you are trying.</p>

 &nbsp;If I restart this doesn't happen, or if I never put it to sleep, it doesn't happen.</p>

            <p>It seems that there isn't proper fix for this problem. It appears to be some unresolved bug in Windows 10. I have seen many threads here about this issue (the display does not turn off and the computer does not go to sleep). I have tried all the fixes what&nbsp;Microsoft
 support has given here. None of them had made any difference. My computer never sleeps after the set time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can force the computer to sleep only from the start menu "Power, Sleep". When I wake up the computer, sometimes it wakes up all right, sometimes it stalls (I can see the hard disk working, but the computer appears to be dead),&nbsp;sometimes the computer reboots
 when trying to wake it up from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had these problems in Windows 7. The computer is exactly the same now in Windows 10, same exact hardware and programs as were in Windows 7. All latest drivers are installed in Windows 10. Yet the sleep mode does not work properly. This is extremely
 annoying.</p>

<h3> henryr13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store Error Code 0x80072EFD</h2>
                    <p>Every time I open the Windows Store, it just says:</p>
<p>"Check your connection -&nbsp;The error code is 0x80072EFD, in case you need it."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried most of the suggestions given in similar posts on this community (such as running the Windows Update Troubleshooter and disabling the Proxy, as well as trying to reset the Windows Store), but none of them have worked.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Burning cds in mp3 format in windows media player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence2931  say:</h3>
<h2>            Burning cds in mp3 format in windows media player</h2>
                    I recently started using windows media player to burn cds. When I play my burned cds in other devices that has the capability to show the song titles they don't. I used to use rhapsody and never encountered this problem and I went into properties in windows
 media player and selected mp3 format, nothing changed.

            <p>Lawrence - welcome to the forum...</p>
<p>If you have burned an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Audio</span> CD using WMP there is no feature for copying&nbsp;titles onto the disc that will read in another machine such as a text-enabled cd player. When you say you 'selected mp3 format' - if you
 then used that to burn an audio CD it would make no difference...if it was burned to a
 Q correctly. - Thanks, R.</p>

            I never had an issue with this in Rhapsody, I use the same blanks(Music CDs) and when I import music into Windows media player all the song titles show. A friend of mine's stumbled upon a way that allows song titles to display when playing a CD made in
 Windows media player on other devices but he can't remember how. I went into the properties tab in Windows media player but was unable to find anything that would work. I might have to find another program to do my music in, thanks R.

            <p>Hi thanks for the update...I am not aware of any on board element in WMP that will create titles on an audio disc. The only kit I have ever used that enabled this was a Pioneer stand-alone audio CD recorder. There may be third-party software available, but
 I steer clear of TP stuff as much as possible. I'll do a bit of research and let you know whether (or not) I find anything of interest. - Regards, Ric.
</p>
<p>ps - if you actually want to burn an mp3 disc (playing mp3 format tracks directly, rather than creating an audio disc from them) 'iTunes for Windows' does a good job.</p>

            <strong>Update</strong> - a quick web search shows that there is burning software available (the one most familiar to me being 'Nero' although I have never used it) that will add titles when burning audio discs...as always when it comes to third-party
 stuff proceed with caution if that is what you wish to do. - R.

<h2>            my windows7 does no more recognize my SAPI5 TTS engines&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I checked control panel- speech properties- text to speech, and I found no TTS engine displayed&nbsp;in the dropdown list, nor can I test the text.</p>
<p>while I can use all the some 5 TTS engines in lingoes(a free e-dic software)</p>
<p>then in another software I just tried, there's only one SAPI4 TTS engine recognized successfully ,it's" Peter(British)SAPI4“, while&nbsp;no SAPI5 recognized&nbsp;there, dropdown list left blank.</p>
<p>I think there must been something wrong with the SAPI5,&nbsp;considering&nbsp;I don't wanna now reinstall a system ,can someboby give me some advice to fix the problem?&nbsp; I would like to reinstall a SAPI5 platform if someone tells me how to do it, but it would be&nbsp;best
 if a little tweaking can fix it </p>
<p>thank you in advance!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, what I wanna do at the moment is "record text into mp3" , I found no softwares with such fuction can recognize my SAPi5 engines, so if someone know softwares suitable I'd like to try . @,@</p>

<p>It's my fault not mentioning I'm on 32bit windows7, so the link doesn't help much.</p>
<p>but I've found a "text to mp3" software that can recognize my TTS voices, so the problem doesn't haunt me at the moment.</p>

<h2>            Does it cost money to ask MS a question on the live chat after warranty expiration&#63;</h2>
                    Does it cost money to ask MS a question on the live chat after warranty expiration?&nbsp; It says this will cost you $29 before I go any farther.&nbsp; Surely it does not cost $29 to ask a question.&nbsp; Please tell me I'm wrong.&nbsp; If so, I just bought this computer
 a few months ago and I will sell it tomorrow and go back to Apple and be the loudest unhappy camper on social media ever.&nbsp; My computer shows it is in a town hours away from me in the "find my computer" application....is there a way I can fix this on my own
 so I can actually find it if it is lost or stolen?&nbsp; Thanks for the help community :-)!

<p>1. the answer to the $29 question is "it depends". But if you are in the US, you can go to a physical retail Microsoft Store and they will assist without charging $29. And you can post questions HERE first for free.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can't really&nbsp;use find my computer to actually pin point the location if it is stolen (even if it was more accurate)&nbsp;- you need an external program like lojack for laptops.

<h2>            MS Edge&#47;Windows 10 MS mail app saving emails for server&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have MS edge&nbsp; windows 10 using the mail app on 10 and I save many emails&nbsp; needed for reference to the drafts folder.</p>
<p>After a period of time??? they are poof, gone, the drafts folder is still there but&nbsp; mail is not, searching does not retrieve them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I find them on my sever&nbsp; by&nbsp; opening a browser and&nbsp; entering the IPs&nbsp; web address and then typing in my address and old password when I used them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The app opens and&nbsp; all my mail even current to the minute is there all my stored&nbsp; mails in drafts just like I stored them are there.</p>
<p>How&nbsp; do I retrieve them and store them to my desktop for safe keeping?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Many Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; does not really work on my desktop as per the&nbsp; instructions and graphics, but the&nbsp; email address I am seeking to&nbsp; save my drafts uses an original address,&nbsp; ……..@cebridge.net&nbsp; account that uses Suddenlink as the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; My mail was set up an MS tech&nbsp; when Windows live mail was no longer supported a few years ago.</p>
<p>And went from a pop3 type to a stmp? type to be able to&nbsp; keep my original address that I have used for many years,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But seems this MS email app&nbsp; does not keep many messages or graphics on its&nbsp; app but the ones saved are saved on my IP server, which I would like to collect and store permanently on the desktop in files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;please help me if you can</p>

            Sorry by my delay, I was having internet issues, so, let's try this:
<br />
<br />Go to Tools -&gt; Email Accounts -&gt; Add a new account. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Select POP3, then click Next.
<br />
<br />Input the display name as you'd like it shown on messages you send. Type your email address in the email address field.
<br />
<br />Add the username and password you use to log on to your POP3 mailbox.
<br />
<br />For server information, input the names of your POP3 servers as provided by your ISP (or whoever is hosting your POP3 mailbox). These are typically in the form smtp.mydomain.com and pop.mydomain.com.
<br />
<br />If your ISP has indicated that you need to change the port or SSL settings for the POP3 or SMTP servers, then click More Settings, switch to the Advanced tab, and set these fields using the information provided by your ISP. If your ISP has indicated that your SMTP server requires authentication, click on the Outgoing Server tab and check the checkbox marked 'my outgoing server requires authentication.'
<br />Click OK and Next as appropriate to complete the process.
<br />
<br />Test your POP3 account to ensure you can authenticate, send and receive email.

<h2>            Windows 10 installation failure at 46&#37; of upgrade process.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 install...</p>
<p>Ahh, Windows 10. I have tried to install Windows 10 twice. Both times the install hung at 46% with installing features and drivers at 37%. I spoke with Microsoft technical support and was told once to "let the install run". After 13 hours I rebooted, and
 tried again, I was told I need the Windows Updates. The second install went identical to the first, hanging at the same percentages.</p>
<p>Again I spoke with Microsoft Technical and was told there are issues with Toshiba computers and possibly drivers. It was suggested that I post here.</p>
<p>Is anyone experiencing similar issues with Toshiba? This was an install over Windows 7 Home Edition. Are there any fixes or solutions that have been discovered. This is a I7-267OQM processor at 2.2 GH.</p>
<p>Please post any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response. About 3 Windows updates (drivers) will not down load giving an error message that I am currently using newer or the same drivers. I ran the system file checker but it didn't appear to yield much more than log results. I will download
 Windows 10 and start the process again. If the install hangs yet another time I will attempt the clean boot install, this is my least favorite of your suggestions.</p>
<p>Again, my thanks, hopefully there will be enough failures with a similar configuration as mine, that Windows will offer some patch to assure success. I will let you know if this attempt is successful.</p>

            <p>Nyima,</p>
<p>My enthusiasm for Windows 10 is quickly vanishing. Another hang and 13 hours later I am thankful that the Toshiba is recovering to Windows 7. I do have an external Keyboard and mouse (usb) wireless plugged into this computer. Could this be an issue? It was
 not on a previous Lenovo install over Window 8.1.</p>
<p>I will await a Microsoft response, I am reluctant to use the "clean boot method" as any method that has a disclaimer attached is not high on my list. I appreciate your effort but cannot believe I am the Lone Ranger when it comes to problems with Toshibas
 and Windows 10 installs over Windows 7.</p>
<p>Perhaps readers might offer any user suggestions that have been successful with similar PC configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thanks,</p>

<p><strong>Exact same problem I am having. Tried to upgrade to Windows 10 three times now and it freezes at 46% with installing features and drivers at 37%.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a Dell desktop pc, not a Toshiba.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I really think this is another one of Microsofts big screwups. </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I also disabled all security features I had running, Kaspersky and Advanced Systencare 8. Still freezes at the same place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maybe it's time to try another operating system besides Microsoft, or should I say Micro Hard ! ! !
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What a JOKE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you!! I have neglected this post. I will add that my attempts to install Windows 10 concluded at 5 tries. The last venture was my final gasp to install the new OS. I called Microsoft and allowed one of their techs to "take control" of this unit. Several
 hours later. The tech deleted every Windows update, uninstalled Norton,&nbsp; including numerous other efforts to make the install successful.
</p>
<p>The result was the same except I had to spend a couple of hours restoring the deleted software. The install froze at 46% which I left for over 12 hours at the tech's request before the system was granted a "frozen status".</p>
<p>Microsoft called me the next day and wanted me to grant another tech access.....</p>
<p>Not likely, at minimum wage this "free" upgrade has cost me over $400 in time, not to mention the phone and language barriers I encountered. It has been a totally frustrating experience. The operating system on the Toshiba will remain Windows 7 until the
 laptop is added to the junk pile.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response and good luck.</p>

<p>I am going to give it one more try and then will wash my hands of the windows 10 machine.</p>

            While I normally enjoy my Win 10 experience with it running on 5 machines there is always one to give you grief. I have happily been updating all my machines from their initial win 8 pro thru win 8.1 to win 10. Now given they all started out with the same
 win 8 &nbsp;beginnings and there are major hardware differences I was expecting a few teething problems. The one I first worked with is of course the one withy a &nbsp;problem. For some reason its the only machine that ended up with a win 10 home edition thru all the
 free updates. Its an I3 and its an MSI motherboard with chipsets similar to at least one of the others that works ok. It seems to get an update to upgrade it to win 10 pro and hangs in the process typically at 46%. Manual attempts seem to end at the same point.
 Left to finish up it eventually reverts to its original version of win 10 home. Another issue is it will not allow the speech recognition software to run giving reports of a bad srloc.dll. Reading most of the posted fixes i

            Hi Julie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />At any time during the attempted repairs or reinstall below, you can rescue your files from the Command Prompt in the Repair options or from the booted media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  If this fails you can preserve them during this reinstall by choosing the C partition during the install steps, not deleting or formatting it, just click Next to let it install and it will archive your User files at C:\windows.old.
<br />
<br />I'll first give you the steps to recover from failed Updates,  followed by how to install a rescue install next to your present one to continue work with the files from it.
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />I've given you a method to save your files from the booted media.  If this fails you can preserve them during this reinstall by choosing the C partition during the install steps, not deleting or formatting it, just click Next to let it install and it will archive your User files at C:\windows.old.
<br />
<br />If your needed files are outside of your User folders which are saved as above, then you can also shrink C to do a rescue install to boot into and access your files on the old C partition.  I will walk you through if you need this option.  
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

<p>Thank you Greg, i am going to take it to the IT department at uni tomoorrow to be safe, i guess i needed to know if they can be salvaged. Should i turn it off over night or leave it to try and reboot, or is it and endless reboot. Its a brand new lap top,
 will it go back to what it was prior to this update ?</p>

            If it was a WIndows Update and not the Fall Creators Update Version 1709 being installed, then a simple System Restore should get back before that and start it.  I gave the steps to try that with and without media, and how to create the media if necessary.  
<br />
<br />If it was a Version Update then instead of System Restore you'd want Go Back to Old Version in the Advanced Troubleshoot Options &gt; More Options.  
<br />
<br />How to get to those and pictures of them are in the link I gave:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If those methods don't work then you'd need to create the media on another PC to try from there the repairs or reinstall as I specfied to preserve files. 
<br />
<br />I'll be here to help if you want to give it a try.  You can't really harm it any more.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Wifi - Limited Connection only</h2>
                    <p>My upgrade went smoothly without any issues, until I hit the bottleneck with wifi Limited connection. &nbsp;I think the issue is because "Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 802.11b/g/n Wifi adapter" not compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;I think they had similar issue with 8.1
 initially. &nbsp;Does anyone know any unofficial drivers I can use until Qualcomm comes around...</p>

            <p>I am sorry you are experiencing issues with your Wi-Fi adapter. That said, need a little more information to determine what is causing the issue and we can attempt to update with the inbox version (if you haven't already).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the search box, type devmgmt.msc and hit enter or go into Settings and click on Device Manager. From here, please find your networking adapter&nbsp;&gt; right click and enter 'Properties' &gt; select 'Driver'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info needed: What is the Driver Date and Version Number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After capturing that information, please select 'Details' and from the 'Property' dropdown, please select Hardware Ids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info needed: What is the Hardware ID?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to 'Driver', you can also attempt to 'Update Driver'. While you're not connected to the internet, the inbox driver will be checked and installed (if not already). If this doesn't resolve the issue, let me know along with the Driver Date, Version
 Number, and ID.</p>

</p><p>BTW, before I posted the initial question, I tried updating the driver via device manager, it came out as I have latest driver available.&nbsp; I am right now using it tethered to wall via LAN cable.&nbsp; This is HP Envy Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information can provide more info to help troubleshoot.</p>
<p>

<p>Gaja,</p>

</p><p>Appreciate the information.&nbsp;I am working with engineering&nbsp;on a solution. That said,&nbsp;we could use some additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First,&nbsp;do you&nbsp;have a legacy Cisco VPN? Need to check as we have a known issue and workaround for that issue already in other posts.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Stuck at 49&#37;</h2>
                    Windows 10 update has been blue screen working on update 49% for over 12 hours. This is second attempt at update. Yesterday I ran update troubleshooter and removed AVG Anti-Virus Free. Control-alt-delete doesn't do anything. What now?
