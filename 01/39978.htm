<p><span><span>Hi h_har,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• What type of internet connection do you have?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Are you trying to do automatic updates or manual updates?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> If it is still stuck on installing update
 page, then <strong>restart the computer and choose boot normally and check what happens</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you get into Windows and not all the updates were installed, then you can install the updates one at a time and see if
 one of them is having a problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If you are not able to boot normally to
 the desktop, then you may follow the steps given in this link to do a Startup repair or System restore booting from Vista full version Disc to boot to the desktop:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts when
 you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> When you are able to boot normally,<strong>check
 the update history</strong> to find out the installed updates by following the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>See which Windows updates are installed</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If there any failed updates,</span><span>then try to
<strong>download and install the standalone package of the updates from the Microsoft download center.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Download updates from Microsoft download Center:</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Enter the KB article number in the search field and download the same.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Double click on the downloaded file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. And Click Run and Follow the wizard to install it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Installing Creators Update on older machine - Acer Aspire Revo R3610</h2>
                    <div>Having fun trying to update my Acer Aspire Revo R3610 (Atom N330 4Gb ram &amp; 250Gb Samsung Evo 850 SSD) which led me yesterday to installing Windows 10 32bit (or trying anyway) 5 times. Acer do not even list the machine in their Windows10 compatability page</div>
<div>A little background - machine was bought with Windows7, upgraded to Windows8 (I think), then has been running Windows 10 32bit quite happily for some time, until the dreaded Creators Update...</div>
<div>This machine, which I use successfully as a HTPC, has previously tried to update itself to 1703 on two occasions failing both times with errors in the second boot phase (I'm sorry but I do not have the exact codes/reasons). I have also tried to update
 via the Media Creation Tool route within Windows with again a failure.</div>
<div>Yesterday with some time on my hands, (little did I know how much I would need) and a vague memory that I had to do a clean install for 1607, I unplugged everything except the ethernet cable and tried the full nuclear route - booting from fresh download
 on 16Gb USB stick, deleting partitions and proceeding from there 87% = failure and no OS to revert to. I then tried again with cabled keyboard and mouse, not my Microsoft wireless ones, deleted partitions and 87% = failure.</div>
<div>2 x installs down.</div>
<div>I then tried my previous 1607 download and all was well until the bit where it informed me that I had an update with a 4Gb download. "Aha", thinks I, "maybe this will work", so I let it. 87% = failure. (but at least this time I had an OS to revert to).</div>
<div>4 x installs down.</div>
<div>Finally I let the machine finish off the 1607 install, and let the updates run until it told me Windows was up to date.</div>
<div>Then I tried the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) download in the hope that this would work where the others failed, and it least it went differently. This time at 81% the spinning dots stopped and the system reverted.</div>
<div>5 installs down, and no wiser :)</div>
<div>Each time the machine passed the suitability check for processor, ram and disc space.</div>
<div>I suppose my question(s) is/are, am I wasting my time trying to install these versions of Windows10 on such a low powered machine; or is there some magic trick to getting them to take? Also, if it is not possible to run these newer Windows versions and
 I leave the machine on 1607 is there a way to stop it trying to update itself in future?</div>
<div>There are probably log files of the failed installs that I am happy to find/post if you tell me what you want.</div>
<div>Thanks for reading this far &amp; for any suggestions that I will read and may act upon when I again have time.</div>
<div>Regards.</div>

<p>Yes, the computer belongs to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly one of the machines referred to in the first thread. As a household we have in excess of 10 machines (desktops, laptops, HTPC, servers, etc.), and all family questions devolve to me :) I expect I was asking in advance to minimise the downloads required
 to upgrade all machines.</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Win7 computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Did the computer-in-question come with Win7 32-bit preinstalled?
<br />
<br />1c. When &amp; how did you upgrade the Win7 computer to Windows 8?
<br />
<br />1d. Were you running Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 when you upgraded to Windows 10?
<br />
<br />2a. Did you choose to upgrade to Win10 manually or was the upgrade offered AND INSTALLED via Windows Update?
<br />
<br />2b. Did you or did you not do a "clean install" of Windows 10 1607 sometime after 03 August 2017?
<br />
<br />3. What, if any, third-party anti-virus application is currently installed on the computer?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />
<br />7. Has the Fall Creators Update (Win10 1709) ever been offered to the computer via Windows Update?
<br />

<p>OK, I'll try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. 1/1/2011</p>
<p>1b.&nbsp;Windows 7 Home Premium - I can't remember if it was 32 or 64 bit. The box is probably in the loft - if you have a week... The more I think about it, it came as 64bit but I put 32bit as only 4Gb RAM. (bought as 2Gb, I upgraded RAM &amp; installed SSD)</p>
<p>1c. Can't be certain if I did or did not put this on 8, I think I did &amp; if so it was via the £14.95 upgrade offer when 8 was released.</p>
<p>1d. Unknown.</p>
<p>2a. Assuming you mean the 1703 upgrade, it was offered via Windows Update.</p>
<p>2b. Only yesterday 26/10/2017, as part of getting it to work again. The only prior clean install of 1607 was around when it was released.</p>
<p>3. No third party antivirus.</p>
<p>4. Unless bundled, no. HDD was replaced with SSD by me, and clean install done then. I think I put the new drive in after Windows10 release.</p>
<p>5. No.</p>
<p>6. Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.1770)</p>
<p>7. No</p>

<br />
<br />I'm in no rush.
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you replace the HDD with an SSD?
<br />
<br />1b. Were you running Win7, Win8(.1), or Win10 when you replaced the HDD?
<br />
<br />1c. What installation media did you use to install Windows (any version) on the new SSD?
<br />
<br />2. Did you or did you not "upgrade" the Win7 computer to Win8? [Yes, it's important.]
<br />
<br />3a. When (approx. date) did you upgrade the computer to Windows 10 (not Win10 1709 or 1703 or 1607)? [Would have been between 29 July 2015 and 29 July 2016.]
<br />
<br />3b. Did you choose to upgrade to Win10 manually or was it offered AND INSTALLED via Windows Update?
<br />
<br />4. You've done two (2) "clean installs" of Win10 1607, is that correct?
<br />
<br />5. Did you format the SSD (or HDD as the case may be) prior to doing one or both of the "clean installs?"
<br />
<br />6. What installation media did you use to do the "clean install" of Windows 10 1607, OS Build 14393.1770 yesterday?
<br />
<br />7. Is KB4041688 and/or KB4049179 offered to the computer when you run a manual check for updates and if so, does the update(s) successfully install?

<br />
<br />8. May we assume that neither the Creators Update (Win10 1703) nor the Fall Creators Update (Win10 1709) has been offered to the computer via Windows Update since yesterday?

<p>Re the box - I should have added &amp; if it hasn't been tidied. I also don't keep exact dates when I did something, so all this is based on when I bought something, providing a terminus post quem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. I bought SSD from Amazon in Nov &amp; Dec 2015, so about then.</p>
<p>1b. I expect Windows 10, as that was the best way - get digital entitlement first, then clean install onto new drive.</p>
<p>1c. USB stick - no optical drive.</p>
<p>2. I honestly can't remember, I can find no record of a Windows8 license for it, so it's probable it was from Windows 7.</p>
<p>3a. At a guess August/Sept 2015</p>
<p>3b. Likely to have been done manually, hence the USB stick buying previously referred to.</p>
<p>4. On this machine, that is likely. One at release(ish), and one yesterday.</p>
<p>5. Deleted&nbsp; partitions and let install take it from there.</p>
<p>6. Integral 16Gb USB stick.</p>
<p>7, Currently checking</p>
<p>8. Not so far, but I just got the privacy settings update KB4013214.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help so far, and I hope that you're getting a picture. Can I ask what direction you're currently looking at, if I can understand the destination I might be able to help better.</p>

            Given the questionable computer background (based on what you've told us so far) and the fact that neither Win10 1607 or Win10 1703 were ever offered via Windows Update and the fact that Windows Update isn't working properly (now and probably for quite some time), your best bet at this point would be (a) formatting the SSD and then (b) doing a (literal) clean install of Windows 10 Version 1709.
<br />
<br />Tutorial: Clean install of Win10

<br />
<br />If you choose to backup your personal data to an external source prior to the above, you MUST scan the data /in situ/ with at least two (2) reputable online scanners (i.e., not Windows Defender) before restoring the data to the SSD (or before accessing the data on an external drive).

<p>Similar scenario I purchased the Acer Revo 3610 in 2010 for use as a HTPC mostly for Hulu, NetFlix and YouTube viewing. I proceeded happily along for several years then Microsoft started monkeying with my system. I never wanted to move past Windows 7 which
 worked perfectly for my application. I don't want to spend time using file explorer (which didn't work the last time I tried it) and typing this or that in certain locations. I wasn't aware that I had an option to go back to the old system when Windows 10
 was forced on me and now it seems that I can't go back without a lot of effort and/or expense (such as a third party geek).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I would like for Microsoft to offer some real customer service (since Microsoft is the sole owner and creator of my dilemma) and provide me with hard media and paper instructions to easily revert me to Windows 7 or even Windows 8.1. I am not a geek and
 don't want to waste anymore time on this, three days of frustration is enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Will the creator's patch enable me to avoid all updates until such time as Microsoft provides me the media I need?</p>

            Hi,
<br />if this is a home computer the KMS activation is illegal (pirated). If this a corporate computer, ask your company's system administrator.

<h2>            Windows 10 unexpected restarts</h2>
                    I have a new dell Inspiron 7348 and recently upgraded to Windows 10. Since that time, I have experienced unexpected restarts - simply goes black and restarts without warning. This has occurred when I am working on a Word doc., or writing e-mails or working
 on some other program, but not when streaming. Anyone have similar problem and know how to fix without going back to Windows 8 which came with computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Thank you Isha. I have done what you suggested except for the&nbsp;safe mode actions, but discovered that&nbsp;the computer unexpectedly shuts down and restarts every time it checks for a Windows update when I am working or using most any program. I did change the
 settings&nbsp;so that the system is not supposes to reboot automatically to install updates, but it shuts down and reboots even when&nbsp; there are no updates, but when checking for them. Help?

            <p>I had been experiencing the unexpected shutdown/restart problem since 8/17/2015. Shortly after the Windows 10 upgrade. I never had this problem with Windows 7. It got worse over time, multiple times a day, so much so that I could not depend on the PC to
 stay running long enough to do anything. It did not matter what I was doing when a random shutdown happened.&nbsp;Often a shutdown/restart occurred while I was away from the PC. I would come back to find the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the System Event Log this is Event ID: 41 Source: Kernel-Power:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><em>The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I reseated the i3 CPU and Memory, and replaced the Power Cord&nbsp;to no avail. Continued to shutdown just as often as before. I planned on replacing the Power Supply when I discovered the solution (at least in my case)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started playing around with the <strong>Power Options &gt; Advanced Settings &gt;Processor Power Management
</strong>settings.</p>
<p>The setting that fixed the problem is: Changed the <strong>System Cooling Policy
</strong>from <strong>Active</strong> to <strong>Passive </strong>(see below).</p>
<p>I have not had an unexpected shutdown since making this change 24 hours ago. </p>
<p>Apparently Windows 10 handles system cooling&nbsp;policy differently than Windows 7.</p>
<p>BTW: I checked the CPU temp and it was in spec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone else to resolve this very frustrating problem<strong>.</strong></p>

            I have an Asus Essentio CG8350. It came with Windows 7 installed. I come home one day and when I turned it on, it had downloaded and installed Windows 10. I didn't click anything to install it. I didn't even authorize it to download! That was about 8 months
 ago. Since then it ran ok but in August I received an update and since then I have had nothing but issues! Well let me rephrase, I've had the same issue that just keep popping up randomly! My system will just unexpectedly restart without warning. It will show
 that it is installing something. I've been to multiple sites and viewed multiple comments made here about what could be the cause and what the possible fix is. I know it's not a virus or malware. I was able to update my programs and did several deep scans
 to be sure. Nothing has been found. Had several of parts of my hardware checked to be sure that none were failing. Updated all bios to be current. Still random restarts plague me. Read one comment to check the event viewer to see if a

            <p>Yup, I've got the same problem - has been the same for about 4 to 6 weeks. &nbsp;I updated to W10 last summer and everything's been working fine until this issue started.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert but have tried various steps recommended including deep scan and checking power options. &nbsp;I've checked the Windows update is working correctly. &nbsp;I even opened the case and blew out all collected dust that I could see in case it was an overheating
 problem - for me that took some courage......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have to close any programmes I'm using before leaving the PC (Novatech) for any length of time - 30 minutes or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution, I'll be another very grateful user.</p>

            <p>My computer will restart and then it apparently shows like it is Windows 7 when it is supposed to be Windows 10.&nbsp; The 1st time an issue occurred (which was only 30 or so days after I purchased the computer),&nbsp;it would not even log me in said I was an unauthorized
 user.&nbsp; Had to take into a computer repair and they basically saved my info and reset the computer and I had to reinstall the programs that I had after I had bought it.&nbsp; All they could figure is that an update did not finish when the computer/internet was turned
 off.&nbsp; We live in the country and only have limited internet.&nbsp; Cost me around $100 for this.&nbsp; It happened again after 2 months and had to go through the ritual again (did it myself that time so just time no money).&nbsp; Well last week I walked away from my computer
 for only a few minutes came back and it was at my login, logged in and my home screen was there but my email icon was gone then when I went to menu it was changed and no tiles screen, and going though different things it says recover to Windows 7.&nbsp; After some
 hours of reading and playing around, managed to get my email icon back, but it is still not like it was.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Long story short, Windows 10 has been the WORST program I have dealt with and agree that we should be made to change especially when the program does not work properly.&nbsp; I wonder if we can bill Microsoft for all the hours and research for the time to fix
 these bugs.&nbsp; I have been checking around about class action lawsuits and would love to get involved with one.&nbsp;

<h2>            Disable optimal resolution check and notice</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep receiving the notification that I don't use the optimal screen resolution. Each time, screen turns off and on few times testing resolution to come back with the notification. It lasts few seconds and its extremely annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, that I DON'T WANT to use the optimal resolution - I have Yoga pro 2 13'' and with optimal res (3200x1800) in many apps (eg. photoshop, Meta Trader) fonts are extremely small, way too small to read (and zoom set to 200-300% is not scaling them).
 Therefore I keep using 1920x1080. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How to get rid of constant notification and resolution test? I din't have this problem in W 8.1</p>
<p>Thanks a lot&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Repair&#47;Upgrade installation fails</h2>
                    <p>After a Hard drive failure, I used DDRescue to rebuild from the bad drive, mainly because I was trying to keep from losing a lot of stuff. Windows restarted, fixed itself and kept going. However, I've had quite a few other problems with reinstalling them
 doesn't work. SFC didn't repair everything. I tried to do a repair installation as described here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair Install</a><br />
<br />
But I get the error:<br />
<br />
Windows Installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation.<br />
<br />
Error code: 0xC06D007F<br />
<br />
It appears to happen during the checking compatibility portion of the installation, at least the window in the background shows Compatibility report (saved to desktop) when the error pops up. I'm logged in as an administrator and ran setup using run as administrator.
 Even gave the everyone group full control of the Desktop in case that was the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running Windows update to see if it would repair files, but it says the service isn't running.&nbsp; MMC crashes, so I tried starting fro the cmd line.&nbsp; Says service already running.&nbsp; Check in MSCONFIG and it's running there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I'm uninstalling SP1 to see if reinstalling it will clear some problems, though I'm not hopeful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything else to try before I make a list of all installed programs, copy/backup everything to a separate drive, and do a clean install?</p>

            <p>Hi Hank,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>0xC06D007F error may be caused by windows system files damage or corrupted system files entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be because of an incomplete installation, an incomplete uninstall, improper deletion of applications or hardware. It can also be caused if your computer is recovered from a virus or adware/spyware
 attack or by an improper shutdown of the computer. All the above actives may result in the deletion or corruption of the entries in the windows system files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have already tried SFC scan you may try to run system update readiness tool and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>refer the link below to run system update readiness tool.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If this doesn’t help as you mentioned in the above post, take a backup of data on a separate drive and you may try clean installation of Windows 7.</p>

            1. Do you have the latest Skype installed? What is the version of the Skype?
<br />
<br />2. Can you uninstall and reinstall Skype client?
<br />
<br />3. To isolate the cause, whether the problem is with the client or not, can you use Web Skype and see whether the call goes through or not.

<h2>            My Dell desktop - Vista - will not turn on, monitor says no input and must wake up computer</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell desktop running Vista.&nbsp; A few days ago, when I pressed the power button to turn it on, nothing happened.&nbsp; When I turned on the monitor, it said it was entering power save mode.&nbsp; When I checked the monitor again, it said there is no input from
 the computer and to press any key on the keyboard or use the mouse to wake it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer is plugged in and the green light on the back is on.&nbsp; I do not remember putting the computer to sleep.&nbsp; I thought I did a shut down a few days beforehand.&nbsp; Pressing and holding the power button on the computer does not turn it off or on.&nbsp; There
 is no sound emitting (such as a fan).&nbsp; I unplugged the computer briefly a few times, and then I finally unplugged it overnight and plugged it back in.&nbsp; The light comes on in the back but the "num lock" key on the keyboard doesn't come on and the light underneath
 the mouse does not come on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked some suggestions on this site but they all require that the computer be on and you enter this screen or that screen.&nbsp; Is the computer dead?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There seems to be an issue with hardware, I would suggest you to contact Dell support regarding this issue.

<h2>            Brother printer driver hl-1230 parallel not automatically recognised in Windows 7 professional 32-bit.</h2>
                    Brother printer driver hl-1230 parallel not automatically recognised in Windows 7 professional 32-bit. It is supported by MS, and brother has informed me to contact MS for support, but, of course, MS wants MORE money for support.<br />
<br />
How can I get this printer working?<br />
<br />
* i have updated the list of supported printers in the add/printer wizard<br />
* the only printers closely resembling mine is HL-1240 and HL-1250. I installed them, but they didn't work. Only blank pages came out.<br />
* I went to Windows Update, and the only update available was for Windows Defender<br />
* I haven't tried any Vista drivers for this printer, because I don't think I should have to, if MS says there is W7 support for it.<br />

<p>Brother writes all the Brother print drivers included in the OS as well as those on Windows Update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Did you already install the 5/2007 Vista drivers for this device from the Brother website?<br />

I'll send some mail to the Brother print driver testers who are in Redmond and confirm which driver they recommend for the device.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't expect an answer until after Jan 4.&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to connect to a wireless network for 3 days through my Lenovo Ideapad Z570. The error message "Can't connect to this network" keeps showing up. On the other hand my phone and tablet have no problem connecting to WiFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried turning the router on and off, connecting to other networks, forgetting the network, updating/uninstalling network adapter, uninstalling the wireless network driver, doing a network reset etc. but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I am able to get internet access on my laptop now is through the Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has another solution, it would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            Hi RYB18
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network Adapter &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>That error message (Can't connect to this&nbsp; network) seems to arise from a problem in the router.&nbsp; If you are using MAC filtering, be sure your PC MAC address is on your allow list, or temporarily change to allow all, or whatever your router's instructions
 are for turning off MAC filtering.&nbsp; You can also try to get the PC connected using the router's guest setting and/or using the button on the router that will auto connect the PC that is in close proximity.&nbsp; And, of course, check your pw key for a typo.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4&#58; blurry text on external monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc0159  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4&#58;  blurry text on external monitors</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4 with two 1920x1080 external monitors connected by DisplayPort to the Surface Dock. &nbsp;I'm able to set text scaling for the external monitors to different percentages than the Surface Pro, but when I do so, text on those monitors is noticeably
 fuzzy/blurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pertinent details:</p>
<p>The Surface is fully updated</p>
<p>The external monitors and the connecting cables are fine; when plugged into a different laptop, there's no blurriness</p>
<p>The problem is definitely with text scaling, and notably only manifests after signing out/back in (which the system prompts for after changing scaling settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set all 3 screens (including the Surface) to 100% scaling and sign out/in, as prompted: &nbsp;text appears crisp on all 3 screens (but this configuration is unusable, as text is too small on the Surface itself)</li><li>Change the Surface to 150% scaling, and do NOT sign out (ignoring the prompt): &nbsp;text remains crisp, and this configuration is usable</li><li>If, however, I sign out or reboot, when I sign back in text is again blurry on the external monitors</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It seems clear that this is a bug in how Windows handles differing scaling values, and it's worth noting that everything is fine until I follow the instructions and sign out/in "for a better experience". &nbsp;Searching around, this appears to be a known issue
 so I don't actually expect any solutions. &nbsp;I'm only posting this because it's a huge inconvenience which warrants a patch and which I think hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.</p>

            Hi Amazing.tf245yay,
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />Whet version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Does Activation report that 'Windows is activated using your Organisation's Activation server'?

    <title>File-save dialogue often does nothing when I click &#34;save&#34;. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennytilley  say:</h3>
<h2>            File-save dialogue often does nothing when I click &#34;save&#34;.</h2>
                    Same problem here.&nbsp; The symptoms are slightly different under w7-32 and w7-64 but the starting point is the same, that is, the file-save dialogue often does nothing when I click "save".&nbsp; Sometimes, after repeated clicks or waiting a minute or two, it will
 work.&nbsp; Sometimes it will work immediately.&nbsp; The only way it consistently works is if a file of the same name already exists in the target folder, then selecting that file from the folder view, then clicking "save" allows the dialogue to "complete" (with a
 "do you want to overwrite?" message).&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, under w7-32, selecting the filetype drop list helps as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is occurring in my own applications, so I can choose whether to use the "XP" or "Vista" style of dialogue, but both exhibit the same
 behaviour.<br />
<br />
I have some flash videos that illustrate the problem, if anyone from MS wants to see them...<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>What type of files are you trying to save? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to save the file in clean boot and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><b><span>Note</span></b></span></span><span><span><span><span>: Perform
<b>step 7</b> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.

            I tried my issue again this morning and it seems to have been resolved (for now!)&nbsp; I have had some Windows Updates in the interim so perhaps this fixed the problem?<br />

<p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>Here's the link to my uSkyPhone :- </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85b87af-20d5-4bfd-9cf9-702cd6c7d844?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85b87af-20d5-4bfd-9cf9-702cd6c7d844?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I searched everywhere for a link to it (I've) had it many years and no problems with it !&nbsp; I was unable to find any lead to it. &nbsp; To cut a long story short I have been having problems with all items linked to my Window 10 Computer
 that have USB Ports.&nbsp; -Mouse, Printer, Scanner, Keyboard etc.&nbsp; so I moved the uSkyPhone from one USB Port and then to another and finally it was working.&nbsp; Yet the IT men who fix my Computer for me says there is nothing wrong with my USB Ports&nbsp; !!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Many thanks for you offer to hopeully help me , I do appreciate it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Regards</p>
<p style="text-align: left">from&nbsp; Gloria&nbsp; (Marsh-Fisher)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">P.S. The actual uSkyPhone looks like a T.V. remote gone wrong but it actually acts as a very good phone for Sky.</p>

            Unfortunately, since uSkyPhone is not an official Microsoft product, there may be compatibility issues that we are not aware of. There may also be security issues with the item but if you are determined that the item is secure, then please try the following:- 
<br />
<br />Updating Drivers 
<br />1. Search "Device Manager" in the search box, near the Windows Start Button, and select it. 
<br />2. Locate your microphone (or other device that isnt working), right click and select "Update Drivers". 
<br />3. Restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />Privacy Settings
<br />1. Right-Click your Windows Start Button and Select 'Settings'
<br />2. Select 'Privacy'
<br />3. Select 'Microphone' in the sidebar
<br />4. Make sure 'Allows Apps to Access your Microphone' is checked and below that make sure that Skype and uSkyPhone is checked as well.
<br />
<br />Camera/Mic Settings 
<br />1. Open Skype 
<br />2. Click on your display picture at the top left hand side of the application 
<br />3. Scroll down and select 'Settings' 
<br />4. Click on Audio &amp; Video 
<br />5. You can check all of your Microphone/Camera Settings here.

    <title>Can the old version of paint from XP be brought to windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cowboss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the old version of paint from XP be brought to windows 7</h2>
                    I have over 5,000 drawing that were created in paint from XP. Now they are useless to me as the color are not compatible in 7. If I want to add a lime green line the 7 lime green is different from the XP. I know I can suck up color from old and use but
 with so many colors and shapes I might as well start over. Is there may be a way to bring over the XP paint?? HELP? Please

    <title>Will Xbox play content from iPad with Smartglass&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banana tree 001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Xbox play content from iPad with Smartglass&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I can connect iPad to Xbox 1 with Smartglass and control the Xbox.</p>
<p>However, I want to use the xbox to play the content from the ipad. Specifically, I want to use the IE browser so I can view video that requires Flash.</p>
<p>How do I find the iPad from the Xbox?</p>
<p>iPad is 4th generation, connected to home network via WiFi, and the Xbox&nbsp; is on the same network, but connected via ethernet.</p>

<p>By the way, are there any actual instructions for the Smartglass app? Everything is trial and error here with no guidance.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to whomever takes a look at this. If you could reply in plain language it would be helpful.</p>

<p>Hey Banana Tree 001,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not available on the Xbox One. You cant control from the console( Xbox one or Xbox 360) but you can control to the console. I cant seem to find information on how to control it for an Ipad but will be scouring the internet for an answer.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an update let us know while we search around ourselves.</p>

<p>Thanks for confirming &nbsp;the Smartglass operation. I saw this operate on Utube, but the Apple apparently does not have the functionality. Somebody with an Android said this machine has a physical button you push to reverse the displays so that the Xbox (360)
 can then display the tablet screen and project it on the tv.</p>
<p>Two other approaches I have tried, but with no success, to play videos on the Xbox One browser:</p>
<p>1) This was a suggestion to reconfigure Xbox browser for mobile apps (# Y / Settings / Select the "Use web pages formatted for mobile devices"). This did not work, as I was unable to display video dependent on the "flash" plug-in. The actual error was something
 like "Xbox one needs a application like an email program to load this web page". I assume it meant a flash plug-in.</p>
<p>2) This suggestion from Utube was to load an html5 formatted game (solitaire), play the game, then proceed to watch flash-based videos, that then work on the Xbox 360 browser. This did not work on Xbox One either, as the html5 game never loaded. I can not
 confirm that the Xbox one browser actually works with html5. Can anyone confirm this, or is this also a later or maybe update?</p>
<p>Summary: nothing I have done thus far allows me to use the Xbox one browser to surf for meaningful content, meaningful meaning - to watch videos of my choosing from around the world (translation: my wife to watch ice skating). The browser does display text-based
 messages fine, but not active content, unless specifically from Microsoft, and even then, just a subset (Silverlight not supported either, apparently).</p>
<p>If anyone finds a work-around, I would appreciate it. Guesses as to whether or not Microsoft will in the future allow the browser &nbsp;to display full web content would be appreciated.

<p>One additional comment - I found this description of the IE browser at gamespot.com:</p>
<p>"In addition, Microsoft has increased integration with Xbox SmartGlass so that players' smartphones and tablets can not only be used to navigate Internet Explorer on Xbox One, but also move websites back and forth between the TV and a mobile device."</p>
<p>This implies that, other than the iPad, someone thinks tablets can display web content on the Xbox 1 browser. Can anyone confirm this? Maybe I do just need another tablet. I would like to hear that it works before I buy one.</p>

<p>That description from GameSpot seems incorrect.</p>
<p>Currently, the browser on Xbox One does not support Flash (it is a dying platform, even Adobe has dropped almost all support for it), and there is no way to project the screen of any device onto the Xbox. You can plug anything into the HDMI in (such as a
 ChromeCast) and use that to stream content from another device's web browser.</p>
