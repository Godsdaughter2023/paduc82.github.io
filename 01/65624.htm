            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore back to before this happened : (You could run System Restore<br />
in regular Windows as well however it sometimes works better from Safe Mode - <br />
repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.)<br />

====================================<br />
<br />
Is it hanging at the Welcome Screen?<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp;<br />
RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you<br />
do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one.<br />
Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you retry System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

<h2>            Win 7 Ultimate installed w 4gb. won&#39;t boot now with 8gb&#39;s where&#39;s the link to MS RETURNS&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, I've tried everywhere.&nbsp; I have a Dell Dimension E510 Processor: Pentium D 3.2ghz; (2 DIMMS) Crucial 2gb DDR2 PC2-5300 already installed. The story goes like this:&nbsp; I was running Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit, and I went to Crucial.com to see what
 I could do to boost performance for Windows 7.&nbsp; So I bought 4 DIMMS of Crucial 2gb DDR2 PC2-5300, and I installed it on Windows Vista Ultimate (32bit) Low and behold Vista could "see" all eight gb's of RAM.&nbsp; Knowing full well that it couldn't USE all 8, but
 it did recognize it.&nbsp; SO I buy Windows 7 and it would just NOT install. So I took 2 DIMMS out, and to my amazement it worked.&nbsp; I figured I would put the other 2 DIMMS back in after install completed.......Nope.&nbsp; Windows will not boot.&nbsp; I get to the "Starting
 Windows Screen" and it just sits there.......until I press the power button to shut it off.&nbsp; This is ridiculous I have to install them in pairs, So what do I do with 4gb's of Crucial DDR

            This is probably a late reply but I had exactly the same issue. Changed from 4Gb DDR2 to 8Gb DDR2 800 RAM. Would not boot into Windows 7 64 bit, turns out in the BIOS with everything set to Auto it kept booting up as unganged RAM. Changed the settings
 &nbsp;in the bios to 800 ganged and no more issues booting into Windows 7.

<p>Check in your Mother Board's User's Manual how much RAM&nbsp;in total and how much per chip is allowed. In case of the ASUS K8V SE Deluxe Socket 754 mother board, for example you&nbsp;should not&nbsp;install 2 GB chips but&nbsp;a maximum of 3 times 1 GB. I.e.,. make sure that
 bigger than 512 MB memory chips are supported.&nbsp;It could explain why you cannot access the full memory.</p>

    <title>EPSON Scan exe installs a different program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomdowlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            EPSON Scan exe installs a different program</h2>
                    <p>I've got a real head scratcher for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my job we needed to scan some 35mm film negatives. I brought in my personal Epson Perfection V300 Photo scanner. I connected it to the computer I use at work which is a Dell Precision 5520 running Windows 10 Pro (Version 10.0.17134 Build 17134). I went
 to Epson's web site and it auto detected my PC and recommended the correct Epson Scan software and drivers. The install went as smooth as butter and the software worked perfectly. I really liked using the Epson Scan software because it gave me a ton of options
 to fine tune the scanner. The downloaded file from the Epson web site was named epson13534.exe and created the desktop icon below:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/339bde2d-626f-4d81-b95e-ec38e76839fa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/339bde2d-626f-4d81-b95e-ec38e76839fa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I copied the exe file from my work PC on to a external drive. When I got home, I copied the file off of the external drive and pasted it on my home PC, which is a Dell Optiplex 9010 that came installed with Windows 7 Professional. I had my PC upgraded to
 Windows 10 Pro on June 3, 2018, and everything has been working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran the install, everything seemed to go fine, but once the program was finished installing a different program ran. It installed a goofy program called "ABC Fast Directory" (I did an internet search and found the program at http://www.abcfastdirectory.com/).
 At first I thought maybe I clicked through the install too fast and accidentally installed additional software as some installs do. So I first uninstalled the ABC Fast Directory and started the Epson Scan install again, this time going slowly and checking
 to make sure I wasn't adding additional software. No dice, it installed the ABC Fast Directory again. I took a guess that maybe something went haywire with the exe, so I went back to the official Epson web site and downloaded the Epson Scan software. It did
 the exact same thing! It baffles me where the ABC Fast Directory is coming from! Any thoughts? Is it possible I have a virus that hijacks any exe attempt and changes it to install ABC Fast Directory instead of the original program? I guess I could try installing
 a different program and see if the ABC Fast Directory installs instead. Beats me. Thanks in advance for any thought or advice.</p>

            To rule out a virus/malware.
<br />Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>

<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

    <title>Uploading game Clips - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nachokid67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uploading game Clips</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to upload clips that are saved to my window 10 pc from the xbox app, it tells me that the xbox doesn't recognize the game. When I switched the gam to the game that I played it gave me the exact same error code message. I made sure that the game was spelled correctly and saw that my friends had clips uploaded from the same exact game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi nachokid67,</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Normally, you should be able to record game clips on your 
Windows 10 and&nbsp; upload it on the Xbox app. Let's try to isolate this 
issue so that we could figure out why you can't upload game clips. 
Kindly provide us the following information:</p><p><br /></p>
<ul><li>Can you tell us when did you notice this issue?</li><li>What is the title of the game where the game clips are captured?</li><li>Have you checked if your Windows 10 is updated?</li></ul>
<p><br /></p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you 
run the Windows app troubleshooter to scan and repair your XBox app on 
your computer. You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong>link</strong></em></a> to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Sorry, it is not advised by us to disable your&nbsp;Anti virus&nbsp;while running any kind of program. As it is a 3rd party AV, I am not surprised that you are having issues with it on Windows 10.</p>
<p>I would suggest you&nbsp;to&nbsp;uninstall&nbsp;kaspersky&nbsp;and use Windows&nbsp;Defender,&nbsp;or report this to Kaspersky so that they can fix it in the next release</p>

            Ok, where/when can I enter method 1? I've had this problem for @ a week now. I remember going to a questionable website the night before. The next night I started my laptop, it went to the bsod, it always tries to reboot after the first attempt which is
 when it tells me about the kernel. Then it goes to the option screen of doing things to try to fix the problem. It's a windows screen. I can go to a dos screen or an insyte "f8"screen. Do you know what I can do from there to get to the desktop? I can't do
 anything else on it at this time.&nbsp;

            <p>Ok, how do I get to the bios screen again? It's been awhile for me. I've been trying to tap f8 but that hasn't seemed to be working. I can go to a similar page "InsydeH20 Setup Utility" which seems to have the same info I've seen before in bios. There is
 a Boot tab, as well as: Main, Security, Power Management, and Advanced tabs. Under Security, it has ""BIOS Password".&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get rid of adserving.cpxinteractive adware...need easier instructions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This computer is not even a month old and I'm getting the above-named adware popups.&nbsp; They aren't horrible or always there, just certain sites. I've tried looking up other places on how to remove it.&nbsp; I know my way around a computer but I'm not tech savvy
 enough and don't feel comfortable enough trying&nbsp;all the solutions people are giving on other sites on how to remove this.&nbsp;
<u>I really would like to know if this&nbsp;adware is harmful or is it just annoying?</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Does it steal information?</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told to run Spybot S&amp;D and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.&nbsp; I also ran my McAfee and Microsoft's Security Scanner.&nbsp; Spybot S&amp;D initially
 came up with a Babylon search toolbar but with Spybot and my own doing that has been removed completely.&nbsp; After that all scans came back clean but I'm still stuck with the popups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Is system restore an option for this adware?</u>&nbsp; Since the computer is so "young" I don't really have anything on here yet that I'd be worried about losing.&nbsp; I'm usually so very good about not clicking on anything but with me not knowing Windows 7 (previous
 Windows XP user) I thought the window that opened about needing to run an update for a video plug in was okay, considering that again, this computer is new.&nbsp; So yes, my goof up.&nbsp; So can anyone maybe help me out? Thanks!!</p>

<h3> sanes84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Integrated Realtek HD AC97 audio device in a Fujitsu Siemens laptop produces distorted sounds and music</h2>
                    Sound and music played by the laptop are distorted like listening to a scratched CD or DVD. Sounds are crackling using the original laptop speakers or attached speakers or a headset, I guess its not hardware problem. I have an integrated Realtek AC97 sound
 card in a Fujitsu Siemens Esprimo laptop (1.5 years old). I have read other questions about this problem but the answers could not help. There were no problems with XP and Vista, now I use 7 Ultimate 32-bit.<br />
I have the most up to date sound driver (tried all from 2.29 to 2.40) and the latest BIOS, the troubleshooter did not find anything, I read "Tips for fixing common sound problems", I disabled all sound enhancements, set the default sound format to the lowest
 16 bit, configured speakers and I tried installing the driver in compatibility mode. Sounds and music become more distorted if an application runs in the background (eg. an antivirus).<br />
Maybe the laptop cannot handle W7? Shall I change some settings in the BIOS setup?<br />
Please help,<br />
Regards,
                </div>

<p><span>Hi,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows 7 Answers Forum!
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check for the error message when you try to run audio troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to update the drivers again for sound card, go to manufacturer’s website download the latest drivers for your sound card again, which are compatible with windows7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First run Playing
<strong>Audio troubleshooter</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Play Sound troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, click
<strong>Troubleshoot audio playback</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may try uninstalling the drivers for the sound card and then reinstalling the drivers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Device Manager, locate the device, right click on it and uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Let Windows 7 detect the drivers by itself and install. If that does not help, install the latest drivers<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further troubleshooting you need to contact your hardware manufacturer.</span></p>

<p>When "purchasing" a Xbox 360 (Games with Gold/other titles) you need to have a valid payment method. A credit or/and debit card, could always have your PayPal account linked to your LIVE account.</p>

                    These options were clearly defined in prior editions of windows. I guess we have to face the facts, they didn't think it mattered. If anyone finds away to change them holla.

            <p>Dig me and dig me real. All of those options are history in windows 10. What I use to do from 3.1 to 95 was to change a 95 option back to 3.1 . Maybe that's what needs to be done here. Maybe xp's sound cpl program will work in 10. Xp was the last edition
 that allowed you to change both start and exit sounds (clearly defined). We don't want to hear the "bells and whistles" windows chooses to provide. We want to make our own WAV file, impliment it and listen to it.</p>

<h3> kimgarrison  say:</h3>
<h2>            .NET-Broadcast &#38; CSpNotify Messages on Shutdown</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 on my desktop computer. When I shut down, ".NET-Broadcast..." and "CSpNotify" briefly appear. That's all I could read in such a short space of time. There's more to it. I've read forums on this subject and can say I am unaware of installing
 a .NET app. All the other posts were over 3 years old and did not refer to Windows 10. Something is eating a lot of data that I cannot ascertain as to what is the cause. I've performed the most comprehensive scan Malwarebytes Premium offers, used CCleaner
 to clean up my hard drive and have a defrag automatically performed on a weekly basis. I only had one Google background app running that I disabled. Can anybody out there help me?

            If your installation of Windows 10 is exhibiting strange behavior that doesn't seem to resolve through typical troubleshooting you may need to perform a "Repair Upgrade". This will reinstall windows over top of your existing installation and will preserve personal files and settings. Here is a detailed tutorial to follow<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            <p>You have a couple options for a temp workaround since this is a bug MS has to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set your computer to auto logon when waking from sleep (if that is something you are willing to do). Or use the ease of access keyboard to log in. You can also set a pin for logging in to make it quick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once logged in, open the Charms menu and press settings-&gt; keyboard-&gt; touch keyboard and handwriting panel. Does the onscreen keyboard now work in the proper input files if you go to the Metro IE or another Metro app?</p>

    <title>How to get no relationship in ME1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joily green  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get no relationship in ME1&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I would post this in the ME1 section, but didn't seem like many people went there. I was replaying ME1 after already completing it a few times so I could have no relationship, to have a good class for insanity on ME2 while still having all the story decisions
 still made completely by me. Even though I never talked romantically to any squadmates whatsoever, Ashley still came up to my Shepard as if I talked to her as much as I did to Liara (so I could continue the romance til ME3).</p>

<p>I looked before and someone said that if I talked to Ashley even once that she would be considered my romance option for ME1. So would not talking to her at all work? Though I was thinking now that I could just have her die instead of the other guy (completely
 forgot his name because I always had him die).</p>

<p>Does anyone know a sure way to not have a relationship in ME1? I'm doing this so I can have the relationship with Tali in ME2 without any consequences of having a relationship before in ME3. Thanks!</p>

<p>There's a couple of ways to have your Shepard 'available' for romance in ME2, if you import them from ME1. One option... never talk to Liara or Ashley at all. Choose the negative/renegade options if you do talk to them... Another option (one I've used often),
 deliberately talk to Ashley (Or Kaiden if your Shepard is Female) so as to 'lock' your Shepard into that relationship and don't speak to Liara at all. Then, on Virimire, sacrifice your 'locked' partner. I've done that myself, and it does work quite well.</p>

<p>So get the relationship to start, but sacrificing them on Virmire makes it where there is no relationship at all? I might just try to not talk to Ashley or Liara for the entire game. I am going to sacrifice Ashley on Virmire though because she has gotten
 annoying after a few play throughs.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>If you don't want to risk getting into a relationship with Ashley or Liara... don't speak to them during missions, and when you do (like back on the Normandy after Eden Prime and Ashley is in the medical bay with you), pick the middle/neutral option or lower
 right/renegade option. Following this, will ensure you won't be in a relationship with either of them, come ME2. IF you do speak to Ashley, sacrifice her on Virimire. With Liara... I'm pretty sure you can romance her in ME1... and in ME2 can choose whether
 to continue your relationship with her, or end it and remain friends.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the info! Think I have it figured out now. Hopefully it'll work out because Tali seems to be one of the most interesting characters to have a relationship with and with no consequences in ME3 is really good.</p>

<h2>            My computer memory keeps getting filled for no reason.</h2>
                    <p>My computer memory keeps filling up for no reason. I had like 10GB of memory left and it would periodically drop down to 24MBs before going back to normal. I cleared some space and now had 30GBs but now all that memory is lost and I have between 1-3GBs.<br />
Trying to see what was eating my memory, I went to see my storage and found I have about 50GB of temp files but when I went to check the temp folder it only has about 600MBs. I tried to clear the folder thinking I could clear some space but nothing is happening.
 Please help me because I think I'm losing my mind trying to find out what could be the problem.</p>
<p>What is eating my memory, how can I fix it and how can I clear the Temp files?</p>

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.
