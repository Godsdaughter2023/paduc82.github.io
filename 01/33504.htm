                    <div>Unfortunately, I was not aware of the problems with the 1903 update and downloaded it happily on two of my PCs and now my network is broken. They just do not talk and I have tried all the strange and wonderful solutions on the net, I can not backtrack
 this PC because it is a new and clean installation.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Does anyone know when Microsoft will fix this?</div>

            Hi, FrancineMoran
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection
<br />
<br />Restore all network adapters to repair your connection.
<br />
<br />Open the network and Internet settings in the Configuration application.
<br />
<br />The quickest way to do this is to right-click or long press the network icon in the notification tray and choose "Open network and Internet settings". The network icon looks different if you have an active cable connection or a wireless connection. The menu that opens is the same. Choose open network settings and the Internet.
<br />
<br />On the left side of the Network and Internet settings window, make sure you are in the Status category. Then, to the right, scroll to the end of the configuration list. There, you should see a link called "Restart the network." Click or tap on it.
<br />
<br />The Configuration application opens a view called Network Restart, which tells you that "This will remove and then reinstall all your network adapters, and will set other network components to their original settings. You may need to reinstall other software of networks, such as VPN, client software or virtual switches.
<br />
<br />If you agree with all that and want to continue restarting your network adapters, click or touch Reset now.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 asks you to confirm that you want to reset your network adapters. If you do so, click or touch Yes.
<br />
<br />If you went ahead and chose to reset your network adapters, Windows 10 informs you that your computer or device shuts down in 5 minutes. Close the notification and save whatever you are working on before this timer expires.
<br />

<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

Hi jucachaves<br />
<br />
Were you able to save folder and preview panes' before?<br />
<br />
(A). I would suggest you to run SFC scan and check if that helps.<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
2. Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
3. At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
&nbsp; sfc /scannow<br />
Check the below link for details:<br />
“How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7”<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a><br />
<br />
(B). Also try these steps and check.<br />
Click on Organize&gt;Folder Options, select View tab, scroll down and look for the option 'restore previous folder windows at logon' and place a check mark on it and click on Ok.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

            I'm able to save when not maximized. Noted the error just now.<br />
<br />
Tried System File Checker tool and 'restore previous folder windows at logon'. Both didn't work.<br />
<br />
I believe it's some kind of bug. I'm now finding several users asking about this on the internet.<br />
<br />
Does Microsoft know about this officially? I mean is there a team working on a fix for these annoying bugs?<br />

            I'm having the exact same problem here, and also only with maximized windows. Both options a and b didn't help.<br />
The "computer" screen saves the layout normally but every other screen just jumps back to the same large preview plane as in jucachaves' movie.<span>

<div>I found a simple solution. When this bug appears, you have to maximize the size of the explorer window, but not with the appropriate button. You have to enlarge the window manually. Then, you have to resize the preview pane. Then you can
 close the explorer window.<br />
<br />
Now, when you start again explorer, you can maximize it with the button. And suprise, it keeps the size of the preview pane.</div>

Un-install and re-install Eudora.&nbsp; If the installer asks you to <em>Choose Data Folder</em> , select
<strong>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Qualcomm\Eudora</strong> .&nbsp; If it doesn't ask you to choose, change the folder before running Eudora for the first time:<br />

1. Right-click the desktop Eudora shortcut.<br />

    <title>System image recovery without cd&#47;dvd drive in laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System image recovery without cd&#47;dvd drive in laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I created a system image backup on a ASUS ultrabook laptop (http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/U32VM/) after some juice was spilled over it. The image was made in Windows 8 OS and after it came from the repair shop I installed the same version of OS
 (the hard drive was formatted). I am trying to restore the old image. I am following these instructions: http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/9064-system-image-recovery-restore-image-computer-windows-8-a.html. I can successfully select the image (in my case
 from a hard drive). The next step however wants me to insert a windows recovery cd/dvd in order to continue. The problem is that the computer doesn't have a cd/dvd drive unit. Does anyone know a workaround (maybe with a usb or something)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help...<br />

                    <p>Hi. I’m not sure where to post this question, but here goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone who bought Halloween on 4K UHD had any issues with their 4k disc not working on their Xbox One S? I’ve bought the movie twice (from the same store) and had to return both of them due to the 4K disc not playing on my Xbox One S. Oddly enough, all
 my other 4K movies play fine.</p>

<p>Hey KRX8,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's an interesting issue that it's only that one movie that is not playing, but other 4K movies play fine. If you bought it twice then it may have something to do with the coding for that movie being difficult to decode by the optical disk drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do by any chance have a separate 4K movie player you can try it out on? Also what happens when you put the movie in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend to start with some basic troubleshooting on your Xbox like performing a complete

<p>Well, everytime I inserted the 4k discs, I constantly got a message saying something like, “Please insert another disc. This disc cannot be read.” As for other players, the Xbox One S is the only player I have to play my 4K movies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Admittedly, both 4K discs actually worked. 2-3 out of 10-12 times that is. Still, there’s some issue with the 4k discs I bought and eventually returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, the Halloween blu ray discs that come with the 4K discs worked fine.</p>

<p>Hey KRX8,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, it seem like it's one of those specific issues that don't have a go to fix. From the looks of it, it may just have been those two discs. Were both discs brand new? Maybe you can try to buy&nbsp;it from another store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to imagine there is any sort of issue with your Xbox as every other 4K movie works and the Blu-Ray version of that movie works as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the ambassador mentioned it works fine on his Xbox One X, so it wouldn't hurt to try some troubleshooting on your Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you done a complete <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle </a>on the Xbox already?</p>

<p>Yeah, they were from the same store. Debating whether to try one more time, this time from another store. My guess is they were bad batches.</p>

<p>Hey KRX8,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest if you want to give it one more try to get it from&nbsp;a different store as you mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I could recommend to troubleshoot your Xbox is to try a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a> as this will reset the operating system and have you re-download your profile, while keeping the games and apps installed. If you want to give it a shot, we can see if that will solve anything.</p>

<p>So I’m the only one after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting... So the movie works on other 4k players but not on the Xbox One S... It is the Xbox One S you have, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that’s the case, either Microsoft needs to put out an update to fix this or I may have to consider getting a new 4K player.</p>

<p>I have the xbox one x, sorry. All of my other 4k movies play fine as do all of my blu rays, and all of my game discs load fine. I happen to have access to a dedicated 4k blu ray player so I was able to test Halloween on that and it loaded every time. It
 did however load ONCE out of probably 50 attempts on the xbox one x so I at least got to watch it once.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reset my console as suggested and it didn't help at all. </p>

    <title>Repair disc does not recognize external USB hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haltaras  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repair disc does not recognize external USB hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I made a system image of Windows 7 Professional 64-bit&nbsp;(Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Maintenance &gt; Backup and Restore &gt; Create a system image) and placed it on an external hard drive (Samsung S2 Portable 3 USB Device). Then I made a repair disc (Start &gt; All Programs
 &gt; Maintenance &gt; Create a System Repair Disc). In order to see whether I could restore the image using the repair disc, I booted the computer from the repair disc and clicked the appropriate tabs.</p>
<p>Up to this point everything worked without a hitch. The problem is that the repair disc does not recognize the external HDD and therefore does not find the image. As a result,&nbsp;I am left without the possibility of restoring the system image if the hard drive
 is damaged of if Windows does not boot.</p>
<p>The Samsung S2 Portable is a common&nbsp;external hard drive natively recognized by Windows, just not by the repair disc. The program loaded from the repair disc gives the possibility to add drivers but the Samsung HDD doesn't come with a driver nor does the
 Samsung web site provide one for Windows, presumably because Windows includes the driver. I tried to install various drivers from C:\Windows\inf\usbstor.inf but without success.
</p>
<p>I have read all the entries in this forum on the subject of repair disc. No one mentions this problem. It must be particular to my computer. To what may this be due? How do I begin to look for the solution?</p>

            Sorry, I misunderstood you - I thought you had resolved your problem. Since I do not know what's going on, we need to drill a little deeper.<br />
<ul>
<li>You wrote "The repair disc does not recognize the external HDD and therefore does not find the image". Since I have seen several cases of the image restore process being unable to detect an existing image file, I need to make very sure that the WRE (Windows
 Repair Environment) fails to detect the external disk. Did you try to open a Command Prompt while in the WRE? If so, what drives can you see with the Dir command? Could one of them be your image disk?</li><li>Does the WRE detect other USB devices, e.g. a flash disk? Buy one if you do not have one - they cost next to nothing.</li><li>Did you try different USB ports while in the WRE?</li><li>I am not sure if the WRE can dynamically detect the arrival of USB devices. Best to connect them before booting up.</li></ul>
<br />
As a final note I might add that I am unimpressed by the Windows image facility. Its functionality is very basic, its image files consume twice the amount of disk space than those created by third-party products and it features far too prominently in these
 forums, either because it refuses to recognise a certain disk as a target for its image file or it fails to detect an existing image file. Most third-party products run circles around the native tool. Most let you burn a rescue CD that avoids your current
 problem. Some are free, others are sold for a moderate price.<br />
<br />
In other words, you could solve your current problem in one fell swoop by spending perhaps $50.00.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Account Connecting to LinkedIn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris lodge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account Connecting to LinkedIn</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>

<div>
<p>I am receiving emails from Microsoft telling me that I need to Reconnect to LinkedIn.
<br />
However when I try to reconnect I initially get the message:<br />
"We're having trouble connecting to this service. This problem can usually be fixed if you connect again."<br />
I then choose Connect LinkedIn, re-enter my LinkedIn account details and get the following message:<br />
"There seems to be a problem connecting this service to your Microsoft account at the moment. Please try again later"</p>
<p>Any ideas ?</p>
</div>

<div>Kind regards,<br />
Chris</div>

<p><b>We Think It Started With:</b> The Xbox 360 (2005)</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 is pretty much singlehandedly responsible for popularizing the concept of awarding achievements to gamers for completing specific challenges, such as defeating an enemy or completing a level or owning an Xbox 360 for four years without it breaking
 down.</p>

<span>"Achievement unlocked! You have just wasted $300 bucks."</span></p>
<p>The difference with in-game rewards like unlocking a hidden part of the game or finding a hidden item is that these so-called achievements have no real impact on the game itself. The "trophies" are posted directly to the player's online profile, meaning
 that the whole point is proving to people in the real world that, yes, you do play a lot of video games. Both PlayStation and Steam have been using the same system since 2008, and even Nintendo has incorporated it on a few games.</p>
<p><b>Actually Been Around Since:</b> <i>Pitfall</i> and other Activision games (1982)</p>

<p>That's right, freakin' <i>Pitfall</i> had unlockable achievements, much like <i>
Halo</i> or whatever, and most people who played it probably never even knew it.</p>

<p>Back in the days of the Atari 2600, Activision would give out challenges requiring players to reach a certain amount of points or complete a level within a time limit -- for instance, getting 20,000 points in
<i>Pitfall</i> or 10,000 in <i>Chopper Command</i>. But wait, how did you prove your achievement to Activision without an Internet connection? Easy: you had to take a photo of your television screen and mail it to them as evidence of your gaming expertise.
 You could also record the image on a VCR, probably, but then you'd have to go through the mental stress of having to choose between a VHS or a Betamax tape.</p>

<span>Our point being: This was a <i>long</i> time ago, guys.</span></p>
<span>Our point being: This was a <i>long</i> time ago, guys.</span></p>
<p>If you met the requirements, you would then get a letter from Activision telling you how awesome you were. Oh, and some of them were
<i>signed by Pitfall Harry himself:</i></p>

<span>"PS: I apologize for my shoddy handwriting, but I am currently being knocked down by a barrel."</span></p>
<p>Big deal, right? All this accomplished was proving to your friends that you knew how to use a typewriter. Well, that's not all: Along with every letter, you would also receive a special patch as a token of your achievement. There were a total of 43 patches
 for 33 different Activision games, and some of them were kinda awesome:</p>

<p>Activision was, at some point, receiving more than 2,000 letters <i>every day</i>, and according to
<i>Pitfall</i>'s creator, the bulk of those letters were kids demanding their badges.
<i>Pitfall</i> alone led to <a href="http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_David_Crane.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
14,000 letters in a single week.</a> It got so ridiculous that Activision had to hire employees just to open and answer the letters. So if these achievements were so popular, how come we're only hearing about them now? The obvious explanation is that these
 were actually the same 10 or so players, obsessively getting as many "trophies" as possible so they could show them off to their gamer friends.</p>

            Hello YUSUFKURUPKAR,
<br />
<br />Lets try some troubleshooter:
<br />The basics:
<br />Connect your Mouse to another PC and see if it’s works
<br />If it’s a USB mouse then try to connect it to a different USB port.
<br />Try to check mouse scrolling in a different program, see if the scrolling problem occurs in some particular programs or application.
<br />In case of wireless mouse, pair it again with the computer and check the batteries
<br />
<br />Enable and disable scroll inactive windows a few times
<br />Go to Settings &gt; select Devices &gt; Mouse &amp; Touchpad
<br />Go to the Scroll Inactive Windows option and disable it. Wait for a few seconds and then enable it again. Repeat this action a few times and then check of the mouse wheel is responsive on Chrome.
<br />
<br />Sometimes 3rd party software can conflict with Windows and can cause the delay in Mouse Scroll. So lets try perform a clean boot
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />

<br />2.Expand Mice and other pointing devices and then right-click on your device and select Update driver.
<br />3.First, select “Search automatically for updated driver software” and wait for it to automatically install latest drivers.
<br />4.If the above fails to fix the issue then again follow the above steps except but on the Update driver screen this time choose “Browse my computer for driver software.“
<br />5.Next, select “Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer.“
<br />6.Select the appropriate driver and click Next to install it.
<br />7.Reboot your PC to save changes.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Mouse Drivers
<br />1.Press Windows Key + R then type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter to open Device Manager.
<br />2.Expand Mice and other pointing devices and then right-click on your device and select Uninstall.

<br />
<br />Re-install Synaptics
<br />1.Type Control in the Windows Search then click on Control Panel.
<br />2.Then select Uninstall a program and find Synaptics (or your mouse software for example in Dell laptops there is Dell Touchpad, not Synaptics).
<br />3.Right-click on it and select Uninstall. Click Yes if asked for confirmation.
<br />4.Once the uninstallation is complete reboot your PC to save changes.
<br />5.Now go to your mouse/touchpad manufacturer website and download the latest drivers.
<br />6.Install it and reboot your PC. See if you’re able to Fix Mouse Scroll Not Working On Windows 10.
<br />
<br />4. Run SFC Scan &amp; DISM

<p>I created my xbox account years ago using a mail that i was using as a teen. At some point that hotmail got a virus or something and seeing as how i wasn't using it, the mail was deleted/changed/i lost acsess to it. When i tried to get it back it seemed
 the mail had been taken by someone else, the security question and the secondary mail was all different from mine. Back then I didn't really care because i wasn't using the mail anyways and up until now i have always been playing xbox offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had, mistakenly, believed that the password etc for my xbox account was different from that of my hotmail but when i tried to connect to live the other day, the password was changed there too. I tried using the tool to recover your account or whataver,
 but seeing as how someone else is using my old mail it's literally impossible for me to answer the questions. I'm not even interested in getting my mail back, but my gamertag and xbox profile is NOT something i want someone else having acsess to and its also
 not something i want to give up. And even if i made a new one, the new owner of the mail could theoritcally log onto my xbox account, right?</p>
<p>I have no clue what to do. I really just want my gamer tag removed from an account that is no longer even mine. I'm also really annoyed at the fact that my mail was just deleted without my say so leaving me with accounts that i have used money on that is
 now someone elses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can i do to get my gamertag free from this account?</p>

    <title>LG HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color issue &#40;Screen flickering&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pastystuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            LG HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color issue &#40;Screen flickering&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an Xbox One S for the 4k Blu-ray capabilities, but I seem to be having some problems with the Xbox detecting the TV properly. &nbsp;When I turn on HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color, I'm able to set my TV to 10-bit. &nbsp;According to my TV manual, I should be good
 for 50, 59.94, and 60hz, but the Xbox says 50hz isn't working. &nbsp;Also, on the Xbox One S 4k and HDR troubleshooting guide, it lists Ultra HD Deep Color as another name for HDR. &nbsp;When I look at the 4k TV details page, it says HDR for games and apps is turned
 off. &nbsp;To Turn it on, back up and select Allow HDR. &nbsp;Only problem is, I can't select that option. &nbsp;Now, I have this option turned on to get better color output on the TV, but the biggest problem is that when Ultra HD Deep Color is turned on, the screen flashes
 black pretty frequently or a white flash will come up on the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;When I turn Ultra HD Deep Color off, then the flickering goes away, but then I can't do 10-bit video. &nbsp;Has anyone else had this issue?</p>

<p>I have an LG as well and have enabled UHD Deep Colour. On my set that only works on HDMI port 3 but it does show all options available *except* HDR once selected.
</p>
<p>Like you it says to go back and select it on the previous screen when you go into the details page but on the previous screen the option is greyed out.
</p>
<p>I don't know if HDMI is not auto-detecting the TV's capabilities or whether LG need to update the TV to report it differently or whether there is a setting I am just missing.</p>
<p>I haven't had the black flickering every now and again though. I have my colour option set to 12 bit if that helps?</p>

<p>FWIW I'm having the same flickering problem on an LG 27UD68 monitor when Ultra HD Deep Color is enabled. I'm fairy certain this option is *not* the same as HDR, though; my monitor does not support HDR, but does support 10-bit color (in theory, at least).</p>
<p>The other downside of disabling Ultra HD Deep Color is that it seems to disable 4k 60Hz mode -- the reason I had the option enabled in the first place is that I use 4k 60Hz output from my PC. UHD Blu Rays should only need 4k at 24Hz though, as far as I know,
 so I guess I'll just disable the option for now when using my Xbox.</p>

<p>"Ultra HD Deep Color" is listed as compatiable on the troubleshooting page:</p>

<p>Quick note though - probably just for OP - I found this in my TV manual that means his model might need to be HDMI2?</p>
<p>--Below is quote from manual --</p>
<p>HDMI3* port supports UHD Deep Colour.</p>
<p>If the device connected to HDMI3* also supports UHD Deep Colour, your picture may be clearer.
</p>
<p>However, if the device doesn’t support it, it may not work properly.</p>
<p>In that case, connect the device to a different HDMI port or change the TV’s UHD Deep Colour setting to OFF.
</p>
<p>*LA965, LA97, LA98, and LM96 models are supported in HDMI 2 only.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses, everyone. &nbsp;I have checked with my TV manual and the TV setup menu and HDMI 1 is the port on my TV for Ultra HD Deep Color. &nbsp;I'm not sure why the flickering is happening. &nbsp;I'm going to try and get in touch with LG and Microsoft today
 to see if they can shed any light on the situation. &nbsp;It's a really frustrating issue, that's for sure! &nbsp;Hopefully it's a simple firmware update for the Xbox or TV that will fix it in the future. &nbsp;I'm guessing Microsoft couldn't test the 4k capabilities with
 every 4k TV on the market, so there have to be some quirks out there that I'm sure will be fixed with future updates.</p>

<p>I having &nbsp;a similar issue too with my LG OLED65E6P, when I turn the Deep Colors I will get the same error of 50hz 10bit not supported and I'm not able to turn the xbox 1S to 4k display, however you can still play 4k BD &nbsp;HDR content no problem. Someone mention
 in another forum they did full reset and was able to solve the problem. I have not try that yet, hope someone find solution quick.

<p>As far as the flickering you guys experiencing sounds like HDMI hand shake, make sure you guys using high speed cables and if using an AVR make sure the HDMI connectors are 2.0a</p>

<p>Thanks for the input, Wishkid. &nbsp;I will try a full reset when I get home to see what happens. &nbsp;I am currently using the HDMI cable that came with the console and have it plugged directly from the console to the TV with Optical audio out going to a Vizio sound
 bar with 5.1 surround, so shouldn't be any kind of interference from other devices there. &nbsp;It's so hard to find out the HDMI specs of my TV as LG didn't post much information on it, but I bought it November 2015, so I'm assuming it's the latest spec, especially
 since it does handle 10-bit video. &nbsp;If anyone else has an LG 60UF7300, I'd love to hear your experience with this as well!</p>

<p>Pastystuff,</p>
<p>I am assuming the HDMI could be 2.0 since it only supports 4k not HDR, the HDMI 2.0a was introduce mid last year to support the HDR feature also the 7 series is their mid range TV, they may left it out. Check the built date on the sticker if I'm not mistaken
 the model sounds like the 2014, because the 2015 model are UH. I'm almost positive the
</p>
<p>HDMI issues your having is the connection with the TV. I had similar issue with my AVR I had to skip it because the HDMI is 2.0 not a, and this year they introduce the 2.0b which now support 18GBps. So much for this freaking technology I hate to be changing
 stuff to make everything work correctly. You may need to get a 'new TV and my a new AVR which I'm planning to change in October, luckly I waited for the 4K I just got my tv two weeks ago and they clearly advertised the HDR and the HDMI2.0a. Good luck friend
 keep posting and thanks for starting this </p>
<p>thread hopefully we find a solution.</p>

<p>I just spoke with an LG chat agent who confirmed the TV has HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2. &nbsp;They also said that since the TV is flickering, it means that the console doesn't support Ultra HD Deep Color. &nbsp;Since Microsoft lists that as a name for HDR10, I'm going
 to contact them when I get home from work to see if they have any solutions as to why it isn't working properly with that feature turned on on my TV. &nbsp;Even if it can't display HDR, it should still be able to handle the 10-bit signal from the Ultra HD Deep
 Color. &nbsp;I'll update if I find anything else out from Microsoft. &nbsp;It's also odd, because the console doesn't auto-detect 4k and I had to manually turn it all on. &nbsp;When I select HDMI from the dropdown menu to override the console auto-detect that isn't working,
 it displays the image at a stretched 640x480 resolution. &nbsp;I may toy around with that a bit more as well to see what's going on.</p>

            <p>Hello Jon</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I did find a fix in my particular problem. By accident actually.
</p>
<p>The change to <strong>software rendering instead of&nbsp;GPU rendering </strong>worked!</p>
Problem: YouTube and other video sites aren’t working in Edge
<ul>
<li>Try clearing various Edge data by clicking the “. . .” and choosing <strong>Settings</strong>. Then, click “choose what to clear” under
<strong>Clear browser data</strong>, and delete your browsing history and cached files. Restart Edge and see if&nbsp;that resolves the problem.</li><li>Make sure you’ve installed the latest drivers for your graphics card, and that Windows is up to date.</li><li>If that doesn’t work, head to the&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>View network status and tasks</strong>, and select i<strong>nternet options</strong>. Afterward, head&nbsp;to the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab and check <strong>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering</strong>. This should alleviate the problem.</li></ul>

<p>Hi Sergei, I tried using skype 12.13.257.0 in Windows 10 but this one does not have the tools menu. Now, I have installed the classic version (7.40.0.151) and I was able to change the setting to "Anyone" to allow calls (see screenshot). However, I still
 could not contact my skype number using my regular phone just to test it. Any idea?</p>

            <p>Hi K3Pop, I am having the same issue. I wanted to start using Quicken but also wanted to convert all my years worth of data of using Money 2002 over. Per the conversion instructions, I upgraded to Money Plus Sunset Deluxe (which in the process also uninstalled
 Money 2002 from my computer). When Money Plus Sunset Deluxe was installed, I tried to open my existing Money file, it opened a dialog box saying Converting File... Working and then no response for long time. I see in the task manager that the Money thread
 is not responding so essentially the process has hung up. I have tried shutting down the process and restarting several time and it hangs up each time. Now I cant convert to Quicken nor does my computer have Money 2002 anymore. So I cant figure out what to
 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if you found a solution of Money hanging up while converting/upgrading. I will really appreciate response from others as well who might have some knowledge or experience of going through this and resolving it. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>

    <title>No access to Microsoft account after factory reset without wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucebey  say:</h3>
<h2>            No access to Microsoft account after factory reset without wifi</h2>
                    I just did a factory reset on an older computer (Dell XPS 12), and it went back to Windows 8 (I think). It comes up with my Microsoft account name and request for password. I enter my Microsoft Account password, but I get the message: "You must be online
 the first time to complete your account set up". The problem is that that I'm offline on that computer because the wifi isn't set up yet. Furthermore, there is no option to log on to a local account. (My account is fine and my password is fine, and working
 on other computers.) I have no wifi connection icon on that logon screen, and no ability to change users. Nothing. There's only ease-of-access icon, and the power off icon, and the request for password for my account. Any suggestions?

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened is, after the reset your computer downgraded to the original operating system and wiped the information of your local account associated with your Microsoft account and Internet. Here are our options:<br />
<br />
<strong>Option 1: Connect your computer to the Internet.</strong><br />
Even if you haven't configured the device to connect to your Wi-Fi yet, you can do so on the lock screen by clicking the small monitor icon. It will show a list of network you can join in, then add the password. Otherwise, use an Ethernet cable to connect your
 laptop to the modem/router.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 2: Enable the built-in Administrator account.</strong><br />
<em>Step 1: Enable the Built-in Administrator account: </em><br />
Press the <strong>Shift</strong> key, then Restart your computer to access Safe Mode. Access the Command Prompt (Admin) and type:
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong> (To enable Built-in Administrator account give the command Active: No) and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
<em>Step 2: Administrator Account.</em><br />
Log in to the built-in admin account and create a new admin account. See if you can log in the new admin account.<br />
<br />
If you are able to, then deactivate the built-in administrator account. Let us know how it went or what worked for you.<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

            Good suggestions, but what I finally managed to do was re-start the whole process, and got to a different place that somehow gave me the wifi icon that I could use to log onto. The rest was straightforward.

<p>Hello Xylee, I tried that. I eventually had to take my laptop to Bestbuy for the Geek Squad to look it at. I wanted them to roll back to the previous version, however, they could not do that due to some files that were missing after I allowed a couple Microsoft&nbsp;techs
 to have remote access. I'm over it now, I will be getting an Apple PC next time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

<h2>            Ridiculous price of on demand games</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Does anyone actually buy on demand games??&nbsp; The prices are utterly ridiculous - you can buy these games in the shops for a fraction of what M$ are selling them for - and obviously that includes the box,disk &amp; manuals.&nbsp; Wake up for gods sake M$ - why should
 someone pay more that what they would in a shop &amp; waste an hour of their bandwidth, for an electronic download only??&nbsp; These on demand games should be around £10.00,

<p>Agree, most of the pricing is far higher than it should be. But I believe the game developer sets the price. Also, I don't think Microsoft wants to get the retailers off side by under cutting them with the price. When game consoles go download only I think
 us gamers are in for a torrid time, high pricing probably then being the norm.</p>

<p>The only exception to that is when you get a game like Tales of Vesperia which is quite difficult to obtain unless you are prepared to pay an even more ridiculous price for it elsewhere such as on ebay.</p>

<p>It's not all MS is fault, the publisher is the one that sets the price for its downloadable games. &nbsp;If you buy a game from On Demand, MS only takes a cut, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>Take a look at On demand PC games from the likes of EA, Steam and Direct2drive. &nbsp;Yes, these games cost more than their disc counterparts, it's the way the industry works, allways has been. &nbsp;</p>
