<h2>            Install HP Laserjet 2100 at Windows 10 &#40;1803&#41; over a prallel to usb adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>last weekend I set up a new computer (Dell Inspiron 24) and I wanted to install my HP Laserjet 2100 on it. First I updated Windows 10 to the newest version (1803) and did all updates and I although installed the latest driver for the Laserjet from the hp.com
 homepage. But it refuses to work.</p>
<p>I took some screenshots to make the problem clearer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the settings under devices and the under printers &amp; scanners and there I don't find the laserjet, I only find the IEEE-1284 Controller which is connected to the laserjet, but therefor no driver is found. even if I move over the control panel there it
 states the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96623601-e34f-4975-891a-f950706b0b55?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96623601-e34f-4975-891a-f950706b0b55?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edf09f4e-414f-4d97-8b6c-fb777eec8eb0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edf09f4e-414f-4d97-8b6c-fb777eec8eb0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>although if I take a look in the properties of the item I find that the driver for the IEEE-1284 controller is missing. But I can find the dirver for the HP laserjet 2100.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb67a04a-7989-4146-a07f-f34f9656532a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb67a04a-7989-4146-a07f-f34f9656532a?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64bc2f94-1fd0-4d34-b6f0-072564025622?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64bc2f94-1fd0-4d34-b6f0-072564025622?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I already know that there is an issue to change the port settings (https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/LaserJet-Printing/Installing-a-HP-LaserJet-2100-for-Windows-10/td-p/5295727) in order to get the laserjet working. But where can I change that and does this
 solve my problem?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Maybe someone can help getting my laserjet 2100 to work. Thank you.</p>

            Did you use the drivers from the link below?
<br />Before you try those drivers fully remove all IEEE devices from your device manager.

            Thank you for your reply. Yes I used those drivers. And as you can see in the screenshot the computer recognizes that there is the hp laserjet 2100 installed and it states that the device is working properly.

            Unfortunately many users experiencing printer issues with 1803 update.
<br />Even after troubleshooting drivers etc.
<br />You have 2 options wait it out until a new update that may fix and keep trying HP site for any new drivers.
<br />Or rollback to 1709 version.
<br />
<br />I am very sorry but 1803 is horrible with printers.

            Hi Imran. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br /> 
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

            Hi  Imran, I am Rob, an independent and a 12 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />The real issue is the BSOD which needs to be resolved first.
<br />
<br />rtwlane.sys is the Realtek WiFI driver.
<br />
<br />Check with the System/Motherboard maker for updated versions.
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Hi Imran
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model? HP makes different model computers.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network Adapters 
<br />Select the Network card listed,
<br />Select Update Driver
<br />This should give you a choice of drivers - select the oldest one 
<br />Wait a few minutes while it installs the old driver
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I dont know how to install german spellchecker in windows live mail 2009.</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have windows live mail 2009 in Spanish and therefore there is spellchecker for Spanish but also for English, and I have found out how to install Danish spellchecker also. But I wish to get also German spell checker.</p>
<p>I have found in my Microsoft office map two necessary files mssp3ge.dll and mssp3gea but I still need also a spellchecker with contents like the following:</p>
<p>[spellchecker]</p>
<p>Engine=mssp3ge.dll</p>
<p>Lex=mssp3ge.lex</p>
<p>lang=xxx (dont know number for German edition precisely)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The prf name of spanish map is prf000a(with sub map 7), the english is prf0009(with sub map 7) and the danish is prf0006(with sub map 2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW for German language what will be prf map name, AND what will be name of sub map and finally what is the spell checker contents, especially what is "lang" number like in above sample?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I really hope that somebody can help me to install German spell checker in windows live mail 2009. I have already in my Word programme, and thats why I could mention those two files above but missing correct content for spellchecker.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade problems</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Dell Inspiron 2320 All-in-one 5-yrs ago with Windows 7 Home pre-installed and got the free upgrade to Windows 10 (ver. 1511) 2 years ago.i tried to upgrade to the latest version because of security concerns but fell victim to the " Attempting
 to recover installation... Restoring your previous version of Windows." endless loop.</p>
<p>I was able to create a windows.iso on a DVD but Repair and Restore didn't work and upgrade only gets me back into the loop.&nbsp; A clean install requires the Windows product code which I don't have.&nbsp; I have the Windows 7 reinstallation DVD, which came with the
 computer.</p>
<p>What are my options?</p>

            Hi Paul, if you boot from the Installation Media a clean install does not require a product key - you can skip those steps  . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />IIMPORTANT
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            Hi Paul.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You do not need a Product Key to reinstall Windows 10 Upgrade.  It assigned permanent Digital License to your PC when it was first upgraded so you can reinstall as often and in any way you want the same licensed version.  Just skip the key during install and it will activate afterwards.
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Be sure to follow the illustrated steps to boot the media, delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let the installer create and format the needed partitions and begin - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue any files not backed up:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Tried a clean install.&nbsp; The step asking for "I am reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC"&nbsp;&nbsp;never appears.. I clicked on "I don't have a product key"&nbsp; Selected Windows 10 Home then upgrade and not Custom install.&nbsp; The I got a Compatibility Report that the of
 option isn't available if you start your computer using the Windows installation media&nbsp; and if a copy media Windows is already on the computer and you want to upgrade, remove the installation media and restart hyour computer.&nbsp; After Windows has started normally
 insert the media and run setup.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got to Setup is Starting and right back to the screen asking for the product key.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>I chose the regular Upgrade instead of Custom because I didn't want to jeopardize losing data, apps, settings, having to reinstall programs, etc.&nbsp; I did recently copy my Documents and Downloads folder files and will double-check to make sure and then reconsider
 the Custom install.</p>

            <p>It is <i>extremely </i>unlikely that the hal.dll file is really missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>That error message usually just means that XP can't find the file either because of some corruption in your NT File System (NTFS), or something has buggered your boot.ini file and XP is being told to look for the file in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp;(this includes plug pulling, power buttons and battery removal).</p>
<p>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to start trying to start trying to edit or copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and running chkdsk on your&nbsp;drives may resolve your issue entirely.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>I always assume that nobody has any kind of bootable media or whatever they have is not going to work, so it is best to make your own bootable media so you can be sure what you have.<br />
</p>
<p>You need to start by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a CD you can make (no XP media required) and run a chkdsk with error correction enough times until it runs clean and if that doesn't work, you can create a new boot.ini file (it is usually one
 of those two things).</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<br />
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

            <p>What version of windows do you have 32bit or 64bit, and what specific game?</p>
<p>Is the game listed on<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this</a> site as being compatible or not?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can try running the game/or its installer in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/316-compatibility-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> XP compatibility mode</a> as XP SP3 (or W98se if its that old a game) that
<em>may</em> help getting it to run. Assuming you manage to download it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WRT 'wing32.dll' this helped with one game when the wing32.dll file was actually in the 'wing' folder on the game disc:</p>
<p>"explore the games cd (or image) and go to the "wing" folder and copy the wing32.dll file and place it in either your (1) Games installation folder (where the exe file to run the game is), or if that doesn't work then try (2) windows system32 folder and
 in the syswow64 folder.</p>

<p>Thanks Chuck,</p>
<p>Ran into this yesterday afternoon,</p>
<p>Tried&nbsp;ending <strong>wlsetup-all.exe</strong> and it completed.&nbsp; Also got&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;other updates immediately after that and they went without a hitch.</p>
<p>Checked the "View Update History" and KB2434419 was listed as successful as well as the others that came after it.</p>
<p>However, a few minuets later (maybe 10) KB2434419 came back as an important update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned by Jason H,&nbsp;the second window&nbsp;asks if you want to install the updates for the&nbsp;currently installed programs or upgrade to the full version of&nbsp; windows live and then update.</p>
<p>I don't remember what I chose the first time, but there was an error about another program that was installing and to wait until it finished then retry.</p>
<p>When it reappeared the second time I chose to upgrade and install updates for all the programs and again the same error and again it hung at 50%.</p>
<p>Went back to Task Manager and ended <strong>wlsetup-all.exe </strong>and again after a few minuets it reappeared.</p>
<p>ON the third try I chose to only install updates for the currently installed programs and it went without any issues&nbsp;or errors.</p>
<p>It's listed as successful three times also.&nbsp; It has been about 6 hours now and&nbsp;KB2434419 has not reappeared.</p>
<p>Maybe this has something to do with the updates being applied at the same time the upgrade is being installed .&nbsp; What do you think Jason?</p>

<p>Hello RReillySeaIsland,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.&nbsp; When this install starts, a second window is opened in the background that asks if you would like to upgrade or perform a full install of the software.&nbsp; This occurs at 50% and is likely the reason that your install appears to freeze.&nbsp;
 Once the choice is made, the install should continue as planned.&nbsp; Please let us know if this did or didn't help to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<br />
<br />Did you download the DDST drivers form the support page on the Ricoh website:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://support.ricoh.com/bb/html/dr_ut_e/re2/model/sp203sf/sp203sf.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.ricoh.com/bb/html/dr_ut_e/re2/mo...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have already tried to install those drivers, what is the exacterror you see when you try that?

<p>I know some of those were awarded from a limited time offer. You just enrolled in the program and you could download the gamer pics. I tried it, but apparently it was only open to residents of Canada. I used to be able to find the link on this site, but
 it appears it's no longer there. I know where are 3rd party sites where you can d/l Gamer Pics, but I have never tried them.</p>

<p>I was not aware of that, but now that you mention it, it makes sense. 3rd party Gamer Pic would be a bad idea.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Won&#39;t Start First Boot, But Always After CTRL-Alt-Del - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epicnoise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Won&#39;t Start First Boot, But Always After CTRL-Alt-Del</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this happens every time I do a fresh boot from an unpowered state. &nbsp;I have done a Shut Down, let the computer boot down, and turned off the power strip to save electricity. &nbsp;When I do a fresh boot, I get to the Windows logo and the spinning wheel of progress,
 which then starts to slow, and eventually lurches to a stop and start state -- imagine a lag situation with graphics. &nbsp;The HDD light shows there's some activity there, but it doesn't get any further. &nbsp;If I press CTRL-Alt-Del, it goes through the bootup process
 with no problems, every time, the wheel spinning fluidly. &nbsp;Any idea what is causing this, and what I can do to have it boot correctly the first time, every time? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Windows 10 Large tile screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lk54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Large tile screen</h2>
                    I updated one of my laptops to windows 10 but haven't had the time to really dig into it. However it appears to me they eliminated the screen that has the larger tiles on it and put access to it on the lower left hand side using a windows icon. Does anyone
 feel that this is going to be an issue for those that enjoy easy access to all there apps especially for those using a touch screen device like a windows tablet? As I mentioned I haven't had time to really check out windows 10 so if there is a way to bring
 back access to that screen please explained it to me. I'd prefer to have the option.&nbsp;

            I as many others using Microsoft update KB4090913 download, but unable to continue or permitted with the install. A&nbsp;roll back&nbsp;prior to previous install is the norm. I note my update now shows 10 attempts has been carried by Windows to install KB4090913,
 but&nbsp;remains in this state. What is happening? any solutions? According to Windows 10 a major update is due in April 2018, will this also be a gigantic headache for us users?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            When this failed and roll back, it collect log files and if you share to submit logs to Microsoft, they will be reviewed by Windows team. However, you may open Feedback Hub app and report this issue to make sure Windows team view this issue.

I am having exactly the same issue. Tried troubleshooter 3 times and the "corrections" it made (same each time) did not help. Even tried system restore which failed.&nbsp; My last successful update is KB4074588 version 16249.248.&nbsp; I show 17 unsuccessful install
 attempts on the March update (kb4088776) but it has only been the last week that I find my laptop has not automatically restarted and needs a manual one.&nbsp; Maybe April updates will correct🤞

            Hi Ozgott,
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. We would like to help you promptly.
<br />
<br />
<br />This issue might occur if the power plan is not configured correctly. I would suggest you to restore default settings for the power plan and then change the settings. 
<br />
<br />But, let me ask, have you made any update recently?
<br />
<br />After upgrading from an older version of the Windows Operating System to Windows 10, or even after upgrading from an older build of Windows 10 to a newer one, quite a few users start experiencing a variety of problems, chief among them being their computer going to sleep after 1-4 minutes of inactivity. For some affected users, their computers go to sleep after 2 minutes, whereas some affected users have reported 3-4 minutes of inactivity triggering the problem in their case. This seems to happen even if an affected user has set their computer to go to sleep after a longer period of time, which is why this problem can be quite troubling.
<br />
<br />Now, I would like to kindly ask you to perform a few troubleshooting. Would you?
<br />
<br />Solution 1: Resetting and then re-configuring your power settings
<br />
<br />In most cases, the root of this problem are customized power plan settings – if you have custom power settings and you upgrade to a newer version of Windows, the new Operating System may not be able to cope with and support your custom power settings and, as a consequence, cause your computer to go to sleep after every 1-4 minutes of inactivity. If this is what is causing this issue in your case, you can fix it by resetting and then re-configuring your power settings. To do so, you need to:
<br />
<br />Open the Start Menu.
<br />Click on Settings.
<br />Click on System.
<br />Navigate to Power &amp; sleep in the left pane.
<br />In the right pane, click on Additional power settings.
<br />Select Choose when to turn off the display.
<br />Click on Change advanced power settings.
<br />Click on Restore plan defaults
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 2: Fix the problem by editing your registry
<br />
<br />Many affected users have also had luck with applying a certain fix to their registry and then configuring custom power settings to make sure that your computer only goes to sleep after a longer period of inactivity. To do so, you need to:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Logo key + R to launch a Run
<br />
<br />Type regedit into the Run dialog and press Enter.
<br />In the left pane of the Registry Editor, navigate to the following directory:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM &gt; CurrentControlSet &gt; Control &gt; Power &gt; PowerSettings &gt; 238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20 &gt; 7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0
<br />
<br />In the right pane of the Registry Editor, double-click on a value named Attributes to modify it.
<br />
<br />Replace whatever is in this value’s Value data field with 2.
<br />
<br />Click on OK.
<br />Exit the Registry Editor.
<br />Windows 10 Sleeps
<br />
<br />Once you have applied the registry fix, you need to change your system unattended sleep timeout to a longer period of time. To do so, you need to:
<br />
<br />Open the Start Menu.
<br />Search for “power options”.
<br />
<br />Click on the search result titled Power Options.
<br />Click on Change plan settings under your selected power plan.
<br />Click on Change advanced power settings.
<br />Click on Change settings that are currently unavailable.
<br />Click on Sleep.
<br />
<br />Select System unattended sleep timeout. The value for this setting will probably be set to 2 minutes – change it to something longer, for example, 30 minutes.
<br />
<br />System unattended sleep timeout
<br />
<br />Apply and save the changes you have made, exit, and the problem should have been fixed.
<br />
<br />Let me know if it works

    <title>In Windows 10, Windows Security keeps asking for login credentials - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viswa santhanam  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows 10, Windows Security keeps asking for login credentials repeatedly following a BIOS update from Dell</h2>
                    <p>I run Windows 10 Pro (1803) with Outlook 2013. I have two live.com accounts one of which is my Windows login account.</p>
<p>I installed a BIOS update and a Support Assistant update from Dell. The machine rebooted and I was able to login using my PIN. When I started my Outlook, I started getting these "Windows Security" messages asking for my login credentials. Both my live.com
 accounts did the same. I entered the correct password. With no other indication the window popped up again. So, I re-entered the password and the same thing happened again. It was obvious that I would not succeed. I pressed 'Forgot password' to reset it. It
 gave me several options to receive a code. One was sending the code to the other email that also got locked up. Another option was to use the Windows Authenticator, which seemed not applicable to someone who was only having the trouble on the PC. A third option
 was to receive a code on my phone, which is identified by only the last two 2 digits. I have two phones both ending in the same last 2 digits (could you please display last 3 digits?)! So, I guessed one and I happened to be right. Received a code and entered
 it and was able to log into my account at live.com. I repeated the sequence for my other live.com account as well.
</p>
<p>Back to Outlook, the problem persisted as if all that work I did to reset was of no avail. I had to shut down Outlook, reboot my machine and restart Outlook, but the problem persisted. It almost looked like Outlook was checking my credential against a cached
 copy, but that was not the case as the old password wouldn't work either. I repeated the password reset sequence again and all was fine after that.</p>
<p>This problem seems to date back several years. The fixes posted are convoluted (delete the account and re-enter them or non-applicable Windows Authenticator option, etc.). My questions are:</p>
<p>(a) Why isn't there a simple solution? E.g., Go to 'live.com' and reset your password and come back and retry Outlook.</p>
<p>(b) How can the problem keep persisting after the password had been reset? </p>
<p>(c) Who all need my login credentials? Windows Security is the id on the title bar, but Outlook seems to popping the window. When the window simply pops up again and again, I assumed another component in Windows needed the same information. Apparently that
 is not the case.</p>
<p>BTW, one of the posts here said to hit 'Cancel' when Windows Security does not accept the credential and report the error message--there was no error message when I hit Cancel. The window just went away, but I finally noticed a small caution message at the
 bottom on my Outlook window that said Disconnected. Am I supposed to click on it to get the error message? I didn't follow this path because I decided to simply reset my password, but wondered where I should look for the error message next time.</p>
<p>I am sure this is going to happen again, perhaps on my next update. I hope to hear a simpler, cleaner solution before then.</p>

 Mail): </p>
<p>Your Outlook account settings are out-of-date. I pressed Fix account and it went through a "fix" and reported "All done! Your account was updated successfully." Should I trust it did? Will wait and see what else pops up. BTW, I had to do this for both my
