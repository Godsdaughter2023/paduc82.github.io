            Hi Gaming, 
<br />
<br />You’ll need to download the Win 10 iso and reinstall your OS. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>

<br />
<br />The two links above are to the Windows 10 iso, and how to build the bootable usb.
<br />
<br />You could also use these apps I like to build the media:

Watch out for ads on the sites that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />I'd back up your data, and make note of your apps before proceeding. Once you build the media, you’ll boot your laptop to it. you’ll elect to install windows and then pick the version of the OS you want to install. Make sure choose the correct version (Home, Pro, Etc) and the 64 Bit version. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />- C

            Hello! 
<br />
<br />All in all you can follow this guide here on how to do it: <a href="https://www.faqforge.com/windows/windows-10/upgrade-32-bit-64-bit-version-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.faqforge.com/windows/windows-10/upg...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />You want to pay special attention to weather or not your PC CAN be 64 bit. 
<br />
<br />This is at the top of the page I linked where you go to Settings &gt; System &gt;  About. 
<br />
<br />If your PC says "x64 based processor" Then you CAN upgrade to 64 bit. 
<br />
<br />If your PC says "x86 based processor" then you CANNOT upgrade to 64 bit. 
<br />
<br />You will need a new CPU.

            Well, I figured out how to complete the install. I pressed Activate on a prior menu, which I thought it meant just that. A better set of words would have been "Purchase and Activate".<br />

            It was either a well hidden malware or me having to clear my cache and cookies, likely the former, I had to use Malwarebytes to remove it though since I had used other malware cleaning programs when I still had the problem.<br />
There's also a slight chance that it got fixed while clearing my cache and cookies since I did that&nbsp;simultaneously.

<br />
this is the link of 2 files the i have got from windows performance recorder.. recorded at startup windows .. i have opened them and i have no idea where is issue yet ..<br />
<br />
as i have mentioned before my problem that at the windows startup and at gaming time .. task manager goes wrong .. mostly disk usage hits 100% .. so it slows my laptop and affects frams per second .. also affects everything like any folder would take too long
 to open ..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i have never had this problem before .. i dont know what's happened&nbsp;<br />
and i have tried to record when i'm playing .. but it says there is no enough memory in the storage .. beacause memory usage hits 100% too<br />
<br />
<br />
that's all i have to say ... i hope anyone helps me to figure out the issue .. thx in advance

            <p>as from title you may figured the issue .. i open task manager and find that system and service host : local system is always taking 100% of my disk usage ..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i refreshed and diagnosed the windows .. nothing happened actully&nbsp;<br />
scanned with windows defender for any virus may causing this issue .. and found nothing it was clean&nbsp;<br />
<br />
and i actully tried to custom paging files at initial and max memory .. it became even more worse ( i may put the wrong numbers )<br />
my ram is 4GB&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
and i dont think it's about updating drivers .. because before refreshing and diagnosing the windows i was 8.1 &nbsp;up to date ... nw my windows version is 8 with no updates yet ..and still have the same issue ..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
my CPU/GPU is : intel core i5-4200M &nbsp;@2.5GHz - &nbsp; &nbsp;RAM : 4GB&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi Omar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the following methods and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Try <strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Run a Virus Scan</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would recommend you to run a complete virus scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner. It will scan the computer for viruses and malicious programs. To download it and know more about it, click on the link below.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            thx for response ..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
first step about safe mode .. the problem i couldnt figure out because in safe mode disk usage is dissapeared in task manager .. only showed CPU and memory&nbsp;<br />
<br />
( my main problem is disk usage 100% at startup and gaming )&nbsp;<br />
<br />
and about scan virus .. i always enable windows defender .. and pc is clean&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
i will try second step ... may it will solve the problem .. thx again

    <title>Cannot install Windows 10 pro on a laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot install Windows 10 pro on a laptop</h2>
                    I bought a Windows 10 pro DVD top upgrade my laptop to 10 pro from home and I can't seem to figure out how to install pro edition on the machine. Whenever I boot to the install media (tried both DVDand USB drive) I get no options to install the version
 and the only version that installs is home (which originally came with the laptop to begin with) and the OEM key (for home) is still baked into the system. I tried turning off the TPM and clearing it, both don't work. Any ideas?

 (Not Responding).&nbsp;I have shut down and restarted several times but the games still dont work.&nbsp;Is there something I'm not doing ?<br />

<p>I have the desktop version of Skype on my windows 10 desktop and I am very happy with it. I have turned off my automatic updates but the new version keeps installing and then my old version does not launch at startup.</p>
<p>The new version is really poor without the ability to set up your audio and Video devices of which I have many and swap them around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>please Microsoft&nbsp; stop replacing really good tools that work&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Media Player&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype</p>
<p>Windows Explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>with tools that keep pushing on to my desktop which are nowhere near as good and lack basic management functions.</p>

<p>the desktop version I have is&nbsp;740.0.151. Windows does not prompt me for updates it just keeps installing the new version which then stops my desktop version, which means I keep having to uninstall it. The reason I do this is because we connect different
 sound devices and cameras and the new version does not allow you to select.</p>
<p>can I ask why you give your users the option to keep the desktop versions if you plan to replace them. may I suggest instead of using a production platform for your new versions you make sure they at least have the basic functionality of the old version.
 for example I was prompted to try the beta version of outlook recently only to find the calendar did not have the ability to add invites to events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>while I appreciate you are trying to improve your platform I think the way you are doing it is causing a lot of user dissatisfaction</p>

                    <p>Original title: Photoshop 7 with windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgraded to 10 and installed my Photoshop 7. It worked fine and had the correct icon in the task bar and start menu.</p>
<p>Next day I turned my PC on and went to start PS 7 and noticed the icon was plain white and when clicked gave me a message saying the program has moved or changed. I checked in File Explorer and noticed that the application .exe file had gone! All other associated
 files were there.</p>
<p>I did a full uninstall and re-installed the app which again worked fine but after a re-start the .exe file was gone!</p>
<p>I have searched for the missing file but no sign. File settings have been checked to make sure no files are hidden and nothing in the recycle.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Tried that, no help. But....I have disconnected the internet and re-installed and rebooted 4 times and it is still working well. I then re-connected internet, rebooted and the .exe file has gone! Now, I just reinstalled the app and&nbsp;checked Windows Defender
 and it has quarantined Trogan:Win32\Maltule.C!cl&nbsp; and advised the removal of Adobe Photoshop 7 !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>A virus could not have been installed with PS7 as it is from the original CD and has worked perfectly for years on W7.</p>
<p>Could this be a false positive? I have scanned the CD, the installed exe file and the whole installed /Adobe file.</p>

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;7 Home&nbsp;64 installed at the moment but I have a new copy of&nbsp;7 Pro which I never installed. How do I upgrade to&nbsp;10 Pro. Do I just change&nbsp;the Product ID on 7 Home to the 7 Pro version then upgrade to 10 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

    <title>New versions - modify or rewrite&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New versions - modify or rewrite&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am 110% positive this discussion will be moved and I very much am in hope that if moved, those who move will indicate exactly where it was moved to such as, well say, the exact address of its new location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, from time to time, as we all know, Microsoft releases new versions of Windows, Office/Excel &amp; Word, as well as other apps.&nbsp; Last year when my ancient PC finally turned to dust, I was forced to jump from XP to Windows 10.&nbsp; That is a considerable jump
 and nearly required relearning Windows completely.&nbsp; My concern is when Microsoft begins working on a new version of Windows or any of its apps, do they rewrite the program or do they begin with the latest version and make modifications?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is that especially in Excel, I have noted many changes in capabilities that are, to be honest, light-years from what they used to be and honestly, not in a good way.&nbsp; Further, I have noted that many capabilities are simply missing and not
 to be found.&nbsp; For an example, in WIN95, if one had an Excel workbook and wanted to copy specific results from a specific formula and enter them into a second workbook,&nbsp; you simply went to your new workbook and the cell where you needed the data from the first
 workbook and put an equal sign in that cell, then went immediately (alt+tab) to the first workbook where the cell is with the formula results you need and clicked on it and then hit ENTER and bamm, the data from workbook I, cell "<em>whatever</em>" then appeared
 in your new workbook in the cell which needed said data and further, if at any time, the results in workbook I are ever changed, they will also change in workbook II.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before my retirement, I had an application whereby I captured a good deal of data from a massive mainframe program and entered this data into 49 different workbooks and then had a final, or 50th workbook which contained the results form thousands of formulas
 in the previous 49 workbooks.&nbsp; This data changed every month (it was performance data) and once completed, it was all an automatic program that updated every month and a new name was applied to that so that all the history was maintained along with all the
 new data&nbsp; This (50 workbooks) was all accomplished with the process I just described above and it was very simple (at least for me).&nbsp; However, today, to do the same thing would be nearly impossible as the process of capturing the formula results contained
 within a given cell in one workbook and transferring it to a second workbook (just the formula results) is beyond my ability to describe here as I have only attempted to do it one time and found it so cumbersome, I gave up on it, and made me come to the conclusion
 that previous methods were totally ignored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my opinion that when creating newer versions of Windows, Excel, Word or any other apps, the programmers of the newer versions must be aware of what was available previously and not make those capabilities extinct or changed to the extent, it becomes
 nearly impossible. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I am BEGGING Microsoft to use previous versions to create newer versions and always maintain all capabilities.&nbsp; I understand there is a location in Microsoft where folks can make suggestions for consideration by Microsoft but am not aware of where
 it is.&nbsp; But I sincerely believe the process I described above for copying data in a given cell in a specific workbook into another workbook must be addressed and corrected as the new process is so horrible, it almost is not functional!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

            Hello.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If a Moderator should move this then you'll be kept linked wherever it goes.
<br />
<br />I think you have very valuable feedback for the Product Teams.  Microsoft has established a Feedback Hub where these are tasked to process consumer feedback.  It may not be as effective if it is generalized across all Products, so I'd focus on the ones which mean the most to you, and post it there because it's unlikely those who need to see it will even see it here.  
<br />
<br />You can open the Feedback Hub by pressing the Windows (flag) key + F.  Search for your Products of interest and add your Feedback.  
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share to your Feedback here then others can vote it up and add their comments to give it momentum.  If it is as thoughtful as your post here I will add my MVP badge to it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            In reality, most of the guts of Windows XP through Windows 10 are all the same code. For example, you can fill a hard drive on Widows XP, unplu it, plug it into a PC with Windows 10 and all the files will be available. So, the file system code is the same, for the most part. Many Windows XP programs run just fine in Windows 10.

<h2>            Adobe Reader in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have the Adobe Reader app that came with Windows 10. &nbsp;I can't find a way to make notes on the PDF texts. &nbsp;If I try to select text, as soon as I click on it, I just get the menus that appear at the top and bottom of the screen; I'm unable to select text.
 &nbsp;The same thing happens when I right-click on the document. &nbsp;The document I'm working on does have permissions for making notes on the document.

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium - Service Pack 1 &#58; Updated and now says not genuine MS</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got my updates last night. Installed them rebooted and noticed that I had the Win7 Malicious Software Removal tool to load. Went to updates and have been informed that my Windows 7 Home Premium is not Genuine Microsoft and has failed the validation test.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>REALLY!?!?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using this software since 2009 and have loaded anything and everything that MS has said. I have passed numerous validation tests!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why now do I have this issue?</p>

<h3> lottieh14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exe files won&#39;t open neither will command prompt</h2>
                    <p>When I log onto my computer I have been having problems opening all exe files including google chrome. Whenever I attempt to open a file it says 'open with...' and displays a list of programs none of which work. When I went to try to open Command Prompt
 it either says I have no programs compatible and need to install one or just displays the 'open with...' screen once again. I am at a loss and have no clue what to do. I am using windows 10 on a pc. Any help would be much appreciated xxxx</p>

<p>Hi Lottie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Corrupt registry settings or some third-party product (or virus) can change the default configuration for running EXE files. This may lead to failed operation when you try running EXE files. To help you out with your concern, we suggest that you try performing

<p>Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately when I attempt to open command prompt so I can run the System File Checker, it only displays the open with screen again. I have inserted a picture of the screen that pops up. This always comes up when I attempt to open
 any exe file including command prompt.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why I could Activate Windows Key from a laptop with a dead HDD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why I could Activate Windows Key from a laptop with a dead HDD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A.S.: After activation I've tried to contact Microsoft through phone number; only to ask them the same question...<br />
</p>
<p>I have an Asus laptop with Windows 10 Preinstalled OS, the HDD died few weeks ago, and I moved the Windows Licence on another Laptop and I could install Windows 8.1 x32 by using the key; when I bought the laptop the vendor told me it's OEM key (the OS dies
 with the computer). My question is this: Why I was able to move the OS from the Laptop who came with Windows to the one who had FreeDos on it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being on Linux over 1 year, I'm kinda new user on Windows and I don't know much about the Windows activation and Licence Transfer; also I want to know if I can use this licence for Windows 7... Or I must contact Microsoft and tell them my story and
 how the HDD died?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Adrian</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: The activation through phone number worked, and I didn't had any problem with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.P.S: Few days before the Asus's HDD dies, I had a problem with Windows 10, boot manager couldn't load properly so I made the decision to reinstall windows, and I've been looking on forums and I found out if the Windows 10 it's showing in properties "Downgrade
 to Windows 7 or 8.1; it's the anniversary update so, you actually can downgrade the OS, so I've downgraded it to Windows 8.1, on forums about Windows downgrades there was a discussion about the Windows downgrades and I need a serial key, using the command
 wmic in command promt instead to show the entire Windows Serial Key at the end of the Serial the manufacturer used AOEM; so for seeing the entire key I had to use an OpenSource Software called ShowKeyPlus; and I wrote the number on a paper only to install
 Windows 8.1, after downloading the "mediacreatintool"from Microsoft webpage, I made a bootable USB with windows 8.1 and installed it on Asus, it worked; I don't understand when I bought the laptop why none told me it, actually, was an 8.1 Licence key; not
 an Windows 10 key OEM key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After presenting how I figure out I can install a lower version of windows, I'm gonna tell you what happened with the HDD, I've been reading and windows 8.1 showed a strange behavior; it goes little laggy for few minutes, and when it worked again, the screen
 freeze and I couldn't use any Windows option, so I had to force turn it off, by pressing the button, when I started it again the HDD didn't respond and in boot options I couldn't see the HDD anymore; only to see if there were other components affected I inserted
 a live USB with Linux Mint 18.2 and checked the HDD; in Linux I didn't got any response from HDD actually Windows couldn't find it neither. I want to know if the Asus have the HDD dead and it had Windows 8.1 activated on it, then why I was able to transfer
 the same licence key from Asus to HP and activate it on Microsoft... I thought only full RT Licences have this options; for me this licence is little shady and I guess I will contact Microsoft from my country because something doesn't look so good; on Asus
 was preinstalled Windows 10 Home Pro x64; I could downgraded it to Windows 8.1 Pro x64; on HP I can install Windows 8.1 Pro x32 (is a very old laptop).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course on Monday I will call Microsoft because I want to know what happened and why I could use this licence on my HP; usually I'm using Linux Distros; but I need to work with Windows for few months; by the way I know the terms and conditions of Microsoft;
 but I couldn't find anything about the licence transfer; when I called the number for activating windows (writing the installation ID and getting a very long Serial Number only to activate your OS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my ticket, and please tell me what happened with my licence... And why I've been able to use my serial number on HP and passed the Activation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Figure it out; I can't change anymore; the vendor gave me an OS who can be activated 3 times (I had problems with the motherboard and the service had to change it, so if the HP laptop will have any modification the licence can't be activated anymore).</p>
<p>Sorry for bothering you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you had to do was replace the Hard Drive in the Asus&nbsp;and reinstall windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Information about what Hardware&nbsp;you can and can not replace:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This was the original link. Microsoft is altering/deleting links, but the information that was originally there&nbsp;remains the same (I copied it before the link disappeared)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en-gb/licensing/sblicensing/pages/licensing_faq.aspx#fbid=iePP5a9JaWJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en-gb/licensing/sblicensing/pages/licensing_faq.aspx#fbid=iePP5a9JaWJ</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>If my customer asks me to upgrade a PC with new hardware components, when is a new operating system needed? When would the PC be considered "new"?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer—<strong><em>except</em> the motherboard</strong>—and still retain the licence for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the licence of new operating system software is required.</p>
<p>If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC
<strong>as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought and installed your own Retail&nbsp;Windows License, you can change Motherboards, but doing that will now require a Phone Activation and you should not follow the Auto prompts, but hold on for a real person to explain to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Transfer of License:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

<p>I see, I've asked the manufacturer about my Asus X555LB-xx025T, and I found out they gave me a broken laptop, and when the service replaced the motherboard, I got another hardware problem; I've been reading for the entire day about the OEM serial numbers
 and how they are applied, but I don't understand why I was able to use the serial key from Asus X555LB-XX025T, this laptop had a lot of malfunctions from the moment I bought it. Also I don't want to replace the HDD, that thing isn't the only one who've been
 damaged, the laggy part is from RAM, instead to repair something like that, I will try to rebuild another laptop using it's components, and I still don't understand what type of Licence I have, and why the Service didn't told me about the Licence... &nbsp;I've
 been asking about this because I could install Windows 8.1 on my Hewlett-Packard Pav. G6 using the licence key from Asus motherboard, also the HDDs doesn't correlate (HP's HDD is SATA, wile Asus's HDD is SATAIII). All what it came in my mind was this: when
 the service changed the Asus's motherboard, instead to take away my Windows 10, they choosed to give me an Reatail Licence.</p>
<p>As you can read in the subject, I was able to activate that licence on Windows 8.1 x32, installed on HP, by phone call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Do you think so? </p>
<p>When I inserted the serial key on the Windows it asked me for an activation so I called the number provided by the activation ID, do you think it can be an RT licence? That Asus desn't have any information about the license.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know, and I tried to report it to Microsoft, I will remove the serial as soon as possible and install Linux over Windows; but 1st tell me how to report this error to Microsoft, I have no idea what happened with that Asus before buying it, when I've been
 looking for the Asus on the internet, I found out the only model with ddr3L RAM is a NS; and when I bought the ASUS as I said it had a problem with Windows 10 Home Pro SL; but all what I want to know, if the Serial was activated on that ASUS, and I worked
 on it, Microsoft should tell me the licence is canceled or terminated? </p>
<p>It isn't my fault Windows Activated on another Computer, when I had replaced the motherboard (on Asus) it was the same message; and I called Microsoft, activated &nbsp;through phone and bang it worked, but now on &nbsp;HP worked the same method, I think I will remove
 Windows and install Linux... I really don't like this kind of shady stuffs, when I bought the Asus nobody told me anything about the licence and if it's transferable or &nbsp;no, the vendor sold a broken laptop and he was happy to see it going, and when I asked
 for my money back I had no chance. By the way that Asus had a lot of changes (1 year of faulty repairs and now the HDD broken and the RAM is showing a lot of error messages when I try to use a Live USB to see if it's working); so instead to use this WINDOWS
 8.1 &nbsp;x32, I will look for a faster and stable version of Linux; I knew it was something shady when I've been able to use THIS LICENCE for another PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: I forgot to mention this: THE PREINSTALLED WINDOWS &nbsp;10 WAS THE ANNIVERSARY UPDATE; &nbsp;I know this because it showed me when I used it 1st time (in the day when I bought Asus) showed a message it's beta version (this happened in March,18 2016).&nbsp;</p>

<p>once on June 16th I had to reset my account security with a <strong>4 digit account security code</strong> and then it happen again<strong> 4 times
</strong>in Dec starting on Dec 20. The last occurrence being on 1/3/18. </p>
<p>I have to reset my Microsoft account security code in order to <strong>log into my laptop</strong>.&nbsp; No errors codes just a message that i needed to reset my security code. It would then ask how i would like to have my special code sent to me and I choose
 "text" to my cell. It comes back with a<strong>&nbsp;7 digit code </strong>which I&nbsp;enter and then it allows me to reset the security code. I am now logged in and a about 10-15 minutes later it ask me again for the security code for access to my one drive account.
 (I do not use). I don't understand why this is happening.&nbsp; I certainly do not want to be locked out of my system. HELP!&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>When it asks your password to OneDrive, it may have a checkbox to remember my password, make sure that is checked.&nbsp; OneDrive even if you think you dont use it, windows does use it to store in the background some of your account settings.</p>

<p>Thank you for the tip on the One Drive. I will look for the "remember my password" and save next time i have an issue.</p>
<p>As far as a pin, not sure what you are talking about. My access code(Password) is 10 characters/numbers to log into my system.</p>
<p>MS gives me a security code through my cell of 7 digits (pin) so i can reset my account password<br />
when I have to reset.<br />
</p>
<p>My issue is "Why am I having to reset my login password so frequently?" Up until June 2017, it never happened then it reoccurred 4 times in last 15 days. What's going on???</p>

<p>Don't know why its asking so often.&nbsp; I can't recall it ever asking me, but I do change it every 6 or so months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If windows asked me frequently to change my password, I think I might look in https://account.microsoft.com/ &nbsp; Security, Recent Activity &nbsp;&nbsp; for anything too strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you might check the box on the bottom of the password reset to the 72 days or whatever yours might say.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 onto new PC</h2>
                    I'm in the process of building a new PC. My current PC runs Windows 10, which was a free upgrade from the original Windows 8.1 (retail) install. I want to put Windows 10 onto the new PC which will have an M.2 SSD as the primary drive and eventually the
 HDD from the current PC will be the new PC's secondary drive. I don't have a Windows 10 retail disc, so how do I go about installing Windows 10 onto the new PC without a disc? And how do I transfer the Windows license from the old PC to the new PC?

            There is no deactivation process for the old computer, Microsoft recommend you format the old computer to ensure it is not in use. 
<br />
<br />You will likely need to use chat support to reactivate on the new computer.

<h2>            My console is acting funny.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i have got a couple things going wrong and weird with my console right now and some questions. Oh yeah and by the way i have got an
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">elite</span>. </p>
<ol>
<li>When my console has no disc in the disc tray it wont open like it is jammed. </li><li>When I took my elites face plate off and&nbsp;now when i put it back on it won't let me turn on or off the console or open the disc tray.( I have to take off the face plate and do it then)
</li><li>When i put my face plate back on my console if active will shut down or if inactive it will turn on.
</li><li>Is the slim really that good or should i stick with my elite seeing it is only like 3 years old and running perfectly except from the flaws listed above.
</li><li>Is the slim having more errors than the first one and once again RROD. </li></ol>
<p>Could some people please help me with this stuff cause I spent nearly half a day trying to figure out how to fix some of the stuff listed above (1-3).</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Andrew.</p>

<p><em>1 &amp; 2, Sounds like the faceplate is not sitting on the console correctly and is stopping the tray from opening.<br />
<br />
3, Not sure about that one, but it sounds as though this is connected to the faceplate also. U</em><em>sually consoles shut down because they are overheating so I am wondering if the faceplate is somehow affecting the power button also.
</em></p>
<p><em>(Do any of the light on the RROD light up at all when it shut down?, or does the light on the power unit change colour?).<br />
<br />
4, The slim is definitely an improved design, like all electronics they can fail but touch wood mine has been great so far.<br />
<br />
5, The slim can get the RROD (or RDOD) but its much more seldom than used to occur with the older design units.
</em></p>
<p><em>But if you are unlucky and something goes wrong the console, it&nbsp;is covered by a standard warranty for a year. There was an extended 3 year warranty for the RROD but I'm unsure if this applies to the 's',&nbsp;hopefully someone else&nbsp;can clarify that.</em></p>
