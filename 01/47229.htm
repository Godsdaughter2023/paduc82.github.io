<h2>            Money taken from my bank from &#38;quot&#59;Microsoft&#47;Xbox Dublin Ireland&#38;quot&#59;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I've just checked my bank account and on my statement it says on the 24/01/2013 Microsoft/Xbox has taken £25.20 from my account from Dublin Ireland.</p>

<p>The thing is, for Christmas, I was given £15 credit and I still have £8 left from it. I haven't purchased anything using my bank card, what should I do?</p>

<h2>            gameplay&#58;which game has exceeded this gen&#39;s expectations</h2>
                    
<p>there have been few games in my opinion that have exceeded a consoles expectancy.for example there was metal gear solid for the ps1.the enemy AI weas spot on and the way the game could/had to be played was amazing.I thought that it totally surpassed any
 game of that generation.then there was legend of zelda:ocarina of time.this game blew me away with how much there was to do.OK there was little enemy AI but the variety in the gameplay (exploration,different boss battles etc) made this game in my opinion again
 surpass any game of that generation. now this generation,to me it has been elder scrolls oblivion. it is more than just a regular FPS.theres a massive wide open area to discover, massive amounts of levelling upetc. also the game 'makes' you want to play more.are
 there any games that you think this about?and i dont mean modern warfare because those basic FPS games have been going for years and have offered nothing new.</p>

<p><strong>Crackdown 1</strong> really sticks out in my mind of a game that was true innovation for this generation and for the sandbox genre. &nbsp; You could climb every single building in the game which added a lot of vertical gameplay, go anywhere you want in
 3 cities, &nbsp;gain superpowers, drive every vehicle, and the ENTIRE game was a&nbsp;co-op campaign. &nbsp; &nbsp;The demo for that game blew me away and I had well over 24 hours just into the demo. &nbsp; Then I fell in love with the full game and played for several years. &nbsp;Just
 loved that game so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Saints Row 2</strong>&nbsp; Another sandbox game that just went all out with a full drop in drop out co-op campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a huge GTA fan and own all the games but Saints Row 2 is easily the best of the sandbox series.&nbsp; Saints Row 2 is full drop in drop
 out co-op campaign with everything that was missing from the GTA4 campaign. You can see your co-op partners character, buy clothes, jewelry, completely customize your character top to bottom including walk and personality, buy cars from car dealerships, buy
 bikes from bike dealerships, buy houses just like in Vice City and San Andreas then make money off of them, buy every single store you see in the game, buy boats and boat docks, customize your house, parachute from anywhere in the game, fly planes, join fight
 clubs, drive monster trucks, quads, dirt bikes, car surf, fly a helicopter, customize your homies and the way their cars look, customize EVERY vehicle in the game (if you can drive it you can customize it), and much much more all with a co-op partner. Every
 mission every level everything is all co-op. You can hold people as human shields just like in GOW2. Pick up any object in the game and throw it or use it as a weapon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are hundreds of great games out there but these 2 truly amazed me and have been a major influence on sandbox games.&nbsp;&nbsp; They focused on what matters the most.......fun!

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I'm not saying you're wrong, but I wish it hadn't. Now every game want's to play like Call of Duty. I hate it when a new shooter comes into the market, I get it expecting a somewhat refreshing experience, only to realize that every single thing is an exact
 copy. I'm okay with games in the FPS genre to be alike, but not identical to all of the others.</p>

<h2>            Slow computer - no idea how to reinstall windows</h2>
                    <p>I have a acer laptop with windows 7 starter operating system. It's a laptop I bought from my boss then six years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to reinstall windows since the computer is extremely slow - can't scroll down pages and can't open a file without it going into a "not responding mode" etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bought the laptop I only got the laptop and the charging wire - nothing else - no CDs</p>
<p>I have a product key on a sticker at the bottom of my laptop. When I enter it to verify before reinstalling I get the following message:
</p>
<p>"Error: The product key you entered appears to be for software pre-installed by the device manufacturer. Please contact the device manufacturer for software recovery options."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have no idea what to do. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have technical expertise but I can follow through directions really well.&nbsp;Please help resolve this.<br />

            <p>Usually it's just dust build up that causes high temperatures and a slower machine</p>
<p>So the first thing that should be done is to clean it properly</p>

<p>
</p><p>If still no joy use a free program/ utility like ccleaner to rid it of temp files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install you'll need of course installation media and the activation key</p>
<p>If you have these two basic items </p>
<p>You might look into this it is the newest way to update after a clean install,</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or the older method</p>
<p>When manually installing updates you need to switch your update settings to Never check for updates and restart the machine first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure KB3020369 is installed if not manually install it,</p>
<p>Win-7 32 bit</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then manually install KB3172605</p>

<h2>            DVD Maker</h2>
                    <p>Dear Mrs/Mr.,</p>
<p>&nbsp; my name is Pantelis and I'm writing this email to ask you about Windows DVD Maker. It's a very useful app that I used to use a lot on my previous computer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, now that I have upgraded my hardware that includes my computer too, I can't find
 the app on my new windows 10 computer. After having read many articles, I realized that Windows DVD Maker isn't available&nbsp;any further on the windows' latest versions. I have tried other similar apps from your site, but none of them was as useful and helpful
 as DVD Maker was. So I really, please&nbsp;you to tell me how I can download windows DVD maker on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yours faithfully,</p>

            Hi there Pantelis, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />As you've mentioned, Windows DVD Maker isn't supported any longer on Windows 10. You won't be able to run it using that version of Windows. I'd suggest trying to find another app on the Windows Store to replace it.
<br />
<br />However, if you're certain you can only use Windows DVD Maker, you may be able to run a virtual machine with Windows 7 to install Windows DVD Maker. It's a very complicated process and may have driver issues connecting to your DVD burner, but the option is there if you choose to pursue it. Here's a link to instructions.

<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if I can help with anything else. Thanks!

<h3> sverre054  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one making humming&#47;grinding noise, will MS Store exchange&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a day one edition Xbox One, purchased from the MS store, with extended warranty. They told me any issues, they would exchange in store if I bought the extended warranty. My Xbox started making a loud pulsing noise. It's one long buzz followed by two
 shorter buzzing sounds. Not sure if its grinding or a humming noise. Everything appears to working fine, but the noise is getting louder.</p>

<p>Anyone know what may be causing this, and can I just take it back to the MS store like they said, or do I need to send it out for repair? I don't want to be without my Xbox for a long period and hope they will keep their word and exchange, but I am worried
 they just sold me the warranty to get a sale. I went online and it says eligible for repair and to print a shipping label, but Its the holiday season, so I don't want to ship out, and have it be gone for a month. MS store on phone just wants me to schedule
 an appointment, but before I tear apart my home theater and drive 2 hours to the MS store I want to know if they can help me. Any Advice would be appreciated,.</p>

<p>It really depends on how long your extended warranty was for. &nbsp;All you can do is take it back and find out.</p>
<p>It definitely sounds like it is beginning to get some hardware issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Call the store you purchased it from and ask them if they will exchange it they should be able to tell you without you driving all the way. &nbsp;Good Luck.</p>

            <strong><span>Hi snbear,</span></strong>
<p><span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Were there any changes prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>duser.dll is a process associated with Windows DirectUser Engine from Microsoft Corporation</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Replace the file from i386 folder and check.<br />
</span><span>Make sure you rename the currnnt file to duser.old and copy the files from service pack folder in i386 folder.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
</span><span><span><strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong>If this issue has started recently, perform system restore to an earlier point when everything was working fine.<br />

                    I have tried everything possible to cure this problem except replacing my disc drive which is 6 months old. It will play the longest cd without issues. I see lots of this same complaint all over the internet and no real cure. I never has this issue with
 previous versions of itunes. I have actually had luck burning my playlists with itunes 12.5.5. The problem started 3 days ago. Is it Apple? Is it Microsoft? With all the issues, do these companies work together?? Please do not rehash what's already out there.
 There are quite a few download cures I do not trust Does anyone know the "real deal" with this issue?&nbsp;

            There are frequent issues with iTunes on Windows devices. iTunes is by Apple, so they care most about the iOS and OS X versions of iTunes. Because Windows is far different, the program is actually quite different. Due to that, updates are not given frequently
 and there are often bugs in iTunes versions for Windows. Sometimes, issues are simply broken until one of the two sides provides an update. If this is a known problem, Apple is likely putting a small staff to fixing the bug and will release an update in the
 near future.

<p>Hi Damian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you are getting an error 4450 message is because of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Corrupt or incomplete installation of iTunes software.</li><li>Corruption in Windows registry from a recent iTunes-related software change (install or uninstall).</li><li>Virus or malware infection that has corrupted Windows system files or iTunes-related program files.</li><li>Another program maliciously or mistakenly deleted iTunes-related files.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this concern, we suggest that you <strong>uninstall</strong> the iTunes application; then
<strong>reinstall</strong> the latest version. Give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

    <title>NTFS Permissions Problem on USB Movable Backup Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcw2  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTFS Permissions Problem on USB Movable Backup Drive</h2>
                    I have a large external USB drive that is formatted NTFS and that I use for image backups, transferring files, etc.&nbsp; Until now it has been used with only one computer (which happens to be running Windows XP SP3).&nbsp; The relevant permissions for this drive
 are Full Control for "[original machine name]\Administrators" and "SYSTEM" and read/list/execute control for the specific "Limited User" account on this same machine.&nbsp; These permissions were set on the original drive (I think) and should have been inherited
 by all folders and files therein.&nbsp; Now I also want to use the same external drive for the same purpose(s) on a new machine running Windows 7 SP1.<br />
<br />
If I plug the drive into this new machine and open an administrator account, however, I cannot access the external drive at all (access denied).&nbsp; I tried going back to the original machine and adding full-control permissions for "Everyone."&nbsp; Then I could gain
 access from the new machine, and the relevant permissions showing are Full Control for "[**new** machine name]\Administrators," "Everyone," and "SYSTEM" and nearly full control for the some unknown account with a very long string of letters and numbers beginning
 in "S-1-5-21-..."&nbsp; As expected, I can now use the drive for backups on [new machine].<br />
<br />
**Now comes the puzzle:**&nbsp; Having gained access to the drive on [new machine], if I now remove "Everyone" from the permissions list (from [new machine]), I can no longer gain access.&nbsp; I can't figure out what I have to do to get administrator (or any other)
 access from **both** machines without allowing "Everyone," and that can be done only from [original machine].<br />
<br />
(I admit that I don't remember, from when I set up my NTFS permissions long ago, everything about how permissions propagate or don't propagate automatically down the directory tree from the top level, but I don't understand why, if I remove "Everyone" from
 the permissions list on [new machine] at the top level, I cannot even gain access to the drive, let alone the files that I created on that machine). -- JCW2<br />

While I'm waiting (still!) for this server, may I ask a couple of related questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is there anything fundamentally different about having two different computers (one XP and one Win7 in my case) access the same NTFS external USB drive?&nbsp; Since the computers necessarily have different names, the effective names of the permitted accounts
 (e.g., "[computer name]\Administrators") change when the drive is moved (and in my case no longer permit access).<br />
<br />
2) I'm becoming more concerned about the unknown account with a very long string of letters and numbers beginning in "Account unknown(S-1-5-21-.. " that&nbsp; has shown up with nearly full control after I moved the drive from XP to Win7.&nbsp; Moving the drive back to
 the XP computer, I don't see this account listed anymore&nbsp; Is this a security problem?<br />
<br />

Please indulge me while I make sure I understand you:&nbsp; Are you saying that permissions for "[old computer] \Administrators" that gave full control on [old computer] should **not** give full control on [new computer], even though the permission shows there as
 "[new computer] \Administrators"?&nbsp; In other words, to get access on two different computers, must I permanently add "Everyone" to the permissions list?<br />
<br />
Or is this behavior (and my apparent inability to add a working "[new computer] \Administrators" to the permissions list on [new computer]) a symptom of an underlying problem that requires me seize ownership (that is, if that server is ever fixed so I can get
 your reference)?<br />

And now two of your replies are missing from **this** thread!&nbsp; I had marked them useful.&nbsp; What gives?<br />

Forrest Brook wrote the above in one of his two helpful replies that have disappeared from this thread overnight&nbsp; I am still unable to connect to the recommended server, but I now think I understand how to "seize ownership" of folders (or perhaps of entire
 drives?).<br />
<br />
What I still don't understand is what I should do with this information to solve the problem in my OP.&nbsp; Since I want Administrator accounts on **both** computers to have access, could you can explain which of the two computers should do the seizing and what
 that might do to access from the other computer?<br />

            Hi S.K.L,<br />
<br />
It appears that the TweakUI Setup hasn't created an entry under "Uninstall".<br />
<br />
Simply delete the two files from the Windows\System32 folder:
<ul>
<li>TweakUI.exe </li><li>PowerToysLicense.rtf </li></ul>

<p>The adoption of IPV6 in the states has been a slow one. &nbsp;There are networks however that support it now, but it's not wide spread. &nbsp;Just like with anything else, it's going to cost $$$ and companies are slow to implement due to cost.</p>

<p>Internet Protocol Version 6.</p>

<p>Here's the wiki link if you want to read more:&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Truth is most modern Internet enabled devices would run far better if IPv6 was implemented by more ISPs. The reason they don't is because these cable firms have their head stuck in the sand, or up another orifice or two. IPv4 has been creaking for sometime
 now, and the slow pace of IPv6 adoption will indeed be a stumbling block, of sorts, for both next-gen systems. Perhaps with both Sony's and Microsoft's plans with the two of them pushing they can convince ISPs to speed thing up a little. Here's hoping.</p>

            In my experience on several computers, Windows 7 is even better than Vista and XP at automatically detecting and installing devices.&nbsp; And if it doesn't find a driver for a device during Windows 7 installation, the first Windows Update run probably will.

<h2>            Display or page moves to the left.</h2>
                    when I go to another page ,my page will go to the left to blank page then comes back to the page before that I was on.This happens when I go to move up the page to search or read.This just started out of the blue one day about a month ago. I have to click
 on the page first before I try to roll up the page. If I click on the page ,,I can move up or down all I like but!!! ,Go to the next page and if I do not click on the page first ,the page will move to the left to a blank and then comes back to the previous
 page I was on. This is driving me crazy. What can I do?

RE: Any page I am browsing on will move to the left.&nbsp; It does not matter what web site I am on. For instance -(KIJIJI) .If I click on a vehicle to read about it ,before I try to move up the page I first have to click anywhere on the page before moving or the
 page will go off to the left and is blank for a few seconds and then the previous page will show up and I have to start over with my search. This problem happens on all sites wether Yahoo Microsoft, Bing. It does not matter. I get this problem all the time.&nbsp;
 I have tried troubleshooting and reinstalling windows 10 and I can not seem to find a way to stop this from happening.

<p>Thanks for following up and apologies for the delayed response. Based on your description of the issue, there's a possibility that there could be and issue with your mouse and keyboard. To check on this, try unplugging your keyboard and just navigate to
 the web page using the mouse (if you are using a PC.) Also try using a different mouse, so we can check if this is a possible hardware issue. If the symptoms persists, let us know so we can further assess the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

    <title>Child cannot access YouTube, even though I&#39;ve allowed it in Family - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Child cannot access YouTube, even though I&#39;ve allowed it in Family Safety</h2>
                    <p>We have a family account, my granddaughter is set up under my account with Family Safety activated (she is 12). She would like to access YouTube, which is fine by me, because she's in to Minecraft and I monitor what she watches.&nbsp;However, whenever I make
 the changes to <strong>allow</strong> the websites of: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
http://youtube.com </span>or<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> https://youtube.com
</span>as sites that she can access, she<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>still
</strong></span>can't access many of the sites she would like to access. She can&nbsp;log on to her YouTube subscription page and see her subscriptions, but&nbsp;most of them--she can't get to. When she clicks on them--it says&nbsp;"Access denied, I'm Sorry" (or something
 similar). All of the searching I've done on this issue leads me back to the Microsoft Family Safety issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried going in on her account (from my account) and turned <strong>off</strong> "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block inappropriate websites</span>" and "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block inappropriate apps and games</span>."
 That still doesn't work--once again, she can get to her subscriptions page, but isn't allowed to access all of her YouTube subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where to go from here. I found some info on refreshing Family Safety, but I can't even find that setting. I don't want to remove her as a child from my account, but I would like to allow her to view whatever YouTube site she would like. &nbsp;I've
 also tried, on the YouTube site, moving it from restricted to unrestricted, but it doesn't matter--it won't stay as unrestricted. Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>No--I'm sorry. The information you provided apparently does not apply to Windows 10, or at least I can't find the settings you're referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method One:</strong></span></p>
<p>I am using Windows 10 and the Edge browser. When I sign in to my family account, Sydnee (my granddaughter) is listed under my account as a child. But there are no settings<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>ANYWHERE
</strong></span>for her account that allow me to edit her "<strong>web filtering.</strong>" It's just not there. I have looked and looked. Please tell me exactly where it is or how to get there. I found web filtering references to Windows 7, but nothing for

<p>Same thing. There is no <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Start Button/Family Safety/Refresh

<p>
</p><p>You are sending me links to figure this out--but the links aren't giving me the correct information for the Edge browser, or Windows 10. One or the other. I am a fairly skilled computer person, but I can't figure out why I can't see the options you are referring

<h2>            Laptop goes straight into automatic repair mode after Windows 10 May 2019 update</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 was updated on my laptop on May 15 and it went straight into automatic repair mode as soon as I restarted it and continues to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exhausted all options offered from the repair options: restart, restore, reset, even restart with the new workaround posted by Microsoft a few days ago (option 7 from startup setting menu) failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need assistance with this issue. I am by no means a computer expert and I hope there is an easy solution to this.</p>

            Hi, NBoss
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />	
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the Microsoft Surface Keyboard, Microsoft's own external surface keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/da-dk/p/surface-keyboard/8r3rqvvflp4k?activetab=pivot:overviewtab</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried a different keyboard, i do not have e second bluetooth keyboard at my disposal. &nbsp; But i have other bluetooth devices connected, (Plantronic headset, and the Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse) nothing has changed in my setup the last 4 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other business partner who has the samme issue on his Surface Boók 2. only has the Surface keyboard&nbsp; and a surface Precision Mouse running on Bluetooth on his device &nbsp; (He is not placed in the same company, so his machine do not have the same programs
 installed at all, but still see the same issues as i do)</p>

<p>Hi Kent Gadgaard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for clarifying the concern. Possible reason why the keyboard keep disconnected the Bluetooth driver on the keyboard is not working properly or the keyboard it self. Since you already install update and run the Bluetooth troubleshooter.
 Next steps we will run the <a href="http://aka.ms/Surfacedt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Diagnostic tools.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;This tools will automatically fix any hidden issue on your Surface device.&nbsp;
</p>

 the same issue with this new Surface Book 2 and my keyboard.&nbsp; I have tried the same, waited&nbsp; about 30 seconds, while clicking the windows button, until i see it starts the Windows start menu. &nbsp; So with this new setup i have the same issue, as with my other
 surface book 2 13" laptop.</p>

            Same keyboard, same setup (surface book 2) using the surface hub, same problem.&nbsp; Leave the keyboard, loose connection.&nbsp; Other Bluetooth devices still connected, but the surface keyboard loses connection.&nbsp; I used to delete the keyboard from Bluetooth devices
 and then would add it back.&nbsp; Now, I just run the Bluetooth trouble shooter, and it says it fixes it, which it does.&nbsp; What does it fix, I have no idea, but the keyboard comes back, which beats deleting the keyboard.&nbsp; With the 1809 update, it got worse.&nbsp; Either
 it's the keyboard, or it is the Marvell radio adapter.&nbsp; One of the devices has a serious problem.&nbsp; Drives you nuts.&nbsp; All Microsoft products, which is kind of disappointing. &nbsp;

<p>I have the same issue, with the same setup&nbsp; Bluetooth&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;keyboard and precision mouse. Both&nbsp;will stop responding multiple&nbsp;times a day. My keyboard will also ghost type. For instance, if I type "h" it will type "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh." I've spent countless
 hours troubleshooting this, refreshing windows, updating drivers etc, nothing has worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a Logitech&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;setup for about 6 months before I bought the Microsoft&nbsp;stuff and had no such issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we get some help here?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue here.&nbsp; Microsoft Surface Keyboard keeps disconnecting from Bluetooth.&nbsp; Run the troubleshooter and it reconnects.&nbsp; This is very frustrating.&nbsp; And why not give this keyboard an optional wire??????????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to return the keyboard if I cannot find a way to fix this.&nbsp; It is super frustrating and happens every time I set down at my computer.</p>

            I too have the same issues as describes above. The keyboard disconnect randomly and almost guaranteed when away from the computer for a couple of hours.
