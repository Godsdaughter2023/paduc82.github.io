<h2>            I accidently made drive D my dafault music folder and can&#39;t change it back</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried moving my default music folder to drive D, I clicked on the music folder in drive C, clicked on properties, location and then clicked on drive D ( D:\ ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all of my drive D is the music folder. I tried restoring it to default under location, but it doesn't work as it tries to restore ALL the drive D partition as the music folder and of course it says it can't do it. Now when I click on the music folder
 it just opens drive D.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer I did this on is brand new :/ As I never had two drives like this and didn't fully understand how the moving default folder works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to bring it back to normal so I can change the default properly? Without resetting windows ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did change all the other folders properly and they work fine.</p>
<p>I also changed the music default location in settings (which created a new music folder inside D), removed drive D from music library, so now I have a new music folder in D under my username and it works fine. It doesn't have the little note picture on it
 though. I guess my main issue now is to remove drive D from the "default folders" as shown in the picture and put my new music folder in its place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance, all help is appreciated, I also attached a picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps. Windows should really make everything user related in drive D by default and only leave apps and windows on C. Or at least ask us during installation. It is absurd the way it works right now, 90% of computers sold have a tiny SSD drive C and a gigantic
 hard drive D (like mine).&nbsp;</p>

            Hi HeroMtl, this will require a Registry fix:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to this Key:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />On the right hane side, double click My Music
<br />
<br />Set its value to: %USERPROFILE%\Music
<br />
<br />Click OK and close the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Restart your PC (not shut down)
<br />
<br />Then you will be able to move your music folder to your D Drive again . . .       
        </p>

<p>Hi DaveM121!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your quick reply! Sadly the method didn't work, I changed it, but the link of drive D in the folders menu stayed the same even after the restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I managed to find a solution in this forum where several people seemed to have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the bat file that was given and it restored my music folder to default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still thank you for the try!</p>

    <title>Cannot seem to upgrade from Windows Pro N to Windows Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher niles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot seem to upgrade from Windows Pro N to Windows Pro</h2>
                    I have been <strong>running Windows Pro N</strong> on one of my machines for almost 2 years. It was originally installed there by accident, and hasn't become an issue until recently when a
<strong>non-N version of windows is required to utilize Windows Mixed Reality devices</strong>, not to mention that not having the Media Player built is has also become quite a pain.<br />
<br />
Now i've <strong>attempted to upgrade my OS to Windows 10 Pro</strong>, but continually get issues when attempting to activate the key, where it informs me that the key is not valid, while i know that it is.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to run the ISO to reinstall windows, the windows install tool, and most other Microsoft provided solutions for installing windows.<br />
<br />
Now i would prefer not to format my drives, as this is a developer machine, and would turn into a multi-day project to bring things back to where they are now.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are my next possible solutions, and where can i go from here?</strong>&nbsp;

            A Windows 10 Pro N key cannot activate non-N Windows 10 Pro and you will need to perform a clean install if you want to migrate from Windows 10 Pro N.

            Windows 10 N and Windows 10 are entirely different versions of Windows. Sorry, there is no upgrade path for it too.
<br />You have to download and Clean Install Windows 10 Pro.

            Uninstall it, 'SpeedUpMyPc' type of programs are unneccessary, as win7 has inbuilt maintenance tools, and in the worst case such programs can render the system unuseable

                    <p>My ssd was running out of space so I decided to look up ways to clear up space on it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told to disable the hibernation feature and also change the virtual memory paging file size..</p>
<p>
</p><p>someone said he uses 1024min and 1024 max size for their paging file size on their ssd, so I entered that.. and it said you need to restart to make these changes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted and now it wont load up for me.. it gets to the part with the circle loading thing and it says : "please wait" but stays at that screen forever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I booted to my hard drive instead to make this post because I cant log into my ssd right now and im lost...</p>
<p>
</p><p>what can I do?.. My whole day is lost and ruined now because Ive been messing around trying to fix this..</p>

<p>All I did was use an elevated command prompt to turn hibernation off and then I changed the page file to 1024 and 1024 on both min and max..asked me to restart ,so I did..now it just gets stuck at the loading screen before the login..</p>
<p>Reformatting is not really an option tbh.. I have a lot of stuff on there and it will be a huge hassle to redownload/reconfig things..plus..I feel like its still a working drive..doesnt make sense for it to not log in suddenly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is not the drive itself, but some type of setting with Windows...</p>
<p>What was the command you used to turn off Hibernation ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do the forced Automatic Repair without losing any of your data...</p>
<p>It doesn't reformat anything... just attempts to fix boot errors...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... have you checked your BIOS settings to make sure the SSD is still the selected Boot Device ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any bootable installation media you could use to access Safe Mode?</p>

            <p>The command I did was something something hyber- off and I remember that clearing like 6.5 gigs of space..then i proceeded to try to change the virtual memory to further clear space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive been using my hard drive instead of ssd to access my computer and yeah,when I look in bios,I can set the ssd as the main boot..but when I do that,it just stays at loading screen. So the hard drive is the main boot right now.</p>

</p><p>Also..ive tried to do the repair tool..but it says to put in my windows disk right before it starts,which I dont have..any way around this?</p>
<p>I feel like that would work if I could get it running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also opened aomei partition manager from my hard drive to trouble shoot solutions for my ssd..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And I saw that my ssd had 2 partitions, 1 reserved and 250mb or so and it was listed as the active partition for some reason.. so I tried changing the 118 gig ssd partition to active and once again set the ssd as main boot device and restarted..and a black
 screen came up and said something like "windows doesnt have the proper boot files,insert disk".. so Idk if that was just a result of me changing the big partition to active or me doing the right thing and discovering that the changes made to the pagefile somehow
 changed the partitions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Idk... but this is frustrating..typing this on my phone.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some machines with UEFI Bios don't boot directly to the Windows partition... </p>
<p>They start to boot to a EFI, or possibly like your's, System Reserved, and then redirect to the Windows partition...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would have been created when you installed Windows, or cloned your HDD, whichever the case... Just make it the active again..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could probably bypass that partition by leaving it like it is, and doing a boot repair, but you might be better off just making it the active partition like it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty hard to come by the media to create a Win 8 Flash Drive or DVD...</p>
<p>If you have purchased Win 8 and have a key, you can check out this link for a download.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it was preinstalled, about your only option would be a Win 8.1 Flash\DVD which would work OK for booting and doing a repair...</p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW... it's not really a good idea to have both Windows drives hooked up at the same time... Either unhook the one not being used, or "HIDE" and make "Not Active".</p>

    <title>Playing HD MTS video files causes blue screen crash windows 7 home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Playing HD MTS video files causes blue screen crash windows 7 home premium 64-bit</h2>
                    <p><span>I've tried everything I could find via various searches to try to correct this problem, but nothing I have yet tried will correct this problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Solutions I have tried include updating display and sound card drivers, uninstalling and reinstalling same, running the Windows Memory Diagnostic which didn't discover any hardware problems, Microsoft
 Fixit ditto, the scannow utility ditto and numerous others.</span></p>
<p><span>When I play a full HD (1920 x 1080) MTS file, which was imported onto my hard drive from an SD card from a Canon Vixia G10 Camcorder, it plays for between 3 and 8 minutes, then the screen turns
 blue for a few seconds then turns black. This occurs when using Windows Media Player or VLC Media Player. Sometimes this is accompanied by a buzzing noise and sometimes from a sound similar to a needle being stuck on a phonograph record (for those of you who
 remember that). The only remedy is to shut down with the power button and start back up.</span></p>
<p><span>I can play the same file after converting it to MP4 at 720 x 480 with Nero Video 11 and it plays normally. Working with the files in that program doesn't cause any problem, but I recently decided
 to try Cyberlink Power Director 10 to convert my files, and it caused the same problem about 3 minutes into the rendering process to convert an MTS to an MP4.</span></p>
<p><span>My computer is a custom-built Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 950 @ 3.07 GHz 3.07 GHz.</span></p>
<p><span>I emphasize, this only occurs when working with MTS files. It has not occurred during any other activity.</span></p>
<p><span>Any and all suggestions greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span>1. When Windows Media Player was my default player I was double-clicking the files and opening them with WMP. When this problem developed I started right-clicking and opening them with VLC, which exhibited the same behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>2. As I said in my post, I am able to convert the files to MP4 at 720 x 480 with Nero Video and they will play normally in any player. As I also said, it occurs with MTS files and no other&nbsp;types that I have played. However, it occurs with all MTS files.</span></p>
<p><span>I have long since gone through all the steps in your post, as I have seen the same advice on other posts in this forum.</span></p>
<p><span>My NVidia GTS 430 did not support changing hardware acceleration, nor does the 450 I replaced it with yesterday. After I replaced it I played an 11 min. 20 sec 1.9 GB MTS HD video all the way through with VLC and the problem did not occur. Maybe there
 was a hardware fault in the old card, although none of the tests I conducted detected it, or it wasn't powerful enough to play these files. I am hoping that the new, more powerful video card corrected the problem, but time will tell.</span></p>

                    <p>I need to rotate a number of JPG photos taken with my Microsoft 950XL phone and viewed on Windows 10 in the Photos app. There must be no degradation of picture quality.<br />

            This, apparently, is a widespread issue. The best thing to do when this happens is hard reset your xbox. I had to teach myself this because Microsoft hasn't fixed the software issue and their tech line always assumed it's your router or Internet and will
 have you reboot a console before figuring it out, generally. Hold the button on the front down for at least 5 seconds until the console Powers off and then unplug the power from the back of the console wait a few seconds and plug it back in. After powering
 up everything should be resolved.

            Also, take your console off quick boot up if it's on it. It has a common issue with skipping steps just like their windows platform. Let it take it's time to boot.&nbsp;

&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And <br />
I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - <strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong><br />
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device<br />
maker (such a RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t open folders in Homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lray801  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open folders in Homegroup</h2>
                    I just bought a new laptop and put W7 Ultimate Signature Edition on it.&nbsp; My other laptop has Ultimate build 7100.&nbsp; For a couple days I have been able to use the Homegroup but all of a sudden I cannot open the files on my old laptop in Homegroup.&nbsp; My other
 laptop can access this one.&nbsp; I have left and rejoined the homegroup and also tried different networks.&nbsp; The only thing I can see that is different is the look of the folders.&nbsp; For some reason they look different on my new laptop than they do on my old laptop.<br />
<br />
When I click on the folder nothing happens.&nbsp; If I right-click and tell it to open in new window, it still does nothing.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p><span>Hello Iray,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers community forums!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate Mark's reply, however, you can take a look at the following:<br />
<br />
What happens when you try to boot in safe mode?<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>To start your computer in safe mode, you can refer the below link:&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>One thing you can try is doing a system restore.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Refer the below link to know how to perform a system restore:<br />

<p><span>Step 2:<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>If that doesn’t work you can try running the following command: go to Start, All Programs, Accessories, right click Command Prompt choose Run as Administrator then type the following command
 and press enter: </span></p>
<p><span>secedit /configure /cfg %windir%\inf\defltbase.inf /db defltbase.sdb /verbose</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3:</span></p>
<p><span>Share files and folders over the network:</span></p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It would seem that there's no way to "sign out" of Skype on the Xbox One without actually signing out of your account on the console.<br />
<br />
The support page&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/apps/skype-faq#b5a9a4edecd74d75be9b5122f62446b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>currently lists all of the troubleshooting for the application as well as features.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It's possible indirectly: If you sign in with multiple Microsoft accounts to your XB1 you will get notifications for chats and calls to come in on all of these. So by switching Microsoft accounts on your Xbox you can switch between their Skype accoutns at the same time.</p>

            <p>@Hassassinade: You are right, it's not possible to sign out, but at least come very close to that by switching online status to "Invisible" and disabling notifications.

    <title>Strict NAT and Teredo Tunneling errors on a university network - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strict NAT and Teredo Tunneling errors on a university network</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I am a tech support manager for a university in Texas. &nbsp;We receive support calls and emails from students regarding internet connectivity issues with the Xbox One that boil down to errors related to NAT and Teredo tunneling. &nbsp;Before contacting us the students
 usually do some research and contact us wanting us to change the NAT settings on the network used in the residence halls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dont' use NAT on our network. All the devices on our network have public IP addresses. There are no NAT settings for us to adjust.</p>
<p>Also, we get frequent calls on Teredo related errors. Teredo is designed to work in a NAT environment. Again, something we do not use on our network.</p>
<p>The Xbox One seems to be hardwired to operate in a network environment where there are not public IP addresses, only those handed out by a router like in a residential setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end result is we have a LOT of students with shiny new Xbox Ones that don't work and they are not happy about it. We don't like it either but there is nothing we can do about it. And that is why I am posting this here.</p>
<p>I have looked for some official way to contact MS on seeing if we can do something to resolve this issue but I have had no luck. I would be thrilled if we could get some of our engineers together with some folks from MS to see if something can be done to
 fix this.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and thank you for your help.</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p>Hey there, Tim!</p>
<p>The Xbox One functions quite well with a public IP address, as we often suggest setting up the console under DMZ or directly connect to their modem; both of which will give the console a public IP address, as I am sure you are aware.</p>
<p>It seems the problem you may be running into is the Teredo IP address issue, and that is likely what is at fault for all the issues (as long as each device is getting its <strong>own&nbsp;</strong>public IP address). Sometimes, the Teredo error will show up and <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restoring the console to factory defaults</a> is required. While we don't know the cause for this, if the factory reset doesn't happen, the error is a result of the ISP themselves.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Network Connection Troubleshooter</a> is quite in depth, and may be able to help you troubleshoot users that call you guys. Have you given it a shot yet? They should be able to work with you, this troubleshooter, and your access to their routing device to help nail down any possible networking issues. I suggest trying it out, especially with any Teredo IP errors you guys may receive a call about.</p>
<p>My main suggestion is to try that out first. What I am going to do on my end is pass this along to the appropriate people and see what I can dig up for you. I will post back once I have more information from them. :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>We always suggest that the console owner restore to factory default. This has helped in some instances but usually not.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back from you. Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hey, GJB. Seems like what the students are likely running into is how the University gateway/firewall is setup for handling unsolicited, inbound connectivity for P2P communications, and possibly consoles failing to acquire a Teredo address. Party Chat and
 many multiplayer titles use a P2P mesh topology for network communications, which requires open inbound communications to the Xbox One console. Teredo is used for a few things here, such as detecting the public IP/port of the console if it's behind a NAT (sounds
 like it doesn't apply here), detecting what type of inbound/outbound connectivity is allowed to the console behind whatever network gear the console is traversing to reach the outside world, acting as an endpoint for bubble packets to hit, and securing network
 communications between the console and its peers.</p>
<p>So first thing first, if any of the students are getting an error that their console can't obtain a Teredo address, that will block Party Chat and many multiplayer games. UDP 3544 outbound needs to be open, and the console will default to a source port of
 UDP 3074 when targeting the Teredo server pool. If the console is getting a Teredo address, then next thing would be to see what Teredo is detecting as far as what inbound connectivity is allowed. If you go under Settings, and Network. The Open/Moderate/Strict
 NAT detection will be present here. If you go to Test Multiplayer Connection on this page, it will re-detect the NAT type and run a few more tests. After the Multiplayer Test is run, and before selecting "Continue", press and release both triggers and both
 bumpers on the controller at the same time. A more advanced test will run, and a more descriptive Teredo NAT type will show (IP Restricted, Port Restricted, Sequential Port Symmetric, etc.) What Teredo detects here will give us a good idea on next steps.

<p>I did contact the IT folks at my university. I was told that it is a hardware compatibility issue stemming from my Xbox One console. There is nothing they can do on the network side of things. They said several students have had this issue now over the past
 year, that they (the IT department) have been in contact with Microsoft engineers, and it was ultimately resolved by sending the consoles back to be replaced by units with a different hardware and/or firmware configuration. I've been trying to follow up on
 this but it always seems to just confound the tech support from Microsoft.</p>

<p>We all have the same firmware on our consoles and the same hardware, this problem is in nature of how is NAT implemented on sites or traffic filtering. Microsoft use some special protocols to help fight with NAT and firewalls automatically, but this not
 always can be done without manual configuration.</p>

    <title>The Movies &#40;2005 Lionhead&#47;EA Game&#41; - Pitch Black character - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the wildman  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Movies &#40;2005 Lionhead&#47;EA Game&#41; - Pitch Black character textures due to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I came upon difficulties just getting to install and&nbsp;play this game back when I reinstalled it on Windows 8. I've seen a few reports here and there concerning this issue ( getting to play it at all ).&nbsp;I think I should take the time to explain
 how I did it, just in case other people have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The game didn't launch automatically upon inserting the disc like most games do. I went and opened the CD's folders manually to uncover its files. I clicked on setup.exe and I could install the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The game tries to make you install an older version of DirectX. The game is so old, it thinks the new versions are not new. All you have to do is choose&nbsp;not to install the game's proposed version of DirectX. It's obsolete. If you installed their DirectX
 version, then you must re-install the correct, newest version and I think you might&nbsp;also have to reinstall the game altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My issue</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After figuring this out, I could play the game properly last spring/summer. Then came Windows 10. Like most people I guess, I upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently tried to play The Movies again. The game still works. I can launch and play it.&nbsp;But now there's a new issue. I didn't have it on Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I play, at some point, some characters turn pitch black. It's a texture issue for sure. Only their eyes are left. The rest of them is all black, just like they are made out of nothing. Then the game crashes to desktop. Usually, it takes between
 15 to 25 minutes until it happens, but not always. You can make it happen faster by trying to save your game. At some point, it crashes when you try to save.&nbsp;Auto-saves definitely crash it at some point or another ( the 15 to 25min part&nbsp;I was referring to
 ).&nbsp;I can save the game until the characters turn pitch black. When they are black, the game crashes to desktop. So is it just a texture issue? I don't think so, otherwise I could save my game with the black characters glitch, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was my saved game that had been corrupted. I created new games but the issue came back again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure this one out. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game multiple times. Back when it was working, I had the Stunts &amp; Effects additional content along with some mods. I thought maybe it was one of the mods that was making
 the game crash. I deleted every single mod and when I saw nothing was working,&nbsp;I even went in regedit to delete everything that was related to the game The Movies before reinstalling it as if it was the very first time. I reinstalled the core game ( without
 the additional content ) and I'm still getting the same issue. There is a patch out there for the game that came before Stunts &amp; Effects. The game has the issue whether or not the patch is installed.&nbsp;I was curious so I took my very old computer that still
 runs on Windows XP and the game worked fine. But, as you may understand, I want to play it&nbsp;on my new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This led me to believe Windows 10 has something to do with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check for Windows updates very regularly. The only things I could've done to affect the game in the recent months is the installation of Windows 10. Whilst I know it's a texture issue that's within the game, I'm also certain it's not due to the game itself,
 but due to the OS running the game. There's something that came with Windows 10 or its subsequent updates that makes the game do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried compatibility mode, it didn't work. I can still run the game, but I also still get the pitch black characters issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only a The Movies issue. I have other games - many of them are quite old, older than The Movies - and I can run them properly although some do need to have their compatibility settings modified. I have two other Lionhead games: Black &amp; White 1 and 2,
 and both games seem to work just fine. Black &amp; White 2 was made at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly doubt it has anything to do with my graphics card or driver. They are fine and work 100% with all the other games I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a laptop ( ASUS 555L ). Like I said, I already played The Movies on it. I can play fairly recent games ( ex: Pillars of Eternity (2015)&nbsp;) and old games too ( ex: Populous 3 (1998). It's not normal that I can't play The Movies, but then again
 I'm sure it has something to do with Windows 8/10 because even at the beginning it didn't want to launch automatically, and I had to fight my way&nbsp;out to make this game launch in the first place. That was due to the OS not cooperating, I'm pretty sure of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I browsed the web for answers. Saw some guy had a similar issue and talked about it on a forum. Another person told him to go to Task Manager and set "Affinity" to a limited number of CPU. I tried this, I thought it was working at first, but then the issue
 came back. Black character texture, crash to desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw other people complaining about this very same issue, but not here, and they didn't have answers that could fix this. But among those who&nbsp;managed to make the game run on Windows 8,&nbsp;they too&nbsp;all began to get this issue&nbsp;with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't rely on Lionhead or EA's tech support, they don't offer any support for the game. It's too old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only hope someone out there has some tips or ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT:</span></em> I didn't check before. Probably because you have been able to launch the game, but
<em>secdrv.sys&nbsp; </em>is on this </p>
<p>games disk, which means you should have never been able to launch the game&nbsp; on Win10, much</p>
<p>less have a missing textures issue. Win10's DRM Blocking should have not allowed more than a bogus</p>
<p><em>'run as admin' error.</em><em>- Movies</em> should require a noCD fix to run at all with Win10. Unless using an illegitimate copy which would includea noCD in the kit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I just ran the game on Win10 for at least 30 min (using a noCD) .</p>
<p>A few minutes past making the second movie, and the textures have all been good so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>---------------</p>
<p><em>"It's not a priority issue for MS and I'm well aware of that. It's good to see you also&nbsp;spend time on little cases like mine."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing to do with MS. This is a community forum (despite some having titles such as 'MS support engineer', which</p>
<p>from what I've seen, translates to phone support via the forums). </p>
<p>- I'm just another long term gamer with an interest in learning while I try to help. Some of the others have</p>
<p>PC repair business, etc., so there is a wide range of experience on the forums.</p>
<p>We can all be a bit capricious regarding what we respond to. The mood of the moment, you might say. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"If it wasn't compatible, I couldn't play it at all."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be correct, but a number of older games have colour issues. DIABLO 2 is one example, but there is</p>
<p>a fan based fix for that game. </p>
<p>I ran The Movies test movie last night and it went well, but I assume that an FMV would not have the problem</p>
<p>you are... facing ( ;D ).&nbsp; I've had the game on the shelf for years, but never got around to playing it.
</p>
<p>I&nbsp; suppose if I were to play awhile I may also get the&nbsp; missing texture issue ? I'll try (no promise) to give is a
</p>
<p>go later and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The copy protection would not cause missing textures. Win10 does have it's own little malware MS has dubbed
</p>
<p>DRM Blocking, which is preventing many disk based games from loading. You can read my rant on my
</p>

--here--</a>&nbsp; for future reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"The game nevertheless won't work if you install its DirectX and will work if you don't though."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm, curiouser and curiouser, eh! I didn't pick up on this part earlier.</p>
<p>I assume that when you reinstalled DX again that you used the</p>
<p>June 2010 Redist ? (old it may be, but it still has the most recent DX 9,10 and 11 files)</p>
<p>This will overwrite all DX files and repair any corruption in the process.</p>
<p>(One reason I hate new games always reinstalling DX without offering an option not to is the increased</p>
<p>potential of corruption. Leave well enough alone, I reckon).</p>

</p><p><em>"Coming here was my last resort, to be honest. I was afraid I'd be told it's just the game's problem, "</em></p>

            &nbsp;Hi,<br />
<div>Do you see the printer in Device Manager?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method1:</strong></div>
<div>
<div>You may try to&nbsp;connect the printer using wired connection and then check if it detects. if it does, then uninstall the printer software and drivers and then install them back. Refer the following link.</div>
<div><strong>Add or remove a printer</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/add-or-remove-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/add-or-remove-a-printer</a></div>
<div>Also applies for Win 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to install latest driver for it. Refer the following link.</div>
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></div>
