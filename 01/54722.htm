<h2>            echo dot 3rd gen setup</h2>
                    I have windows 8 on my pc and am using an old apple iPhone 4. I can't install the alexa app on either one. I was able to set up my echo dot by logging into the alexa.amazon.com site. I would like to set up communications so I can call other people and
 drop in on other people as well but everything says I have to download the alexa app for this. I would like to know if there is a work around.&nbsp; Thank you

            Unfortunately no there's not a workaround for that.&nbsp; Although if you update to Windows 10, you can use the official Alexa app for Windows, which is in the Windows 10 store.<br />

    <title>Update KB4343898 for Windows 8.1-x64 &#40;Aug 2018 Rollup, incl. L1TF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 111milestogo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update KB4343898 for Windows 8.1-x64 &#40;Aug 2018 Rollup, incl. L1TF fix&#33;&#41; stuck with &#34;Pending Restart&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The Aug 2018 Update Rollup for Windows 8.1 64-bit KB4343898 is a most important one because of the L1TF CPU bugfix contained therein. Unfortunately, on my main production Windows 8.1-64 installation, this update gets stuck in a continuous "pending restart"
 state. I can't get it to install satisfactorily, no matter what I try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remark: KB4343898 installs properly in a Windows 8.1-64 virtual machine of mine, running within Oracle VirtualBox under Linux (both openSUSE Tumbleweed and Majaro) on the same machine as the malfunctioning one. And it installs properly on another PC of mine.
 But it fails on my main production machine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the following text, I am including the original German Windows wording, preceded by a translation to what I think might be close to the English wording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms of malfunction of KB4343898:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading and installing work as expected before the required reboot. At this point, the Win 8.1 Updater GUI (Start Menu &gt; "PC Settings" ("PC Einstellungen") &gt; "Update/Recovery" ("Update/Wiederherstellung") reports the status "Pending restart" ("Ausstehender
 Neustart nach Installation am ..."). The Windows Control Panel ("Systemsteuerung") &gt; Programs ("Programme") &gt; "Programs and Features" ("Programme und Features") &gt; "Show installed updates" ("Installierte Updates anzeigen") reports KB4343898 as installed already
 at this point in time.</li><li>Rebooting as required seems to do the extected actions, prepare Windows and install updates. However, the Updater GUI keeps reporting KB4343898 as "Pending restart", it does so perpetually.</li><li>From then on, my Windows continues to do the Windows preparations and updates installation at every restart or cold start of my computer. It does this either right away, or it does it after the next check for update availability (both an automatic check
 the next day or a manual check).</li><li>In conclusion, this most important update is not installing properly, and it is a time-comsuming nuisance at every restart.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>In order to try the remedies I could get hold of, I am working from a system backup, fully updated except for KB4343898. I restored this backup every time a remedy would fail, and started from scratch again. In summary, NONE of the remedies worked.</p>
<ol>
<li>I took the guided tour (https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors) all the way through:
<ol>
<li>The troubleshooting tools claimed to have fixed some things, but to no avail.</li><li>Trying to fix the update components by renaming the software distribution folders C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution and C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 (after stopping the four services wuauserv, cryptSvc, bits, msiserver) didn't help. This made the update history
 go away, but the system kept to do "installing updates" at every restart.</li><li>Trying to fix corrupt Windows files via "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" didn't get anywhere, DISM stopped with Error 3017, asking for a reboot in order to roll its changes back. No success with that.</li><li>"sfc /scannow" would not run at all, saying a system repair and reboot were pending. Yeah, sure...</li></ol>
</li><li>I downloaded KB4343898's .msu file and installed it manually. The standalone installer reported "successful installation, please reboot", wherafter everything was back to the perpetual "pending restart" plus "error during installation" status.</li><li>I tried to get rid of the C:\Windows\WinSxS\pending.xml file. "takeown /f C:\Windows\WinSxS\pending.xml" was successful, but the ensuing "ren C:\Windows\WinSxS\pending.xml pending.old" would throw an "access denied" no matter what I would do (looked at
 security settings for this file and changed them to full access). No luck with this published method, access denied! Funny enough, I was allowed to text-edit pending.xml and delete its inner contents. However, this didn't help the perpetual "pending restart"
 either. At this point, the Updater GUI reported an error code 80073712 for KB4343898 in addition to the "pending restart" status.</li><li>I tried downloading / installing KB4343898 without my antivirus software, i.e. deactivating the AutoProtect of Norton Security. No success either, as expected.</li></ol>
<p>Thus, I am down to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anybody out there who could offer other methods of remedy? Anybody who has succeeded in getting this update to install? In case of a successful remedy, how would I know for sure that this update has installed in full and properly?</li><li>I am URGENTLY asking Microsoft to get KB4343898 fixed, since it has the MANDATORY bugfix for the L1TF CPU flaw.</li></ol>
<p>I am sparing you the rant. Just one thing though: I used to run two Windows 10 machines, until one of the fat upgrade rounds sent them both down the drain by causing perpetual BSOD's. So I ruefully returned to Windows 8.1, hoping for a smooth sailing (well,
 that worked for a bit more than half a year until now...). So I have not only lost the money for two Windows 10 licenses to Microsoft, but now I received the headaches and pains I am reporting here.<br />

<p>I* am having the EXACT SAME PROBLEM! I am so glad this worked for you but it's seems questionable that you were fortunate. I've put in hours myself trying to do the same actions as 111 miles to go Windows just WILL NOT UPDATE! Can you find out a fix for
 this? I understand that you are just a volunteer but your short answer ,can you not find information in a library of Microsoft or something!I have Not been able to do so. Or is there a different volunteer with technical capabilities to help. How does a person
 get this information on this situation TO MICROSOFT!Thanks</p>

<p>I know how you feel. I've done the tasks also and Windows update continues to "fail." I'm glad you posted this. I was thinking of upgrading to !) since it seems to be the only operating system that Microsoft supports now! It sould have been a simple fix,but
 I've also spent a month on this problem and even when I DO RESTART ,Windows update says it has "failed and I spending a LOT of time without the use of my computer!Thank you! I am on windows 8.1. Now that I know upgrading to 10 won't solve the problem.</p>

</p><p>FWIW, maybe some further info could be helpful:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I have two PCs with Windows 8.1-x64. One is an HP EliteBook 8560w from 2011 - here the KB4343898 install failed; one is an even older HP Compaq 8710p from 2008 - KB4343898 went fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both machines have MBR-partitioned hard disks (SSDs), both are BIOS-booted, neither one has Secure Boot. (Secure Boot seems to have been problematic with some updates for some people.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both machines have Norton Security, updated to the latest status. I had deactivated Norton on the machine where KB4343898 failed.</p>

<p>I could finally resolve the perpetual "pending restart" loop caused by the obnoxious but critically important KB4343898 update pack for Windows 8.1-x64. My solution is to take the C:\Windows \WinSxS\pending.xml away, i.e. rename it to e.g. pending.xml.old.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method to get such renaming done is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot from an installation medium, e.g. DVD or USB stick,</li><li>continue from the language selector screen,</li><li>go to the computer repair options (lower left of the screen),</li><li>then go to advanced options,</li><li>and finally go to command prompt.</li></ul>
<p>At this admin command prompt, use</p>
<p>to find the drive letter of the malfunctioning Windows "C:" partition, then rename your pending.xml file by issueing</p>
<p>where L is to be replaced by the appropriate drive letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done, reboot into your Windows system. In my case, it took two reboots for Windows to do the necessary "Preparing to configure Windows" and "Configuring Windows updates". While "Configuring updates" had never arrived at 100% at the time of the failed KB4343898
 installation, it did reach 100% now. Thereafter, the Windows Updater GUI reports KB4343898 as having been installed successfully. I hope this message now is the full and complete and sustainable truth, as opposed to the Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs
 and features &gt; Installed updates which does even report a failed update with a date of installation, letting me erroneously assume it is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried such renaming before (cf. my initial post here) by following advice found on this answers.microsoft.com website. However, those writeups turn out to have shortcomings - which is the reason why I wrote things down in the details given above. In
 several places I read to just get into an elevated command prompt from the malfunctioning Windows system in question, issue a</p>
<p>(which works fine), then do the actual renaming</p>
<p>which caused an "access denied" for me no matter what I tried. It takes booting from an installation medium to do it.</p>

<li>Boot from an installation medium, e.g. DVD or USB stick,</li><li>continue from the language selector screen,</li><li>go to the computer repair options (lower left of the screen),</li><li>then go to advanced options,</li><li>and finally go to command prompt.</li></ul>
<p>At this admin command prompt, use</p>
<p>to find the drive letter of the malfunctioning Windows "C:" partition, then rename your pending.xml file by issueing</p>
<p>where L is to be replaced by the appropriate drive letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done, reboot into your Windows system. In my case, it took two reboots for Windows to do the necessary "Preparing to configure Windows" and "Configuring Windows updates". While "Configuring updates" had never arrived at 100% at the time of the failed KB4343898
 installation, it did reach 100% now. Thereafter, the Windows Updater GUI reports KB4343898 as having been installed successfully. I hope this message now is the full and complete and sustainable truth, as opposed to the Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs
 and features &gt; Installed updates which does even report a failed update with a date of installation, letting me erroneously assume it is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried such renaming before (cf. my initial post here) by following advice found on this answers.microsoft.com website. However, those writeups turn out to have shortcomings - which is the reason why I wrote things down in the details given above. In
 several places I read to just get into an elevated command prompt from the malfunctioning Windows system in question, issue a</p>
<p>(which works fine), then do the actual renaming</p>
<p>which caused an "access denied" for me no matter what I tried. It takes booting from an installation medium to do it.</p>

<p>Wow! That's pretty complicated. Thanks for the reply. I Really guess you are a determined person to continue to the lengths that you have done so to get this download, it's kind of ridiculous to me that Microsoft can't make this easier.</p>

<p>Just an short update here. I did now also try to install KB4343898 with Norton Security and even some other software fully UNinstalled, but to no avail at all. I also tried to install KB4343888 which provides only the L1TF bugfix without all other patches
 contained in the Aug 2018 rollup KB4343898. No success either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus I am fully convinced now that Microsoft did indeed provide flawed update packages KB4343898 and KB4343888. I hope to see some confirmation someday that my installation with manual fix (remove pending.xml) is 100% complete and functional, and that Microsoft
 will provide a fix for the KB4343898 flaw if necessary and possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do really HATE - even more so given all the time I invested into this - that sentence on the KB4343898 web page: "Microsoft is not aware of any problems with this update." !!!</p>

    <title>Issues with DirectPlay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salvaro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with DirectPlay</h2>
                    <p>Could someone please assist me with a problem I'm encountering? Since yesterday I've been trying to install AOE3 Complete Edition on Steam,
 but every time I do, after inputing the product key, I am asked to install DirectPlay as it states it may hinder my ability to play this 'app'. When I attempt installing DirectPlay, however, I keep getting the same error message: Error code: 0x80073712, stating
 the files are corrupted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I did to try fixing this problem, was to click on the link below on 'how to fix this problem'. It took me to a Microsoft website on installing .Net Framework 3.5. After doing some research, I found a Youtube video that, after showing I needed
 the June 2010 .Net Framework 3.5, stated that you must install the DXSETUP file found within the above mentioned downloaded file. &nbsp;After doing all this, it still didn't fix my DirectPlay problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried unintstalling and reinstalling the game about 3 times, as I read somewhere that it could be a problem within the files when you were installing/uninstalling, but still to no avail. Then, I looked up online how to remove/clean corrupted files,
 and I was presented with a code, 'sfc /scannow' to be used on the Command Prompt application, and yet still no changes with my corrupted files issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went to the Control Panel, went to Windows features on or off, and I checked the DirectPlay file within the Legacy Compoments, and still no signs of any changes. At this point I'm just so frustrated could you please assist me on what it is I should
 do in order to get DirectPlay working correctly?? </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please and Thank You.</p>

            I tried what was mentioned by Andre, but no luck. &nbsp;I tried every single option available, and no matter what setting was applied by the program, it was the same result. &nbsp;I try installing it, a small windows of the game's name comes out, after which settings
 &nbsp;stating I need to install DIrectPlay or I may have issues playing my game. &nbsp;If I chose to skip or install this feature, the same thing happens, &nbsp;I get a message stating DirectPlay couldn't install because a component store was corrupted.

                    <p>Original title: Beeping sound&nbsp; instead of error sound</p>
<p>Hi, I got new problem with my 2nd laptop.<br />
The problem is hard to solve.<br />
My sound card, everything is alright.<br />
I can hear sound very well.<br />
But the problem is, i hear BIOS booting sound-"Beep!"ing instead<br />
of system error sound(like when you type "abcdefg" in run, low piano tone sound comes out with<br />
X mark error msg).<br />
That's all the problem i got.<br />
Only error sound is the problem.<br />
My sound card driver is alright.<br />
How do i solve this problem?</p>

            Okay.<br />
<br />
Most sounds XP makes are configurable.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Sounds and Audio Devices and look on the Sounds tab.<br />
<br />
Look in the Program events section.<br />
<br />
When you type abcdefg into Start, Run, and click OK, XP should play the sound associated with the event called
<br />
Highlight the Critical Stop Program event and see what .wav file is associated with that event.&nbsp; The files are usually in the c:\windows\media folder so you can change the sound file of your own into that folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Click the little black right arrow to play the sound associated with the Event Critical Stop and what do you hear?<br />
<br />
It is usually going to be set to:<br />
<br />
<br />
If it is not, change it and save the changes.&nbsp; You can just pick any sound you like from the Sounds drop down list of .wav files and listen to it and if you like it, click OK to save it.&nbsp; If you don't like it, leave it alone or pick another one.<br />
<br />
When I get new mail, instead of the new mail sound (default is New Mail Notification.wav), I have Homer Simpson saying "The mail!&nbsp; The mail is here!".&nbsp; Sometimes I change it to a crowing rooster.<br />
<br />
If your Windows <span style="font-weight: bold">XP Critical Stop.wav</span> file is missing or somehow doesn't sound right when you play it, I can upload one to my SkyDrive and you can download it and replace it.
<br />
<br />
Check them all!&nbsp; Change them all!&nbsp; Some Events have no sound, but you can assign a sound to any of those events or change any of them.<br />
<br />

Also, if those steps don't help. Try to uninstall Bully from the console and reinstall it to see if that helps.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also to clarify, what happens when you try to use the controller? Is it that the console doesn't detect it, or maybe certain buttons aren't working.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro - Can&#39;t backup or use File History - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam hirzalla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Can&#39;t backup or use File History</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I installed Windows 10 Pro on my SSD I've been finding out some of the Windows features aren't working. One of the main things is Back up and Restore. The first thing I tried doing after a fresh windows installation was create an Image or backup
 my windows so that I could go back to it if something happens. Whenever I tried the backup option, it would stop mid-way and tell me that the last backup did not finish successfully. I also can't seem to use the File History feature, since I can't choose a
 drive because it says there isn't any usable drives. Both my 250GB SSD and 1TB HDD have plenty of space in them (SSD with over 70GB and HDD with over 650GB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I care way more for the backup feature since I only use the SSD boot drive for windows, so all my personal data will be on the HDD which wouldn't be affected upon a format or a reset, so a File History isn't a necessity.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've mentioned above, the File History is Turned off and I can't click it to turn it on (you can check the screenshot).</p>
<p>The button doesn't get highlighted or clickable until Insert an external drive. Even so, it should be able to detect my HDD that's inside my PC, should it not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool
 as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please <span>&nbsp;</span>run Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal mode. Disable
 other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before starting any of this, now that you mention it, I already have CCleaner downloaded along with Avast! and Malewarebytes Free. I've ran multiple scans last week (the week I got my windows installation) and I remember clicking the "Fix all" option on
 CCleaner. I also remember it showing up a lot of registry errors and I clicked Fix it. That might've been my problem, I had no idea that this could mess my windows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So knowing all this, could you please guide me on what I should do? Do I proceed with your instructions while unchecking the registry tool? Do I uninstall CCleaner and install it again without the Registry tool? Keep in mind I've already changed or in terms
 of CCleaner "fixed" a lot of registry settings last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adam.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You should not use the Registry cleaner component of cCleaner. You could use a System Restore point if you have one dating before you ran the Registry Cleaner. Otherwise I would just do what I suggested in my previous message.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update &#40;Reboot Endless Loop&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcytech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update &#40;Reboot Endless Loop&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm pretty sure most of you would know that after 10th April 2018...Windows will no longer receive security updates and etc...<br />
It would say like:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>"Important updates needed</p>
<p>
</p><p>"After April 10, 2018, Microsoft will no longer support your version of Windows 10, and this PC won't receive official security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"These security updates help protect your personal data from harmful viruses, malware, spyware, and other malicious software. Microsoft recommends updating to the latest version of Windows 10 immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Select Download updates to begin downloading and installing the new version of Windows 10. The update may be up to 6 GB, and may take a few hours to download depending on your internet speed and PC performance. Internet access fees may apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(button) "Download updates</p>
<p>(button) "I need help</p>
<p>(button) "Not right now"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once I click update now and finish downloading the update. it prompts me to update now and install...Then it restarts and starts the percentage with blue screen<br />
</p>
<p>Once it finishes till 100% and restart again, it would then start a loop where it launches the boot screen<br />
<br />
(HP Boot Screen) -&gt; (Windows 10 Startup Screen with the circle dots going around at the bottom) -&gt; (Then there's like a small cmd prompt blink and vanishes) -&gt; (Followed by a "Attempting to recover installation" with the white dots moving in a circle again)
 -&gt; (Then a second later, "Restoring your previous version of Windows") -&gt; Then blank screen and computer restarts from the HP Boot Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help me fix this!!! Are there any ways to recover this issue? Is it a glitch or smth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I can try and get a video of the process if I can try and post it here</p>

            A <em>Recovery Drive</em> serves as a back up of your system files and personal files which you can use even if your PC won't start. To create a recovery drive, you'll need a USB drive. An
<em>Installation Media</em> is a Windows installer that you could also use to restore or reset your PC.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You can only create a recovery drive if your PC is working.<br />

<p>Hi BCYTECH,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various options in <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong> that would help you restore your computer. We suggest going first with Startup Repair to fix problems that keep Windows from loading. To proceed, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi Adrianne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, Which OS should I choose? Because there is one option which was blank and looks like a control panel icon while there's another option with Windows 10 logo which states Windows 10...Therefore I selected Windows 10 because it is the
 logical answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run it and waited for it to be done</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result was :</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC</strong></p>
<p><em>Press 'Advanced options' to try other options to repair your PC or 'Shut Down' to turn off your PC</em></p>
<p><em>Log file: E:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</em></p>
<p>[Button: ShutDown] [Button: Advanced Options]</p>
<p>What should I do? Any advice please?</p>

<p>Hello <em>BCYTECH</em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted or damaged Windows system file is possibly preventing you from performing a
<strong><em>Startup </em></strong><strong><em>Repair</em></strong>. To help you resolve the issue, you can rebuild the
<strong>Boot Configuration Data (BCD)</strong> and running <strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool using a Windows 10 installation media.
<strong>BCD</strong> is a firmware database for boot-time configuration data. The
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool is designed to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If you haven't created an installation media yet, you can refer to
<em>Andre Da Costa</em>'s <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326" title="How to Download Official Windows 10 ISO files Using Media Creation Tool or Directly Using your Web Browser">forum
 article</a></strong> for the steps on how to create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've created your Windows 10 installation media, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot from your Windows 10 installation media.</li><li>On the <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Setup</strong> window, click <strong>
Next</strong> &gt; <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt;
<strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong> &gt; <strong>Command</strong> <strong>
Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Select the administrator account and enter the necessary credentials.</li><li>On the <strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong> window, type the command below and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong> after each line.<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd</strong></li><li><strong>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</strong></li><li><strong>bootrec.exe /fixboot</strong></li><li><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>Wait for the process to complete.</li><li>Restart your PC and then perform a <strong><em>Startup</em></strong> <strong>
<em>Repair</em></strong> again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>- Stuck in Boot loop (2 screens kept repeating, acer logo screen, then the "Restoring your previous version of Windows" screen, then automatic restart and …)</p>
<p>- I can access my files using a bootable USB, so my hard drive is working.</p>
<p>- Used a "Windows 10 installation media" USB, to access advanced boot menu.</p>
<p>- "Go back to the previous version" gives the message "We ran into a problem ..."</p>
<p>- <span>&nbsp;</span>Used “command prompt”, and ran: chkdsk c: /r /x</p>
<p>- After reboot, no more boot loop, but again stuck in "Restoring your previous version of Windows" for hours!</p>

<p>- After restart, again stuck in "Restoring your previous version of Windows" for hours!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am giving up and will probably need to do a clean windows install. But, I am asking to see if there is anything else that I can do first. Also, does Microsoft somehow support its customers,
 when something like this happens that is totally caused by a Microsoft update?</p>

<p>Two things did you buy the correct regional currency like us currency for us account or UK for UK not France for UK accoujt and yes it is important</p>
<p>Currency cards are region specific</p>
<p>If you used an out of region card then you have another issue which we will get to in part two</p>
<p>2nd please check commerce.microsoft.com to see if its listed if you have two different currencies you redeemed the wrong card</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the possible solutions to this problem listed in this forum and it still does not resolve my problem. The issue is present on both of Windows machines with the identical setup.&nbsp; Judging by the number of questions asked concerning this
 issue, it appears to be a common problem.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 Pro Edition, version 1511, OS 10586.218. I don't care what application I tried to update, I either get this error code on the Windows Store Application crashes.&nbsp; There is obviously a bug in
 the Windows Store Application that needs to be a fix; since you can't add any applications which are installed by Windows Store any other way.&nbsp; I do not recall having this issue in previous builds of the OS.</p>

            <p>As I stated in my original post, I have tried all recommended solutions including adding another account on both computers and it does not resolve the issue.&nbsp; In addition to the one suggested, the ones that I can remember trying are the wsreset, dim scan
 and restore, sfc scan, stopping services, deleting file folders, restarting services after delete file folders, etc. and nothing resolves the issue.&nbsp; I don't know if this will help, on both computers I am logging in via a local account with the same Microsoft
 account for the Store and Office Application .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually after trying and retrying all of the suggested options on this forum, I finally started suspecting it might be Kaspersky Internet Security settings, I found the solution on Kasperky website and it has to do with the scan all encrypted connections
 I had enabled. So if you have Kasperky Internet Security and&nbsp; if you modify the scan encrypted connections setting&nbsp; by going to Settings&gt;Additional&gt;Network Settings&gt;Encrypted Connections Scanning&gt;make sure you check another option other than always scan encrypted
 connections, all should be well.</p>

    <title>Flash drive not recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wentill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flash drive not recognized</h2>
                    Hi, I've got a flash drive with some document from my collegue few days ago. When I plugged the flash drive for the first time everything went well. I did what I needed and then safely removed and unplugged the drive. After few hours when I connected it
 again Windows did not show anything and after few minutes it showed a disc with an grey icon and impossible to use or explore.<br />
<br />
So far there are three flash drives I've tested. Kingston DataTraveler 4GB, brand new A-DATA 16GB and GOODRAM 16GB. All three are working perfectly fine on an older pc with Windows XP and on a laptop with Windows 7 32-bit. On my pc A-DATA is the one taking
 long time to appear and then working fine (shown and possible to explore) and GOODRAM is the same case. Kingston appears only with a grey icon after probably same amount of time and it's not possible to work with. In the disk management A-DATA and GOODRAM
 are shown normally. Kingston is shown but without the memory information. It shows G: as a letter of a drive but there is "no medium" sign.<br />
<br />
It does not matter whether I connect the flash drives to both usb ports in the front panel or any from the rear panel.<br />
I've been using the GOODRAM mainly in the past and it worked without any problem. The flash drive was shown immediately I connected it to the pc. Then there could have been a month I haven't used any flash drive because I somehow didn't need to. And then those
 problems started to appear. Meanwhile I've installed pretty old webcamera which was actually not working with the Windows 7 drivers so I made it work with drivers for Windows Vista. Could this be the source of the problems? But still..I've uninstalled all
 the drivers for the webcam already.<br />
<br />
Other devices are working fine. Even external hard drive is working well.<br />
<br />
It's possible to use the disc again if I uninstall all the drivers for it in the device manager, then it's connected as a new one but everything happens again if plugging for the second time.<br />
<br />
I've also tried uninstalling all the drivers for devices which had been used sometimes in the past through the USBDeview software and also uninstalling all the usb drivers for the motherboard and then updating the drivers for chipset..but didn't bring any help
 :/<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and having Gigabyte GA-H55M-UD2H motherboard.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea where the problem could be? Thanks a lot for any hints..
<br />

<h2>            Xbox One S not playing all 4k blu-rays. Some work some don&#39;t.</h2>
                    <p>Please help, just had Christmas and 5 of 6 new, 4k blu rays don't won't! Not recognised error code 0x91d70000, sometimes no error, no movie, just brought back to home page. This is using the Xbox One S blu ray player app.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ghost in the shell, worked</p><p>Wonder Woman, error</p><p>Valerian city of a thousand planets, error</p><p>Westward (3 discs), error.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now additional notes</p><p>&nbsp; 1. Other 4k blu ray discs still work fine, 'Maze runner', 'Scorch Trials' and more, plus game discs.</p><p>&nbsp; 2. Batman vrs Superman 4k, doesn't work now but has in the past. On the same system and set up. Has an update to app changed things?</p><p>&nbsp; 3. No scratches or damage to discs, but getting 5 new discs not registering tells me it's the reader or the software.</p><p>&nbsp; 4. If it's the disc reader then why only certain discs work when others don't, on repeated trials.</p><p>&nbsp; 5. This leaves me thinking it's the app software, Blu-ray Player.</p>

Despite two mails chasing her up for an update. The situation with Joan was she had originally requested that I send in my Xbox for repair. I asked if it could be confirmed that any of my problem films could play in another Xbox One S. To check the App was capable of playing these films, before being without my xbox (for up to three weeks) and possibly having it sent back to me with the same problem. It was confirmed that the 'Offline Team' would look into these films to confirm they work before I would then send in my Xbox for repair. As mentioned after replying with a question, waiting a week, sending another mail and waiting two more days I still had not heard back from them.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have then gone back to Support Chat to chase this up today in which it has been confirmed that the Xbox One S currently can not play these discs a

That another support guy said I should wait until the off line team had checked the disc could play in other Xbox. I had to then ask the current support guy if this was being looked into or not. They stated it was still open and I should wait for him to look into.</

<h2>            Windows 10 Not Recognising Headphones</h2>
                    <p>My computer doesn't seem to recognise when there are headphones plugged in, and so the sound doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume its some issue with the driver (that tends to commonly be it, from looking around the forums) but I've tried updating it (downloading the Realtek high definition audio codecs from
<a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>, as one article said to do) and that hasn't worked, though I may have done it incorrectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Providing all relevant screenshots I can think of.</p>

<p>All of the above screenshots were taken while my headphones were plugged into the audio jack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my headphones work, they work with other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any help,</p>

<p>Hi Stephanie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your response. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The computer was bought second hand. I have not made any physical changes to the hardware since I bought it yesterday. I installed a few things, but nothing so major think I think it could be the obvious cause.</li><li>These headphones have worked with other devices, yes, and they still work when I try them on my phone or my laptop. However I only bought this computer yesterday and the sound wasn't working when I tried it for the first time.
</li><li>Just tried it with another brand new pair or earphones: the issue persists.&nbsp;</li><li>Am trying this, but it will require a restart. I'll report back!</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:&nbsp;</strong>Tried this. Started with uninstalling my AMD High Definition driver. Then I uninstalled the Realtek driver, which required a restart. After restarting, both drivers were back where they had been. I should mention that there was no
 Realtek driver when I first checked the device manager, I only have it after downloading the codecs from the Realtek website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: </strong>I believe this is an issue with my front panel. The sound seems to work (the headphones are detected) when I plug them in at one of the jacks on the back panel. I get a pop up message saying that an audio device was plugged in when
 I plug it in and that one was unplugged when I plug it out. I get no such message when I plug my headphones into the front panel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Policy NEEDS to Change.</h2>
                    <p>This is a usability and performance/stability disaster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the latest AMD Drivers, and Windows Update keeps replacing them with months old drivers.&nbsp; It just completely removed AMD Catalyst Control Center.&nbsp; It didn't even ASK me if I wanted to install the driver package, it just did it completely in the
 background and I had no clue until my screen flickered and I heard the "new device" ping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous.&nbsp; Users should not be expected to have to re-update their PCs as much as 2-3x per day - every other day if you're lucky with the same freaking drivers they've installed before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put an Option to turn off the driver updates.&nbsp; It's causing issues for a lot of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F***.&nbsp; What idiot even thought this was a good idea?&nbsp; Seriously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver 1.1:&nbsp; Increases Performance for &lt;Games You Play&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Day Later:&nbsp; Windows Update Silently Rolls you back to version 0.9 because apparently Microsoft thought that was cool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put in the damn option to turn it off.&nbsp; I cannot even believe this.</p>

 enabling the service. "</div>

    <title>Weird pixelation on screen &#40;temporary issue&#63;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jf lafleche  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird pixelation on screen &#40;temporary issue&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    Had a strange issue with my &nbsp;Surface RT - While in the SmartGlass app, the screen started showing strange pixelation around animating elements, loading circles, and even text. Think of a computer with a defective video card, that is what it looked like.
 I got a bit worried at that point and powered it off. When I powered it back on, it seemed to be fine.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just wondering if this sounds like a hardware issue that may become a problem in the future. If so, I'd rather exchange it now.</div>
