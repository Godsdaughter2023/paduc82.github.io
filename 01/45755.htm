    <title>Billed for digital copy twice&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Billed for digital copy twice&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I was billed for Battlefield V just the other day, I ordered it in August. In September the Xbox said I hadn't ordered it/didn't own it and I was clicking through trying to figure out why. Somewhere in the process I ordered it again (I guess) and just got
 actually billed for them yesterday. Them! I was billed for two digital copies of Battlefield V from Microsoft! How can that even happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Xbox support and tried to get a refund for the second copy, but they said it violated their terms of sale and that they could not refund it. Does anyone have any tips for me to resolve this? I don't even think I can sell the extra copy to anyone
 else because it tied to my Microsoft Account/Gamertag. What can I do?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Cal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. It should not be possible to buy a game that you already own digitally. Do you think it may be possible that your first order was on a different account? You can review your
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
past order history here</a>. Try to find the old and the new transaction for this game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from that, you can request your own refund here by filling out the refund request form :
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Request an Xbox digital product or subscription refund</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            They told you it violates the term of sale? That doesn't make sense but I haven't read the fine print on the Store terms. Maybe resubmit your case and see if you get a different answer. The only other thing I can think of is to talk to your bank and see
 if something happened there. Hope you get it resolved, sry I couldn't be of more help.

<p>I have two email confirmations right next to eachother with different order numbers. One is at a slight discount from owning several previous Battlefield games and the other is at full price. I did not notice at the time because my Outlook App often doubles
 my notifications due to a sync problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I got two charges back to back for each digital copy of the game. Upon noticing it I immediately tried to request a refund with the same form you linked. A few hours later I got an email saying my request was denied.</p>

<p>Hi Cal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to keep us updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you should reply directly to the email that your received denying you the refund to ask that they review the situation. Since you made a duplicate purchase for the same game, they should be able to look into the matter for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is helpful and best of luck to you!</p>

            Are you 100% sure you were billed twice? I mean, are you seeing two charges for the cost of the game on your bank statement?<br />
<br />
Here's the reason I ask. When you pre-order digital games far in advance, you're not necessarily charged immediately. In fact, the only way you are charged right then if you're ordering weeks/months in advance is if you're using Microsoft account funds (Xbox
 gift cards) to pay for the entire cost of the game. If you're using a credit/debit card to pay for it, or to cover whatever your Microsoft account funds don't cover, you won't be charged for the game until about 10 days before it launches.<br />
<br />
That said, the Microsoft Store Terms of Sale do permit refunds on games before they launch, even if you have paid for them in full, so whoever you're talking to appears to be greatly mistaken. So, what I would do would be to go through your bank statements
 and see just how many times you were charged; I'm believing (and hoping) it is just one time.

<p>I am 100% sure. I am looking at my statement right now. I received two email receipts from Microsoft with two separate order numbers back to back as well as two credit card activity alerts back to back. Looking at my bank statement there is a charge for
 $77.30 and a charge for $85.89 from Microsoft for the same day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of the problem is that I pre-ordered early (August) and was just charged on Tuesday for it (them). Do you think I should contact my card company and see if I can dispute the charge from them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was most definitely charged twice.</p>

<p>There is not a raid driver listed for ASUS M2A-VM HDMI for Windows 7 64 bit on the ASUS drivers page for this moboard. . I am guessing that I will not be able to install Windows 7 64 bit on this computer.</p>
<p>Wow, should this install be able to use a generic sata drive on the windows 7 64 bit install disk?</p>
<p>Unbuntu linux install with out any fuss or other driver required.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try installing Raid drivers for Windows Vista 64-bit and check if it helps.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The chipset drivers need to be developed and released by the third party motherboard manufacturer. If you need RAID drivers
 you will have to contact ASUS Support about the problem.&nbsp; Microsoft does not write any drivers for third party hardware.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />Fitting perfectly doesn't mean the RAM would work. did you check the compatibility on the device website?
<br />Another thing I can infer is the RAM might be defective- In that case, go to the shop where you bought it and ask them to put it for you.

            Hi Yanglem, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a fellow Microsoft user.
<br />
<br />If your laptop isn't booting after a change of RAM, it's quite possible one or both of the RAM sticks is faulty.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend first trying to boot up with only one RAM stick, and if that doesn't work try the other. That way you'll know if it's just one or both of the sticks at fault.
<br />
<br />If it still doesn't boot up, I'd take the RAM back to the place you purchased it from and ask for an exchange. It's most likely the RAM sticks are faulty and need to be replaced.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!       
        </p>

<h2>            Event Viewer Errors and warnings</h2>

            It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that.<span style="font-weight: bold"> There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing
 this every day -</span> we get two or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing
 you to buy software or services you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these
 people, do not give them any personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give
 them access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the best they
 can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does not do
 this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username and password
 and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email, they could
 have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often the case
 since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be good. In
 others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install or System
 Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See this article: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10. The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information
 about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the hard drive).
 If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network, ISP and
 perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online
 scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If so:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start here - https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (http://www.answerdesk.com/) in the US at this time.
 After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can start here: https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/ (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In other regions not served by the link above, go here: http://Support.microsoft.com/securityand go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally good, the
 level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:<br />

 prior transactions that were charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or
 companies for a refund - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll
 notify the authorities and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span><br />

http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases. I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone
 actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the
 matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.<br />

<p>Hello I also have this problem, googled it and it seems as many have this problem using VGA-cable.
</p>
<p>Running Windows 7 and set up the Media Center with my xbox without any problem using HDMI cable, but if I use my VGA cable it downscales to 640x480 and then it just displays artifacts... Will link to another thread also describing this issue.</p>

<p>Anyone knows how to fix it? Or most it be fixed with a update, that I think never ever will be released? :P</p>

<p>ITs probably because u are trying to do server loads on a Netbook...</p>
<p>If its an Atom cpu then its got about the same power as an average old Pentium 4 and most netbooks only have 1GB ram... &nbsp;Windows 7 runs terrible on a 1GB Pentium 4 system...</p>
<p>Also, Running 64bit Windows on under 4GB ram is pointless and will make it slower and laggier than just running 32 bit windows as 64Bit windows takes up even more ram before u even launch any apps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Edge Browser&#47;Settings&#47;Updates&#47;App Store</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10, I cannot open Settings, Edge, or the App Store. Either nothing happens or I get an error message saying, "Explorer.exe - Element not found." I have to believe that these problems are related to one another.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted, disabled my firewall, and tried the troubleshoot workaround provided on a different thread dealing with Settings not opening and none have worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

            I managed to fix this error on my LENOVO z580 laptop my uninstalling lenovo CAPOSD and onekey theatre. I also did a SFC scan before (not sure if this helped). Essentially the bloatware on my laptop was causing conflicts- try clean installing windows 10
 if installing those programs doesn't work.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you so much for this advice! I have a Lenovo Z575 laptop that had a previous Windows 7 installation and this issue has been driving me insane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The moment I uninstalled the Lenovo Onekey Theater app I was able to get the Edge browser to finally load! I couldn't find CAPOSD, but I am removing all of my other Lenovo bloatware to see if I have any further luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't Settings and a few other buttons to work from the Start menu, but I am happy that I am finally making some progress. I had a feeling there was some sort of program or service conflicting somewhere, because everything worked while in Safe Mode.</p>

            <p>Just wanted to provide an update that I uninstalled a few more Lenovo apps and now my Windows installation is running perfectly. I would have never guessed a program that came pre-installed on my laptop would cause so much headache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if anyone else is having a similar issue, uninstalling unnecessary programs that have special hardware/software functions might make everything work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>example:</p>
<p>Lenovo Onekey theater is tied to a physical button that dims the screen.</p>
<p>CAPOSD is an on-screen notification pop-up that displays your Caps-lock status</p>

            Hi,
<br />Try using the ISO file/MCT once and if it fails let us know.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.
<br /><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi Rad1o, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
I tried the simple iso file upgrade. This ended in the error message.<br />
Then I tried to switch the various services off and on, but was unable to rename the catroot2 and softwaredistribution folders even when changing the security access because windows reported that some files were in use.<br />
<br />
Then I tried the windows reset with a iso file upgrade but again ended up with the same message that the upgrade had failed.<br />
<br />
The laptop has a dual boot with linux. GRUB is set to boot into windows by default. Does GRUB interfere with the reboot to windows after upgrading?

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death When Trying to Play Black Ops 3</h2>
                    <p>Hello and Merry Christmas all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having many Blue Screen of Death issues when trying to play Call of Duty Black Ops 3. &nbsp;This has been an issue ever since i've gotten the game a few days ago and I've tried posting on other sites and the Steam forums to no avail. &nbsp;These crashes
 don't happen with any other game and seem to be exclusive to BO3. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get a BSOD it has the error&nbsp;<strong>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>(Win32kbase.sys)</strong>&nbsp;in parenthesis beside it. &nbsp;It seems fairly random when it happens but I've noticed that it seems rare during regular gameplay and typically
 happens when loading a match, loading into a lobby or in menus. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried scanning the OS for corrupted files with SFC and booting in safe mode and have found nothing amiss and&nbsp;</p>
<p>done scans with both Avast and Malwarebytes. I have the latest Nvidia graphics driver as of 12/24/15 (version 361.43)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are my System specs (custom built PC) and the link to the dump files. &nbsp;Any and all help is very much appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to all</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 Home 64 bit</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core i5 4690k @ 3.5 Ghz</p>
<p>GPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 960</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte z97x</p>
<p>RAM: 2x4GB (8GB dual channel)</p>
<p>Storage: : C: is a 120GB SSd and the game is on a 1TB HDD(E:), these are the only two drives. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The guide in setting up the Xbox One Elite Controller can only be found on our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-one/accessories/elite-controller-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Support page</a> which is through links and videos. Having a PDF manual guide would be a great idea, which we highly recommend that you send this as a suggestion to the Xbox UserVoice. That way, a user can have the option of downloading the manual guide
 in setting up Xbox One Elite Controller as a PDF, depending on one's preference. To do this, you may click the link below.</p>

            Hi Cerie, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />There are many steps involved in installing Windows 10 using Parallels, so I'd recommend following the tutorial I've linked below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/install-windows-10-on-parallels-desktop-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.parallels.com/blogs/install-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />This will give you all the steps you'll need to install Windows 10 successfully. If you run into any problems following that tutorial, please let me know! Thanks!

<p>Skype for Windows 10 doesn't have an option the fully delete a conversation, history and all. There is a hide conversation feature, but that only removes it from the Recents list. If you search, you can find it. If you get a new message in the conversation,
 it shows up in the Recents list again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fully delete a conversation is an oft requested feature. I see it here on the forum pretty regularly, and we get feedback from within the app as well. Based on interest for the feature, we've moved this very high on the To Do list and will try to bring
 the feature as soon as we can.</p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Gallery Automatic GPS Geotagging&#47;Reverse Geocoding Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Windows Photo Gallery is not using the GPS data from my photos to create geotags.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached is a screenshot from Photo Gallery -- I took the photo using my iPhone 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Location Services were set to "on," and as you can see (lower right-hand side), the phone
 recorded latitude and longitude information.&nbsp; However, when I imported the photo, Photo Gallery did not convert the latitude and longitude coordinates into a geotag (upper right-hand side).&nbsp;&nbsp; The coordinates are not in some strange location; they are in downtown
 Los Angeles--at the very least, Photo Gallery should have used the geotag "Los Angeles."&nbsp; I have similar photos from a trip to Vietnam that include latitude/longitude/GPS coordinates, but which Photo GAllery has not converted to geotags.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get Photo
 Gallery to use the latitude/longitude information to create geotags?</p>

<p><span>Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk
 in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc with it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it.<br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Repair Vista disk.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>It is not a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.<br />

<br />
Contact the Manufacturer for Recovery disk/s to reinstall Vista.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;If the computer manufacturer did not include Vista disk/s, there should be a Recovery Partition on your Hard drive.<br />
<br />
That is the way they do it now, most of the time. We are supposed to make the Recovery Disks ourselves, with instructions included in the installed Manufacturer's&nbsp;Software in Start &gt; All Programs.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the splash Screen at startup/power on, there usually is a Key number, F10, or F11,&nbsp;to hit to start Recovery Process, to take it back to factory standards (out of the box).<br />
<br />
Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options&nbsp;, and start a factory standards recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
<br />
See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
Each manufacturer has their own way of doing a Recovery to factory standards.<br />
<br />
And save all your Data before you do it, as a reinstall wipes everything from your Hard Drive..<br />
<br />
Cheers.</span></span></p>
