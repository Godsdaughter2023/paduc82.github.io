<p><span>Hi jwad,</span></p>
<p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on. Let’s do the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer
 in <strong>No Add-ons</strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can be fairly certain that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable the add-on. To open Internet Explorer in No
 Add-ons mode, please do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close all Internet Explorer Windows</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>Start</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>All Programs</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>Accessories</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>System Tools</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<strong> Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Now if the problem is not happening in No Add-ons mode then next we need to try and figure out which add-on is causing the issue (if still present then just
 skip past these steps); we can do that by doing the following (while doing these steps, if you feel like you can locate the Sonic DLA add-on, just start by disabling that and see if that resolves the issue):</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Internet Explorer (Normally, not in No add-ons mode)</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<strong>Tools</strong> button, click <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>, and then click
<strong>Enable or Disable Add-ons</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
<strong>Show</strong> box, click <strong>Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer</strong>. If you don’t see that, where it says “Show:” drop down the arrow and select All add-ons</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select an add-on one at a time and then click
<strong>Disable</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>OK</strong> when finished</span></p>
<p><span>Follow this process for about half of the add-ons, then restart IE and see if the problem is still present. If so then enable those add-ons and try disabling
 the other half. Now if you don’t have the issue we know that the problematic add-on lies in the other group. From here you can do it however you like, but through trial and error you should be able to eventually pinpoint a specific cause of this issue. Once
 you do find the add-on that is&nbsp; causing the issue you can leave it disabled and then try to find it in
<strong>Control Panel</strong>&gt; <strong>Programs</strong>&gt; <strong>Uninstall a Program</strong>. From there look through the list and try to find the add-on that was causing the problem, select it, and then click uninstall located above the list of programs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to hearing back from you with your results.</span></p>

            Hi lageneral, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

<h2>            Windows 10 update fails yet again - June 2018</h2>
                    So here we go again. There have been 3 major updates to the WIN 10 OS and all have been colossal failures. They take over your computer for 6-10 hours or more, crash, reinstall previous version.... repeat. This is truly a horror story yet again. On the
 first update, I lost use of my computer for a week while it **** around with these failures. The 2nd, almost a month of interruptions. And on this latest one, just had the first 6+ hour steal and crash. I write this on my Mac which is quickly becoming my
 system of choice given these ineptitudes. MS try hiring some competent programmers who can send out updates that actually work quickly and efficiently the first time! I look forward to the coming weeks of crashes as it tries and fails over and over and over
 and over......

            So first lock up is at 75% (6 hours) and requires a hard reset. Second crash at 82% is fatal (8 hours), then over to restore previous version. Congratulations, I award Windows 10 worst ever OS. Please stop taking over my computer for extended periods with
 products that ultimately fail.

<p>I have started to consider the windows engineering (?) team a group of not very clever people. They're not that smart. They don't learn the lesson. They don't fix what they break. They continue breaking. What they continue positively to do, is to fill windows
 with useless and disturbing features. And often after an update (of course when it works) they reset my computer configuration. They want to convince me to use other default programs. They continue to add or enable (or re-enable if I had disabled them) some
 absurd features and services that make my old laptop run high on cpu and/or disk. It's always a fight to remove these features. More often than not, when I use windows I lose calm and kindness and I become ferocious against all these uncomfortable situations.
 When will the windows gang stop thinking that they're important, and start thinking that the customer is important, so they should give her/him something that works, that doesn't consume too many resources, that updates silently, quickly and only when the
 customer allows ? When will you make Windows a pleasant experience ? When will you try to care about customer satisfaction (because at the moment you haven't even started, I want to think, or otherwise you're very poor at this job). You have made me become
 a hater.</p>

<p>Windows 10 is worst than the combined O/S starting with DOS 3.1.<br />
On one PC got a blank/black screen after update and restart. <br />
Took about 5 hours to restore previous version.</p>
<p>On other PC power down with updates and power on this morning PC wont connect to Internet/router.&nbsp; I will now have to spend time backing off its update.<br />
Good thing I have a Win 7 available, which will not be updated to Win 10.</p>

<p>I know this is going to sound weird but if you have a Wi-Fi card plugged into your motherboard, it can cause the problem of black screen at 75% lockup. When powered back up the computer continues to the 81% or 82% point then the screen freezes at that point.&nbsp;
 When manually powered down the computer attempts to recover update, fails, and then reverts to the previous version.</p>

</p><p>What it amounts to is an Anatel Wi-Fi card causes major problems with the Win10 updates since 1607. The easiest workaround is to physically remove the Anatel Wi-Fi card from the computer and then allow the update to run.&nbsp; Just disabling&nbsp;the Wi-Fi card in
 device&nbsp;manager generally does not allow the update to complete. Nor does disabling or removing the driver. A lot of people have solved their&nbsp;update problem by removing the Wi-Fi card physically from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if this will help you. I'm just another very frustrated Win10 customer with a Gateway computer. I am currently on Win10 1803 (originally a Win 7). Removing the Anatel Wi-Fi card allowed me to update to this point.<br />

<p>Please read through those threads to see if it might apply to your circumstance.&nbsp;<br />

            Thanks for the info. My card is not the Anatel, but even if it was, a solution that requires the disassembly of your hardware is NOT acceptable. MS needs to get this resolved without the user community resorting to extremes to meet THEIR needs. How about
 meeting the client needs instead. If you are not serving your customer, someone else is, as eluded to by my handle. Never have I had to resort to any such acrobatics and time wastage's to have an update installed on my Mac!&nbsp;

<p>So decided to try this out when I saw that the update was again pending. Pulled the card (no easy task, but not too laborious), update was done in literally 5 minutes vs the 6-8 hours previous attempts took before crashing. Nice one. However, I still contend
 that the user community should not be required to modify their hardware in order for an update to be installed. Lets find the solution MS folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the brighter side, cleaned out 7 years of dust while I was in there..... lol.<br />

<p>Hi E for Excel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, just a little more extensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the April 2018 update, my Microsoft Solitaire and Modern Combat 5 apps stopped working.&nbsp; They would open to the slash screen and then not load any further.</p>
<p>I followed you advice and it did not fix the problem for Solitaire ( in fact Solitaire now doesn't even open to the splash screen anymore) or MC5.&nbsp; The trouble shooter said it fixed a hanging crashing app, but did not identify it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you make any further suggestions.</p>

<h2>            My Skype credit keeps disappearing</h2>
                    Every time I put credit on my Skype account it just disappears&nbsp;for no reason. For example, I put £5 on two days ago and made a couple of calls, probably 5 minutes in total, at 17p/minute. Today, my balance is zero. This has happened before.<br />
<br />
What's going on and what do I do about it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

 up in my 'Disk Management' under 'Storage' other then my SSD boot drive. I've just switched to Windows after years with Mac, hope you can help me out.</p>

            <p>Well, after spending countless hours trying to install the KB3206632 update, following all the instructions on this and other threads, running update troubleshooter repeatedly, running SFC and DISM, trying to manually reset a corupted update database, uploading
 diagnostic reports to onedrive, not getting any response, investigating the error that I got when I ran DISM and DISM restore health, trying to find the missing component for the DISM restore, including downloading a Windows 10.iso and loading it onto a DVD
 which still didn't allow DISM to find the missing or corrupted component, I was at wit's end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read many times on various threads, that a reset of windows 10 would cause you to lose all your programs, but here and there I saw posts that said you could do that without losing your programs (apps) and personal files, I decided I would give it a
 try. &nbsp;It may have been true at one point in time that you lost and had to reload all your porograms, but that is no longer true. &nbsp;As long as you have a legal copy of Wndows 10, either when it was offered for free or if you paid for it after the free distribution
 ended, you can download and install the latest version of Windows 10 with all updates and install it. &nbsp;I did just that, and the default that I was shown was to save all apps and personal files. &nbsp;I proceeded with the install, &nbsp;Though I was nervous, when it
 finished, there was my usual desktop and all my programs. &nbsp;I did have one heart-stopping moment when after the desktop appeared, I got a message that windows ran ino a problem and needed to restart. &nbsp;It did restart and everything is working fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The site for the download is&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked, I now have the latest version of windows 14383.576</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me, it's probably worth a try for you if you are as fruistrated as I was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p><span><span>Hi grimgeezer,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Vista cannot update files automatically from music folder to external hard drive or vice versa.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You won’t be able to
</span><span>directly copy music files from library of media player and paste it in the external hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You may need to
<strong>Right </strong></span><strong><span>click</span></strong><span> on the song,
<strong>open folder location</strong> and <strong>copy </strong>
from there and <strong>paste </strong>it in the external hard drive. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

                    <p>I have just brought this printer and I am having problems on Win8-64. I have had it printing basic text pages with a little bit of colour, but today I just will not print one page colour PowerPoint. The display panel says printing but it just sits there
 and does not print!</p>

            <p>Photoshop 7 is old and no longer&nbsp;supported by Adobe. It is a program which uses low level access to Windows functions. Such functions can be changed at any time by updates to Windows. Programs which depend on them and are not supported by their manufacturers
 may stop working after updates to Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can roll back the updates (and not accept any newer updates), and leave Windows 7 vulnerable, or get a&nbsp;newer version of Photoshop or some other program which is supported,</p>

<h3> dieselww  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to update Windows 7 home premium to Windows 7 SP1</h2>
                    <p>My mum had to do a factory restore on her PC as it became corrupted.&nbsp; It is running Windows 7 Home Premium and I cannot get it&nbsp; to install Windows 7 SP1 so that we can run internet explorer 11 (she's stuck with IE8 at the moment).&nbsp; I've tried the download
 from Microsoft&nbsp;download centre&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=5842)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=5842"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=5842)</span></a>&nbsp;but
 even once I install that, which took ages, it still comes up with the same error message when I then try to load IE11 (that Windows 7 SP1 or server 2008 R2 SP1 is required for IE11).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried checking for updates via Windows Updates but it just hangs for hours saying 'checking for updates'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do?</p>

<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did&nbsp;Mum purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Toshiba; HP; Dell; Lenovo)?</p>

<p>
</p><p>1d. Has Win10 ever been installed on the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of&nbsp;the currently-installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does the current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender &amp; MBAM) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>

<p>1c. My dad turned the computer off at the mains whilst it was loading , it then wouldn't load fully even in safe mode, it just kept loading to&nbsp;the window welcome screen and then shutting down and restarting on a cycle.&nbsp; We got a local guys who fixes PC to
 check it and he couldn't fix it as he said it was corrupt so did a factory restore.</p>
<p>1d. No</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. AVG Antivirus free, no subscription.&nbsp; Just the latest version downloaded from AVG.com. We've tried switching it off to do the upgrades. Malware Bytes is also installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.We uninstalled Norton and McAfee after the restore, which is what we'd done when the PC was first purchased as we prefer AVG.</p>

<p>Norton and McAfee were installed when the updates were done.&nbsp; I uninstalled them both (not using the removal tool), before I installed AVG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother installed Teamviewer&nbsp;12 on 29th June so I could remotely help her to install the programs that she'd previously had on her PC, namely AVG, Malwarebytes and Chrome, and also to update her Adobe reader.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means I&nbsp;can help her with any other
 IT issues that are tricky to describe over the phone.&nbsp; When we tried to install the programs from their respective websites we noticed that they were displayed with errors on the page in IE, and also her home page (e-bay) wouldn't display correctly, although
 they are fine in Chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspected it was&nbsp;because she is running IE8 due to the&nbsp;factory restore&nbsp;so I downloaded IE11 (which she'd had previously) from the Microsoft website&nbsp;but when I tried to install it the error message about needing Windows7 SP1 appeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the update for this from Microsoft download center as her Windows updates was just hanging when I tried to see if it would do an automatic update. My PC guy had been surprised that it had only taken 30 minutes to install updates after he'd done
 the factory restore. I then had to manually select to run each of the files that were downloaded (I think there were 7) before I once again tried IE11, to which I received the same error message.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly SP1 isn't installed on my mum's PC which I'm assuming
 may cause more issues in the future, especially if there is an underlying problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've exhausted my IT knowledge and all suggestions I've found on the Microsoft help center.&nbsp; I really appreciate your time, especially on a holiday weekend.</p>

    <title>Increasing performance when copying&#47;moving multiple files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anjosam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increasing performance when copying&#47;moving multiple files</h2>
                    <p>1. When copy command is given to multiple files, they are all transferred simultaneously. Doesn't it cause a reduction in performance? Wouldn't it be better to copy only 1 file at a time and hold the rest of the files to be copied in a queue. When 1 transfer
 ends, the next in queue starts. Given it would increase performance, why isn't it implemented in windows?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.How exactly is buffer used while copying. How does changing buffer size affect performance? OR How is the copy/ move operations performed in Windows; what are the steps involved?(XP, 7, 8)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated, Thank You.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What version of Windows are you using?</p>

</p><p>1) A single write of eight pages is faster than eight separate single-page writes,
<br />
primarily because it allows the hard disk to write the data in one pass over the <br />
disk surface. --File System Performance Guidelines--</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When reading data from the disk to a local buffer, the buffer size you choose
<br />
can have a dramatic effect on the speed of the operation. If you are working <br />
with relatively large files, it does not make sense to allocate a 1K buffer to <br />
read and process the data in small chunks. Instead, it is advisable to create a <br />
larger buffer (say 128K to 256K in size) and read much or all of the data into <br />
memory before processing it. The same rules apply for writing data to the disk: <br />
write data as sequentially as you can using a single file-system call. --File System Performance Guidelines--</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) When using the drag-and-drop method, you might notice that sometimes the file or folder is copied, and at other times it's moved. If you're dragging an item between two folders that are stored on the same&nbsp;&nbsp; hard disk, then the item is moved so that two
 copies of the same file or folder aren't created in the same location. If you drag the item to a folder that's in a different location (such as a network location) or to removable media like a CD, then the item is copied.&nbsp; --Working with Files and Folders</p>

<p>
</p><p>But wouldnt you have to read from 2 different locations and write to 2 different locations if 2 files are copied at same time(which decrease performance?). Also is this also true when the destination is an external device like pendrives? Note that 3rd party
 file copiers like teracopy transfers only 1 file at a time.</p>

</p><p>You got me wrong. What i meant to ask is what all operations are done internally when a copy command is given to a file.</p>

            <p>1)&nbsp; Think of it as a Windows Update - There is a .cab file containing all the information sent when you copied the file.&nbsp; Then the additional information&nbsp;of where it is to be deployed to is entered.&nbsp; Once the installation is deployed, it comes from the source
 (.cab) and the files are sent to the specified folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The standard interface is the <em>Copy interface</em>. Because it is entirely transparent to applications, the Copy interface is used by most applications. As the name implies, the Copy interface copies file data from a buffer inside the file cache to
 an application data file buffer on a read, and copies data in the opposite direction on a write.&nbsp; Windows Operating System&nbsp;uses 512KB as default size for the buffer when it needs to change data with the harddrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Windows receiving Copy Command</p>
<p><strong><em>Source</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>: </strong>Required. Specifies the location from
<br />
which you want to copy a file or set of files. <em>Source</em> can consist of a <br />
drive letter and colon, a folder name, a file name, or a combination of these. </p>
<p><strong><em>Destination</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>: </strong>Required. Specifies the location to
<br />
which you want to copy a file or set of files. <em>Destination</em> can consist of

<h2>            &#40;Raid 1 &#47; Mirror&#41; Can&#39;t boot  &#61; windows 7 Root cause found &#58; unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused the problem</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I'm hitting a wall with my wife's computer... and getting a bit desperate right now :(<br />
<br />
Coming back from an oversea trip I tried to start her computer with only one hard drive from her Win7 software mirror... and it failed.<br />
Thing is I used the slave disk (by mistake)&nbsp; and the system refused to boot saying changes have been made to the system.<br />
The day after, finally getting back the primary disk from a friend, who stored it for safety, I tried again to boot with both disks (edit: very bad idea) and got the same issue (edit: worse as corrupted both disks) .
<br />
(edit: same issue as Odin Trisk <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/02440498-b842-4a01-a109-cbd9687ec70a/repair-invalid-dynamic-disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>)<br />
<br />
I did some tests like:<br />
- Booting with only one or both disks, even switching the SATA cables = failed<br />
- Doing multiple passes of Startup Repair == unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused the problem<br />
- Attempting system restore == failing with "<span>the memory could not be read" message</span><br />
- Booting in safe mode or last known configuration == failed<br />
- Testing the RAM == no errors found<br />
- Command prompt : sfc /scannow and chkdsk /f or&nbsp; /r == no issues found<br />
- <a href="http://captaindbg.com/how-to-restore-registry-hives-on-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore the registry hives</a> from backup: Copying the C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack files to C:\Windows\System32\config\ == not booting<br />
- <a href="http://www.paragon-software.com/home/rk-express/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Trying Paragon Rescue Kit 11</a> system restore and all boot options /fixmbr or else = nothing<br />
<br />
Right now I can access the files on the primary disk with the command prompt,<br />
and the Paragon utility finds my windows partition fine.<br />
<br />
So I'd appreciate if you could point me at some suggestions.<br />
<br />

            Toyed a bit more with the beast...<br />
<br />
As the dynamic disk was still being seen as invalid by windows and accessible directly under linux , I went further this path.<br />
<br />
Initially I tested the <a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/?gclid=CPOlkeLomLkCFUSi4AodeA8AbA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EaseUS Partition Master</a> but contrary to the example in the following <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/234514-dynamic-disk-conversion-help-hxd-hex-editer-shows-01c2-0-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
thread</a> I had no option in the disk menu to convert the disk back to basic.<br />
<br />
I was about to use the TestDisk <a href="http://mypkb.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/how-to-non-destructively-convert-dynamic-disks-to-basic-disks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
method</a> from <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ultimate Boot CD</a> (highly recommended) but was getting quite fed up by now.<br />
<br />
Lucky for me a friend of mine had a version of <a href="http://www.dynamic-disk-converter.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dynamic Disk Converter</a>.<br />
Not to say after all the sector editing, diskpart and so I tested, I was quite doubtful.<br />
Still 30 secs later after converting the disk back to basic and rebooting all my data was now being readable by windows.<br />
<br />

            <p><strong>POST MORTEM</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booting with the slave disk only failed and Windows repair did nothing. </p>
<p>Found out later on that sometimes it takes 3 runs of Windows repair to fix a system, even if it "seems" to do nothing. That might have solved my issue.</p>
<p>Due to the stress/urgency/tiredness, due to the oversea travel, I'm not sure I even selected use the second PLEX boot option!</p>
<p>Adding back the 2 disks of the mirror after trying to boot with only the second was a mistake. It seems Windows marked the first inserted disk with a special tag, then the disks where conflicting. Looks like related to how windows adds a serial tag to the
 disks to recognize them.</p>
<p>When booting in Windows repair mode and stuck with the uncancellable windows: do not ever physically shut down your computer. It's going to corrupt your files and move you to a check disk (painful on large drives... read 3+ days).</p>
<p>Initially my files were fine but then, when I had access to the command line I should have run a chkdsk /f /i /c on my onw and a sfc /scannow, as later on I was stuck in the locked reboot mode and spent lof of time searching how to still run them.
</p>
<p>Sometimes being too geeky doesn't help: recovery from my inital system clone + data recovery + Windows and programs updates would have taken way less time than trying to fix the system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions for data &amp;&amp; system backup for a Windows 7 software RAID 1 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to use same model hard drives but ideally from different batches, but make sure they have the same controller and the same firmware. (Had twice a second disk failing in a raid 5 system while reconstructing the RAID @work in 10 years)</p>
<ol>
<li>Mirror both the reserved (hidden) partition and the system one (and data if separate)
</li><li>For easier recovery, deploy the Windows repair disk on your system (ie.: no need of the Windows CD to repair).
</li><li>Do not put your data on your system disk, but move it to a separate partition. (It allows easier data recovery and&nbsp;eventually fresh OS install without loosing the data).
</li><li>Make a clone, or a Windows image, of your disk before setting up the mirror </li><li>As suggested by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f784b2f1-2735-413e-9fdd-72d0d5f4f967">
<font color="#0072c6">Forest Brook</font></a>&nbsp;above, keep the latest version of your mirrored image plus one or two before.
</li><li>Save your data regularly on a separate external disk, that you always keep with you (your are safe if your PC is stolen or you house go through fire).
</li><li>I'd advise against always having your backup HD plugged in your computer when&nbsp;powered on&nbsp;and automatically syncing your files: it would not allow you to recover easily accidentally deleted files (or older versions) and won't protect you against files corruption
 or infection by viruses. </li><li>Write down in a cloud stored location (ex: email) and an usb key/CD your system recovery plan, plus a few links pointing at how to solve most issues. Usually your system is going to fail when you need it the most... urgently or you don't have access to
 internet anymore. </li><li>Also prepare a recovery kit: print docs, prepare boot CD, Windows bootable disk, Windows recovery CD.&nbsp; And store them in a safe place. Do not forget your admin password... in case you need to use a system clone 2 years later.
</li><li>Before a disaster... familiarize yourself with Windows booting sequence and tools like bcdedit, diskpart,&nbsp;chkdsk, scandisk, HxD</li></ol>
<p>Never forget: <strong>it's not because Windows cannot boot or can't access your files/volumes that they are lost!
</strong></p>
<p>First try Linux based bootable CDs to check if you can access your files.</p>
<p>Then try software&nbsp;like filescavenger. </p>
<p>Finally check with companies specialized in data recovery. Sometimes for personal data you can get a deal, getting in touch with a representative, and while expensive it could be well&nbsp;worth it. Provided you can't afford it and you have data like family pics
 and so. I'd suggest storing your disk away, and maybe in the future you're going to be able to afford the data recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this thread will help people in the future!</p>
<p>Best luck to you.</p>

    <title>Forced Vertical Sync and why its bad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noahgibbs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forced Vertical Sync and why its bad</h2>
                    <p>Vertical sync is a technology that keeps the framerate of things on your screen no higher than the refresh rate of your screen to prevent screen tearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen tearing is what happens when frames that are rendered too quickly are overwriting the frames meant to be shown, generally showing what appears to be tearing across your screen when something is moving on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On it's own this sounds good, but to attempt to keep all the frames in sync a delay is created between your input and what you see on your screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be fine with doing something where your mouse and keyboard input isn't very important.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why it's bad:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When playing fast paced video games this tiny delay forces you to predict what is going to happen. Your input isn't shown on the screen for sometime later, making the game more difficult and even potentially nauseating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has made it so any third party full screen application isn't affected by this setting. But many games don't run in full screen or are preferred not to be played in them (such as making it easier to go to a different window or being able to quickly
 focus on another monitor and quickly going back to the game)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basically what I am trying to say here is many hardcore Gamers including myself will not stay upgraded to windows 10 simply because of this delay and no way to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Gamers of today love running games in fullscreen windowed for the increased ability of multitasking so much that upgrading to windows 10 to play games is actually a downgrade, because for many of us the only thing windows 10 has to offer is slightly faster
 speeds and directx 12 implemented video games a few years down the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time, please consider changing this very soon.</p>
<p>Sorry for posting this in this discussion, if there is a better one please move it or redirect me to where I should post this.</p>

            <p>Turning off Xbox Game DVR does NOT turn of forced v-sync.</p>
<p>In fact, forced v-sync can't be turned off on Windows 10 AT ALL, because it's part of the core GUI.</p>
<p>If you were to somehow turn it off your system would just become completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unheard of really. I always play in Fullscreen Windowed. Borderless Windowed however you want to call it.</p>
<p>Being unable to play on Borderless without this massive input lag is a clear cut reason for me to say no to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I'm currently running a dual boot of Windows 7 and Windows 10 and I never use Windows 10. At all.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is terrible for this and more reasons.</p>

            its because MS are <strong>[Mod removed Profanity]</strong> , and have removed TEREDO from the Windows 10 1809 build, have also deleted it from the legacy driver suppository , and are in general
<strong>[Mod removed Profanity] </strong>when it comes to understanding and solving problems with their own operating systems. Ive had it with this OS it is the

    <title>Xbox One turns itself on&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> st anger20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One turns itself on&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Every day without fail, once per day usually when I go to bed I shut down the console for the night and within seconds the Xbox boots right back up! It does it if I turn it off from the console, the Xbox app on my phone, or the app on my pc! This has been
 going on for a week or so now. Normally it's not an issue because I'm right there in the room, but earlier I shut it off and went down to make dinner and came back up about an hour later and the Xbox, tv, cable box, and surround system were all on! Using power
 and burning the home screen in my tv!</p>

<p>Whenever the Xbox One starts acting strangely, the first thing I would do is a hard restart (power cycle).</p>
<p>Read this article for steps how to do so: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../power-cycle-console</a></p>
<p>Hopefully, your Xbox will stop turning on by itself afterwards.</p>

<p>That's a joke right?</p>
<p>That's always the very first thing I do when I have an issue with the Xbox one... Common sense dude! I have to do a hard reset every few days or so sometimes even unplugging it from the wall also because of how buggy the preview os builds are so I know to
 do all the normal troubleshooting steps! The problem is I've encountered and seen many users encounter consoles shutting off randomly.... But turning itself on lol, now this one I can't seem to troubleshoot!</p>

            <p>Hey there St Anger20!</p>
<p>Are there any USB devices plugged into your Xbox One? If so, try unplugging them to see if there's any change. Also, be sure that your Xbox One is plugged directly into a wall outlet, as power strips aren't supported and may cause some trouble. </p>

<p>Thanks for the response pal. Yes I have 2 external hard drive storage devices plugged in at all times and will try that solution and get back to you! My console is plugged directly to the wall outlet though so that shouldn't be an issue! I did read an really
 old post on here where someone with this issue just unplugged his/her console overnight and it seemed to work for them so I did that last night and will test today, if the problem persists I will try unplugging the external drives. Either way I will respond
 back!</p>

<p>Hey there St Anger20,</p>
<p>Few questions that I think will help narrow this down. Are you in the Xbox One Preview program and using the new dashboard? Is your console set to instant on mode as opposed to energy saving mode? You can check the mode on the console by going
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/learn-about-power-modes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>.</p>
<p>If so, what's likely happening is that your console is checking for updates before it shuts down fully and is seeing that the console has a new update and what you're noticing is that the console is starting those updates. There has been a preview update
 nearly every day over the last week and that could explain why the console may be turning back on to update, but wouldn't explain why the TV, Surround Sound or other accessories turn on.</p>
<p>If you check on the front of the console is the power button area clean as well? It's possible there is some dust or fingerprints over the power button that might be triggering it.</p>
<p>Let us know!</p>

<p>Yes I'm in the preview program, and I already have the and had the latest updates installed! And yes instant on is enabled as it has been since I got the console on day one and it never turned on like this before! Yesterday it did this twice with all updates
 installed and when I tried to do a hard reset the power button on the console itself was completely unresponsive nor did it make the dinging noise turning on or shutting down. I had to shut down from controller and unplug everything and then I got my console
 power button working again but then I couldn't receive any notifications until I did another hard reset! It's getting kind of ridiculous really! My console and all devices for that matter are in immaculate condition and are spot free of fit or dust so I'm
 at a loss of what to do!</p>

<p>Also Mister Mascot I don't think you fully understand what my console is doing... It is not in between shutting down and looking for an update at all!!! It has actually shut down completely and turned off all my devices!!! Then it will just boot up as if
 I hit the power button in turn booting up all my connected ir blaster devices!!! So hopefully now that will explain to you why when it boots back up it turns in the tv, surround, and cable!!! It's because it was OFF, and then it turns itself back on!!!</p>

            Nothing literally happens&nbsp;when I click UAC, the top bar just blinks a different colour and that's it. Also how do I re-install windows WITHOUT changing or deleting any files, I've had it done once before and it just removed all the programmes but not the
 files, and that fixed the problem. Thanks&nbsp;

Not exactly what I had in mind when I wrote <i>"What exactly is it you wish to delete, which file or which folder?"
</i>Best to ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you.

<h2>            Windows Store not working, can&#39;t get into Microsoft account, apps not working and so on</h2>
                    <p>Without any&nbsp;apparent reasons everything&nbsp;associated with Microsoft online services stopped working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't authenticate Microsoft account (error 0x80190001)</li><li>After switching to local account, can't get back to Microsoft account ("try later")</li><li>Edge can't open any address</li><li>Windows Store gives me an error 0x80072EE7</li><li>Most of the Store apps don't work (Weather shows splash screen, Xbox app shows clear green screen after splash, Forza Horizon 3 crashes after splash and so on...)</li></ul>
<p>Stuff I tried to do to resolve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turned off antivirus and brandmauer</li><li>Built-in Microsoft troubleshooters for net, windows update and store</li><li>App manipulations through PowerShell</li><li>SFC and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">DISM /.../ RestoreHealth through CMD</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Making local accounts and trying to make something work through theme</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">System recovery to an earlier point (gives an error)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Many other stuff I forgot</span></li></ul>

            Hi,
<br />Though the error code means it can't connect to the internet, but it is quite possible that it might be due to damaged system files.
<br />Anything found by SFC/DISM?
<br />Plus are you using a proxy server to connect to the Internet?

<p>SFC showed some error it can't repair, something like: "Error: Overlap: Duplicate ownership for directory ".</p>
<p>DISM shows that everything is perfect.</p>
<p>And no, I'm not using proxy. Everything other than MS apps works perfect - chrome, firefox, steam, last.fm scrobbler and so on.</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer, but I've done all of those already. I'll try the Network commands, maybe some of them were wrong the last time I tried. Timezone was cheked several times, I performed some manipulations, but achived nothign.&nbsp;Troubleshooter shows
 "Frozed or corrupted apps" and can't do nothing with it.</p>

            If nothing works, I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            A repair install would be the best option in this case. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.
