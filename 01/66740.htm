    <title>Network discovery fails to find NAS device after W10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeth32  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network discovery fails to find NAS device after W10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a DLINK DNS-323 NAS device with two hard drives.&nbsp; Under W7 it appeared under in the Network folder, but after he W10 upgrade, network discover fails to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to find a workaround based on posts in other forums:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - One post suggested that I could verify that the device was attached to the network properly by running a file exlorer program on an Android tablet.&nbsp; That worked fine, and I could see and access the files on both drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - I found that the DLink setup program was able to detect the device and display it's IP address, but was not able to map the drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - Another post suggested opening Windows Explorer (not IE) and entering the following:&nbsp; \\(IP address)\(Device name)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This enabled me to access both drives and their contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But network discovery still fails to find the drive and I can't access the drives as I did before with W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the outside forum posts that I found contained any way to restore the normal access vie the Network object.&nbsp; They just provided the workaround and said that it was an MS problem that needed to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Can not take a screenshot anymore on Windows 10 Dell Inspiron 13-5368 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cayl1n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not take a screenshot anymore on Windows 10 Dell Inspiron 13-5368</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been using my Dell Inspiron 13-5368 for 2 years now. When I first got it I was able to take full screen screenshots using win + prtscr, however this year I have not been able to use that shortcut anymore. I checked my screenshots folder in pictures
 and the last screenshot taken was November last year. </p>
<p>I am running Windows 10 Home version 1803 and installed that in July, however this was already a problem before then.</p>
<p>Active screenshot is also not working, however I can get screenshots using the game bar and the snipping tool but both are really frustrating to use.</p>
<p>Another problem I have recently noticed is the ctrl + alt + delete shortcut does not work, it only works when I use the touch keyboard. I would prefer to have this working so I can put my computer to sleep quicker.
</p>
<p>I have a feeling my alt keys are not working but can not tell for sure. I am so frustrated and have spent hours and hours searching for answers. I have tried fn + the other keys but nothing is working. When I go to device manager it says my keyboards are
 all working I have also tried search for updates for them but they are all up to date.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some help or advice, or something else I could try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

            Hello, I am sorry to hear that you are having some major issues with keyboard shortcuts. One method is to check and see if Sticky Keys are disabled. This has to be disabled, or the shortcut keys will not work. There are nine more methods listed on this article here. Try each one of them, and see if the problem resolves!

<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>file explorer making 3 additional copies of my pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachelespinoza  say:</h3>
<h2>            file explorer making 3 additional copies of my pictures</h2>
                    Hello I dumped all my pictures from several memory cards into my laptop in efforts to file and organize my pictures into categories and delete the photos that are not wanted and my plan there after was to either burn that folder &nbsp;(with several sub folders)
 onto a disc or a large memory/flash card. When I was done I started going threw the sorting process and realized that while scrolling through I started seeing same photos (that where duplicated) but rotated, then the second copy as a smaller version of original,
 and the third copy was upside down. My question is why are they duplicating and triplicating on their own? And how to stop this as well as how to prevent this from happening again? Also why does'nt the duplicate finder detect the copies? Thank you for your
 time.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Rachel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why are they duplicating and triplicating on their own?</p>
<p>- There are a wide number of reasons for data duplication, ranging from data corruption to Windows functionality issue. It also depends, if you are using any photo importing software to copy the image files to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue? Is it an abrupt issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Does this issue happen only when transferring image files in Windows?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you check if the source of the files itself does not have data duplicated in them? Because it is again an assumption that Windows will edit the orientation of the images before copying them to destination.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, for&nbsp;eliminating potentially unwanted software, including rootkits, you can run the Windows Defender Offline in your PC if the active Windows firewall is unable to remove the threats.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Every time I run WU the following message appears "Restart your computer to install important updates".&nbsp; This has been going on for some time now, and has kept me from installing any updates. As a result I've disabled WU to stop the endless requests to restart.
 Have tried a number of recommendations from people with the same issue, but, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in over my head on this, and do need help from someone who could advise me.</p>

<br />
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>First thing to try is a System Restore to before the problem:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If the above does not fix the problem, follow these steps to improve performance and resolve the issue:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers
 for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>

<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</span></p>

<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2231/vista_run_system_file_checker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2231/vista_run_system_file_checker/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 headphone problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janithmallawaarachchi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 headphone problem</h2>
                    <p>Hey, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my windows 10, where I am unable to here anything from my headphones.
</p>
<p>I have installed the latest drivers and everything. reinstalled and installed multiple times. Restarted&nbsp;many&nbsp;times as well.&nbsp;Been looking for the past couple of days and nothing.
</p>
<p>I have enabled the "show disabled devices" in sound, but nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is running "Realtek HD audio manager". I cannot also seem to find the software for the realtek hd audio to configure anything, as there seems to be nothing in "hardware and sound". And it has nothing to do with the headphones either. because they do the
 same with my speakers as well (sol republic headphones and Logitech z623 speakers).
</p>
<p>When I connect the headphones, nothing appears in the sound.&nbsp;and the music or whatever I play just come out of the speakers, as if nothing was connected to headphone jack.</p>
<p>I don't believe it is a internal problem, because it didn't do this in windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to try this method I saw:</p>
<p><strong>I found another simple solution for this. If you have installed the Realtek software, open the Realtek HD Audio Manager , and check the " Disable front panel jack detection" option, under connector settings in the right side panel. The headphones
 and other audio devices work like a charm.</strong></p>
<p>But it seems as I cannot access the realtek software, it does not seem to appear in my control panel. I have the Realtek HD Manager installed, but I cannot seem to find the software to do this. And when I go into my PC and find the exe. for it, it doesn't
 do anything when&nbsp;I try open it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try help :) Thank you</p>
<p>Laptop is Sony Vaio Pro 13</p>

            Yes; my problem continues. &nbsp;The problem seems associated with the Beats audio that was preloaded on the computer. &nbsp;The Beats goes into a very very long loading loop when we plug in the headphones. &nbsp;After several minutes, it does load and the headphones
 will work, but it's a problem to not be able to go from speakers to headphones for that period.

<h2>            Windows server 2012 services default behavior</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows server 2012 R2 on my PC and found that the Windows update service "wuauserv" starts and stops automatically after sometime. I believe the same happens for Windows 8 and 10 as well. The startup type shows as automatic(Trigger
 start). Going through various articles and forums, I understood that it is default behavior introduced in Windows where inactive services will stop automatically and run only when triggered by some policies.</p>
<p>I want to change this default behavior and want Windows update services to run always. Could you please advise how to make these changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Adi</p>

<h2>            Slow startup&#59; Task Manager shows lots of memory usage on startup&#59; &#34;Warning&#58; Terminating a process can cause loss of data and system instability.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Watching&nbsp;Task Manager on Startup I finally saw the memory usage column, which previously been hiding from me. There are about 93 processes running on startup and lots of memory used. I'm guessing this might be my slow start problem. That's my first question.<br />
<br />
If so, how and which processes can I stop running on startup? When I separate the User Name column, there are 4 categories: Compaq Owner, Local Service, Network Service and System. I know to leave the System ones alone. I also know I will probably have to search
 each one of them to learn what they are, but for example: Netscape.exe This is a no brainer. I want to get rid of it. I never use Netscape and it's using 15,748 k of memory on startup.<br />
<br />
But...I can remove Netscape from my Remove Programs. Nothing happens. How do I get rid of this?<br />
<br />
Then...back on the Task Manager, when I click the 'End Process' button, I get the dire warning that 'Terminating a process can cause undesired results including loss of data and system instability." That's enough to stop me in my tracks, so I never take that
 step. So, if you know you don't want a process that's not a System, or Local or Network service, can I stop it safely?
<br />
<br />
Then, will it just reappear the next time I start the computer again?<br />

            Killing processes from task manager can get you out of trouble, especially if one particular process is grinding your machine to a halt, or something like IE has stopped responding. But I would only advise killing a process that you actually know what
 it is, and like you said this is usually only temporary fix until you restart your machine. So doesn't really help for trying to speed up your machine during startup.
<div><br />
<div>Also, background programs can restart processes that have been stopped, this is usually the case with Anti-Virus Software which is protecting itself from viruses that might be trying to shut it down.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When trying to lighten the load on a machine at startup, I always look first at the notification area down by the time. How many background apps have you got running down there? Things like MSN messenger, Skype, Adobe updater, Quicktime updater, they'll
 all congregate down there taking up resources. Sometimes you'll find in the settings of each program they'll be an option to stop it from running at startup. Or at least it gives you an idea of the apps you no longer need, and therefore can uninstall.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next take a look at your Startup folder under All Programs. Here you'll find other programs that will start running as soon as they get the chance. you can normally safely remove things from here</div>
<div><br />
<div>Open MSConfig and look under the Startup tab, you'll find a whole list of things here, and you normally get a good description of each item. You can select the items you do not want to run at startup and disable them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is also a very useful tool freely available called HijackThis from Trend Micro, which allows you to deep scan your registry and file settings showing up things like startup processes and apps. With this you can remove these settings completely, but
 be warned it does not seperate what's safe and not safe to remove.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lastly, I guess you could check the Registry manually with regedit, and really there only two places I would look at:</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</div>
<div>This will show you apps that run at startup. Just make sure you backup the registry key before you make any changes.
<b>Mistakes in the Registry can cause serious problems in Windows, so always tread with care, and always make a backup.</b></div>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft delivers Windows Defender updates through Windows Update, through Automatic Updates, and through Windows Server Update Service (WSUS). In some cases, you might receive

            <p><strong>Should I upgrade my existing version of Windows to Windows 10 Preview?</strong></p>
<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>

            Hi Peter
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />When making a call and using the Dial Pad to select the option for Touch Tones, they will not work if you have subtitles enabled on the call.
<br />  To workaround this issue simply disable subtitles: Select your profile picture &gt; Settings &gt; Calling &gt; Call Subtitles, then turn off the option to Show subtitles for all voice and video calls. 
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't have the option turned on to Show subtitles for all voice and video calls but have turned subtitles on for an individual call, starting a new call with your contact will resolve this issue.

            KB2670838 breaks Aero Glass completely, regardless of&nbsp;your hardware. <br />
The following statement on the MSDN web site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj863687.aspx) makes this abundantly clear:<br />
<br />
<p>"When installed on Windows&nbsp;7, the Platform Update for Windows&nbsp;7 updates Windows&nbsp;7 with functionality available in Windows 8. For example, these Windows&nbsp;8 components become available with full functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct2D 1.1 (including Direct2D Effects)</li><li>DirectWrite</li><li>Windows Imaging Component (WIC) </li></ul>
<p>These provide partial functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct3D 11.1</li><li>DXGI 1.2</li></ul>
<p>And, for example, this component is not available:</p>
<ul>
<li>DirectComposition (DComp)"</li></ul>
The key here is that "DirectComposition (DComp)" is not available. That API functionality is necessary for Aero Glass to work.<br />
<br />
Obviously, Microsoft has changed several graphics APIs with this Update and it does in fact break Aero Glass. Basically, this Update turns the native Windows 7 graphics stack into the Windows 8 graphics stack. As this above statement on MSDN states "the Platform
 Update for Windows&nbsp;7 updates Windows&nbsp;7 with functionality available in Windows 8". That means no more Aero Glass, period.

And the really good news is, (Yay Microsoft), even though I've removed this particular POS twice, MS keeps helpfully reinstalling it for me! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
And here's another symptom for you, this update totally munges the Windows LiveMail desktop app as well. It's completely unusable with the update applied. &nbsp;(It's almost completely unusable to start with, but I use it to keep track of all my throwaway junkmail/graymail
 addresses).

            I still am unable to install IE10 or this update without everything on my desktop going FUBAR.&nbsp; The really weird thing is that I have 10 PCs, most of them have very few common parts besides an NVIDIA video card (different models) and an INTEL CPU, (different
 models).&nbsp; I have only gotten this update to work on the OLDEST 2 PCs.&nbsp; The other 8, nope!&nbsp; Update 10-30-13

            THANK GOD!<br />
<br />
THIS UPDATE HAS PLAGUED ME SINCE AUGUST WHEN I ALLOWED IT TO BE INSTALLED.<br />
<br />
It not only breaks calculator, it breaks Catalyst Control Center and Windows Live Mail as well.<br />
<br />
I had a restore point and WHS restore image but I waited too long to fix it the second time after it installed itself again and my system overwrote the good backup.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for detailing this.&nbsp; Damn YOU KB2670838, I had to use webmail because of you for 4 months!<br />

            Hi JC.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you flashed the BIOS and reset to defaults via CMOS, it could have changed a setting that is booting Windows.  
<br />
<br />One such setting to check is the SATA controller which optimally should be AHCI but could need changing to another.  
<br />
<br />More importantly if this is a UEFI BIOS whether it is properly set to UEFI because you have the modern UEFI install to GPT formatted disk.  If you don't know this for sure then I'd try it with UEFI both enabled and disabled, CSM or LEgacy BIOS both enabled and disabled, Boot Priority order set with hard drive set to boot first OR Windows Boot manager which must be first to boot a UEFI install.  
<br />
<br />I'd also disable Secure Boot and Fast boot, try each both ways.  
<br />
<br />If none of these help then set it to UEFI without CSM or Legacy, create the bootable media and boot it as a UEFI device, choose Custom Install, delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to clear formatting, then click Next to let it auto-create and format the needed partitions and begin install.
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<h2>            Error message when I right click on desktop icon or try to access file menu </h2>
                    I have started getting the following error message whenever I right click on a desktop icon. It also appears when I select a file in windows explorer folders and press the "File" menu button on the menu bar. I'm using windows xp.<br />
<br />
Error signature<br />
AppName:explorer.exe appver 6.0.2900.5512 modname: kernel32.dll<br />
modver: 5.1.2600.5781 offset: 0000d00d<br />
<br />
If anyone has an idea what is wrong and how I can fix it, I would greatly appreciate your help. Or if anyone knows other sites that I can check to look for a solution, that would be great also.<br />

            Problems with right-clicking are usually caused by third-party software that has shoved an entry into the context menu. This is most easily solved using the free ShellExView utility.<br />
