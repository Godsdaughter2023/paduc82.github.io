<h2>            Audio&#47;Video won&#39;t work on cold boot, only after restart</h2>
                    <p>This is very strange. 2 days ago, around 8pm, I noticed video in facebook stopped playing. (Chrome) The video would load the first frame, but wouldn't play. Not thinking much I shut down and went to bed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, every time I boot from a complete shutdown, my audio/video won't work. No system sounds, can't play music in iTunes or windows media player, can't play videos in Youtube/vimeo/fb, in *any* browser...and not even in VLC/quicktime or windows player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart and everything works fine. So now, every time I boot, I need to do a restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't installed any software in months. nor any updates. Even windows updates reports the last update was 2 weeks ago. So I haven't changed anything on my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After two days of this, I updated by audio driver, nvidia driver and checked manually for any windows update. My machine still won't play audio/video from a cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This will be a consequence of Hybrid shutdown (aka Fast start). &nbsp; So, one alternative would be to disable that and go for a slow boot (what you get with your Restart).&nbsp; Another one would be to use Hibernate and then you could just resume instead of doing
 either kind of shut down.&nbsp; You will have to check the size of your hiberfil.sys after this change but hopefully it will be resized appropriately automatically.</p>

<h2>            Sender Name, Subject and Caller ID info not shown &#40;blanked&#41; in INBOX on Wins 10 Fax and Scan</h2>
                    <p>When receiving fax, the sender name is shown on the Fax Status Monitor. Yet after the fax is received, the Sender Name and Subject and Caller ID columns showed nothing (blank). I have googled the internet for any solution, but none fixed the problem. There
 is nothing wrong with my modem and driver. It sends and receives FAX ok. I have tried three different computers with Wins 10 installed, they all have the Sender Name....etc. missing. If my memory still serves me right, the Sender Name..etc. were there in Wins
 XP. However after upgraded to Wins 7 and then Wins 10, these info disappeared.</p>
<p>Anyone also have this problem? Appreciate anyone can help!!</p>

<p>Hi Kitty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult it is, when the app or device doesn't work in the way it should. For us to isolate the issue and to assist you better, we'd like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you able to see the sender name and the caller ID by opening the fax properties?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to see all the information in sent items?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and the model number of the modem that you are using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            System and Compressed memory frequently runs at 100&#37; Disk usage</h2>
                    <p>System and Compressed memory frequently runs at 100% Disk usage for 2 to 3 minutes at a time, effectively preventing any other computer operation from occurring - so the machine just hangs until the disk becomes available again.&nbsp; I'm running an older laptop
 (Toshiba Sattellite Pro) with Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I'm not sure if the problem is my laptop is not powerful enough, or if there is something weird happening in the operations.&nbsp; I have: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU; 2GB RAM; 64 Bit operating system.&nbsp; I have run the
 Windows Performance Recorder and attach the link.&nbsp; Any help gratefully received.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the system memory frequently runs at 100% Disk usage in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have caused due to some third party applications installed in Windows or even because of the incompatibility of the machine with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Check if the issue resolves in
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Safe mode loads only minimal set of drivers and application which helps you check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer this </span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">article to boot to safe mode</span></a></strong></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state and check if it helps</span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><span> </span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>I also suggest you to <strong>

            <p>Dear Microsoft support and others,</p>
<p>This saga is a month old at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this System and compressed memory got into our lives, it just stuck many computers and the web is full of frustrated users with partial solutions.</p>
<p>You, Microsoft, as usual, give a solution which is not a solution at all. Please stop running us around in your "supposed to be" best windows version and just solve it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this feature is good for some people which hold 16GB ram, or that their computer is always plugged to power source, but for laptop users, which occasionally still hold 4-8GB RAM and work on battery, this new feature can jump to 100% HDD and 40% RAM
 use, and just stuck the computer. Not to speak of high battery consumption.</p>
<p>Lets say it this way- if I decided not to use superfetch (because it is useless for me), so is this new feature of "System and compressed memory" which my computer already worked perfect without.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always in versions later to win XP, and even more in win 10, you don't give your users the choice, but just make us suffer it, no matter what is our way to use the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, instead of telling us how to live with it or how to check our computer, please just tell us how to remove it or disable it immediately.</p>
<p>On the way, also place back the option to ignore some of the unwanted updates. we used to have 3 options for handling updates, now we have only 2- why oh why?(!!!!). Last but not least, please revive the scanning dialog of win XP, and save us from the terrible
 scan dialog of win 7. the idea is to develop, not to go backwards(!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Haggai</p>
        </p>

            <p>I think this is the only post someone got a comment this might be caused by the antivirus.</p>
<p>Also other possibilities to try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2813275/disk-usage-100.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did all the suggestions, replaced my Avast-free with Avira-free antivirus, disabled superfetch and windows tips. Checked the possibility with defining the virtual memory, but it works much better when leaving it as automatically set by windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just checked the results by trying to peak my memory usage (what uncovered the problem with the system and compressed memory in the first place) and this seems to work very well. If before the peak to 100% HD use and memory peak got my computer stuck for
 minutes, now i can see the peaks, but it falls back after a second or two, and the computer runs smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it will help others.</p>

            <p>Ok, better than before, but still- after all the above my computer peaked to 100% disk usage and got stuck for 20 seconds when using high memory levels (but not 100%!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was fine up until recently, now this new feature of Windows makes it impossible to work. Like people already noted in other posts- it is possible it becames worse after hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft oh microsoft, please give us a good solution and do not tell us to stop using hibernation or other domb solutions. The idea in computer is to be able to use its features. As so far we lived just fine without "system and compresses memory" we can
 also live fine without it again- please add a disable option!</p>

            <p>I agree with the adding a disable option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, I've found that this issue is usually limited to computers with hard drives that are at average speed or slower. &nbsp;Unfortunately this means that any off-the-shelf computer seems to have this problem since the HDD in them (if a conventional,
 mechanical HDD) is fairly standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened to my laptop and one I purchased for my mother. &nbsp;In both cases I was able to replace the mechanical drive with a solid state (SSD) and it completely resolved the issue for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that as Windows tries to write the compressed memory back and forth the HDD just gets backed up. &nbsp;It's dumb that this will utilize 100% of the capacity of the disk system, particularly since Windows can see that it is using 100% of the disk system
 and should be able to throttle it (since 100% of anything being used results in a slow down for other tasks -- background or automated things shouldn't use 100% when an user is trying to do something else).</p>

            <p>Ok, more information:</p>
<p>Tried to peak my memory after restart and then again after one hibernation. In both cases "system and compressed memory" kicked in, but did not peaked my HDD and did not stuck the computer. memory peak caused no more than 10 seconds delay and then i could
 still switch between pages easily with memory usage of 93-100% and HDD usage of 90-100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases I opened and actively switched between outlook, Photoshop, Multiple chrome windows running several youtube movies, picture viewer (running through large jpg files), File explorer, task scheduler window, and running Avira system scan (which
 mostly used more HDD resources than the "system and compressed memory" feature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is while beforehand (admittedly, after several hibernations) using only outlook and file explorer (altogether reaching 40-50% memory usage) caused the&nbsp;"system and compressed memory" to kick in, peaked HDD usage to 100% and stuck my computer for almost
 one minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hibernation is known to cause different problems, which do not happen in each and every hibernation. In my Asus ultrabook, after updating my BIOS, these problem disappeared. Now it possibly reappeared with the introduction of this new "system and compressed
 memory" feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, this feature is constantly using the HDD (even in low memory usage levels), for no apparent reason, meaning, even when the computer sits for several minutes without opened windows this feature drains battery power and shortens the HDD life by activating
 it for no reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Disable option for both "system and compressed memory" feature and "superfetch" service is required, especially within the Power management options, so these won't kick in when running laptops on battery power.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.:</p>
<p>there is a "solution" for disabling "system and compressed memory" feature by disabling "RunFullMemoryDiagnosticEntry" task (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://appuals.com/100-disk-usage-by-system-and-compressed-memory-in-windows-10/</span>).</p>
<p>But while the repeating problem and the checks were done today, this task last use was only 3 days ago. Therefore I guess it is irrelevant or only partially relevant.</p>

<p>This problem only recently started in the last few months, and the only time I am not disconnected from Live is when I am actually playing an online game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If I decide to leave the game and update a profile make changes to my character, etc, it will disconnect me off &nbsp;within 15 seconds. &nbsp;So basically I can never update any characters for any game that I play. I also can not access netflix or anything else as
 it will only allow me about 15 seconds before it disconnects.</p>
<p>I have tried clearing the cache, deleting my profile and re downloading it, etc. &nbsp;But those have not helped.</p>
<p>One thing I will add is that I have another Xbox, that is also on Xbox live, and if I play on that Xbox, &nbsp;this issue does not happen with either my profile, or my kid's profile. &nbsp;The only difference is that the Xbox that I am not having issue's with is closer
 to the Wifi.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? &nbsp;Do I need another wifi so that each Xbox has it's own to work off of?</p>

<p>I haven't had that problem but I have a similar one where every time I turn off my Xbox 360 and then turn it on my connection to X-box live is off. Everything else is fine but I have to go to settings and click on test connection in order to get Xbox live
 started up again,every single time I turn on my 360.</p>
<p>This is really annoying and started up a few months back so I don't know why they haven't fixed this problem as I've seen others with this exact problem or like this similar ones.

<p>I have purchased Xbox 360 to play games on and have been an Xbox user for at least 3 to 4 years...... &nbsp; &nbsp;THIS IS MY HORROR STORY. &nbsp; &nbsp;BEATLE59</p>
<p>Before: &nbsp; &nbsp;About 3 or 4 years ago our community finally got high speed 1 Mb/s Xbox 360 requirements then was a 1 Mb/s signal. &nbsp;6 friends get together and build a gaming room called the Man Cave. &nbsp;They get together and game one night a week. &nbsp;The internet
 connection did not support all 6 Xbox 360 for on line 1st person shooting games but we could all still log on to Xbox live and then system link and enjoy 6 hours of uninterrupted fun between ourselves for various games.</p>
<p>Later: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As time rolled on, games got more complicated needing more bandwidth and demanding live connections to even play or log onto a game. &nbsp;Now our internet connection has been upgraded to 3 Mb/s. the fastest available for our area. &nbsp;Our latest and
 favorite game was Forza Horizon with auto club called [MCAV] Man Cave, purchased when game was new in Oct. 2012. &nbsp;Six players on their own Xbox 360 consoles in the game room could comfortably game on line for hours of enjoyment and no interruptions. &nbsp;This
 was very fun and exciting and we enjoyed years of entertainment.......... Until..............</p>
<p>Not long ago: &nbsp; Xbox One came on line a couple of months ago requiring all service providers across Canada to do an update to their internet connections. &nbsp;Since this update Xbox 360 users now require a 4 Mb/s connection, 1 Mb/s minimum. &nbsp;Xbox 360 live can
 no longer log on more than 3 Xbox users per router. and system link is no longer working on most of the games we used to play this way.
</p>
<p>Present: &nbsp; Before extra router 3 users only could log on to Xbox live with NAT moderate problems. &nbsp;With an extra router we are able to log onto Xbox live with 6 users and no NAT problems. &nbsp;Having only a 3 Mb/s internet speed we can still play older games
 that do not require a lot of band width. &nbsp;Forza Horizon we can still play 4 comfortably, 5 with challenges if internet is not uninterrupted we are playing and are happy. &nbsp; However games like the new WSOP Poker game requires a minimum 3 Mb/s. per console Therefor
 one would need a 18 Mb/s. Internet connection to play this game with 6 players on their own Xbox console on the same internet connection. &nbsp;If two of us log onto and try to play WSOP Poker the other 4 of us are pushed off of the Xbox live log on and cannot
 reconnect. &nbsp;We have to do a major power down and restart all modems, routers and Xbox consoles to get the six players reconnected to Xbox live. &nbsp;Watching an Xbox One video on Xbox 360 with a 3 Mb/s internet connection we see 15- 20 seconds of a white line
 with "Loading" written on it. &nbsp;Then a blank screen. Then 20 - 30 seconds of line "Loading". Then see first frame of video which was pretty much blank. &nbsp;Then 20 - 30 seconds of white line with "Loading". &nbsp;Then finally after 3 minutes we see the first actual
 picture of a mans face with so much detail it was upsetting. &nbsp;( I really did not want to see the crud in this guys pores on his face. ) &nbsp;REALLY do we really need to see that much detail? &nbsp; Gross. &nbsp;Never did see much more of the video as it was taking minutes
 to see seconds of the video. &nbsp;I tested my internet connection speed at this time and was getting 2.5 Mb/s. &nbsp;Well that pretty much tells me that I will never be able to buy a Xbox One and the increased demands on the Xbox 360 is putting us off line, off system
 link, and Killing the Man Cave Club. &nbsp;Microsoft claims that the Xbox One way is the best way for us all....... &nbsp; BU## SH*^.</p>
<p>Future: &nbsp;I Have found no reasons to pay good money to update or renew my account for the Xbox 360 or move to an Xbox One as Microsoft have proved themselves to be money grabbing internet sucking liars. &nbsp;In 2009 Microsoft said you will always be able to game
 on the Xbox 360 without a internet connection. &nbsp;Since 2010 all the games started coming out with "internet connection required to play" . &nbsp;You have to be logged into Xbox live service to use and play the game. &nbsp;If you get logged out of Xbox live during game
 play due to temporary loss of internet, or for any reason like a server reset you are immediately ejected from the game and all the stats and game play time, played, &nbsp;is gone, wasted, toasted, YOU START OVER Tough luck. &nbsp; If Microsoft thinks this is the way
 to gain customers...... &nbsp; They are wrong...... &nbsp; &nbsp;They have upset their Man Cave Customers and will eliminate 12 players from their income. &nbsp;This is just one small group of their customers how many more are they upsetting with the increased requirements and
 internet sucking demands.</p>
<p>Stuff Learned during this fiasco.</p>
<p>Connecting 4 or more Xbox 360 to a single internet connection requires more than one router and Port forwarding 3074... etc. implemented.</p>
<p>Happy Xbox 360 users need 5 Mb/s internet. &nbsp;Recommend 10 Mb/s. for a single Xbox 360. &nbsp;More if you would like to see &nbsp;HD videos.</p>
<p>Happy Xbox One users need 5 Mb/s internet and 20 Mb/s to see HD. videos uninterrupted for a single Xbox One.</p>
<p>The internet service providers in rural areas cannot possibly keep up to the demand in the increase of bandwidth needed to keep up with Microsoft Xbox 360 or Xbox One. &nbsp;Therefor Xbox is going to loose their rural customers slowly, continually, and permanently.</p>
<p>Only Big City Folk can get fast internet connections. &nbsp;20 to 50 Mb/s. &nbsp;Rural is very lucky to have 5 Mb/s rare. 3 Mb/s sometimes. 1 Mb/s mostly. &nbsp;Dial up still available but useless even for emails. &nbsp;Only Cities with more than a 100,000 people have internet
 10 Mb/s or better.</p>
<p>My internet connection can get up to 3.2 Mb/s. 6 hours / day but usually only see 500 Kb/s during busy times.... &nbsp;which is about 18 hours a day. &nbsp;If Microsoft wants more customers, cut down on the high internet Terror Bytes demands. &nbsp;I can still see that
 mans facial dirt details burned into my brain with such high detail. &nbsp;I am sure I would have still recognized him with out that much High definition details and with using only half of the megabytes used to display a face.</p>

    <title>Guide Data for Digital OTA Broadcast SUB channels - Vista WMC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moonstruck67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guide Data for Digital OTA Broadcast SUB channels - Vista WMC</h2>
                    Digital OTA subchannels add to Guide easily, however data for secondary sub channels duplicates that of primary channel.<br />
<br />
How can this be fixed?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Hardware:&nbsp; HP media center PC w/ Hauppauge 1600 tuner&nbsp; (though this seems irrelevant as this problem is commonly reported across hardware)<br />
<br />
Software:&nbsp; Windows Media Center as part of Vista Premium (though same problem widely reported across other versions, though rumored to be corrected in Win 7 Beta)<br />
<br />
Resources Tried: <br />
*&nbsp; Looked at WMC Hotfix (not the same issue); <br />
* this thread: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vistamedia/thread/52c101b6-9cae-45f4-81e4-d7370bcbb54a (which is unanswered, and people confused the issue of adding subchannels, vs getting the appropriate subchannel info).<br />
* MS's Troubleshooting guide: hmmmm, not even a mention of the problem????<br />
* This thread at The Green Button:&nbsp; http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/thread/299749.aspx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (thread suggestion to remap channels from a local cable provider, remapping channels to guide, TV Pack Hacks, etc....not clear or MS approved apparently...)<br />
<br />
Is this that difficult to fix?&nbsp; If Zap2It, the provider to MS for the guide data in question has the appropriate data, and the WMC program doesn't display it as promised...where does the problem lie?<br />
<br />
instead of deleting the thread can anyone actually provide an constructive answer for this fundamental issue that has lingered apparently unfixed for almost two years?<br />
<br />
<br />

Hello moonstruck67,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In regards to this issue you must contact your local cable or satellite provider as they would have the Digital and analog channel<span>&nbsp;
</span>listings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>

            Anthony:<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to answer the question, but I'm not sure if I was clear in the first post.<br />
<br />
I am using an OTA (OVER THE AIR) method of recieving DIGITAL signals via the Hauppauge card.<br />
<br />
The Guide when doing the setup process as proscribed correctly and automatically populates the appropriate local channels for OTA broadcast reception.<br />
<br />
The snag comes in that the SUBCHANNELS' PROGRAM LISTINGS are incorrect:&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; the secondary &amp; tertiary subchannels just show the program information for the primary channels.<br />
<br />
This data does not come from local providers.&nbsp; The data comes from the Microsoft Servers via license that was included in the purchase of Windows Vista Premium.&nbsp; Microsoft gets the data from ZAP2IT.&nbsp; When one goes to the ZAP2IT site they have the correct listings
 for local OTA channels, however it is somewhere in the backend (microsoft's retrieval from Zap2it, or the retransmission of it to the end user/customer) that the snag occurs.<br />
<br />
This software error has been widely reported, and to my knowledge is unaddressed.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate your suggestions, if there are any, but would also appreciate somebody escalating the issue to the appropriate people on the WMC team.<br />
<br />
If need be, I'd gladly supply other threads/forums from around the web describing the exact same problem using different hardware.<br />
<br />
ALSO:&nbsp; please note that I am able to tune in all the available channels (primary/secondary/tertiary) that are broadcast in my area, it is just that the guide is, and has been, consistently wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and attempt to help with this vexing issue.<br />
<br />

Interested in following up on this issue.<br />

Can ANYONE verify that they are using OTA (OVER THE AIR) broadcast reception with Vista WMC and getting a guide that is populated with correct PROGRAM GUIDE information once steps have been successfully taken to add/get the proper local channels?<br />
<br />
Again - please note, this is NOT FROM CABLE OR SATELLITE, ONLY OTA RECEPTION!<br />

            For reference, this issue is well documented BUG that isn't getting attention/answers. apart from using "registry hacks" to remap channel headend info for OTA broadcasts to a local cable providers channels...certainly this can't be considered acceptable...?<br />
<br />
<br />
(This workaround appears to be an answer, if you're willing to do registry hacks, certainly this can't be an acceptable answer to the WMC team?)<br />

Hopefully the above give some insight into the fact that this issue is:<br />
<br />
1) hardware independent (dells, HPs, tuner variations, etc...)<br />
2) has NOTHING to do w/ adding the digital subchannel #s to the guide, which wmc does very nicely and automatically now in my experience - ie. the channels add, they work to tune in channels, just that you can't get guide/program info for subchannels .2, .3,
 etc...<br />
3) is affecting seemingly everyone wishing to take advantage of the OTA ATSC digital broadcasts, and severely hampers the promise of the otherwise quite good WMC, limiting the use of the guide to the primary channel<br />

            re: Anthony, or other contibutors:<br />
<br />
after rereading your post, I'm not sure what I'd have done after contacting local broadcasters (you specifically said to contact local CABLE or my SATELLITE provider, neither of which are being used for OTA (over the air) broadcasts...nor did you indicate what
 to do ask them when contacting them, nor&nbsp; what to do with that information after getting it.&nbsp; I am under the belief that you were referring to people having difficulty ADDING channels to the guide vs the PROGRAM GUIDE INFO that is subsequently downloaded.<br />
<br />
Now that several days have passed, and I've made several posts of clarification, can anyone come forth with a constructive suggestion, or at the very least acknowledge this apparent bug which has existed for a few years (from reading the internet it goes back
 to WMC 2005)?&nbsp; Is this problem fundamental to the use that the software is provided for being addressed or at least on the bug issue to be fixed for the WMC team?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for your help, or at least feedback that this issue is being addressed.<br />
<br />
if someone from the WMC team needs to contact me please feel free to post here or contact me directly, TY!

            Anthony:<br />
<br />
once again, let me thank you for following this thread and trying to make suggestions.<br />
<br />
I followed your link, and read numerous other pages at Engadget, The Green Button, AVSforum, etc..&nbsp; You enlightened me to the existence of the WMC TVPack, vs the plain WMC included in the Vista Premium which included WMC.<br />
<br />
As you are no doubt aware, the TVPack you reference above is NOT AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ANYWHERE ON MICROSOFT'S SITE!!!.&nbsp; Yes, there have been updates available on the Microsoft site, the most recent update was 06-10-09.<br />
<br />
The "TVPack", according to the available news, was released ONLY to OEM manufactuerers, and they seem to only include that with new computer purchases and haven't made it available to owners who bought these higher end machines prior to the August/September
 2008 release of the TVPack.<br />
<br />
While this forum is perhaps not the best place to guess why Microsoft would have sent this update to OEM's only, the situation seems to be this:<br />
<br />
1) OEMs haven't made it available except via new machine purchase.<br />
2) the problems lies with the Microsoft software - not hardware.&nbsp; People using MS Compatability list certified hardware are suffering due to Microsoft’s Software - nothing the hardware/OEMs have control over.<br />
3) the only path for people like myself&nbsp; (those who bought Vista Premium or Ultimate Media Centers prior to the TVPack release) get the remedy you prescribe s to download the "TVPack" from unreputable sources (torrents, no-name driver sites, etc., and of course
 there's no hash check to even verify that you're not getting corrupted files from these sites)<br />
4) the "TVPack" for many has required a complete reinstall of the OPERATING SYSTEM, loss of access to previously recorded materials (even if they weren't copy-protected flaged).<br />
<br />
I am uncertain whether Microsoft is fixing these bugs.&nbsp; It would “appear” that the renaming the product with the "TVPack" moniker&nbsp; and the OEM-only release of the TVPack MS is trying suggest that this is somehow a different product—and anyone could see that
 it’s use/function/application is exactly the same.&nbsp; We are talking about Vista...the currently sold and available OS.&nbsp; The one we paid good $$ for, whether as part of a OEM PC, or the DIY builds, and are being orphaned.<br />
<br />
IF THE TVPack isn't for us, then WHERE ARE THE BUG FIXES FOR THE VISTA PRODUCT????????????? If they are in fact separate products (and since these updates don’t show up in my “Windows Update”, they are considered as such) then the fix for a buggy product MS
 manufactured has not been delivered.<br />
<br />
The idea of having spent hours tracking the problem is not new to me ( I've been using computers since cassette tapes were the mode of storage.), but finding myself where I'm left with options of going to "off" sites to find the software patches that may or
 may not dork your system, require a full OS reinstall, and at that would leave you with an unsupported system has got to be the worst execution of any software product I've ever bought.<br />
<br />
And, BTW, waiting (and paying for Win 7) isn't an appropriate remedy for bugs in an existing product that is not function as is (in the supported sense) without doing reg hacks or installing unsupported software from unsupported sites.<br />
<br />
Don't mean to rant, but in my position there is nothing left to do...please prove me wrong here and show me if I've missed a technical path.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If my understanding is correct, Please escalate my concerns to the appropriate eyes and ears.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time and consideration.<br />

            <strong>RE:&nbsp; </strong><span><strong>Guide Data for Digital OTA Broadcast SUB channels - Vista WMC Issue.</strong>
<br />
<br />
</span>I'm also have an issue where I do not receive Program Guide Data for SUB-Channels from "Off-the-Air" (OTA) Broadcast using WMC running a new install of Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; Before loading the newly purchased Vista Home Premium, I did a test install of
 Windows 7 RC installing the same drivers for the "Hauppauge WinTV HVR-1600" PCI card.&nbsp; WMC on Windows 7 correctly obtained and displayed the Program Guide Data correctly for the SUB-Channels.&nbsp; After buying and installing Vista, WMC no longer displays the Program
 Guide Data for the SUB-Channels.<br />
<br />
My system information:<br />
Vista Home premium 64-bit SP2<br />
Windows Media Center - Version 6.0.6002.18030 <br />
AMD Athlon 64 x2 Dual Core Processor 3800+ 2.00 GHz<br />
RAM: 4.00 GB<br />
System type: 64-bit Operatin System<br />
<br />
Video:&nbsp; NVIDIA GeForce GT<br />
Hauppauge WinTV HVR-1600 NTSC/ATSC/QAM Combo PCI Card<br />
Audio:&nbsp; C-Media <br />
<br />
I do feel that Microsoft is letting us down again by not issuing a fix for this issue.&nbsp; Without a FIX, I have to advise all my friends and coworkers
<strong>"Do Not Buy Windows Vista"</strong> or a new computer preloaded with Vista if they plan to use Windows Media Center, instead wait for Windows 7.&nbsp; Even my $40.01 ( one cent with coupon) APEX Digital to Analog TV Converter Box correctly displays the SUB-Channel
 Program Guide information.

<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>This is a bug in the software. Every time I call and ask to have someone fix it, they say that "atsc subchannel guide listings arn't supported for vista, You'll have to upgrade to Windows 7"</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>THIS MAKES ME ANGRY. When I was shopping around for software to serve as on OTA PVR system, I chose Vista MC because right on the box it says Supports ATSC Broadcasting.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>it FAILED to mention that it doesn't show the guide listings for 2/3rds of the channels.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A PVR IS USELESS WITHOUT GUIDE LISTINGS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And now the ATSC is the ONLY OTA system in the USA, you'd think they would support it.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I spent a LOT of money building this machine, and HALF MONTHS SALERY buying Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit. and it DOESN'T WORK as advertised.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I WILL NEVER BUY A MICROSOFT OS AGAIN AFTER THIS BURN.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>For those who want a system that works, look into MYTH TV, its a media center programe far more powerfull than WMC, and it allows you to see guide data for ATSC subchannels. Its a Linux Programe. It works amazing, and best yet its open sorce and that means
 FREE!</div>

<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I was a loyal Microsoft Customer since windows 3.1, but no more. I'm still a fan of PC, but because of this irritating and expensive burn I now use&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Linux instead of Windows OS (looking foreword to googles new OS, get some good pc OS compitition)</div>
<div>Googe Docs instead of MS OFFICE</div>
<div>I DO NOT USE BING,</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>We can not let Microsoft get away with this FALSE ADVERTISING, They sold me a product that didn't do what I was promised, they wont give me my money back, and they want me to shell out more money to buy an upgrade to do what the software was suposed to
 do in the first place. This is rediculus, and I am ANGRY.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>after 2 years of hastle trying to get this BUG resulved, fixing it wont make me a loyal customer again. (I've spent at least $10,000.00 in my life time on Microsofts products, and I've got a lot of life left to live, and spend money on software). The ONLY
 way I will now be satisfied after all the pain and suffering of bad product and customer support is a free upgrade to Windows 7. Then maybe after settling into software that works, and not haveing to pay for content I already paid for with vista. MAYBE then
 I can stop telling people about my expirience, telling them to choose Mac, or Linux, or wait for Google. and letting them know about free software that dies everything the $200.00 MS suites do. But I need an apology.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in, and SQL Server won&#39;t start after windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have multiple problems after the latest Windows update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I try to view anything in the forum, I get this message "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">The Microsoft account login server has detected too many repeated authentication attempts. Please wait a moment and try again."&nbsp;</span>I
 am able to log into outlook, etc., however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I try to start SQL Server, I get this message <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">
"the request failed or the service did not respond"</span>. When I look in the log it says "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">SQL Server evaluation period has expired.</span>" (it hasn't). I look in Help About in SQL Server Management Studio and it shows the licenses
 correctly (not expired).</p>

<h2>            Xbox One controllers keep disconnecting after firmware update for Headset Stereo Adapter</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>After updating the firmware of my Xbox controllers (v1.2.2236.0) to use the Headset Stereo Adapter I've bought recently, they *both* started to randomly disconnect while I play. They automatically reconnect seconds later, which is enough to interrupt my
 gameplay.</p>
<p>So far I've tried almost all the alternatives presented here: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-disconnects</p>
<p>- full power cycle of console</p>
<p>- reconnecting the wireless controller to the console</p>
<p>- disconnect all connected wireless controllers and headsets</p>
<p>There is also no metallic object positioned between the console and the wireless controller. I use it within a 2,5m distance.</p>
<p>I can't believe it is a "weak battery" problem since both controllers got affected at the same time and their batteries have different lifetimes. I also had no issues before the firmware update.</p>
<p>Is there any alternative I haven't tried yet? Is it possible to downgrade Xbox controller firmware?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing issue for over a year now with no acknowledgement from Microsoft, they're clearly trying to ignore it.
</p>
<p><a href="https://facebook.com/xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://facebook.com/xbox/</a>

<p>Post to their Facebook page, spam everything they post with repeated comments about controllers disconnecting. Let's make it impossible to ignore us.

</p><p><span><span>Hi, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I realize that you experienced a blue screen on your PC. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the PC?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you make any changes to the PC prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut
 down to prevent damage to your computer”. These errors can be caused by both hardware and software problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are unable to get to the desktop screen then unplug all external devices connected to the computer and restart the system to check if you are able to get to the desktop screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sometimes new hardware can cause blue screen errors. If you recently added new hardware to your PC, shut down your PC, unplug the new hardware, and then restart your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you are able to get to the desktop screen ensure to install all pending updates and also update all device drivers from Device Manager. Once this is done remember to restart the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many blue screen errors can be resolved by making sure that Windows is up to date. In the search box on the taskbar, enter Windows Update, select Windows Update. On the Windows Update page, select Check for updates.</span></p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<div><br />

<div>Can anyone help me with trying to get Viva Piñata to run on the PC please? I have two copies my brother and I are trying to play on each of our computers. Both Win7 64-bit. Mine installs and runs fine. However his installs but does not run. The launcher
 pops up but has no text in it. I can see the purple box which should contain the 'play' button but it can't be clicked so the game won't start.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have unistalled and reinstalled, updated Games For Windows and DirectX, started the game with crypto-somethingorother (under services in msconfig) on and off but still to no avail.</div>

<div>1. No, no error messages.</div>

<div><br />
<div><span>First go to C:\Users\Forest\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Games\Viva Pinata and find Startup.xml then open it and
 instend where says false enter true.</span><br />
<span>Enter the startup.exe and run the game(launcher wont show up but thats normal).</span></div>

<h2>            Connecting laptop directly to a projector and can&#39;t see my laptop screen</h2>
                    I'm trying to figure out how to display my laptop screen through a projector and also be able to see my laptop screen.&nbsp; When i hit the function key to display on the big screen, my laptop goes dark.&nbsp; I found a post on this forum about connecting additional
 displays or projector (Set Up Multiple Displays). When i go to Mobile PC and Display Settings the choices listed in the answer (mirrored, extended, etc) are not there.&nbsp; My laptop is two weeks old and running Vista Business Service Pack 2.&nbsp; Thank you for any
 help you can provide.

<p><span>Hello Shawn,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for Posting on the Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Probably there should be shortcut on your laptop keyboard to switch the visible monitor (e.g. Fn + F5). Try those until you
 can see the image on the laptop monitor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also follow the steps and try to set the display setting as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Right-click on the desktop, click on Properties and on the Display Settings choose monitor 1 as your primary display adapter.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Setup that external display (Projector) as a 2nd monitor.
</span></p>
<p><span>3) Click on Apply and Ok.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to verify if you are able to see the display on both Laptop and Projector.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also verify with the computer manufacturer to verify if they have any additional settings to be changed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.

    <title>Does Windows 7 Upgrade Program stay on PC after Upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msilvers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows 7 Upgrade Program stay on PC after Upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    I currently have Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit and am thinking of buying the download able Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade. For now I want to upgrade to Windows 7 32 bit (because of certain programs I use) but there is a chance that I may at some point want
 to convert to 64 bit. My question is, after I upgrade from Vista to 7, would the Upgrade program I payed for and downloaded still be on the computer to use if I wanted to later in time do a clean install of Window 7 64 bit?

            If you purchase it from the Microsoft Store, all you have to do is go to the Microsoft Store website (http://store.microsoft.com), log in with your store account, select Download Options and select Windows 7 64 bit and proceed to download.

                    Can't get the printer to work. Dell 1250c laser color. &nbsp;Error comment suggests it has to do with the USB 3.0 not compatible with this printer. &nbsp;And I have both USB 3 and USB 2 and I think I'm using the USB 2..so don't get it. &nbsp;And older scanner/printer
 and such works just fine. Not the newer Dell 1250c.

            <p>Dell's website shows that the printer is compatible with Windows 8.1; however, you cannot download the software package online or use the CD. It shows that the only usable driver is obtained through Windows Update. Maybe this is causing the problem? Try
 plugging in the printer and running windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Swipe (or slide cursor) in from the right edge of the screen, click Settings, and then click Change PC settings.</p>
<p>2. Click Update and recovery, and then click Windows Update.</p>
<p>3. Click or click Check now.</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Depends on the mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if you have a wheel you can still Zoom using Ctrl+Roll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, in Settings, Internet Options you can find a Zoom slider.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like it is not completely integrated or at least not dynamic.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I changed Zoom externally then went to check the slider.&nbsp;&nbsp; The slider only changed (in the direction that corresponded
 to the change) when I clicked in the Options bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it looks like I have to click so&nbsp;close to the slider that it may actually be resetting it that way&nbsp;instead of actually adjusting the setting to its current value.&nbsp;&nbsp; YMMV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quirks abound in this
 OS.</p>

    <title>Suspensions for... what &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzo 2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suspensions for... what &#63;</h2>
                    Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
I'm from France (so please be cool with my english) and a XBOX LIVE player since 10 years ago probably, and then today is my first suspension of my life \o/.<br />
<br />
But... I really do not understand why ?<br />
<br />
I was playing at GTA 5 with strangers on a multiplayer only mission. We lost the mission twice, the thids time, players with us trolled to NOT end the mission and then, everyone leave.&nbsp; Then, I saw a message from XBOX, can not open it, just with the firsts
 word "Your reputation hav...". Then, I saw a e-mail and open it : Avis d'application de sanction, telling me to go to microsoft[.]enforcement.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82eb2fe8-2882-4cca-8bc4-cf88dc5e0dee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82eb2fe8-2882-4cca-8bc4-cf88dc5e0dee?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
But, the point is... I have no microphone, and I don't send any messages :'), I think microsoft can check this right ?<br />
<br />
What I know is, this afternoon, I was playing with a stranger player in to GTA V too, on a mission, and I send a message to him "Sry, I&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> up" (with the "u") because I died like and itiot ^^. But I don't think this is
 the reason of my suspension. I think this is because one of players I played with at 8h30pm who may be blame me for... something I didn't played like he wanted me to do ?<br />
Can we serioulsy be banned by a player who decide "this guy is responsable for our defeat ! è_é" even if we play normaly ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

 account.&nbsp;In most cases, we&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;to&nbsp;appeal the decision made by the&nbsp;enforcement team. This&nbsp;can be done by&nbsp;submitting&nbsp;a case review. This process can be completed at the
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Enforcement Team's website</a>. Since your suspension is only 24 hours, you must wait until the suspension time is completed. The decisions are made and upheld by the enforcement team. We hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Which gametype do you despise and WHY&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I haven't played them all yet but there is one mode I despise. It's Alpha Zombies. The reason I hate this mode is because of the people who camp in the stupidest places so you have no way of getting to them. Boardwalk is the worst for this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modes I do like are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">- Slayer and Headhunter (These are my top 2 game types of choice on Rumble Pit)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">- CTF (I love this mode on Big Team Battle)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><br />

<p>Dino Blasters. Its the worst to ever exist in all the halo games. I feel as if the requirement to play this is an IQ below 80 because the game is so mindless and has no point. Boom you get thrown into it and are forced to play it, its stupidly simple its

            Almost certainly, your installation of Norton 360 Premier has nothing to do with this issue (although you may yet come to regret that decision).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, neither of the articles that "will surely help you" will in fact help you at all with this issue.<br />
<br />
By default, Windows uses a black font for normal files, a blue font for files that have been compressed to save space (usually by checking the box in Disk Cleanup to "Compress old files to save space"), and a green font for files encrypted with the Windows
 Encrypting File System (EFS). I recommend that you stay as far as possible away from EFS.<br />
<br />
If you have a relatively new computer, you won't notice much ill effect from having the file(s) compressed.&nbsp; Windows automatically uncompresses the file(s) "on the fly" whenever you open them.&nbsp; This compression, however, usually doesn't save all that much space
 and sometimes can cause very long delays in the operation of Disk Cleanup. For that reason, many users disable the option:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812248</a><br />
<br />
Note the this compression is not the same as ZIPping the file(s).&nbsp; See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307987?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307987?wa=wsignin1.0<br />
</a><br />
If you want to uncompress a file manually, right-click, select Properties, and click the "Advanced" button on the "General" tab.&nbsp; Uncheck the box and OK your way out.<br />
<br />
You can turn this behavior off or even change the colors associated with these file characteristics.&nbsp; See

<h2>            What does windows 7 and my wireless connection want when asking for Network authentication - user creditials username and password&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Windows 7 home premium on my laptop (upgraded from Vista).&nbsp;At home I have a wireless network that is working just fine with ethernet cable connected.&nbsp; When I try to connect wirelessly, although it finds my router, I get a prompt:<br />
<br />
Titled:&nbsp;Windows Security<br />
Network&nbsp;Authentication<br />
Please input the user credentials<br />
Asking for a user name and password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried all passwords for the router and I have no windows password, nothing works.&nbsp; My husband just purchased a new laptop with windows 7 home premium and his connected wirelessly no worries with just the WEP key. I checked that I have the latest network
 adapter drivers. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I have tried the proposed solution without success.</p>
<p>Have just upgraded from Vista Business to 7.0 Profesional</p>
<p>I have a Speedstream2113 modem which connects fine via ethernet cable. The wireless connection is found, but I get the same Windows Security Network Authentication window requesting a Username and Password. Have tried the router paswords and windows user
 /password. No luck.</p>
<p>Very frustrating !</p>
<p>Any other thoughts welcome.</p>

<p>Hello Savan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I had tried this already and password protected sharing was already off.</p>
<p>I'm still not connected wirelessly, any other ideas????</p>
<p>Like jmazenga, I have a speedstream router (speedstream 7261).</p>
<p>The main difference I can tell between my husbands laptop with windows 7 which works wirelessly with this router and my laptop&nbsp;is that mine was upgraded from vista.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi jmazenga,</p>
<p>Like you, I have a speedstream router (speedstream 7261) and the proposed solution doesn't work.&nbsp; I'm still having issues - if you find a solution let me know and I'll do the same for you.</p>
<p>The frusting thing is my new husbands laptop with windows 7 connected wirelessly in a flash! I'm still trying to connect from Christmas.&nbsp; Could you connect wirelessly when you had Vista?</p>
<p>Good to know I'm not alone....thanks</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>From the above description it kind of hard to understand which part of the process to connect to the Network is Not working.</p>
<p>Wireless needs to connect first to the Wireless Router.</p>
<p>Most people use security (every one should) that entails password logon.</p>
<p>If this part of the process is OK you should be able to use the Internet, and it means that the Wireless is OK and you should leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>As for logon for File Sharing.</strong></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has three types of sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
HomeGroup Network = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Work Network = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.<br />
<br />

<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; The computer finds the wireless network connection OK but is asking for a username and password that I don't think exists!&nbsp; I've&nbsp;tried setting up a network between the home computer running XP and this laptop (and it works - I can
 share files)&nbsp;to reset any password, but that hasn't given me access either (besides I need a user name and password).&nbsp; The router username and password doesn't work.&nbsp; Yet, my husbands laptop can just simply connect without "network authentication"...why???&nbsp;
 I bet it is something really simple - that I can't work out even in 6 months!</p>

<p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Answers forum! In your previous post you said that your wireless connection is<em>“asking for a username and password”.

<p>Captain Planet did a good job of describing the problem.&nbsp; I don't understand why Microsoft decided to have this window pop up, or what they want in the spaces, but I did find a work around that works for me in the same situation:</p>
<p>If I go to the Network and Sharing Center in Control Panel; then click on "Set up a new connection or network"; then "Manually connect to a wireless network"; and enter the credentials for the wireless router manually I am able to access the internet and
 network without any problem (and without being asked for&nbsp;additional user names or passwords).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should assist you, but be VERY careful when disabling DEP.</p>
<p>
</p><div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vistax64.com%2fimages%2finfosmall1.png" height="20" width="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; Information</div>
<div>Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a security feature that can help prevent damage to your computer from viruses and other security threats. Harmful programs can try to attack Windows by attempting to run (also known as execute) code from system memory
 (RAM) locations reserved only for Windows and other authorized programs. These types of attacks can harm your programs and files. If DEP notices a program on your computer using memory incorrectly, it closes the program and notifies you with the
<strong>DEP stop error</strong>. DEP is ran in a software mode and in a hardware mode. If your processor supports DEP (<strong>NX</strong> for AMD, and
<strong>XD</strong> for Intel), then you will have hardware and software DEP. If it doesn't, then Vista will just use software DEP. 64 bit applications will have DEP enabled all the time by default, but 32 bit applications do not and must have DEP manually
 enabled for them. For more information, see: <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/186de3d0-01af-4d4c-981d-674637d2f4bf1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            We obtained the game on CD-Rom; it wasn't a download. I've tried disabling DEP or adding the game as an exception, but I get an error saying that DEP must be enabled for this application.<br />

            <p>This game works on Windows 8.1, so the problem seems to be a Windows Vista issue. Does anyone have any other ideas on how to fix it?</p>

</p><blockquote>When I use control panel I am asked to let the software make changes to the computer</blockquote>
<p>That's the normal behaviour of the User Account Control (UAC).</p>
<p>When you install a program UAC asks you to allow changes to your computer, and when you uninstall that program UAC will ask you, too.</p>
