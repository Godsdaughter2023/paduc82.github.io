<h2>            Windows 8 account status changed to guest mode</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so I've done the searching and found squat on this. I have found people with similar problems but the solutions are every where, one person only had to reboot their computer, others had to completely re-install, some found a way into admin mode,
 created a new account and then copied the old account into the new one and yet others have found NO solution.&nbsp; I've rebooted, restored and been on the phone with Microsoft support. THE PROBLEM: My wife works from home, obviously it requires a computer. Yesterday
 the computer worked fine, it shut down fine. No updates. No Changes. No problems. Today, we boot it up and she signs in as normal EXCEPT, the start up 'tile' screen is empty, just the destktop, IE and I think MS store tiles are there. Going to desktop everything
 is missing as well, it looks like a fresh install of Windows 8 but MOST IMPORTANTLY an alert box on the bottom right pops up and says "you are signed in as a guest, this is a temporary account and all changes and files created during this session will be deleted
 at the end of the session" or something like it.&nbsp; Here's the thing, there is only one account on the computer AND it's the right account (not guest). Going back to the tile screen it IS her account name logged in, PLUS if you put in the wrong password during
 log in it WILL deny and say incorrect password, it only will log in with the correct password. Signing out and signing back in does nothing. I have since created two other accounts on the computer and they both work perfectly fine, but they don't have admin
 rights nor can they access ALL of the files and software she had installed under the original account. Looking through C drive I can see her user folder with the other accounts I've created plus two TEMP folders, one just named TEMP the other TEMP.(PC name
 here). TEMP is deletable, TEMP.PCNAME is not. I've run scanners, restored, refreshed, everything but re-install which I can't do because I don't have a physical copy of W8. At this point though I don't want to re-install it, this problem happened on its own
 with no changes or anything, so unless I can repair this issue through administrator action I have no desire to re-install and KEEP windows 8. If this can only be fixed by re-installing windows 8 or replacing the computer (Microsoft support finished our session
 by telling me to contact the PC manufacturer to get the entire unit replaced) then I will replace the system with a Windows 7 unit, or build a new unit and try out Linux. I need a dependable work computer, not some techno-screw up that just goes nuts whenever
 it pleases. So if anyone can constructively help, please do.<br />

            <div>Hi </div>
<div>We are glad to get your query on Windows Community.</div>
<div>As far as your query is concerned, It seem that you are having a tough time logging to your default account.</div>
<div>I will surely help you with issue. But I still require certain information to get the right resolution:</div>
<div>May I know whether the default account is an Admin account or a standard user account?</div>
<div>I would recommend you to follow the methods below to resolve the issue:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Enable Built Admin account.<br />
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key together on your desktop screen.<br />
b) Click on Command Prompt (admin).<br />
c) Type: <strong>net user administrator /active: yes</strong></div>
<div>Note: Please follow the same steps and type <strong>net user administrator /active: no</strong> to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done</div>
<div>After enabling Built-in admin, please try with the steps below:</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Perform <strong>SFC Scan</strong></div>
<div>Please follow the steps to perform SFC Scan:<br />
<div>a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q” </strong>to open Charms Bar.<br />
b. Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” without quotes in the search box.<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select <strong>“Run as Administrator</strong>”.<br />
d. Type <strong>‘sfc /scannow’ </strong>without quotes and hit enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Please perform Microsoft Safety Scanner to scan your computer for infections.</div>
<div><br />
To download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner, follow these steps: </div>
<div>a) Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner site at: Microsoft Safety Scanner <br />
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>)</div>
<div>b) Click Download Now.</div>
<div>c) If prompted, click Run. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the Microsoft Safety Scanner. When prompted, add a shortcut to the Microsoft Safety Scanner to your desktop.</div>
<div>d) From your desktop, double click the Microsoft Safety Scanner icon. When the Microsoft Safety Scanner program launches, click Scan Type, then click Full Scan, then click Next.</div>
<div>e) After the scan is complete, remove all detected malware entries<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
<br />
For more information refer:</div>
<div><br />
Microsoft resources and guidance for removal of malware and viruses (Microsoft Safety Scanner).</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671662</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>Please restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to your Default Profile.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>From Built in administrator account create a new user account and transfer the profile data.</div>
<div>Please follow the steps below to do that:</div>
<div><br />
a) Press <strong>Windows and x</strong> together and select Windows Explorer.</div>
<div>b) Click on <strong>View tab </strong>and Click on <strong>Options</strong> at the top right corner.</div>
<div>c) Click the <strong>View tab</strong>, and then click <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</div>
<div>d) Uncheck the box which states <strong>Hide protected operating system files.<br />
</strong>e) Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm, and then click <strong>OK. </strong>
<div>f) Locate the <strong>C:\Users\Old_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.</div>
<div>g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:</div>
<div><strong>•Ntuser.dat<br />
•Ntuser.dat.log<br />
•Ntuser.ini</strong></div>
<div>h) Right click and Select <strong>Copy</strong>.</div>
<div>i) Locate the <strong>C:\Users\New_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and New Username is the name of the new user profile you created.</div>
<div>j) Right click inside the folder and select <strong>Paste</strong>.</div>
<div>k) Restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to default profile.</div>
<div><br />
Please reply us back if the issue still persists. </div>

            <p>Wow ..... As far as I can tell this ridiculous bug goes clear back to Win 7 Beta and still hasn't been fixed correctly by Microsoft as I got hit by it yesterday &nbsp;... I haven't even touched my User Accounts since Oct 2014, it just did it all on it's own when
 I was working on another bug ridden Win 8.1 system (Which will do the same thing eventually)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a HUGE SECURITY HOLE you can drive a semi-truck full of Viruses and Trojans through .... sideways it has been ongoing for at least six years and still affests Win 7 Win 8 and Win 8.1 which explains a lot as to why Microsoft continues to rapidly lose
 Market Share to Apple and Android devices that just work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found 50 different non-answers to this problem that OBVIOUSLY has Microsoft completely baffled and frankl;y the only thing that actually works without wasting 2 or 3 days time is restore from a back up image and lose whatever work you have done since the
 backup. This product and Microsoft continues to swirl the drain .....</p>

    <title>Copy filenames from folders and subfolders - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Copy filenames from folders and subfolders</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I would like to be able to copy filenames to my clipboard.&nbsp; I need to be able to copy the filenames from folders and subfolders.&nbsp; I would rather use a standalone utility rather than the command prompt if possible.&nbsp; I have found many programs that will copy
 the filenames from a specific folder, but not the subfolders.&nbsp; I have also found one program called Drive Inventory that will copy the
<strong>path name</strong> for all the files that I need but I prefer the just filename plus extension rather than entire path.&nbsp; I may be able to make this work work with a work.&nbsp; Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Well I don't have a standalone utility, but the command prompt does work quite well.&nbsp; Why are you avoiding it?&nbsp; If it helps, here's a visual example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's one way:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Open a Command Window in the Folder</span></strong><br />
Hold Shift while you right-click the folder were all the pictures are.&nbsp; Holding shift provides more options on the right-click menu.&nbsp; Choose "Open Command Window Here".<br />
<br />

At the command window, type this command and press enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>dir /b&nbsp;/s&nbsp;|clip</strong><br />
<br />
When you press enter, nothing will appear to happen yet.&nbsp; In the background, a list of all file names was copied to the clipboard.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f822f837-a262-4e0c-a3b3-586df2b42bcd" /></li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Paste the List Into Excel</span></strong><br />
Switch to Excel and press Paste (or Ctrl-V).&nbsp; A list of the file names will appear.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08dba3f0-1d90-4723-a704-c56d9e0c9397" /></li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Remove the File Path Info (optional)</span><br />
</strong>If you want just the names, and to remove the folder path, you can press Ctrl-H and do a replacement:<br />
<br />
<strong>Replace:&nbsp; </strong>*\<br />
<strong>Replace With:</strong>&nbsp; (nothing, leave this blank)<br />
<br />
After replacing, you'll have just the file names:<br />

            My pleasure. Also just a note, Windows 8 and higher have this built-in as a "copy path" button on the toolbar, just highlight one or more files then click it to copy their paths to the clipboard.

<p>Thanks for the detail. Very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Win 10, though, the first steps opens a "Powershell" (on my machine, at least). The subsequent steps just then lead to a series of errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead:</p>
<p>- Open the command prompt from the 'start' menu</p>
<p>- Navigate to the directory in question (in now seems that quotation marks are not need for long directory names and capitals are ignored)</p>
<p>- follow steps above.</p>

<p>Hello Shawn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>That's very&nbsp;excellent article you provided :) .. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wonder if there is a&nbsp;DOS command&nbsp;that does not include the directory paths alone and instead, shows the"[directory paths ..]\file names instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example in the 1st Excel spreadsheet above, it&nbsp;will not&nbsp;include the line&nbsp;of the directory "C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Architecture"
 ... but will show the line "C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Architecture\imag13.jpg", ..., "C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Architecture\imag15.jpg",
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help, Shawn.</p>

<p>There's probably several ways to accomplish that, but if you want to just get file names and not directories, you could filter the list to only those that contain a dot.</p>

<p>I don't see any reason why not.&nbsp; The size of the files doesn't really matter. It may take a bit longer depending on the number of files, but their sizes doesn't impact it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real limit I can think of initially is that Excel can only "hold" 1 million rows of data. But I bet you don't have a million files all in that folder.</p>

<p>This is fantastic, except that it stops at the first folder where I don't have access rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a cmd that will allow users to bypass folders where access is restricted?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like it to preferably just list the folders where I don't have access to the contents and have the CMD continue listing the rest. If this is impossible, then I would be happy if the CMD just skipped those restricted-rights folders and keep listing all
 the file names from the rest of the folders.</p>

            That's what's causing it, had the same problem. Uninstall fences, restart pc and if you go to stardock you can download the latest version which works correctly on windows 10

<p>
</p><p>I just had this problem! and I fixed it! there are lots of fixes but didn't worked for me, the esc thingy didn't worked! so here's how I fixed it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press windows-key+R, and it will open the run command</p>
<p>2. Type INETCPL.CPL</p>
<p>3. Go to "advanced tab"</p>
<p>4. Click the restore default settings and click reset!</p>
<p>5. check the check box that would appear!</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it will be all good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: the settings on your internet explorer will be reseted, and the cause may have seem to be corrupted files on Internet explorer</p>

<h2>            ADFS 3.0 form authentication loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem regarding ADFS 3.0 forms authentication, in order to use SharePoint. When I try to connect through forms authentication, the browser loop back to the login page. This happens only with users that have something shared on the sharepoint.
 If the user doesn't have anything shared for him, the respond is that this site hasn't shared with you, which is right. When I change the authentication, on ADFS, to windows authentication its working right. Unfortunately I have to make it work&nbsp;with forms
 authentication. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Really confused about the level cap...please help. </h2>
                    
<p>Okay so I am obviously new to the Borderlands community, I've had the game for about two weeks now. Love it. Already got 1,000/1,000 gscore. So obviously I am level 50. However, I immediately stopped after hitting 50 and am coming onto these forums because
 I am confused about the level cap. Can i reach the 69 level cap in the main game without any DLC? Do I have to buy the Knoxx DLC to reach 69 (even though it says it only goes up to 61) OR do I have to buy the Knoxx DLC and a second/third/fourth DLC in order
 to reach 69? I don't really have 40 dollars to spend on DLC right now (and I know i shudve gotten the GOTY edition), so please don't tell me to just buy all the DLC. Please help. Thanks.
</p>

<p>With just the regular game you can only go up to level 58, so keep playing cuz when u hit level 51 u get another acheevo, if u want level 69 u need to get the secret armory DLC, the other DLCs are fun just no level upgrades, just bonus skill points for completing
 the dlcs, 1 for each playthrough. My suggestion get the Secret Armory for now, you only need the other DLCs if u wanna get all the acheevos</p>

<p><span>The DLC will get your level higher but not ALL the DLC.&nbsp; Mad Moxxie won't.&nbsp; You won't get ANY XP from it.&nbsp; The best, in my opinion,&nbsp;are&nbsp;Gen Knoxx, Zombie Island and then Claptrap Revo.&nbsp; Moxxie last but only if you have 2-4
 friends, with at least 8 hours to waste.</span></p>

<p><span>If your level stopped increasing once you reached level 50, then you are missing the (free) patch that increased the level cap to 58.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There were to things that increased the Borderlands level cap.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The <i>Secret Armory of General Knoxx</i> add-on increased the level cap by 11. As this came first, the level cap was raised to 61.</span>
</li><li><span>Patch 1.4.1 increased the level cap by 8. This means with the Secret Armory add-on, the level cap is 69. Patch only, the level cap is 58.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Since you do not have the add-on, you should be able to reach level 58 (without buying anything). If you are truly stuck at 50, then you need to install the patch. Assuming you have an XBox360, just sign into XBox
 Live and try to start Borderlands. You should be prompted to install the patch. If you have Borderlands on a different platform, I am sure that they have their own method for getting the (equivalent) patch.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer to the Borderlands wiki (<a href="http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_Points#Experience_and_levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">experience points</a> and
<a href="http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">patch</a>) for more details.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once the patch is installed, you can raise your level further (to 58). You do not need any DLC to do this -- just do play-through 2 and 2+ to keep earning experience. However, I would recommend getting (at least)
 Secret Armory, assuming you enjoy the base game. It costs 800 points ($10) but if you watch for occasional specials, you can get it at half-price.<br />

<p>grab some note paper, and make a list of the items, then check them each time you get one.</p>
<p>really that's what i did and other players i know did to keep track of them.</p>
<p>[quote user="oRainbow Crasho"]</p>
<p>the annoying ones are like thestupid random thigns that claptraps drop..like panties pizza..etc...and there's no way of telling how many of each you've collected...I've done Tannis' crazy mission once..lol it was fun to do.and Inow have this game on Steam.and

<p>I too am confused at the level cap thing. Sorry, i know it isnt hard, i just haven't woken up yet.</p>
<p>I have played through the game once and got to about level 40 i think.. or v close to that.</p>
<p>I started playthrough 2 and went through a few missions and decided to buy the Dr Neds Zombie Island DLC.</p>
<p>If i play through the DLC on playthrough 1, my cap seems to be stuck at level 41 however when i play it on playthrough 2, i starts to increase again.</p>
<p>Whats the explanation for this then?? Why is the game 'making me' play through the DLC on playthrough 2 in order to get EXP. I want to play it through on 1 first, then max out, then do playthrough 2...</p>
<p>hmmmmm....</p>
<p>annoying.</p>

    <title>Unable to access wireless printer on Windows 10 error&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to access wireless printer on Windows 10 error&#58; &#34;Application not found&#34;, while installing thed driver</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off I'd like to say that I could likely find this information somewhere else, but would rather discuss the issue with other people instead.&nbsp; I recently purchased an XPS 8900 and it has a wireless card in it, and I believe bluetooth as well.&nbsp; I
 got everything set up and then went to connect to a wireless printer already set up in my house, but had no luck and can't seem to find the printer on the network.&nbsp; I tried getting drivers from the Seiko Epson site, but still couldn't find the printer on my
 network.&nbsp; Finally I found the original install disk but I get an error that says "Application not found" every time I try and open it.&nbsp; Is this printer just not supported or am I doing something wrong??</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another issue of mine, off topic sure but still an issue is that I have a GT 730 card in my tower with 2 gigabytes of memory to it, as well as Intel graphics at 1.7 gigabytes(so says the ark)&nbsp; but when I opened my display properties it shows dedicated
 memory of 2 gigabytes and shared memory of roughly 4 gigabytes bringing me close to twice what I thought my video memory was at.&nbsp; Why is that number so high?</p>

            <p>I don't need any further assistance, thank you.&nbsp; I thought that maybe there was a network problem the whole time, it just seemed strange that the printer wasn't showing on my private network.&nbsp; I tried the troubleshooting tool you recommended and showed no
 problems, and all drivers are up to date.&nbsp; I got onto to the computer the printer was originally installed on and checked the network.&nbsp; Sure enough I got an error message, sorry I can't remember exactly what it said but it was something about not being able
 to communicate with the printer.&nbsp; I turned the Wifi off on the printer itself then turned it back on, reentered the password and sure enough it showed up and I was able to open it's folder on the network.&nbsp; After this I tried the original install disk again
 and it worked, although I chose not to autoplay it and just opened it to view files and ran the setup.&nbsp; One of the first steps was to download the drivers, I did get a message that said installation or download(I can't remember which, sorry) unsuccessful,
 I would guess this is because I already have the most up to date driver installed and despite the failed step it still prints.&nbsp; I seriously doubted it was not supported by Windows, I just haven't used a PC for longer than a few minutes since Vista days.&nbsp; The
 last two computers to use the printer were using Windows 7 and 8 so I thought maybe Epson had a Driver specifically for Windows 10 and that I got the wrong one.&nbsp; Sorry to bother with a topic not all that related to Windows.&nbsp; Thanks so much for your input though
 I appreciate it.<br />

<h2>            C.P.U. occupancy 99&#37; by windows installer</h2>
                    <p>Because of some process namely Windows Installer, C.P.U. occupancy of my windows increases to 99% . Your community had provided some steps and measures that i can take but after that too i am facing the same problem. My windows is not activated yet. Is it
 compulsory to active windows in order to work properly with it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a one screenshot in which my C.P.U. is running smoothly but in every 15-30 min whenever i left my PC idle C.P.U. usage increases to 99% because of this Windows Explorer process. That times there are mainly 4 such process out of which mainly 1 or
 2 occupies 99% C.P.U. . I am facing this&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem since 6 months. And all the time the only cure i found is to delete this process whenever it troubles me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Zen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Starting with Version 1803 you must have a Digital License to change from Home to Pro version. 
<br />
<br />To do this now go offline by choosing Airplane Mode in Action Center (at right end of task bar), then insert the Generic Product Key to change to Pro Version: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a> 
<br />
<br />After it changes to Pro version, go back online and insert the Pro Product Key in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation  to activate.
<br />
<br />If any problems contact Microsoft Support via one of these methods:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <div>My troubles began last week when my pc failed to boot, potentially after a windows update. It would get to the windows logo screen then freeze. I tried resetting and even a fresh install to no avail.
</div>
<div>I decided to get a new ssd and try a fresh Win10 install on that. Same issue. I have now managed to get into my fresh install by removing my graphics card, putting it in results in the same freeze at the windows logo.</div>

<div>Other issues I've discovered: </div>
<div>Within device manager the second of my 'standard SATA AHCI Controller' has a hardware error.</div>

<div>Running Cfs/Scannow, results in a large amount of&nbsp;[DIRSD OWNER WARNING]&nbsp;errors and 'Error - Overlap: Duplicate ownership for directory'</div>

            <p>Have managed to boot into windows with gpu installed with safe mode with networking, cannot install drivers though.</p>
<p>SATA controller error is now gone after plugging my SATA cable into a different SATA slot on the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was told by Microsoft support after several hours of troubleshooting to contact motherboard vendor (Asus) for any newer bios updates or drivers. The incompatibility was caused apparently by the November update to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting a reply from Asus but am sceptical as I haven't heard of any issues with the same motherboard so far.</p>

 switched for a minute and then after that it will go back to normal, but right now it is not going back. I usually have the right button as my primary one, and that is how it is set when I go to my settings. However, whenever I try using the right mouse button,
 it behaves like a secondary button, and the left is behaving as the primary button. I tried restarting and nothing happened. Does anyone know what might be causing this, and if there is a solution? Thank you.</span>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been occurring for a few months off and on, but it usually goes back to normal after a little while, but now it is not. I have only one user profile on my laptop, so I'm not sure if it would occur on a different one. I'm not sure about safe mode either.
 I thought about updating the driver, but I'm not sure which one I might need to update in order to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>We may need to do basic troubleshooting to determine what's causing the issue on your touch pad. As an initial troubleshooting, we suggest that you create a test user profile to see it the issue will still occur. Another solution that may solve the issue
 is updating your mouse drivers, which can be found on your laptop's <strong>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)</strong> website.</p>

    <title>Stop error irq_not_less_or_equal&#58; reboot hangs at tdi.sys in safe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> appliance_healing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop error irq_not_less_or_equal&#58; reboot hangs at tdi.sys in safe mode &#38; takes ages to reboot into normal mode</h2>
                    This occurs in XP sp2 (so far not in sp3 and hopefully won't - tho I do think it is IRQ conflict related, more on that in a moment) and seems to be triggered by multiple tabs opened in a browser that are graphic intensive &amp; have a lot of image related
 coding, or two tabs that both have Flash .swf movies or animated elements.<br />
<br />
the program 'Who Crashed' is never quite sure of the exact cause, tho agrees it is driver related.<br />
<br />
similarly, Event Viewer does not log the error as anything definite enough to search on precisely.<br />
<br />
Initially if the bluescreen occured, a reboot would take the normal amount of time to get back to the OS - however, what has begun to occur when it happens is that the reboot takes a very long time to get into the GUI. The splash screen shows up fine, then
 there are hard drive noises that sound like the disk is thrashing back and forth - this goes on for ages, and then the GUI shows up as normal, and the box for 'Your System has recovered from a serious error' shows up and asks to send the details to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
It will never boot into safe modes after the blue screen - it always hangs at TDI.SYS. That driver shows up as last in the list of drivers being loaded and it gets no further. It only eventually boots into the GUI from either 'Start Windows Normally' or 'Last
 Known Good Configuration'.<br />
<br />
About the IRQ conflict - initially the install was done prior to having broadband access, so the onboard Ethernet port was not used. The IRQ for that is set to the same number as the IRQ for the graphics card. I can't change the IRQs, and I suspect that is
 the problem going by the kind of events that seem to trigger the STOP error. Tho neither the GPU or the NIC seem to share any memory allocations.<br />
<br />
The motherboard only has the one 16x interface for a graphics card, and I don't want to slot a NIC in between it and the PSU fan; hence why I haven't just added another NIC instead of changing the IRQ.<br />
<br />
So, the things I am wondering does anyone have answers on - why does it not boot into safe mode, and hang at TDI.SYS &amp; what are the recommended best practices to disable ACPI so to change the IRQ assignments? Is there anything I should be careful about that
 ACPI also affects (I'm not bothered about the varied sleep modes, tho I would want to be able to use suspend). Also, why does the hard drive take such a long time to reboot back into the GUI - is it page thrashing? or just writing extremely long info to someplace?<br />
<br />
It could be some other driver, as the reports are vague as to which drivers are trying to take one anothers memory space, or why that crashes the OS anyway. I haven't looked a huge amount into debugging, and found that I have to configure a symbol path to get
 the Windows Debugger to work right anyway, which I haven't had the time to look into and find out what-where-how it should be pointing at.<br />
<br />
this is the crash dumps as seen by Who Crashed, the system is on daily and as can be seen the crashes are kinda intermittent and not regular - but I can't stand not knowing exactly why they happen - the graphics driver has also been updated since then.<br />

<span>18 crash dumps have been found and analyzed. Note that it's not always possible to state with certainty whether a reported driver is really responsible for crashing your system or that
 the root cause is in another module. Nonetheless it's suggested you look for updates for the products that these drivers belong to and regularly visit Windows update or enable automatic updates for Windows. In case a piece of malfunctioning hardware is causing
 trouble, a search with Google on the bug check errors together with the model name and brand of your computer may help you investigate this further.

rofl?! CMOS? Did you even read anything I wrote? Don't answer that, it's obvious you did not. The BIOS doesn't have options to change the IRQs anyway, so resetting things via the battery wouldn't work.<br />
The IRQs were selected by the operating system install, ACPI picks them for you automatically - hence why not being able to change them in the OS setting later on is such a problem. Some people (on other forums) have even claimed only a reinstall will change
 them. Reinstalls are last-ever-ever options. However, if you have some secret webpage link that no-one else can get unless you post it here, about how CMOS resets will fix that, then do link it. Tho even if you do it doesn't seem anymore to be the issue here
 at all,<br />
<br />
Update -<br />
<br />
sadly sp3 (service pack 3) hasn't fixed the problem - and this time the NIC was off, so I doubt there was an interrupt (IRQ) conflict between it and the graphics card after all.<br />
<br />
This time I was converting audio files, left for a minute, and came back to that same bluescreen. It had converted 1-10 &amp; number 20 of the files, I found when it eventually booted back into the GUI.<br />
<br />
It still won't boot into safe modes, and hangs at TDI.SYS,<br />
<br />
now it also doesn't boot from Last Known Good Configuration either, but it boots - after the same large amount of disk writing - from Start Windows Normally.<br />
<br />
How it it even possible for an OS to crash entirely just because two or more apps (or their drivers) are trying to use the same memory space. That just doesn't sound like it should be able to happen.
<br />
And TDI.SYS is listed as being a network driver, so why does Safe Mode (without networking) try to load it? - it also loads the NDIS and some other drivers that are for networking too.<br />

<p>Hello there lovestheganja28!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tried the previously posted troubleshooting steps, then can I ask, how are you connected?</p>
<p>Wired or wirelessly?</p>
<p>Does it recognize that your network is set up at all?</p>
<p>If it does, what happens when you go to Network Settings and test your Multiplayer Connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the previously posted steps didn't help, then I would try referring to our guide entitled ”<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I get an error message when I run
 the ‘Test multiplayer connection’ on Xbox One</a>” and/or make sure that your network is setup the way it's outlined on our support page

<h2>            Brand New Dell, Just installed Windows 10 WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR</h2>
                    I just bought a new Dell Pc XPS 8900, and before starting it up for the first time, installed a firewire&nbsp;card. It started up fine, asking the regular new pc questions but when it got to the Network Settings it crashed and restarted after I put in the password
 for my Wi-Fi and hit enter. This happened twice before being successful. After that I instantly installed Windows 10. It was fine after that for a while, even after installing Steam and one game, but now I get the blue screen with the WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR
 after a few minutes in a game and even just while playing mp3 files and nothing else.

<h2>            Hard Drive Transfer issues with transfer cable</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I recently decided to upgrade my harddrive by buying a 250 gb xbox 360 harddrive. I currently own a 20 gb hardrive with the original console fyi. I also have a microsoft licensed transfer cable, and took the steps to connect it all up. When i put
 it all together, the xbox does not automatically prompt me to transfer the data which is a problem because i am not able to transfer otherwise. Anyone have solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How i have it set up: 20 gb hard drive connected to xbox....250 gb harddrive attached to tranfer cable. I also have the software disc that i put in and should make it all work...but it doesnt.</p>

<p>It turns out that I may have been a tad too impatient when it didnt work as soon as i plugged it in. I needed to connect to xbox live with the new hard drive and download the updates (i think the big update when the whole dashboard changed) and i am currently
 waiting on that to finish to see if it works. Will post later if this solved my problems</p>

<p><span>Hi Ron Cohn,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Aero Snap is a new feature in Windows 7 wherein the windows will automatically arrange (dock) when moved to the edge of the screen. When you drag a window to the left side
 of the screen, it will automatically dock to the left side of the screen taking half of the screen space. The same goes for the right side. When dragged to the top of the screen, the window maximizes.</span></p>
<p><span>You may disable Aero Snap ability to auto arrange or auto maximize window when dragging.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on Ease of Access link or Ease of Access Center icon.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Change how your mouse works or Make the mouse easier to use option.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Tick the check box for Prevent Windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen with the mouse under “Make
 it easier to manage windows” section. </span></p>
<p><span>5. Click OK or Apply to make the change effective.</span></p>
<p><span>Once Aero Snap is disabled, the window won’t be automatically maximized and arranged when window is dragged to the edge of the screen, including
 both top and sides of the screen.<strong><span> </span></strong></span></p>

    <title>Pinned Shortcuts on the Explorer icon on the Taskbar disappear... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aj. cole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pinned Shortcuts on the Explorer icon on the Taskbar disappear...</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
As you know, we are able to drag 'n drop folders/files, etc. onto the Explorer icon that is on the Taskbar and then right-click on the Explorer Taskbar icon to see those shortcuts. Recently they started disappearing randomly forcing me to copy them back. After
 some 5 or 6 times I decided to make a folder on my desktop containing these shortcut links so that I could quickly just drag 'n drop them back on the Explorer Taskbar icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, today when they disappeared I can only copy 4 links and then nothing else can be placed in the Pinned section. Additionally, only 4 Frequent shortcuts will appear as well. No new software has been installed except for the Windows Update files installed
 on June 10th. To make note, this was happening a couple of days before the WU files were installed, so I don't believe any of the updates did this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have tried rebooting and shutting down to see if this would clear an error in the Explorer, but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to ask if there is a registry entry that I can manually check and/or change that will allow the pinned icon shortcuts to be set so I can start using them again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Cole</p>

            <p>Hello Aj. Cole,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I&nbsp;can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I need some more information to narrow
 down the issue and provide you better assistance.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you remember the KB number of the update which you installed on June 10th&nbsp;prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Is the issue specific to some application/program or with all application/program pinned to the taskbar?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>As per the issue description icons pinned to the taskbar is disappearing from taskbar randomly. The situation is becoming worst day to day. The reason behind the issue
 may be any virus/malware or if some system files get corrupted. There might be a chance that some start items/third party services/application may also cause the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Boot the computer in <strong><span>safe mode with networking.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode with networking and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong><span>clean boot</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>If issue still persist, I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run security software and check if your system is affected by some viruses.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner </strong>is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p><span>... Please note that I posted this a week ago yet it isn't appearing in this thread. Additionally, I replied via email containing all the information you had asked for in your suggestions, and unfortunately it looks like you didn't get that either.
 I'm still, as of this moment, having the issue where only 4 Pinned Shortcut Links can be placed in the Explorer Taskbar Icon. Please let me know how I can send you the data from my tests for review.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>.... The below is from June 13th, 2015&nbsp;....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for your quick and attentive response to my frustrating issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sadly, I performed all 3 of your suggestions below obtaining the same results, even in Safe Mode. &nbsp;Attached are screenshots and logfiles showing all the information from the 3 steps suggested below and a Zipfile that contains all crashlogs and system
 information / configurations.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I moved from America in 2002 I was a Sr. Computer Engineer and had worked with every version of Windows up to 2000, including the Server versions. Since then I’ve continued my love as a hobby and have kept up with all subsequent versions except
 the server versions. I am familiar and experienced with reading and modifying the registry, and would like to know where the Key to the Pinned Shortcut lnk entry is located in the registry. Maybe I can look at this key and see what is causing it to accept
 only 4 links whereas prior to the past 24 hours I could put up to 12. Will you supply me with this information for the registry key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, I remember that about 3 days ago I did install Epson ME-301 Network software that would allow me to print to the Epson via Wi-Fi using all of my Android mobile devices. However, the problem of the Pinned shortcut links on the Explorer
 icon located on the Taskbar randonly disappearing was happening prior to this software being installed for the printer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In conclusion, is there further information you would like from me for us to continue researching the cause of this problem?</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10. Working fine then all of a sudden screen goes black</h2>
                    <p>Ok I upgraded my PC to Windows 10 and all was working well. Then for some reason over the last week or so It has started to crash intermittently. The&nbsp;Nvidia 720 card just stops the screen goes black and the PC continues to run. The only message I get is
 the monitor saying there is no display output. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing the Nvidia drivers. Checking the power save settings and making sure it isn't powering the card down. I checked the Bios settings and all looks fine. It seems to crash
 more if I open Edge&nbsp;or try and go on youtube videos or Netflix. Any Idea as this is driving me insane. I cant get it to run for longer than about 15 mins before it crashes out&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best </p>

            <span>Hi Chris,
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.　</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to b</span></span><span><span>oot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and perform the Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart
</strong>at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Select <strong>T</strong></span><strong><span><span>roubleshoot </span>
</span></strong><span><span>and click on </span></span><strong><span><span>Advanced Options</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>2. Select </span></span><strong><span><span>Startup Settings </span>
</span></strong><span><span>and click on </span></span><strong><span><span>Restart</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>3. After restarting, choose </span></span><strong><span><span>Enable Safe mode</span></span><span><span>with networking</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong></p>
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After Clean Boot troubleshooting step, refer to "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with Clean Boot</strong>" from the article.</p>

            Tried that tonight, No joy. Even uninstalled all programs except for Microsoft ones. Then uninstalled the sound card and graphics card drivers. Rebooted and let windows select the relevant drivers. It ran for about 10 mins. As soon as I opened a video
 in YouTube and let it run the screen went black and nothing :(&nbsp; I'm thinking of formatting ang installing windows 8 again

            OK Finally after a lot of messing around I have found out what was causing it and found a work around. Windows 10 is not stable in 64 bit pro when using an external USB CM6206-LX 5.1 sound card. The sound card drive and software cause interference with
 the operating system and crash the graphics. The work around I found online advised to download the driver software for the Trust 510EX USB sound card&nbsp;and install that. Even though its another manufacturer I tried that and the 5.1 sound works fine and Windows
 has remained stable without dropping the graphics card at all. :) RESULT

                    Hallo,
<div>leider funktionieren meine TV-Karten nicht unter Windows 8. Die Antwort auf meine Frage beim Support von Technisat war, dass eine Unterstützung von Windows 8 nicht geplant sei (was wohl keine wohlüberlegte Antwort war - vermute ich).</div>
<div>Nun, den Treiber von Win 7 akzeptieren meine TV-Karten nicht. Nun, vielleicht liest es hier ein Betroffener und postet es ebenso mal der Fa. Technisat. Vielleicht passiert doch ein Wunder? Hat Microsoft eine Lösung?</div>

It's very difficult to help you when you provide so little information. Please be much more specific about your problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What e-mail program are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What are the symptoms of the problem?&nbsp; Tell us what "what has happened to it" means. Exactly how are you trying to use it? What happens when you try? If you get an error message, please quote it verbatim.</p>
