<h2>            Unable to install 16203 Update from Xbox Live or from USB. Error code 8007-0070.</h2>
                    
<p>I have gone through every step on this page "http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/system-updates/system-update-help" and still have no luck getting this update to install. At first i assumed it was my internet connection but since i get the same error
 code (8007-0070) when using a flash drive i really don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Any help would be extremely appreciated as i can't use my xbox live gold subscription which i have paid Â£35 for at the moment.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Hello Adriano,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you have questions with gamming on full screen and monitor display on Windows 10. We will certainly assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game resolution depends on the game. Different game have different requirements. You can check with the game requirements and proceed accordingly. For playing high resolution games you will need proper graphic cards and updated drivers. Playing high
 resolution game in lower resolution may cause problem with the game and the game may not work smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>It's safe to use standard low resolutions such as 1680x1050, or lower on a monitor with a native 1920x1080 res.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage is the image is not as sharp (not dramatically ) on an LCD monitor when not using
</p>
<p>the native res compared to using a lower res on the old CRT monitors.</p>
<p>Anything that is shown on the Display &gt; Resolution tab, or in games graphics setup would be a standard resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- A small drop in res such as this may yield a few extra fps, but lowering or disabling Anti-aliasing
</p>
<p>(a higher res is similar to using 2XAA for reducing jagged edges ), or PhysX may be more productive,</p>
<p>followed by texture settings and draw distance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Using a 'custom' resolution may damage the monitor, but it is more likely to be rejected and</p>
<p>cause an 'out of range' or similar error message in conjunction with a black screen.</p>
<p>The exception here is if your are using Nvidia's DSR, or the AMD equivalent, to attain a higher than native res</p>
<p>as this is done at driver level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Note the comment ...</p>
<p><em>"Playing high resolution game in lower resolution may cause problem with the game and the
</em></p>
<p><em>game may not work smoothly."</em></p>
<p>is misinformed. The game may not look as good if you use a very low res, but that's the only issue.</p>
<p>- It is also safe to change the monitors resolution (vs using the in game settings), but not it's necessary</p>
<p>with games.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After I upgrade window 10, I found a lot of pre-set or default settings with my keyboard which not exist in before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>When I touch and hold the "Shift" key for a while, the language&nbsp;change from English to Chinese&nbsp;automatically. Please advise how I can ignore this pre-set or default setting. It make me a lot inconvenience during typing.</p>

<h2>            Libraries icon shows on desktop. I cannot delete it.</h2>
                    I did a clean install on my computer and all looked fine. I then used the migration tool and moved my old Vista settings to Win7. Upon doing this, I now have a "Libraries" icon on my desktop. I cannot delete it. Right-click does not give me the option
 to delete. I do not have this problem on my other computer, where I used an update version of Win7 and did not use the migration tool.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how I can delete the Libraries icon? It is only screen clutter to me.

It's a namespace icon, and can be deleted by editing the registry. See the response here by Wilson Jia&nbsp;of Microsoft.<br />

<h2>            Getting almost constantly disconneted from Halo 5 now</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the last update in Halo 5 (Monitors Bounty) I have been getting disconnected almost constantly from matches. Here is a video of what keeps happening http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Dead%20End%2024/video/25796626</p>
<p>This has been getting worst and worst since the monitors bounty update&nbsp;to the point where this is happening almost every match. Before that update, I never got disconnected and I've been playing halo 5 since day 1. Nothing has changed with my router or internet either. This is becoming a joke 343I/Microsoft, please fix!</p>

 </p></blockquote><p /><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for the information and&nbsp;my apologies, I did see that you only saw the issue when wired,&nbsp;I just mistyped that. It looks like this is a 3G/4G LTE connected device to obtain an internet connection in that correct? To clarify, is <a href="http://www.ztedevices.ca/products/mf28b-wifi-hub.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a> your device?&nbsp;&nbsp;From the video it appears that the error states "You've been disconnected from your local network"&nbsp;which would indicate a local connection issue and not a server side error.&nbsp;So my hunch on this one right now might be that the specific Ethernet port on the ZTE might be having a problem.</p><p><br /></p><p>Have you tried swapping Ethernet cables and Ethernet ports on the device yet? Or tried to use another device to play to see if the same issue happenes? I know you mentioned that the issue doesn't happen in other games and based on the 0% Packet Loss I don't believe that you should see a

<p>I have gone threw all those steps (more then once)&nbsp;and still have the same issues. I should have said in my original post that I am NOT being disconnected from Xbox live and I'm only being disconnected from the Halo 5 servers (as seen in my video I posted above) Any other game works fine when I'm wired and I don't get disconnects. Since the&nbsp;Monitors Bounty update in Halo 5 the only thing that has changed on my end is I now have an Xbox one S.
</p>
<p>Oddly enough, in my tinkering, I&nbsp;haven't been disconnected from Halo 5 dedicated server when I'm WIRELESS, which makes no sense at all (so far I've played about 30 games wireless and no disconnects) I have tried being hardwired during my tests with Halo 5&nbsp;and everytime I get disconnected.&nbsp;I know my Ethernet port on my Xbox One S is fine because as I stated, any other game works fine. It's nice I can play, but wireless connection isn't a good and I notice a difference, but for now it's better then nothing. Maybe there are issues with Xbox One S's and Halo 5 dedicated server issues when hardwire. Only thing I can think of...

            Hi CarlynStorms
<br />
<br />The clipboard in Windows is just a part of your RAM (system memory) that is set aside temporarily to store data
<br />
<br />When you copy something, like say text or a file, it is put into that RAM location
<br />
<br />Then when you paste that object, it is moved from RAM to the destination location

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>My father in law is having some issues with some word documents, and photos on his windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>He is pretty sure the problem occurred after the latest windows 10 update, but is not certain.</p>
<p>As an example, he typed up a word document, saved it, emailed it and all was fine. &nbsp;The next day he check it and instead of the word document been present in the folder it was replaced with multiple files such as :</p>
<p>a js file: 65698178</p>
<p>a LOADED_0 File named :cb=gapi(1).loaded_0</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>This has happened to some of his photo folders as well.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Aimee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which is the recently installed update?</span></li><li><span>Did you check for the virus/malware on the PC?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may face the above issue if any virus/malware is present on the computer. Virus/malware may occur due to downloading or installing programs/applications on the computer from the browsers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>Scan your PC for the presence of virus/malware by running the anti-virus security software. Run the anti-virus software twice to detect and confirm the presence of malware/virus on your PC.
 Check for the status of the scan to view the presence of virus/malware.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>If the anti-virus software does not detect any virus/malware activities,
</span><span>run <strong>
System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check for the status of the computer behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Maintenance</span></strong><span> troubleshooter will find and clean up unused files and shortcuts present on the system
 and perform maintenance tasks which will enhance the performance of the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>View all </strong>from the left side panel of the window.</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> from the listed options,<span> c</span>lick on
<strong>Advanced </strong>option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>
<span>option.</span></span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the troubleshooting is completed, check the status for any missing system components on the computer.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;is resolved&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:
</span></strong><span>If the issue persists, run
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> on the PC by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an
<strong>Administrator command prompt </strong>window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Click on
<strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></li><li><span>Check if it says
<strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>

<h2>            Where will all my stuff go after I install Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I currently have Windows 8.1 running on my laptop. I have 3 drives - C, D, &amp; F. C is the local drive where we all save stuff like app or some programs and photos and videos. D is my "Recovery" drive. and I have some folders stored on my F drive. So can
 anyone tell me which of this data may get lost while I install (Upgrade) to Windows 10 so that I can backup only that data which may get lost.

            <p><strong>Will upgrading to Windows 10 affect other drives or partitions in my computer?</strong></p>
<p>No, only the drive where the upgrade is initiated from will be affected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

<h2>            Do I need .NET 3.5 to run .NET 4&#63;</h2>
                    As far as I am aware, .NET 3.5.1 is installed with Windows 7. I am running on a pretty space constrained computer and with the new iteration of .NET Framework coming out, I was wondering whether I could uninstall .NET 3.5 using the add/remove windows features
 tool and still be able to use .NET 4.0 and any applications I have already installed that run .NET (Silverlight runtime, Microsoft Student/Encarta).

            .net 4 is independent from former .net frameworks. You must have .net 3.5 installed if an app want's it.

<p>Hi kakogohrena,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>OpenSSH is not supported in Windows 7. I suggest you to install openSSH in XP compatibility mode and check if it works. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the installation file and select properties.</p>
<p>2. Now click on the compatibility tab.</p>
<p>3. Under compatibility mode, check âRun this program in compatibility mode forâ.</p>
<p>4. From the drop down menu, select Windows XP.</p>
<p>5. Click Apply and then click OK.</p>
<p>Refer this link for more information:</p>

<p>Also, you can try to install openSSH in Windows XP mode.</p>
<p>The new Windows XP Mode lets you run older Windows XP business software right on your Windows 7 desktop.</p>

<p>Run the installation file as an âAdministratorâ and check if it helps.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand the inconvenience caused to you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please be assured that I will do my best to help you fix the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This behavior can occur if the signal from the video adapter exceeds the scan range of the new monitor. The video adapter setting for updating the screen (the refresh rate) is incompatible with the monitor.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would have you change the monitor settings and see if it fixes the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here are the steps: </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Press
</span><span><strong>Windows + X</strong></span><span><strong>keys</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Click on
</span><span><strong>Control panel</strong></span><span>, click on </span><span><strong>Display</strong></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Click on
</span><span><strong>Adjust resolution</strong></span><span> on the right hand side.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Click on
</span><span><strong>Advanced settings</strong></span><span>, click on </span><span><strong>Monitor</strong></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Under <strong>
Monitor </strong>settings, make sure the </span><span><strong>screen refresh rate</strong></span><span> is set to
</span><span><strong>60 Hertz or high</strong></span><span>. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, reset the display settings of the Xbox 360 console to the default settings and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p><span>1. Remove any discs from the disc tray. </span></p>
<p><span>2. Turn the console off. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Turn the console on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span>If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn the console on by using the Xbox
<strong>Guide</strong> button on the controller. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller is the controller where the upper-left quadrant light is on.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p><span>4. As the console starts, press and hold the <strong>Y</strong> button, and then pull the right trigger at the same time. This causes the Xbox Dashboard to reset the display settings to the default settings and then automatically restarts the console.
 So it's OK when the Xbox 360 console restarts. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us posted on the status of the issue. We will be glad to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you. </span></span></p>

<h2>            Is it safe to uninstall the pre-installed applications on my Acer computer&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Original Title: &lt;<em>219 VIEWS; NO ANSWER!&gt;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 219 - 219! - VIEWERS of this message I posted back in December last year. &nbsp;Could some kind-hearted person please help!</p>
<p>I already have Windows Media Player; therefore, shouldn't I uninstall the pre-installed Acer Arcade Deluxe (Cyberlink Corp.) from Programs &amp; Features? &nbsp;I don't use this laptop's DVD player, except in order to (very rarely) play a DVD movie (which I most
 often use a separate VCR/DVD combo for that); hence couldn't I also uninstall NTI CD&amp;DVD Maker (New Tech Info Systems)?</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The following programs/features, too, were pre-installed on this Windows Vista laptop, which is about three years old (close to 50 GB is free out of 70 GB, and I've used the notebook for less than 250 hours):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Acer eAudio Management (HITRUST Inc.)</div>
<div>Acer empowering Technology</div>
<div>AcerNet Management</div>
<div>Acer ePresentation</div>
<div>Acer eSettings Management</div>
<div>Acer GridVista</div>
<div>Acer Mobility Center Plug-In</div>
<div>HD Audio Soft Data Fax Modem with Smart CP (Please note that I don't use this PC for faxing)</div>
<div>Launch Manager</div>
<div>Power Producer</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please let me know if there's any program from the above list that I should keep, as I'm considering uninstalling virtually every one of them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much.</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
You can uninstall the applications that you do not need. But some pre-installed applications may need to function on the computer, for it to work the way the computer manufacturer intended it to.
<br />
</p>
<p>It is best you contact Acer and check if it is safe to uninstall the mentioned applications.<br />

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">So picked up the game through games with gold, I already owned all the DLC previously, so I attempted to download them from the store, but they were not listed as free. I risked buying one, and it did
 not charge me the price and the download went well, so I thought it was just a small bug. However, none of the dlc show as downloaded in the game itself, and uninstalling them does not prompt them to return to the ready to install section of the game. I could
 really use some help here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Edit: Downloading the free souls pack from the microsoft website, a dlc i hadnt had before, DOES prompt it to show up in the ready to install section. Doing the same for previously owned DLC does not.
 Please help!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Edit 2: Trying to push the download of the dlc using the xbox app results in the error: "you need to install the game or app for this"</span></p>

            They appear nowhere except in the store for purchase. Not re-download, purchase. It says I have to buy them again, even though I've already "bought" them twice. Also, I've edited my post with an additional result from an experiment I tried.&nbsp;

<p>Hey King thanks for keeping in touch!&nbsp;</p>

the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults">

 I had to go into the game hub and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/view-downloadable-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download</a> it from there,</p>

            Apologies if it wasn't clear in my post somehow, but they are not in the ready to install section of the game itself, or the games and apps menu. They don't even show as free in the xbox store, only on the microsoft website, despite me owning them. I've
 even tried pushing the download from the xbox app on my laptop (where they show as owned), as soon as I do my xbox says&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">âyou need to install
 the game or app for thisâ</span>

            What is it with you microsoft agent guys, do you all run off as soon as you post you response, thinking it's the right answer? News flash: it wasn't, and I'm still getting screwed out of DLC I paid for.&nbsp;

<p>Hey there Chaosking243!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry you're dealing with this issue trying to get your DLC to work for that game on the One.&nbsp;It could be that this DLC is not backwards compatible, as is the case with some games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they do download and seem to install, maybe try to launch the game and when you're in the 360 emulator press the<strong> select
</strong>and <strong>menu</strong> buttons go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>
Storage</strong>, delete your profile and then redownload it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest giving our support pages entitled <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-playing-xbox-360-games-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>I installed windows 10 when is released and I noticed that it's been taking a long time to save/download items from google chrome, some tabs take for ever to load too. When I run an .exe file it takes
 forever to load and than gives me an error saying "the service did not respond in a timely fashion". Also when I try to open task manager and it rarely opens. When I press "Turn windows features on or off" in program features, it gives me the same error. What
 is happening?</p>

            <p>The first program that I noticed with this issue was Google Chrome. Then, when I tried to open my Task Manager, nothing happened. I cannot uninstall Google Chrome, I cannot access the majority of my System and Security tools including the System Reset/Restore
 options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also followed your directions and when I tried to run the maintenance task I experienced the same results that the other forum users have posted.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I ran a system scan with Norton 360 - it only picked up on tracking cookies. Also, this issue is only on my PC not on my laptop which also has the Windows 10 OS installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It seems as if the latest set of updates have solved the issue on my end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE #2:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Had this issue AGAIN. Every 48 hours or so, the chrome browser won't open, the task manager won't open, all the aforementioned issues. The only thing that seems to help is restarting my PC.</p>
