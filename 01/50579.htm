<h2>            Toshiba Satellite A665 - &#34;known&#34; bluetooth stack incompatibility with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Toshiba Satellite A665 laptop tells me that there is a "known" incompatibility between the "bluetooth stack" and Windows 7 - my operating system.&nbsp; Okay, so what does that mean?&nbsp; I can't connect my HTC Freestyle phone with the computer (they don't recognize
 each other) to transfer my photos from the phone to the computer.&nbsp; But what can I do about it?&nbsp; I've checked the Windows, Toshiba and HTC websites but find no hints about how to fix this.&nbsp; Can anyone guide me?</p>

            <p>Hi Lewisma,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Disconnect all Bluetooth devices from your computer by switching them off or unplugging them from your PC.<br />
b) Click "Start," followed by "Control Panel" and "Add/Remove Program." Locate "Bluetooth Stack for Windows by Toshiba," click on the "Remove" button and click "Yes" to confirm.<br />
c) Access the Control Panel again and click on "System (Performance &amp; Maintenance)." Select the "Hardware" tab and click on "Device Manager." Click on the "+" sign next to "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" to expand it. If "Motion Computing USB Bluetooth Adapter"
 is on the list, right-click on it and select "Uninstall."<br />
d) Click on "Start" and "Run." Type "%windir%\inf" into the "Open" box and click "OK." Check if either file "bth.bak" or "bth.inf.old" exists. If neither of them is listed, continue to Step 5. If one of these files does exist, right-click on it, select "Rename"
 and rename it to "bth.inf."<br />
e) Restart your computer and the Microsoft Bluetooth driver will load by default. Look for the Bluetooth icon in your task bar. If you can't see it, click on "Start" and then "Run." Type "bthprops.cpl" in the "Open" box and click "OK" to bring up the Bluetooth
 Devices window and select the options for your Bluetooth device.<br />

            <p>Thank you, but:&nbsp;there are ERRORS IN YOUR REPLY.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(1) There is no "Add/Remove Program" under "Control Panel" in Windows 7.&nbsp; However, I looked around, and found that I could "Uninstall" the Bluetooth Stack under "Programs and Features" instead.</p>
<p>(2) There is no "System (Performance &amp; Maintenance)" under "Control Panel", and I cannot find anywhere else to accomplish "c)" in your reply.</p>
<p>Would you kindly send me another response with instructions appropriate for Windows 7?&nbsp; I will appreciate it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help, but unfortunately, it didn't work.&nbsp; I uninstalled the USB controllers, and then reinstalled them, as you instructed.&nbsp; Then I restarted my computer.&nbsp; But my computer still will not recognize my ATT/HTC phone.&nbsp; That is, the connection
 cord allows me to recharge the battery, but nothing else.&nbsp; There is no 2-tone sound that I get whenever I connect external hardware.&nbsp; Also, when I look in Microsoft Explorer (the computer's index), I don't see the phone listed as a connected device.</p>
<p>I tried 2 ways to connect the phone.&nbsp; When I first connect it with the cord, it gives me a menu with these 3 options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Charge only - charge phone over USB</p>
<p>2. HTC sync - sync contacts and calendar</p>
<p>3. Disk drive - mount as disk drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried your instructions with both #2 and #3, and neither worked.&nbsp; (Please tell me, which is the correct mode for what I'm trying to do?&nbsp; Thank you.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you advise me to do next?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

    <title>DVD drive not found Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sissieking  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD drive not found Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; I just upgraded to Windows 10 last weekend.&nbsp; I thought everything was fine.&nbsp; I put a CD in my DVD drive and not much happened.&nbsp; A troubleshooter came up and said I needed to restart my computer.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; After it restarted, my desktop was back to its
 Windows 7 appearance and the taskbar looked like it had in Windows 7.&nbsp; Neither were the way I had set them up when I configured Windows 10.&nbsp; My ease of use/accessibility settings were also gone.</p>
<p>The big issue is however that my two DVD drives are still missing.&nbsp; They are not listed in fine manager nor are they to be found anywhere in device manager.&nbsp; Both file manager and device manager list a floppy drive which I do not have.&nbsp; My 3 hard drives
 are C, D, and E and my card reader is Hi, I, J and K as they were called in Windows 7.&nbsp; My DVDs should be F and G, which interestingly enough were skipped in the lettering so it seems the computer knows they are there, but I can't find them and nothing happens
 other that the drive spins when I put a disk in them.</p>
<p>I've downloaded new drivers for the DVD drives, hoping that is the issue, however if I can't find the devices in device manager, I don't know how to load the drivers.</p>
<p>My drives are both Samsung SH-S223Q</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Jon,
<br />
<br />Your best option is to uninstall the printer and accompanying software, then reinstall both the print driver and the printer software
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Uninstall any Epson software associated with your Printer
<br />Go to Control Panel - Devices and Printers
<br />Right click your Epson Stylus Photo RX580 and choose Uninstall
<br />When asked do you want to remove the device driver files, choose yes
<br />
<br />Download the latest software for your printer from the link below
<br />
<br /><a href="https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/Epson-Stylus-Series/Epson-Stylus-Photo-RX580/s/SPT_C11C663011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://epson.com/Support/Printers/All-In-Ones/...</a>
<br />
<br />Unplug your printer
<br />
<br />Start the software installation, when asked to, plug your printer into your PC so the installation sees your printer
<br />
<br />Complete the software installation
<br />
<br />Print out a Test Sheet . . .

            Hello, 
<br />Try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.

<h2>            Paid past due balance but still can&#39;t use Xbox Live Services</h2>
                    I turned on my Xbox today to find my Xbox Live subscription had expired. After looking into this I saw I had around £12 past due(£14.99 in total including Vat or something) and so I went on to pay this amount. Since then the money has been taken out of
 the bank but I am still unable to play online or accept party invites. I have tried reseting the console several times over several hours but still nothing.

<h2>            Back up 2 computers onto one external hard drive using Windows 10 Backup.</h2>
                    <p>I want to back up my laptop and my PC onto the one hard drive. Is there a way to do this while keeping the backups clearly segregated?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I imagine you can manually move the FileHistory and WindowsImageBackup files into a separate folder, but am wary that I could make a mistake or confuse things. Is it possible to change the location of where the backup files are stored automatically? And
 if not, is it ok to manually move them?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi GKMoss.&nbsp; Unless your operating system is massively corrupted (in which case it's unlikely that it would boot), my pick would be an overzealous and buggy registry cleaner.<br />

<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>Microsoft even used to provide a registry cleaner long ago but it caused more problems than it fixed so it was discontinued.</p>
<p>I wouldn't trust them. There is just too many changes to the registry for them to accurately track it all.</p>
<p>Reinstall from backup or recent restore point would be better.</p>

<p>No clue of what the errors were.</p>
<p>What stated this whole mess was My antivirus was having problems starting which is norton 360 up todate and it came up with there 1 click support box and a live tech from norton took control of my computer to see what was going on. They remove the norton
 than couldn't reinstall it! So they started to run a registry ck after they remove all of norton from program files and the reg. They installed a program called gear drivers, and then rebooted my computer. From there its been nothing but down hill from there
 now I getting error messages from windows7</p>
<p>String error Product_name not found and microsoft visual c++ not loading.</p>
<p>Since than I have been able to restore computer back to an earlier date after 6 failed trys. Which took over 3.5hrs to restore which I know is too long for windows. Computer is running like a snail now and I thick I am going to Have to reformatt HD.</p>

            Hi GKMoss.&nbsp; Unfortunately yes,&nbsp; I agree that a clean install of Windows 7 is the most viable solution.&nbsp; To prevent further problems of this nature, I recommend that you do not reinstall Registry Booster.&nbsp; There is every likelihood that it contributed to
 the situation.

            How odd.&nbsp; AVkiller is not new malware, it's been around for a few years now.&nbsp; I would have thought that Norton would provide protection from it.<br />
<br />
Still, it's good to start afresh sometimes and you are very welcome for my input GKMoss.<br />

<div>Firstly type the following two commands (each on one line) to test that the </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reg query "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>AppData REG_EXPAND_SZ %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming</div>

<div>Try this. It is a possible workaround rather than a fix. Click Start menu - </div>
<div>Right click Computer (on the right hand side)- choose Properties - click </div>
<div>Advanced System Settings in the left hand pane - Advanced tab - click </div>
<div>Environment Variables button - under User Variables for &lt;your name&gt; click </div>

<h2>            Windows 10 error code 0x80070008 - 0x90002.after download</h2>
                    <p>I was (and still am) on Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit when this happened. I used the manual upgrade software available here -&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-10-upgrade (under button "Upgrade")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially ran the software and it completed successfully all the way till this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d790732-f567-4924-8a1a-58cc772d9b48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d790732-f567-4924-8a1a-58cc772d9b48" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But this process had taken the whole day so I decided to do the install tomorrow and hence I closed this window and shut down my PC. The next day I ran this tool again and to my horror realized it had started another download from the beginning! I searched
 online for how to recover past downloads of windows 10 without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I let this download complete but this time, as ill luck would have it, as soon as the download completed at 100%, I got an error with an error code of 0x80070008 - 0x90002. I have searched online but no one else seems to have got this error, and there
 is no information available on what this error means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please guide me about what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I have listed this topic under "Upgrade reservation" as there is no other similar topic available. Please note that I had done a manual upgrade using that software and I had NOT used the update notification that occurs in the system tray.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>1. What is the make and model of the system?</span></p>

            <p>Hello, thank you for your reply! But it seems like you missed some of what I said because:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have already included the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">make and model of my system" - Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. As you would have read, I performed this download twice. It worked perfectly in the first try and then errored in the second try. Why? I didn't disable any anti-virus, nor updated my drivers, in the
 first download as well, but yet it had worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Also, you didn't explain what the error code ("</span>0x80070008 - 0x90002" -<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;that I got in the second try) means.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also explain these queries. T<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">hank you for your support!</span></p>

<h2>            broadcom wi-fi error after Jan16 win10 updates</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left">after yesterday's (12.Jan.2016) Windows 10 Version 1511 updates, as soon as I boot my pc I have the following message from notification center

<p>translated <strong>in english </strong>is : <em>"it is not possible to execute this App on this PC. Broadcom 802.11 network adapter wireless network controller doesn't work with this windows version</em>".</p>
<p>I have a broadcom bcm 43142 and to be honest, wifi works (bcm43142 is not the best, but works as usual), bluetooth connection (mouse, file transfer, louspeaker) are ok, and I do not see any event in the event reg or in ctr paanel associated to this failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this happened with no doubt after Jan.16 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestion?</p>
<p>thx, fabio</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply</p>
<p>my PC is updated and the link you suggested is related to a problem that do not apply to my situation.</p>
<p>my connections (wi-fi &amp; bt) are working as usual, so honestly I dont believe I have a real problem, but a problem is highlighted&nbsp; by notification center.</p>
<p>I tried in any case the troubleshooter that didn't show problems.</p>
<p>so, everything is ok but I have a problem notified, that's all.</p>
<p>I can live with that, but something happened as result of latest updates.</p>
<p>ciao, fabio</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've got typically the same problem reported by fabioITALY with my HP Probook laptop running Win 10 Ver 1511 with latest Jan updates;</p>
<ul>
<li>Same notification "This app can't run on this PC. Broadcom 802.11 network adapter wireless network controller doesn't work on this version of Windows".</li><li>Nevertheless, my connectivity is working well without any problem!</li><li>I've run all the stated checks sfc ( no violations), dism (successfully) and done several rebooting but the same notification keeps reappearing.</li></ul>
<p>Anyhow, my connection is fine but the persistent notification is very annoying.</p>

            I have been experiencing same exact issue or message regarding Broadcom 802.11 and I have a Sony Vaio. I am connecting fine to my wireless router but like what everybody says, the message on the notification area is very annoying and not quite sure if
 this is really legit message. I followed and did the steps on sfc scan. And previously udapdated the network adapter driver. But message on notification still comes out. Please help. I've had Windows PC for a long time now and my sons are telling me to get
 Apple PC and i wont have any issues like these. Please help.<br />

            <p>I think I found a solution, o,r if not solved, in any case I removed the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I marked as 'disabled' the Broadcom wireless ... in the start panel ( see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ef62d84-3e35-422c-8f40-f67432ea4159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ef62d84-3e35-422c-8f40-f67432ea4159" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>then restart the computer and no more error messages occour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, wi-fi and btooth are stll working as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the 'disable at start' instead of uninstalling broadcom applications</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16f78d53-ac5a-42c7-9e90-a7f5eb7ad350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16f78d53-ac5a-42c7-9e90-a7f5eb7ad350" /></a></p>
<p>because, in case of problems, disable is easier to revert back, just marking as 'enable'</p>

<h2>            pinch zoom and windows 10 resets to work on every startup</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem which seems to be endemic if the internet is to be searched, I do not want pinch zoom working it causes total problems to me in constantly zooming and pinching with no input from&nbsp;me what so ever only moving a finger on this touch pad will&nbsp;set
 it off, I have tried all so called remedies other than going to the registry for which I do not have the confidence, the problem is no matter how many times you go to the mouse touchpad setting and click to clear the box as required to disable pinch zoom on
 the next start up of the laptop it is reset to work again, my workaround at the moment is to have a shortcut to the pad on the desktop to switch it off. not what you want on a new system is it !!!!</p>
<p>any other way to get rid please.</p>

<p>sadly this made no difference at all, this is something Microsoft needs to look at as I said on the internet I see some one&nbsp;worked round it by adjusting the registry&nbsp; but that's not a cure, it means there is something going on &nbsp;in the update from 8.1 that&nbsp;
 has 10 thinking it has to keep installing this touchpad back to pinch zoom on every start-up&nbsp; and you have to keep disabling it, why cant it be set up in the registry to work the other way round in that you have the ability to turn it on if you want it to&nbsp;
 pinch zoom, just a thought for a silver surfer. all the best</p>

            I have now deleted the synaptics touch pad updated the system automatic update to&nbsp; not install touch pad software which you can do with a tool from Microsoft and I am now using the standard touch pad mouse, so no more pinch zoom or any other un required
 movements just simple laptop use,&nbsp; may reinstall when Microsoft get it working ut at the moment just happy to have found a work around that works.&nbsp;

            After having the same problem, &nbsp;I have now got this sorted out. &nbsp;Windows 10 installation does not install the correct driver for the touch pad. &nbsp;After downloading and installing the specific windows 10 driver from the Synaptic website, &nbsp;the issue has been
 solved completely&nbsp;

            yes on the internet did fine something similar in the end, which also required deleting touch pad from laptop completely then downloading the 8.1 driver,&nbsp;turning off windows update on just the 10 &nbsp;touch pad driver, then installing the 8.1 driver,&nbsp;&nbsp;now
 works a treat in not reinstalling the&nbsp;I0 driver&nbsp; at every start-up.

            <p>Hello Microsoft, (that's if anyone is actually monitoring this thread).</p>
<p>I am tired of being nagged to upgrade to Win 10 for free.&nbsp; The point being made here on this thread is that people like me who know very little about the innards of our computers and don't want to learn, expect that when there is an upgrade or a change that
 the people paid to do it will make sure it works properly.&nbsp; It should not be up to us to have to spend *our* time learning how to do fixes for a product that ought not need them.</p>
<p>I installed 10 and uninstalled it because of this pinch and zoom problem, and from the other problems my friend has since she installed it, I can see that it is more trouble than it is worth.&nbsp; (She would uninstall it too, only she doesn't know how to).
</p>
<p>So hey, spare us the cheery blue ads popping up all over our screens.&nbsp; You let us know when you have got your act together, (maybe you could have a little pink screen to show that you've actually taken some notice of us) and in the meantime, we'll keep going
 with what we've got.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Encryption&#47;Decryption of Folders&#47;Files &#39;Certificate&#39;</h2>
                    I have encrypted a folder along with the files it contains in my desktop. I understand that it is possible that the 'certificate' might be corrupted or somehow unusable and that it is a good idea to provide a means to access these files in a scenario like
 that. As I am not a sophisticated user, I have tried Googling and other searches w/in MS to get a handle on how to have a 'plan B' w/o finding anything really user friendly. Can anybody help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting&nbsp;in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand the issue better, I suggest you to answer the below question.</p>
<ol>
<li>Were you able to Encrypt the data?</li><li>Did you get any error message?</li><li>What exact issue are you facing with Encryption and Decryption?</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first time you encrypt a folder or file, an encryption certificate is automatically created. You should back up your encryption certificate.
<strong>If your certificate and key are lost or damaged </strong>and you don't have a backup,
<strong>you won't be able to use the files that you have encrypted.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hello, Kyneton</span></p>
<p><span>If you are trying to dynamically be able to change the view so that genres are in a specific folder like the library, it is not possible without using the library.</span></p>
<p><span>If you just want to add the fields to the details list, try these steps in order once more:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the root of the drive containing your music (e.g. D:\).<br />
For each folder listed, right click it and choose Properties, go to the Customize tab, select Music then check the Also apply this template to all subfolders option and press OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Next open one of the folders and setup your folder view the way you want it. After its setup, go to Organize, Folder and search options, View, click Apply to Folders and then OK. Check if the other folders have
 the correct view or not.</span></p>
<p><span>If they don’t, try creating a new user account and go through the steps once more to see if it works correctly or not. If it does, you have a corrupt profile.</span></p>

    <title>DLNA media player 12 in Windows 10 semi broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tresmil  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLNA media player 12 in Windows 10 semi broken</h2>
                    <p>Is there a solution to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 7, windows media player correctly obeys file trees, star rating, and parental controls. Any restricted folders do not a pear in client DLNA devices. After windows 10 upgrade the media player now places all videos and folder into one massive video
 folder. While the parental controlled&nbsp; content is still not accessible to client devices, the parent folder titles now appear to all. That is, restricted devices can see they is folder that appear to be "blank". In windows 7, this folder marker simply does
 not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new behavior is not desireable. Apart from changing the entire file system and reorganizing, is there a way to return the logical windows 7 DLNA behavior, including the player's respect for the correct file tree organization system?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. While this appear to be an article dealing with DLNA windows 10 related issues, this does not answer my particular concern.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to make my DLNA work. Casting or pulling is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that media player 12 no longer handles the folder and file structure in the same way. In fact I would say it handles file structure incorrectly. Short of trying to reinstall the media player, I have explored all options. I have tries resetting
 the shared folders, but the consistent behavior is that media player places all videos into one artificial "video" folder in one simple flat hierarchy, instead of the separate file trees I have actually created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ex. I create a folder marked "documentary" and another marked "animation". I add these folders =individually to the library. It picks these up and makes the files in them available but under a single folder marked "videos". Therefore the organization of
 the files becomes jumbled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now If I restrict on folder to a set of clients- I don't want a pc to see the "animation" folder, in windows 7 this is not an issue. Once I restrict it, the restricted PC no longer sees the folder. In Windows 10, the folder remains visible, though the content
 inside that folder remains restricted. The message is no supported file avaialble. While this nearly gets the job done, clearly the Windows &amp; implementation is superior. Why show a file folder title that is not permitted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I mean by semi broken. The core DLNA work, if a bit slower than before. However Windows 10 is not handling the file structures the same and the permission appear a bit more random in application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming there is no settings fix, I hope microsoft will deal with the bug in a future patch.</p>

            I'm having the same issue as Niranjan. I thought it was an issue with my installation and was&nbsp; about to do a clean install. it seems I have tried all the same things as him and am greatly disappointed as media streaming as it is&nbsp;a very large part of my
 systems usage. I don't want to have to sift through files that do not contain videos but are on a drive I have added to video library. it also went through my mind to go back to windows 7 and have another look at this in 6 months time.

            <p>By way of update, I have not been able to resolve the file DLNA structure problem<br />
&nbsp;of media player in Windows 10. A partial workaround is flattening your file tree, but while this cleans up some mess it does not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only successful work around has been to use an alternate dlna player. I would rather not promote competitive products but it seems the only resolution until MS corrects the bug. "Serviio" has worked the best, as an alternative that let you create restricted
 folders correctly.</p>

            <p>I have endured the same issues for a few months now, I have external hard drives for Kids, Films and TV; these are accessed via DLNA using either Smart TVs or wireless media players.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an ideal situation to access all these video files easily from any room in the house; and now no matter what I do all files and folders are listed alphabetically starting with numbers, and displays every file there is, this takes an age to find what
 we want. So has rendered it useless, and we no longer use it; leaving me trawling through the internet to find a solution, this is the first I have found to mention the issue.</p>

<p>Hi smegsie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, windows has no native solution to this problem. Given the slow response after all these months I am not sure they are concerned with the DLNA bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have solved this two ways. For dedicated DLNA players, I use Serviio now, as the content file service. In its free form it does a good job with the file tree. It also has privacy settings if you want to create a rating system to stop kids watching content
 not suitable for their age. However the privacy setting is a premium feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For other windows machines/pc's I have found that the network sharing file system is the best way to go. Instead of accessing media from the player, share the file folders on the network. You can launch the videos from the network file tree there. I have
 not found a single DLNA player that works well in windows as a client, but this network file system in windows 10 works better than even the old WMP and old win 7 file system and you can use your preferred player to access any of the files. I prefer 3rd party
 player myself as they have better contrast, brightness and other extra features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps, as my "kluge" has pretty much brought by all my old functionality. There is still the odd format issue with file type but that is a whole other issue.</p>
<p>

                    Since the January updates for win 8.1 The task scheduler items under Microsoft Windows fail to start with the message Error Value 2147942403. Does anyone even have no clue as to what this message means? Microsoft tech support was of no help and apparently
 have no clue. The tasks show as being ready, but when I click run it says the task no longer exists and to refresh. when I refresh it shows the same task Scheduled and ready but it fails to run period. Every task scheduled in Task scheduler library under Microsoft
 Windows shows as attempted to start on schedule, but failed with this same error value 2147942403. I first noticed this when checking to see why System Restore points were not being created. However I can create restore points manually. Is there a way to fix
 this without refreshing my system? Will upgrading to Win 10 fix this? I began to notice all of this when the GWX desktop icon disappeared after I installed the January windows updates. I wanted to restore to before the Wi

            According to others with this error it seems to have something to do with Cannon Printers, which I do not use.&nbsp; If this is correct than this error apparently has nothing to do with my problem of the Task scheduler trying to start jobs and stops with the
 original error in question.&nbsp; Strange that in task scheduler in library the other tasks outside of Microsoft\Windows do work such as Norton and Auslogics, etc.

            <p>I tried running the DISM tool and it stopped at 20%.&nbsp; Checked the log and it made no sense to me.&nbsp; However, my problem was not with Win update, it with the Task Scheduler Library, Microsoft portion only.&nbsp; All of the tasks in this portion fail to run as scheduled
 with the error value 2147942403.&nbsp; Does anyone at Microsoft know what this value means?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp; after running the DISM tool the Window update check failed.&nbsp; I ran the troubleshooter and it started working again.&nbsp; Again, this problem started with the January Windows updates.&nbsp; There were 22 updates.&nbsp; Is there a chance that you might know of one
 of these updates that could cause this problem?&nbsp; There were no restore points that I could revert to on my system.&nbsp; I noticed that before I install the updates that the system does not automattically&nbsp; create a restore point,so I now have to manually create
 a restore point before installing the updates since then&nbsp; Also, when I ran the SFC scans the only thing that I said it could not fix something that had to do with Cannon printers.&nbsp; I use HP printers and so far no problems there.&nbsp; Once again If I update to
 Win 10 will it reinstall information to replace the current items that control Task Scheduler?&nbsp; The other items in Task scheduler Library such as Norton, Google, Auslogics Boost speed, work just fine.&nbsp; What in Microsoft tasks is wrong or corrupted.&nbsp; Microsoft
 needs a troubleshooter for Task Scheduler?&nbsp; Any more suggestions, Thanks! </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>

<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>

    <title>Unable to access Repair Your Computer option on Win 7 Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karly_001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access Repair Your Computer option on Win 7 Installation &#38; Repair Disc 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>I want to restore a system image from an external hard drive using the Win 7 64 bit&nbsp; Installation and Repair Disc I originally burnt when setting up my computer for the first time. In the past I was able to access the "Repair your computer" option on this
 disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This past week I restored my Asus laptop (model NV56M) to factory settings again and now when I click on the "Repair your computer" option I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This version of system recovery options is not compatible with the version of windows you are trying to repair. Try using a recovery disc that is compatible with this version of windows".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also created a system repair disc via the Control Panel/Backup and restore but when I try to boot it (press ESC to get the boot order menu and then select disc drive - as per the Win 7 Install disc above which does work) I get this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Non-system disk or disk error. Replace and press any key when ready".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please tell me either how to fix the original disc error (preferred) or how to access the repair disc on my asus laptop so that I can restore system images?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to repair the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This error may occur if you use the 32-bit version of the Windows installation disc to run the Complete PC Restore program on a computer that is running the 64-bit version of Windows. By default, the 64-bit operating system is selected in the list of installed

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You need to check that the version of operating system you have on computer is the same on the disc.</p>

            <p>Hi Anusha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due respect, your reply hasn't addressed the issue that I wish to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I do not wish to repair the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I clearly stated in both the subject line and post that I was using a 64 bit installation and repair disc and furthermore that I had been able to access the "Repair your computer" option on the repair disc previously -&nbsp; so the 32 bit versus 64
 bit compatibility issue is not relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is access the "Repair your computer" option to restore a <strong>
System Image </strong>from a previous backup. This is not due to any issues with the operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this clarifies further what it is that I am trying to achieve. Would you kindly reread my original post in light of this clarification and advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note - my Windows 7 was pre-installed by my manufacturer so I am unable to download the file from the Microsoft Website - the cd I have was burnt as an ISO via the digitalriver download that is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karly</p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately my Windows 7 operating system was pre-installed by my manufacturer so my product key is not accepted as valid by Microsoft and therefore I am unable to download the ISO to which you sent the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disc to which I referred in my original post was an ISO I was able to download via digitalriver - the link to which has been cancelled by Microsoft in December last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are now no ISO downloads that I know of for people that have OEM installed Windows on the internet, only for people that bought Windows 7 separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

                    <p>I&nbsp; organize my files using the "Date Modified" date and when some event happens, maybe the system updates ?&nbsp; It's as if I&nbsp; restored&nbsp; files from one HDD to another, even tho I didn't.&nbsp; I will then find all of the "Modified On" dates have changed to the current
 date from what it used to be.&nbsp; Is it possible to prevent this?&nbsp; or even reverse it?</p>
<p>Thx -&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  l_turn9
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Remember that Creation Date and Modification Date are two different things. 
<br />
<br />Change the folder view to Details then right click one of the columns and enable 'Date creation'<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f3d6e9b-bdbc-425e-bd81-5f93c8cdfa76?upload=true" />

            Hi  l_turn9
<br />
<br />With some large Windows Updates, the users files are moved to a temporary profile and when restored those will have the same modified date. I am sorry it is not possible to change this behavior, unless you were to store your files on a separate drive to your system drive.
<br />
<br />Also, storing your files in a folder on your system drive, that is not inside your user library folders should also work . . .

<p>Thanks!&nbsp; First, thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; While I knew there were additional headings available, I had not looked at the "More" headings available.&nbsp; I turned on the Date Created headings and unfortunately ended up where I was before.&nbsp; There was a date
 when all the files were reset to the same date.&nbsp; In this case, 2-18-19.&nbsp; I do plan to tinker with this feature to see how it can help me.&nbsp; There are so many headings available I will surely be able to find one to help me.&nbsp; I assume I can use the Headings in
 my spreadsheet and it will show this in the detail view.&nbsp; I almost always use the File Expl. in details mode, BTW.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>re DaveM121's response.&nbsp; Also very helpful.&nbsp; I now understand what/why this is happening.&nbsp; I hope I can setup one of the headings available that will provide my desired Date Saved info.</p>
<p>Thanks to both of you for the fast and accurate help ! -&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Black Rectangle Volume Bar Upper Left corner</h2>
                    I have a small rectangular volume control, top left of my screen. The volume output is linked directly to it, and it rebounds immediately back to zero %, almost like on a rubber band every time I click anywhere in the center of it. TRhe volume goes up
 with a click, or rapid clicking, but once you stop, it drops to zero. At the same time, corner access to "Start" screen, or right hand side controls are not available whenever the volume box is present. The only option to run the computer at all, is from the
 desktop, basically eliminate all the tiles or any of Windows 8 attributes.

    <title>In Windows Vista, when making changes in Windows Features, get message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bitsaron  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows Vista, when making changes in Windows Features, get message &#34;Please wait while the features are configured&#34; continuously</h2>
                    In the Windows Features --&gt; Turn Windows features on and off, &nbsp;When I press OK I get a&nbsp;message box: "Please wait while the features are configured.&nbsp; This may take several minutes."<br />
<br />
The problem I have is that this never ends.&nbsp; It looks like this message box contains a progress bar, but I never see any progress.&nbsp; The message box&nbsp; stays active forever (or until I log off).<br />
<br />
How do I fix this problem?

<p>Hi Bitsaron,</p>
<p>This issue might also be because the User Profile is corrupted, so create a new profile if the above step does not resolve.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety, and then clicking User Accounts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click Manage another account.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Click Create a new account.</p>
<p>4. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.</p>
<p>Check the link “Create a user account” <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/68a1c4fd-b3f6-4cb9-93a1-8a6023836e531033.mspx#E1D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;If the issue does not persist in new user account do the steps in the following link “Fix a corrupted user profile”
