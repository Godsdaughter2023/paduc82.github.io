    <title>Windows 10 Print Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Print Screen</h2>
                    A while back my screenshots folder got deleted. Since then screenshots have been saving under pictures in libraries. I moved that folder under This PC and Pictures so it would be in the original location. The problem I am having is since my screenshot
 folder was deleted, the prt sc button no longer takes screenshots. I have to use windows key + prt sc instead. Just curious if there's a fix for this out there. I've tried searching around and have come up with nothing. Thanks!

            There is no fix required as the sequence to take screenshots is as you have stated 'Winkey+Printscreen', has been for some time now.

<h2>            Games For Windows Live connection error</h2>
                    It all started when I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto 4 and when I wanted to load my game form my GFWL account, it wouldn't log in. I tried installing GFWL again and changing my password but nothing worked. I can access the internet just fine, I think
 it's an error on your side. Please provide me with a solution because I really want to play GTA 4 !!!

</p><p><strong>[Translation - Hello Vinicius, If you find unexpected charges from MSbill.info or bill.ms.net in your provider's monthly statement, do this:1. Log in to the order history of your Microsoft account. If you have more
 than one Microsoft account, enter each one to verify order history.2.Compare your account with the charge in question. It may be a signature or an incorrect purchase made by someone in your family.3.If you think someone has purchased your payment information,
 contact your payment provider to avoid further charges and change your payment option information in your Microsoft account. If you are looking for a refund for a Microsoft product, see Return items that you purchased from Microsoft to exchange or refund.
 You can have a Microsoft signature set for recurring charges, or you have recently started a free trial subscription that has been converted into a paid subscription. To verify that you have a subscription with recurring billing: 1. Enter Services and subscriptions.
 If you have more than one Microsoft account, go to each one to verify your signatures. 2. Find subscriptions with recurring charges. Here's how to cancel or turn off recurring charges for a Microsoft signature.]</strong></p>

<h2>            Security code being sent to a previous phone number I no longer have</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago, I started getting this message for my hotmail email account:<br />
<br />
<em>Since you're trying to access sensitive info, you need to use a security code to verify your account. How would you like to receive your code?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My only option is to have the four number security code to a phone number I no longer use. I have no way of telling them I no longer have this phone number, yet there is no way around this security code to get into my email. I try to get customer support,
 but again, they need the four digit security code to even let me chat with someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a pain in the butt. If I can't get this figured out, I'll quit using this email address through hotmail.</p>

<p>After I upgraded my windows 7 home version (premium edition) to windows 10, &nbsp;none of the tamil websites (eg. www.dinamalar.com, www.tamil.hindu.com etc) are displayed properly. &nbsp;The fonts are showing up as small square boxes. &nbsp;Is there a fix available for
 this issue? &nbsp;Surprisingly, my other laptop upgraded to windows 10 from windows 7 home version (basic) is displaying these websites without any issue. &nbsp;Is there a setting that need to be changed? &nbsp;Please help me with your suggestions and comments. &nbsp;Thanks a

            <p>Hi, BALAJISETHURAMAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestion that Perumal Kumar gave, to add Tamil to your language settings, actually does more: in addition to enabling a Tamil keyboard, it also install certain optional language-enablement features for Tamil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these optional features is the Tamil Supplemental Fonts feature. This optional feature includes the Latha and Vijaya fonts. In the past, they would have been included in every Windows system, whether users actually used Tamil or not. In Windows 10,
 they were moved into an optional feature so that users that don't need or want these fonts don't have them taking up resources on their system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This had a side effect for some existing apps, such as Chrome: it has custom font handling that expected these fonts to be present. Without them, your symptoms will result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The optional feature is associated with language settings, and in an upgrade from Windows 8/8.1, existing language settings will be detected to apply the optional feature during the upgrade. Unfortunately, this isn't working for upgrades from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you take a look at the following thread, you'll see detailed instructions for either changing your language settings or else manually installing the optional feature without making any changes to your language settings.</p>

<h2>            How permanently stop windows 10 force updates</h2>
                    I'm using an ACER aspire ES 14 laptop and it's been with me for over a year now with no problems whatsoever. Not until the start of 2018 where out of nowhere, windows 10 wants me to install their updates. Now for how long have I been ignoring those latest
 updates and seen some of the peoples complaints in recent forums that the newest updates destroys their PC/laptops instead of making it better, I'm kinda scared and also don't have the time to get all of the updates in my laptop. First, it was the windows
 assistant that was bugging me, where it would just show up and stops me for doing anything else. I tried the following method of going to "Services" and disabling both "Background Intelligence Transfer" and "Windows Update" and restarted my laptop, but of
 course those didn't work since it will automatically enables themselves again while also installing windows 10 assistant back. So I tried another method I found here that needs me to go to Task Scheduler and do some tweaking here and

<p>The only way to stop the updates is to disconnect from the Internet so the system can't receive them (this makes Windows 10 work the same as iPad, iPhone, tablets, Xbox, PlayStation, and other consumer electronic devices).&nbsp; This is why Windows 10 is a continuous
 service, not a one-time product.&nbsp; If you don't agree to the updates, you actually aren't legally allowed to use the system. You don't own Windows, you license the temporary restricted rights to use it. Those are the license terms of contract, and updates are
 required.&nbsp; Your only alternative is to use another product instead.</p>

</p><p>We can help you solve any problem you have at all to get your system working properly, but there's no "off switch" for updates, no matter what you do.</p>

 that people don't want in their system sooner I would've bought something else. But yeah, thanks for nothing I guess.&nbsp;

<p>The latest Win 10 update has been trying to load for months now.&nbsp; I've had to reverse (remove) it about 7 or 8 times as each time it loads, something else doesn't work.&nbsp; It might be Quick Books - or email - or excel - or who knows what.&nbsp; On my son's business
 machine (he runs his business on a single machine), we were trying to 'stiff arm' the 'developer' update as well - but it loaded itself, and his mouse stopped working.&nbsp; Tough to do anything without the mouse !!&nbsp; After 3 hours of service in his office - it's
 now been in the shop for 3 days - I can't wait to see that bill.&nbsp; And then you get some geek from Microsoft, who's never had to run a business tell you that we are forced to take an update that doesn't work smoothly - -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some day, with that attitude, Microsoft will go the way of Radio Shack - The Edsel - Saturn - and the buggy whip.&nbsp; Seems to me like a class action suit brewing - -&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I'll continue 'stiff arming' the download, and removing it after the fact - till Microsoft actually starts servicing their customers.</p>

            Then you should know well what kind of help I'm looking for. I don't want those forced install windows 10 updates in my system. It was going all so well until windows tried to become a virus that will force anyone to update their system whether they like
 or not now. Not everyone has good internet to download all of those and not everyone has time to install all of them in a day and they should really put that into mind... I'm really losing my patience right now and my laptop is the only thing that's working
 in our home. If something were to happen to it or becomes broken because of a windows update then I have no idea what to do anymore. I don't have that much money on me right now to buy a new one or repair it in case that actually happens and I really need
 to work on a bunch of stuff with it at the moment and of course, I need the internet as well in order to do that.&nbsp; So I'm pretty much cornered right now.

Click Apply then OK<br />
<br />
Option 5:<br />
<br />
Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.<br />
<br />
Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop wuauserv<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop cryptSvc<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop bits<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;net stop msiserver&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Option 6:<br />
<br />
Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.<br />
<br />
Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation<br />
Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’<br />
Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).<br />
Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.<br />
Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Option 4 obviously doesn't work since it'll just enables itself like I said in my original post.<br />
<br />
For now, I'll got with option 1 with the metered connection. I'll give it a day or 2 to see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Option 6 is out of the question. </p>
<p>Option 2 is definitely a no. </p>
<p>Option 3 doesn't have a link to what you want me to download.</p>
<p>Option 5 sounds a bit tricky, mind me telling what is actually does by stopping all of those and is it safe?</p>

<p>The "Cmdr" is completely right. The updates are part of the operating system. If you don't want the updates, you don't want Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because updates are an integral part of Windows 10, Microsoft provides no way to prevent them. With the Professional edition you can delay updates, for quite a long time, but you can't stop them permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, of course, stop updates from arriving at your computer by breaking Windows 10. That will work, but interfering with Windows' normal operation has consequences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In past, several years would pass between new versions of Windows. With Windows 10, there are two new versions every year (in spring and fall.) Since the success of an upgrade is directly proportional to the quality of the pre-existing installation, there's
 more pressure on users to operate their computers correctly. In earlier versions you could get away with configuration mistakes for years (don't ask how I know) as long as you didn't upgrade to a new version of Windows, which anticipates a supported configuration.</p>

            If it was easily that possible, I would've done that by now. Since I bought my system which is already pre installed windows 10 in it. Though I saw forums and discussion that even Windows 7 and 8 have some problem where they're forced to upgrade to 10.
 Is this actually true though?

<h2>            HP Compaq nc6400 notebook pre-installed wih Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit Donated by HP here in Panama</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a retired American volunteer medical doctor who has worked for no personal financial compensation since 1967, plus flew B-52 bombers out of Yokota Air Force base for twelve years at night while attending Tokyo University School of Medicine during the
 day. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife and me purchased Windows XP Pro two disk, then we purchased two Disk Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Both desktops I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; My wife's desktop had an OEM #, because a new motherboard was installed.&nbsp; No problem with upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 76 years old and while retired in the city of Panama, Republic of Panama for the paat fifteen years I spent four years in Iraq, four years in Afghanistan and six months in Regga, Syria supporting the Kurdish Women fight against ISIS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Toshiba laptop with Winows7 Home Premium was destroyed by&nbsp;incoming rocket fire.&nbsp; HP here in Panama donated a new laptop pre-installed with Windows 7 Ultimate, Registration- 00426-OEM-8992662-00173&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be quite honest Panama is very corrupt.&nbsp; The HP&nbsp;donated new laptop some times when I boot up, the laptop will make a very loud click near the power button and just shut&nbsp;down.&nbsp; HP and other software/hardware engineers were unable to find anything wrong
 so they claim.&nbsp; Purchased a new CANON Printer IP2700 and&nbsp;when I set up the printer would not work. The electronic store refused to take the printer back or even help with my &nbsp;30 day guarantee.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please is there any way I can get my HP Compaq nc6400 notebook with the OEM # upgraded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-installed, I have no disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live on Social Security that I earned while in the United States Air Force for twelve years.&nbsp; I can not afford to buy a new Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Dr. Hubert Hechabarria</p>

            <p>Dear Kiran:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply back.&nbsp; Unfortunately all of the questions and information that you gave me I already know.&nbsp; My HP Compaq nc6400 meets all of the requirements for the installation of Windows 10.&nbsp; I am an expert in computers going all the
 way back to IBM.&nbsp; Plus Yahoo considers me an expert in computer security being that I have the highest score on their "answers", as being voted by the majority of users as having the best answers to resolve their computer technical problems.&nbsp; Plus I am a beta
 tester for just about all antivirus, software, malware software, registration clean and fix and computer optimization software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP meets all the requirements for the installation of Windows 10.&nbsp; Plus I removed my third party anti virus and installed the free download that Microsoft gave to me, Microsoft Essentials.&nbsp; Plus I removed any and all software that would not be compatible
 with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Two separate Chinese software/hardware engineers, examined my software/hardware, plus ran all the test that one can run on a computer and was not able to find anything wrong.&nbsp; Both engineers fail to understand why Windows 10 will not install&nbsp; on Pre-installed
 Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit., Registration key 00426-OEM-8992662-00173 -- The HP is 100% new, and not used.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran all if the same test prior that the two engineers from Hong Kong who reside here in Panama ran.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With three sharp&nbsp;brains, plus your brain Windows 10 will not install, because Microsoft says that the key is not valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife valid key when she needed a new AROCK Mother Board for Windows 7 Home Premium was changed to the same OEM registration because
 we only use hardware/software engineers from China, that treat us with respect, and avoid the locals here in Panama.&nbsp; I updated her desktop Friday with no problems.&nbsp; My desktop I received Microsoft reservation icon in my tray to install Windows 10 July 29.&nbsp;
 Installed and all is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my English grammar, I am from the United States, but rarely use English. I use six other languages in my medical volunteer work.&nbsp; Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, Arabic, Farsi &amp; Russian.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again many thanks.&nbsp; All I can say is YES to all of your questions, but the references were of no help at all, being I have already reviewed them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse comes to worse, I will just have to find away to obtain another laptop, being that I have only 17 days per Microsoft to come up with a valid key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate HP, but one can not complain when I am receiving a donation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was necessary to remove all the embedded PUPS&nbsp; pre-installed when new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thought please.&nbsp; When I ran Microsoft validation tool on my HP laptop, the validation tool said my laptop registration # was valid.&nbsp; And then Microsoft downloaded a free Microsoft Essentials Anti Virus, that I am using, along with Microsoft firewall,
 being that with Windows 10 exceptional detection rate has gone up.&nbsp; I tested against other Anti Virus and the detection rate was exceptional.&nbsp;

            <p>Dear Microsoft Community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am American, but reside in a country that is corrupt in just about every area. HP donated the HP Compaq nc6400.&nbsp; If I paid cash it would not make any difference if you returned the same day and said there was a serious software or hardware problem, they,
 (and like all other stores here will not honor the warranty they handed you). You just out the money or try and pay some other place or person to repair the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP came pre-installed with an OEM # for Windows 7 Ultimate bit64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus I ran a Microsoft validation tool and my platform was validated. Microsoft even downloaded a free Microsoft Essential Anti Virus software.&nbsp; When I ran the tools to install, Windows
 10, my OEM #&nbsp; was not validated as legal.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago when I turned on the laptop I had a Dynamic Link Problem.&nbsp; Plus IE11 would not work, so I uninstalled and attempted to reinstall and I was told that IE11 is missing one update to perform the installation. Get the update.&nbsp; Of course Microsoft
 &nbsp;does not say what update is needed, plus with no IE11 I can not access the web to obtain any updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have a patient that is serious ill, I will fly in a government helicopter 475km to the city of Panama and while I put the patient in a government hospital, I will take the laptop to my software/hardware engineers from Hong Kong and have her just perform
 a clean&nbsp; install with Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop and my wife's desktop both had Windows XP Pro., then we purchased Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium, and&nbsp;my desktop updated automatic on July 29 and my wife's desktop I updated with the Microsoft tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both work find and no problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your support.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please just consider the ticket closed, because I do not see a place where I can close out the ticket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>As I stated above I am a volunteer medical doctor since 1967 treating people world wide, including four years in Iraq, four years in Afghanistan, one year in Syria, one year in Bosnia, and other parts of the world for no personal financial compensation.&nbsp;
 (The rich are not donating money like they used to),&nbsp;Thus my work as become harder, even when I get donation from pharmaceuticals, medical supply companies and&nbsp;airline donations.&nbsp;

 bomber sent&nbsp;by the Taliban to kill me for protecting women from abuse.</p>

<p>When I ran Microsoft validation tool, my OEM # was validated and I received a free Microsoft Essential Anti Virus download.&nbsp; When I used the Microsoft Tools to update my platform from Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit the validation failed and my platform was reverted
 back to original.&nbsp; (Panama is a very corrupt country in every aspect, and includes shopping stores, electronic stores, and I am sure HP).&nbsp; Because I go all the way back to IBM as an expert in computers and do not understand why an OEM # was installed in a
 new laptop, plus all the PUPS related to HP junk and drivers that are not compatible with Microsoft platform.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Took me months just to install IE11 even with Microsoft SP 1.&nbsp; HP did not like IE browsers, and tried their best to keep Google Platform.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question to the community&nbsp; is should I just give up trying to update to Windows 10.&nbsp; Being that I not have the time to reinstall Windows 7 Ultimate with the OEM key to avoid lost of my platform, as the days tick away for me to obtain a valid platform&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (My desktop and my wife's desktop that I maintain I know for sure hers had an OEM # for Windows 7 Home Premium and updated to Windows 10 with no problems.&nbsp; We have both paid each $120 for Windows XP PRO. And Windows 7 Home Premium $120.&nbsp; We do not have the
 money to pay another $120 for HP laptop that is new with an OEM #.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your advise as to just live with Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit on HP laptop will be appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft Community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday at 11:20 Panama time, while I was using my HP Laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit I received Microsoft Media ICON, in my tray to download Windows 10 via my Windows Update.&nbsp; I am very happy to tell you that the download, installation and configuring
 the software went 100%.&nbsp; Now my two desktop and my HP donated laptop that came with an OEM # for Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit is fine with the new Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to all that offered your support and suggestion in resolving this problem.&nbsp;
</p>

            If the price looks to good to be true then it is. Avoid buying from that company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need&nbsp; any further&nbsp;assistance please post and we will be glad to assist you.

            Yes, actually I do.&nbsp; I'm curious about windows 8.&nbsp; I have never installed it for a customer, however, when a customer brings their laptop or desktop to me with pre installed windows 8 on it, how can I go about re-installing the software and everything?&nbsp;
 Also, the key as well.&nbsp; If there's no key on the computer, how is that possible?&nbsp; I have a client's hard drive crash, the disc won't even spin. So I can't get the key or anything, but when I install a new copy of windows 8, no key, how can I do it?&nbsp; Any information
 will be helpful.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<p>As far as I'm concerned this is a scam. I purchased Windows 8. I received a key code and was given download links for the 32 bit and 64 bit versions, in ISO format. I wanted the 64 bit. The ISO was corrupted and would not install. He sent me a another link
 to the 64 bit version. It also would not work. (I believe it was the same file). When I sent messages to him about this, he refused to reply. I decided to try the 32 bit version. It installed. The listing on his site said that you would be able to update to
 ver. 8.1 after installing. Because the key code was a VL, or Volume License, version the only way to update it would<span>&nbsp;
</span>be with the original code given to the purchaser, or the IT person that originally installed it. Again he would not respond to my messages. Therefore the install was worthless. 8.1 is a necessary update for the OS to be useful. Most further updates issued
 by Microsoft will not work with version 8. He&nbsp;did not support&nbsp;the sale, and I paid for nothing. I was forced to buy the retail version of the OS elsewhere. Beware of positive comments that may be from shills.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you could explain why he would work with and communicate with you so well and blow me off? Perhaps, because you are higher profile, and threatened to report him, he figured that it would serve his purposes to give you necessary support especially
 if you continue to promote his business.&nbsp;I guarantee he never called me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Windows 8, that is obviously not the issue. I also do computer repair and after customizing&nbsp;8.1 there is very little practical difference&nbsp;between it and 7. Support for 7&nbsp;ends&nbsp;in January 2015. If you set up a client with Win 7 what are they going to
 do in 4 months?&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people I talk to are freaking about Win XP support ending. They don't want to go through the same hassle again in January. XP lasted about 13 years, 7 will end in about 5.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for demanding my money back, he has not replied to my many emails and support requests on his site. That is another reason I will continue to warn against him. There is no way to know if you will get ripped, and so it is not worth the risk.&nbsp;A legitimate
 business does not give the finger to a reasonable and simple request for the software he sells to function as advertised. You&nbsp;can&nbsp;only report a business to the BBB if the company is a member, which he is not. At one point his site was taken down. I suspect&nbsp;he
 switched his hosting company. His 800 number has always been disabled. Does any of this sound like a legitimate company?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a good relationship with him why not ask about my situation? I can provide copies of all of my messages and his 2 replies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Tricked into Windows 10 Upgrade - Killed Computer</h2>
                    <p><span>Like many, I was upgraded to Windows 10 without providing explicit permission on 5/31. When I booted first time, I was able to enter in some information into Windows, then it crashed. Further attempts at rebooting always ended with crashes, usually
 with the message: BAD_POOL_HEADER. Sometimes, the login screen is reached, sometimes not. If I reach the login screen, I can reach safe mode via shift restart. Other options (like rollback, reset, or restore) lead to crashes again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In safe mode, Update &amp; Security is seen under Settings, but nothing happens when I click. I was able to get to reset through Control Panel, but still crashed after choosing the option.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In safe mode, many basic apps can’t open. For example, it says, “Microsoft Edge/Get Started can’t be opened using Built-In Administrator account. Sign in with a different account and try again”. However, when I sign out, I cannot find any other account
 to sign in with. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looks like Windows 10 killed my computer. Every path leads to a dead-end. Any advice? Does Microsoft get a kick back from HP/Dell for every computer it kills?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to assist you better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer you are using?</li><li>What was the host operating system installed in your computer prior to Windows 10. Also, did it come pre installed with your PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to download the <strong>Windows 10 ISO
</strong>and create a Media Creation tool from&nbsp;another computer and then perform Automatic Repair using the same ISO media.</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Refer to the section <strong>Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool&nbsp;</strong>in the above article for creating the tool).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to
<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>, do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the
<strong>Install Windows</strong> page, tap or click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>
link to start the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2.&nbsp;In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3.&nbsp;Click, <strong>Advanced Options </strong>and then click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
4.&nbsp;After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> There will be no data loss by performing Startup repair. It will format c: driver and reinstall Windows 10. It will remove all the installed apps and updates.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You might require to change the <strong>
boot priority </strong>in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD or USB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Write to us with the updated status and the required information for us to be able to assist you further.</p>

            <p>I downloaded the tool&nbsp;from the link&nbsp;and started to run it. However, I'm now not clear on whether I should choose "Windows 10" or "Windows 10 Home Single Language" for edition. "Windows 10 Home" is what's currently installed on the PC that I'm trying to fix.
 Is that the same as "Windows 10" or "Windows 10 Home Single Language"? I don't know why there isn't an option for just "Windows 10 Home".

            Probably at this point a clean install of Windows 10 would be best to clean out any remnants of Windows 7 that's causing the issues you are having.<br />

            I moved forward with the boot from DVD, even though no reply from Sayan. After I changed the boot order, it said I've&nbsp;already&nbsp;started an install -- do I want continue or start over with clean install? There was not an option for repair as Sayan indicated.
 I tried first the option of continue install, but it just proceeded to boot without install anything. Then, it crashed like before.
<br />
<br />
Now, I'm down to the option of&nbsp;clean install. For that, I'm trying to back up my c: drover first.

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to play Championship Manager 03/04 on Windows 7 and 8 but it won't run on Windows 10. The game installs absolutely fine but try to open it to play it comes up with 'please login with administrator privileges and try again.' I am the only user
 of my of and as such have administrator privileges. I have tried running the game in compatibility mode which does not work as well as running the game as administrator, which again does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in getting me to get this game running would be awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to check the compatibility of the game with Windows 10 as some of the versions&nbsp;of the&nbsp;mentioned game are not compatible.&nbsp;Please click on the link below to check the compatibility of your games.</p>
<p>

            <p>The game is compatible. The error message bogus, and shows MS's insensitivity towards Windows users.</p>
<p>What is preventing hundreds of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disk based games
</span>from launching in Win10 is a malware developed by MS.</p>
<p>This malware is called DRM Blocking. It is also be subversively installed to Win7/8/8.1 via Windows Updates.</p>

            Sometimes this sort of issue happens with a bad or loose monitor cable, or if the display adapter is failing.

<p>To be clear, are you trying to but DLC for Black Ops, or the game itself? If you're trying to purchase a game from the Games on Demand section of the Marketplace, then you'll need to use a credit card to make those purchases.</p>
<p>Have you tried making the purchase from Xbox.com as well as the console?</p>

<h2>            Windows shut down during an update. Now it boots to blue screen.</h2>
                    <p>I was putting off installing updates because they always cause me problems. My PC would wake up from sleep in the middle of the night and try and fail to update. Whatever, that's not the point. I did Update and Shut Down. It started the update, and did it
 for a bit. (It said PC Will Restart a Few Times, by the way) It shut down randomly in the middle of the update. It wasn't finished. I turned my PC back on, and waited. It booted to the Windows Blue Screen. There was no text on the monitor, just the blue. It
 stayed like this for a minute or two, then shut off. It does this every time I turn it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all of the traditional fixes: the bootrec/ commands, System Restore, etc. Nothing works. I have Windows, and Windows.old. This has happened to me before, and the only way I fixed it was by reformatting my PC and reinstalling Windows. I'm not doing
 that again, it just led to the same problem happening now. What do I do? I've tried everything I could think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Josh</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The message that the PC would restart several times makes it a Version Update.  Here are steps to recover a failed Version Update, leading up to if necessary doing the best Clean Install one can have (better than any money could buy).  Then I'll show you how to block Updates to avoid the hassle and twice yearlly instead install the latest Version Update manually on your own schedule to get caught up with all Updates.  
<br />
<br />Ready?  
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to  Go Back to Old Version:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are able to access Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options - to Go Back.  
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the booted media if they are not scrambled:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />Then be sure to wipe all partitions off the drive to get it cleanest.
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back up and running you can turn off Updates one of these ways so that you only need to run them on your schedule, even just install manually the 2x year Version Updates from Media Creation Tool which rolls up all the previous Updates inside it:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

<br />
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Well, if it didn't work, it looks like you will have to perform another custom install.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
