            <p>Hi HYDRO1313.</p>Canada is no longer part of the Rewards program as of September 30th. Members who did not opt out of the program and did not disable email communications with us were migrated over to Microsoft Rewards. The last deposit made to your Microsoft account with your remaining pending Credits was on October 11th. As Smwutches states, you'll need to connect with Microsoft Rewards support.

<h2>            MP480 Printer will not scan - using windows 7 desktop PC</h2>
                    I've had this Canon MP480 All-in-One printer for about 3 years and have never had a problem with it.&nbsp; I recently got a new computer and ever since, it will print, but it refuses to scan.&nbsp; Keeps saying "Preparing" for about 30 secs, then stops.&nbsp; Why would
 the print function work but not the scan function?&nbsp; Makes no sense.<br />
<br />
The first thing I tried was resetting it by unplugging both plugs from the printer for a couple minutes, plugged them back in, and turned it on.&nbsp; Still wouldn't scan.<br />
<br />
Then I uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it.&nbsp; Same thing.&nbsp; Will print but won't scan.<br />
<br />
Help!&nbsp; This is driving me nuts and holding me back from stuff I need to do!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, if you will.&nbsp; :-)<br />
<br />

<br />
Well yes it does matter,</p>
<p>If the cannon installation cd contains the software/drivers for win7 you should use that.</p>
<p>If not you should install software drivers diirect from Canon site, specific to your bit version of win7 (32bit or 64bit)</p>
<p>The link for these was posted in the first reply.</p>
<p>In general you install the software/drivers prior to connecting the printer, the install will tell you when to connect.</p>

                    <p>Original title: hklm\system\controlset001\enum\storage\volume?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a home build with Win 7 SP1 64 bit OS.&nbsp; My Garmin GPS the driver is faulty, because it will not let me eject the unit.&nbsp; I also am not able to update my maps.&nbsp; I have uninstalled all Garmin and Mapquest software and uninstalled the driver from device
 manager.&nbsp; I have used the register editor to delete all keys referenced with Garmin except for 2 keys located @
</p>
<p>HKLM\SYSTEM\Controlset001\enum\storage\volume\_??_USBSTOR#Disk&amp;Ven_Garmin-------.</p>
<p>I cannot deleted these keys.&nbsp; I get&nbsp;"Error while deleting key."&nbsp; </p>
<p>If I restart&nbsp;my system and&nbsp;reconnect the Garmin the driver files are loaded but I still have the same problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Garmin is not faulty because I have andother desktop and a laptop that does not experience this problem.&nbsp; Is there another method to completely uninstall the driver files?</p>

            "Regedit" is run from the search box to open registry editor. The USB driver keys refered are the only Garmin entries I cannot delete. When I run "Fix It", I am notified that there is a problem with the driver that could not be repaired. Garmin support
 has no stand alone uninstaller.<br />

<p>Well this kinda sucks, apparently (not to start again PC vs Console titles) that the game's engine is modified to be put on platform and to use the platform's strengths and abilities. Alot of people are complaining about console graphics because of the Jimmy
 Fallion segment they had, alot of people don't realize its early version they showed, the game is not done, and Console version will never achieve highest PC graphics quality because the console is basically what your stuck with while PC's are always updating
 with new hardware to use.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I just installed Windows 10, and I wanted to set up a software mirror on one of my disks. The Add Mirror option is completely gone (not just grayed out) from the right mouse button menu. I had no such issue with Windows 7 and the same drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know about Storage Spaces, and unless that is the ONLY way to set up a software mirror in Windows 10, I am not interested in it. Does anyone have any ideas what's going on?</p>

<h2>            Keyboard is typing multiple letters at press of one button</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Not sure where i need to be placing this post, but I&nbsp;recently bought a keyboard from walmart (earlier today actually) so I would have an easier way to type in text chat for Elder Scrolls Online. For like an hour or so, everything was working great! Then my "A" key and my "S" key both started to trigger the other (I'd type either one separately, and the screen would show "as"). The letters seem to be "spreading" and now almost every key I press will trigger 1-4 other keys on the keyboard. Not all are next to each other either (asdfj). I have plugged it into my laptop and it won't work properly there either. I've attempted to look it up online to no avail. Not sure if I&nbsp;should just return it and get another one, or if it's worth fixing. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi pseudo117,</p>
<p>Who is your computer manufacturer? What is the make and the model number of your computer?</p>
<p>Your keyboard settings for your multimedia keyboard to open certain multimedia programs like Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center is configured by your computer manufacturer. So, if you can provide us the details about your computer manufacturer,
 then we can find a way to assist you better.</p>
<p>Check if you’ve any utilities installed for your multimedia keyboard from your computer manufacturers which might have some settings to disable the hotkeys.</p>

<h2>            Fatal Error C0000034 applying windows update 63 out of 81,065</h2>
                    <p>Ohhhh god. Please save me.</p>
<p>I can't stand Windows sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have owned my Windows HP Probook 6460b for around 3 years now. I have a book I am writing currently, about 91 pages through and silly old me forgot to save a backup file somewhere else. I remember doing things and then my computer randomly shutting down
 sometimes to perform updates without my permission. So I went to my control panel and stopped it. I run Malware checkers every day, but I didn't expect this to happen. My computer switched back to it's original ways of updating and randomly SHUT OFF and updated.
 Last time this happened my whole hard drive failed and I had to get a new one. I have plenty of downloaded music, videos, games, work I'm doing, and drawings. I can't risk losing everything and I don't have a backup file for anything. I will lose it all. My
 sister owns one as well that experienced the same problem! I really can't risk losing everything. I get that blue screen with the advanced options button thingy or the restart button. I restarted my computer several times and it did not work. I pressed exit
 and continue to Windows 8.1, my current Windows status and that didn't work 3 times either. I have done every option except fully restarting my PC, which means losing everything. I don't own memory disks or anything it says I can insert into it to fix it,
 and I have checked other discussions on this, and I tried EVERYTHING I found as an answer and none of it worked. I really need help. Please, I need someone to save my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll lose my book, all the fursuit designs I've made, my letter I wrote to Scott Cawthon, every. single. thing. on. my. laptop. HALP!!! I got a version of Undertale Toby Fox himself sent me when my Steam version wouldn't run! I'd lose that, Emily is Away,
 all the FNaF Games, Undertale Yellow, ermmmmm.... All the other games I play? TF2 Anyone? Roblox (It's stupid but I still love playing MM2 on it. Great concept, the way they made it was horrible however. Poor Roblox.)? Pokemon Insurgence? Err... Everything?</p>
<p>I've made my point.</p>
<p>WUT IS HAPPENING????</p>

    <title>Windows Fax and Scan stops working after most recent Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Fax and Scan stops working after most recent Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent windows 10 update which occurred on or about 9/23/16 I noticed that my Windows Fax and Scan program was no longer receiving faxes. &nbsp;After investigating I saw that the fax account within that program was purged. &nbsp;When I try to set up
 add a new fax account under the Tool menu I select "connect to a fax modem." &nbsp;I then use the FaxModem default name and click next which brings me to the screen where I select "Answer automatically" (recommended). &nbsp;At that point I get a message that states
 "To send a fax, you must first connect to a fax modem or server. ..." &nbsp;The PCI modem on my system lists as working properly in the device manager and I'm at a total loss now after uninstalling the modem, uninstalling and res-installing Windows Fax and Scan
 in the Turn on or off Microsoft features in the Uninstall Program window. &nbsp; My business is dependent upon my windows fax and scan service and I'm hoping someone can help me out with this. &nbsp;Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks Rachelle, unfortunately this did not work. &nbsp;Windows Fax and Scan is still not working after running through the suggested steps in Sangeeta Sarkar's post. &nbsp;I also forgot to mention that the problem I'm having as described in the original post is occurring
 on two separate computers.... same exact problem. &nbsp;I used one of them as a back up system. &nbsp;So I'm convinced that the most recent update on 9/16/16 caused the Fax and Scan program to fail. &nbsp;I do know this was a substantial update and I had to reinstall the
 drivers on a number of devices no of which is causing a problem other than the Fax and Scan. &nbsp;I'm hoping someone has a fix for this or Microsoft updates with patch to solve the problem.</p>
<p>

<h2>            computer crashes when skype video call</h2>
                    <p>okay, so during a video call the other night, my Averatec laptop equipped with Windows XP home overheated and shut down, I restarted it, since then whenever I go to video call on skype, my computer crashes, restarts, and gives me several different answers,
 such as a blue screen error, malware, spyware conflict ect.</p>
<p>Since this started occuring I've taken the following steps and cannot figure out another solution;</p>
<ul>
<li>disk check </li><li>sytem update </li><li>driver update </li><li>directX update </li><li>uninstall/ reinstall skype </li><li>installing mcafee </li><li>disk cleanup </li><li>deleting unwanted programming</li></ul>
<p>I cannot figure out what other solution to use</p>

timelysupport</a>'s correct answer, you might do things *methodically* and in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall Skype. </li><li>Update your motherboard chipset driver from the manufacturers web page.* </li><li>Update your audio device driver from&nbsp;the manufacturers web page.* </li><li>Update your video device driver from the manufacturers web page.* </li><li>Update your network device driver(s) from the manufacturer(s) web page(s).* </li><li>Reboot and install CCleaner.&nbsp; Run it and cleanup any loose files it finds. </li><li>Download and install both <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MalwareBytes</a> and <a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SuperAntiSpyware</a> (FREE for BOTH) and run full system scans with each of them (one at a time) and remove everything each of them finds.
</li><li>Open the registry and find the Skype entries and remove them.&nbsp; Any you&nbsp;find.&nbsp; HKLM and HKCU areas in particular.
</li><li>Reboot again. </li><li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform a CHKDSK</a> on all drives
</li><li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform a Defragmentation</a> on all drives
</li><li>Reboot again. </li><li>Visit <a href="http://winodwsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winodwsupdate.microsoft.com/</a> and install all updates that are not optional (Optional Software and Optional Hardware can be ignored) and that do not update something you do not want to update
 (like Internet Explorer, etc.) </li><li>Reboot and repeat 13 and 14 until you have no more non-optional updates you need to install.&nbsp; Reboot once more for good measure.
</li><li>Download the latest version of Skype and install it. Reboot before you run it.</li></ol>
<p>* Whenever possible, go to the actual manufacturer - not of the entire machine - but of the device.&nbsp; For example, if you have an Intel chipset based motherboard, get the drivers for it from Intel.&nbsp; If you have an nVidia video device, get the drivers for
 it from nVidia.&nbsp; If you have a Broadcom network device, get the drivers for it from Broadcom.&nbsp; If you have a RealTek audio device, get the drivers for it from RealTek.&nbsp; And so on...</p>
<p>If, after doing all that in that order, it still does not work - it is likely either a hardware issue or a Skype issue.&nbsp; However, you could try ONE last thing.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic43051.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC /SCANNOW</a>.&nbsp; You will need your Windows XP CD.</p>
<p>After that - you really are left with hardware/Skype or something so messed up you might resign yourself to try a full wipe and install of everything fresh (although I would not do it if I could not image my disk and return it back to where it was before
 I tried.)</p>

    <title>Greatly disappointed with MS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Greatly disappointed with MS</h2>
                    <p>I have been a Microsoft supporter&nbsp;for years now, but lately I'm starting to feel let down by their hardware as well as software endeavors.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Let me start with the beloved surface:</strong></p>
<p>While the device is amazing as a concept, after some regular use the bugs started to show, chief among them is the wifi bug that simply disconnects my surface from the internet at random times which requires a restart of the whole system at worst or of the
 wifi&nbsp;connectivity at best. While this might not seem like a big problem, it has definitely had a big impact on my day to day use. As a grad student I bought the surface pro 3 (core i7 8Gb RAM 256Gb SSD) as a laptop/tablet&nbsp;replacement so&nbsp;it doesn't really help
 when I'm doing an online test or streaming a lecture to have my wifi disconnect.</p>
<p>Moving on, the surface pen that just decides to stop working during lectures when I am in the middle of taking notes. This has happened many times and the only way to get the pen to work again is to repeatedly remove the AAAA battery and then put it back
 again, the try to pair the pen again with the surface and then just pray that it works.
</p>
<p>Then there's the overheating&nbsp;issue that has been very&nbsp;prominent even&nbsp;when I am doing something as simple as text&nbsp;editing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The edge browser also seems to freeze and close on its own from time to time.</p>
<p>What's even worse is the fact that these things have been becoming more and more frequent.</p>
<p>This is not something that you should have to worry about when purchasing a product for ~2000$</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Lumia line:</strong></p>
<p>After deciding to ditch iOS, I went over to Windows Phone 8 with the Lumia 920.</p>
<p>The OS was buttery smooth and had a lot going for it, I saw great potential... potential that Microsoft crushed over and over again with each subsequent update.</p>
<p>It always feels like taking one step forward and two steps back when it comes to Windows Mobile.
</p>
<p>I tried the insider preview of the new OS and was greatly underwhelmed, the atrocity that is the new photo gallery app was just useless.</p>
<p>Not to mention that for some reason, MS still hasn't found a way to properly backup phone data (which should include the start screen design that MS loves to brag about), or transfer song libraries from the phone to the PC.</p>
<p>The people hub, somehow gets worse and loses more and more functionality every time they decide to "upgrade" it and does not sync&nbsp;with outlook contacts on my PC.</p>
<p>This was tolerable in the early days of the OS but after more than 5 years&nbsp;on the market it can longer go on, they can't be&nbsp;STILL playing catch up in terms of functionality&nbsp;and features (not to mention the infamous app gap).</p>
<p>I was&nbsp;still holding on to my 920 but the time has come for me to change it, and I'm not sure if I'm up for paying ~600$ for a 950 just for the sake of brand loyalty and hope that maybe just maybe Microsoft will start to get it right.</p>
<p>(And honestly I feel like I've invested too much in the Microsoft ecosystem to just switch to Android or iOS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on the subject? </p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Stop being the leading edge supporter..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft makes a good second or third rendition of there product.. Nothing they have ever made was good from release. Some were so awful they have been tossed away with minimal product support.. Windows ME, Vista, 8.0..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look deeper into it..&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were many more..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 3.0 sucked.. Windows 3.1 was good.. Windows 95 Sucked.. Windows 95 SE was good, Windows 98 Sucked, Windows 98Se was good, Windows 2k was terrible until SP2, and wasn't great until SP4, Windows Xp in SP0 and SP1 were also Terrible..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft gives nothing away for free.. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your windows 10 wasn't done, and worse you broke the cardinal IT rule..&nbsp;</p>
<p>You NEVER upgrade an OS and you NEVER install a new OS until it makes SP1 at minimal..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a lot of potential, but.. It's not there yet..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Phones have always been horrible..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think they have ever made a good one..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only thing the mobile &nbsp;devices have going for them is that Nokia makes the hardware, which is a step up from the XP device which i am surprised they didn't get sued for.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>True, but what do they have against releasing finished software that actually works well...</p>
<p>Also, Nokia <strong>used</strong> to make the hardware. Most of those engineers either got&nbsp;fired by MS or&nbsp;got offered better jobs and abandoned ship&nbsp;during the merger (the Pureview camera team are now at Apple).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically all they have to offer mobile-wise is an empty shell of a former giant and that magic "potential".</p>
<p>I really hope they get their **** together soon...</p>

<p>They never will.. Honestly Windows 95 when it was released BSOD'd on stage with Bill Gates presenting it. They have never had a single OS that was Bullet-proof from release. But then neither has any of them.. Apple has been using the exact same kernel in
 all versions since the PowerMac which is just NeXT OS from the late 90's. The Gui is updated, but that is open source, and you can get it on Linux too.. It's nothing new, when they released there first Intel based OS it was such a flop they nearly went out
 of business. Linux Ubuntu is a pretty solid OS, but they too have revisions that are pre-releases, where they allow people to submit bug-fix solutions to issues, before they released a polished version. You aren't going to find an OS that is truely new, that
 has all the bugs worked out before it is released.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want a stable OS, you as the consumer shouldn't waste money on anything new for at least a year if not two so that the developers have time to work out the bugs.. It is the same for hardware, again not just from microsoft, but from technology.. it's
 just how it is..&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Shutdown problem with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Shutdown problem with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed a new MB Asus Maximus Formula VIII.&nbsp; Did a clean install of Windows 10 64(bit) and all seems to work well.&nbsp; But when I close down the PC (desktop) via the normal procedure (start --&gt; power --&gt; shutdown)&nbsp; the PC does not shutdown.&nbsp;
 The fan's keep on spinning and it looks like the pc has not completed its shutdown cycle (power remains on the MB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read every article on this matter but none of the solutions seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure at this point wheter this is an Intel (Management engine Interface) or a Microsoft (driver) problem?&nbsp; I also noted that i am not the only one with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions from Microsoft and are they aware of this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi David, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to first check the Event Viewer for any logs that appear there regarding the shutdown problems.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b:</strong> Then click <strong>Event Viewer</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep
 mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to rectify the shutdown problems, I would request you to execute the Power troubleshooter and then check if it helps.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><strong>a.
</strong>Type <strong>Troubleshooter</strong> in the search box and then press <strong>
enter.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><strong>b.
</strong>Click <strong>system and security</strong> and run <strong>the power troubleshooter.</strong></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please revert if you face any issues with shutdown.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you. </span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a critical error: source: Kernel Power telling me that the system was not shutdown the correct way due to power loss.
</p>
<p>This is logic because i have to turn my pc of the only way i can, and that is by switching off the power of the PSU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Troubleshooter (</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>power troubleshooter ) and it did change something.&nbsp; I did overwrite my settings from Samsung Magician.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>I checked the results by doing a normal shutdown, but it did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Windows did a shutdown (black screen) but the motherboard (MB) kept the fan's spinning and the power was not cut like it should be.</p>
<p>But a nice try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep looking for a solution. I just hope it is not a hardware problem of the MB.&nbsp; But if it was then I suppose the pc would not be running.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no problem what zo ever when it is on.&nbsp; it's just that it does not shutdown.</p>

            <p>Latest Intel chipset (inf) driver already installed from Intel site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Asus site I can not find a specific driver for the ACPI regarding my MB Maximus Formula VIII</p>
<p>If I click on the device manager (system devices) is says that no driver files are required or have been loaded.</p>

            <p><span>I'm way past this.&nbsp; I have already tried the standard solutions.</span>All latest drivers have already been installed on my PC (from Asus and Intel)<br />
Been testing with the MEI driver (latest and previous versions) and power options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I am not a rookie. I have been buidling PC's for years. But this is the first time I came across a problem like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway for the advice.</p>
always appreciated
<p>
</p><p>This problem goes beyond the standard solutions.</p>
<p>I already read most topics on this matter but did not find a solution yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to determine if this problem is driver, BIOS or hardware related.</p>
<p>During operations the PC works fine, no reboots, or BSOD or other strange things) It is just when you close down the OS that the PC does not complete its shutdown function correctly + fan's keep spinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always have to turn it off by shutting the PSU (Corsair AX series) off.</p>
<p>It is generating a critical incident in the log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating as you can imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All new ideas are welcome.</p>

            <p>The best way to diagnose this issue is going to be to collect a performance trace during shutdown to see which process is blocking shutdown from completing. There are several ways to do this, the easiest of which is likely using the Assessment and Deployment
 Kit (ADK) to run the fast startup assessment to collect this trace (it traces both boot and shutdown.) You can install the ADK for Win10 from here:
<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've collected the ETW trace, you can view it using WPA. Hopefully the built in views make it obvious which process is blocking shutdown. If not, we can work out a way to share the trace file so that we can help investigate.</p>

    <title>How to keep Num Lock from constantly turning off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tweeter723  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to keep Num Lock from constantly turning off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know how to keep my num lock from repeatedly turning off. I have seen various solutions on the Internet, but none have prevailed. I did manage to get my num lock on when I log in, but when I wake my computer up from sleep mode, the num lock
 always turns off. If I RESTART my computer, num lock will stay on for the entire session until I lock my computer or put it in sleep mode. Once I unlock/wake it, the num lock ALWAYS switches off despite being on before. Is there any way to keep num lock on?
 It is far more convenient to have it on at all times since I work in data entry.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with your System/Mortherboard Maker's Support, their on-line documentation, and ask<br />
in their forums.<br />
<br />
How to Keep NumLock On upon Boot in Windows 8? (and 8.1)<br />

<br />
<br />
And be sure to turn off Fast Startup - Control Panel - Power Options - either&nbsp;Require a password<br />
OR Wakeup or Choose what the power buttons do&nbsp;OR Choose what closing the lid does - uncheck<br />
Turn on Fast Startup.<br />

<br />
<br />
Some makers will have settings in the BIOS, others will provide utilities to do it, and others may<br />
have methods in place which prevent doing it in Windows.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Windows  8.1</h2>
                    My Windows 8.1 computer updated as normal a few times in Nov &amp; before. In Dec &amp; Jan there were updates almost every day, continuing yesterday &amp; today (Feb 1 &amp; 2, 2017).&nbsp; I refused the Windows 10 offer because my old printer isn't 10-compatible.&nbsp; All these
 updates are taking so much of my time and affecting my internet connection. Why are there so many updates so frequently??? Thanks for any info.

</p><p>1c. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you ever done a Refresh? ...a Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription

            <p>Thanks for offering to help.</p>
<p>I've noticed something else since my original post yesterday.</p>
<p>Mostly, as of yesterday, I'd noticed the almost-daily updates have succeeded;&nbsp; yesterday I noticed the same i.d. number of several updates repeats again and again, so the problem is not that there are so many different updates, it's that the same ones keep
 'succeeding' in getting themselves installed, which I don't understand at all.</p>
<p>1a.I bought the computer 4/2014.</p>
<p>1b.It came with Windows 8 pre-installed.&nbsp; If memory serves, I had to upgrade to 8.1, which was free of charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1c.Toshiba</p>
<p>1d.no</p>
<p>2.Avast, free version, renewal date this coming April</p>
<p>3.none</p>
<p>4.,5.I believe Norton came free for a limited period of time with the computer, has expired. I get pop-ups daily reminding me to pay to renew, but I don't.</p>
<p>6.No, neither appear in Installed Updates;&nbsp; however, KB3205401 and KB3214628 are the 2 updates that have repeatedly 'succeeded' in being installed in the last while, as per Update History, as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>7a.I seem to have IE 11.0.9600.18525 Update Versions 11.0.37 (KB3197655). I rarely use IE; I have Install new versions automatically checked.</p>
<p>7b. I have Firefox 51.0.1 (32-bit).&nbsp; I do not have Chrome.&nbsp; I had it on a previous computer, liked it, so installed it on this one, but it hamstrung this computer, was thus removed a in August 2015.</p>
<p>8.no</p>
<p>9.no</p>
<p>Will look forward to more info-thanks again.</p>
<p>

            Thank you. Likely because of all you've posted in this thread, I ran the update troubleshooter, which turned up 3 problems which it told me it had fixed.&nbsp; I also ran system maintenance, which told me it found no probs.&nbsp; Then I tried to check for updates,
 and the update checker wouldn't stop, so I ran the update troubleshooter again, which found another couple of issues, which it said it fixed, and the update checker progress bar went away.&nbsp; Installed Updates looks the same as before - a very long list, but
 Update History tells me no updates have ever been installed, and Most Recent Check for Updates: Never shows in the main Windows Update Control Panel box.&nbsp; I am going to wait a while to see if updates resume as they should.&nbsp; Either they will, or the constant
 problem that led me to post here will continue, or my updates will stop completely.&nbsp; If updates resume as they should, I will thank you;&nbsp; if not, I will answer your latest questions.&nbsp; As of now, at least I have been able to vote you as Helpful.&nbsp; In the meanwhile,
 thank you for your patience.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Thanks for your patience.&nbsp; A bit of improvement at first - a day or so with no updates offered, then a day or so with the option of turning off my computer without updating.&nbsp; Now I'm back to the only options presented being update and restart or update and
 shut down.&nbsp; And it goes thru the whole update process, then, when restarting, tells me updates were unsuccessful and it is undoing all changes.&nbsp; Which it isn't, because in View Update History, I can see the same updates were successful several times, which
 doesn't make any sense to me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View Update History shows KB3214628 'Succeeded' 5 times and KB3205401 and KB3205404 both 'Succeeded' 4 times since February 4, when I ran the troubleshooter, which deleted the update history going back to 2014.&nbsp; All 3 updates 'Failed' a couple of times
 after they each 'Succeeded', most recently 'Succeeded'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Installed Updates:&nbsp; that list is not chronological, nor is it in reverse chron.&nbsp; Most recent is just now, Security Update KB3197874.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now I will answer your February 4 questions.</p>
<p>1. 64-bit, according to Control Panel-System</p>
<p>2. Norton/McAfee Removal: no</p>
<p>3. Avast created 1 May 2014.</p>
<p>4. KB3205401 in Update History only, not Installed Updates.</p>
<p>5. KB3197873, KB3197874, or KB3197875:&nbsp; none in Update History;&nbsp; KB3197874 in Installed Updates as of February 8, i.e. just a few minutes ago.&nbsp; I don't understand why an Installed Update would not also show up in Update History.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>6. Aha!&nbsp; 'Flash Player is out of date (23,0.0,207)'.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually can't find Adobe Flash Player on my computer.&nbsp; It doesn't appear under Apps via the Windows Start Screen.&nbsp; It's not in its own section via File Explorer, but when I put Flash in the file searchbox,
 Flash Player comes up in various folders.&nbsp; I'm not sure what Flash is for.&nbsp; I do sometimes watch video content online, don't know if Flash engages automatically then, or not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will look forward to feedback - thanks!</p>

            Hi,
<br />I have undeleted this thread and merged both of yours. I see there is an issue with 
<br />Intel Technology Access Filter Driver.

<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for ndisrfl.sys
<br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for ndisrfl.sys

<br />
<br />Sorry, I can't see attachment with this thread. 
<br />
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            I think I resolved this issue. I booted in a live version of Linux, extracted ndisrfl.sys from a prior backup, and the issue is not&nbsp;reproducible. I will open a new thread with a new dump if problem persists

            Hi Josiah
<br />
<br />There also appears to be an issue with your Ahteros Qualcomm network device driver (Qcamain10x64.sys)
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the Atheros driver they recommend from the network section to see if that can stop the system crashes . . .       
        </p>

            To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />

<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive, drop box, or google drive to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>be sure to check if it shows any more information on <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com</a> at the subscriptions and also the transactions sections, it might show a possible reason why no purchase can be made.</p>
<p>If nothing is shown then you will have to contact Xbox Support via Phone (or Microsoft Support Chat) they can look into why you are receiving the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried from the website or from the console? If you've tried console and it doesn't work, try to hold down the power button for 10 secs and try again. In this way you should solve.</p>
