    <title>set wrong email when creating admin account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryemills  say:</h3>
<h2>            set wrong email when creating admin account</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new Surface Pro 4. When setting up the administrator I inadvertently made an error when my email address. Consequently, I am unable to access the system generated email sent to this address to verify that I own the email address. I have tried
 to set up the "inadvertent" email address as a new account, but this has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with a step by step approach to changing the administrator email address?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;easiest solution&nbsp;to your issue is to create a new local account and merge it with your (correct) Microsoft account. Once the new account has been setup as an administrator you simply remove the old account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the following link&nbsp;to setup a local account:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here!</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the following link to merge the local account with your Microsoft Account:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here!</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done you simply remove&nbsp;the&nbsp;old account from your device.</p>

    <title>SKype and Creative Sound Blaster omni issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j2sw  say:</h3>
<h2>            SKype and Creative Sound Blaster omni issue</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with Skype and the external USB sound card by Creative.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.creative.com/p/sound-cards/sound-blaster-omni-surround-5-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://us.creative.com/p/sound-cards/sound-blaster-omni-surround-5-1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on a mac. MacOS Mojave</p>
<p>Skype version 8.46.0.60</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype recognizes the Omni. Sound plays through the omni via the headphone jacks as well as the rear jacks.&nbsp; However the speakers do not play through the Omni at all.&nbsp; I can switch the speaker source to another source and things work just fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried
 various settings with no go. It appears to be something SDkype does not like about the soundblaster USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi j2sw 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should do a clean uninstall and reinstall of latest Skype on Mac using below method as first step towards troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />Quit Skype by secondary clicking Skype, then select Quit Skype.
<br />Open your Applications folder and drag your copy of Skype to the trash.
<br />Open Finder and search for “Skype” using the search feature in Mac OS X. Move all of the results returned to the trash.
<br />Secondary click on the trash icon, and select Empty Trash.
<br />Restart your Mac.
<br />Download and install the latest version of Skype from <a href="https://go.skype.com/mac.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/mac.download</a>
<br />
<br />Source - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12073/how-can-i-completely-uninstall-and-then-reinstall-skype-for-mac-os-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12073/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please report back me the results so that I can advise further steps if your problem is not solved.

    <title>Windows Camera is now black. Please help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angeladodson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Camera is now black.  Please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So spontaneously my camera will not work. &nbsp;It shows a black screen. &nbsp;I have checked what version I have in 'winver' and it says Windows 8. &nbsp;I thought I had windows 8.1 and I looked online and it says that if you have a search button next to your account
 name in the start menu, then you have 8.1. &nbsp;So....anyway. &nbsp;My computer may have done some updates automatically or that I authorized but I didn't download anything new or change anything. &nbsp;It is my Microsoft webcam and then of course the Movie Maker which
 uses that too I guess. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have all the most updated drivers on the usb stuff which I didn't think the camera (internal) was usb but I'm no techie. &nbsp;Can you please help?!!</p>

            <p>i no longer have any virus, if I did but I still have a black camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I located the imaging device and tried to automatically update the driver and it could not find one.&nbsp; I went to the manufacturer who didn't even have an exact driver and had me update one that was close.&nbsp; During all this, I have recently restored my system
 to an earlier date and when Iog onto my computer fresh it keeps telling me there is a windows update although I did one on the 27th.&nbsp; I click the update and it just searches and searches and does nothing.&nbsp; i fell asleep and it was still 'downloading updates'
 4 hours later.&nbsp; The manufacturer told me he was 'sure' that after my windows update and his driver, my camera would work again but without the update.....?<br />

<h2>            How to turn off BSTR cache on Win2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to turn off the BSTR cache on Win2016 to prove that there is no real memory leak of my application, which is a COM dll has lots of SysAllocatString, and SysFreeString code in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand, it's OleAut32.dll is caching all the BSTR, and gives a false alarm of memory leak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I tried to set the enviroment variable of OANOCACHE = 1, and rebooted my box, seems did nothing, memory still not flushed yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it true that I need a debug version of OleAut32.dll? But where to download it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my OleAut32.dll version:</p>
<p>10.0.14393.1378</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated!</p>
<p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The above thread is locked for further additions, demonstrates a far reaching issue affecting many XBOX owners.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Issue</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: Xbox One S experiences up to 100% packet loss via Ethernet connection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Device:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">XBOX One S, Latest firmware as of 31-OCT-2018</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Symptoms: &nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">10-100% packet loss up/down will occur resulting in total connection failure to the network:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Failure to respond to ICMP ping for local and external traffic</span></li><li><span>Intermittent ICMP ping response and increased latency &gt;3-3000ms between LAN nodes</span></li><li><span>Inability to reconnect/resolve after restarting the Xbox One</span></li><li><span>Inability to sign-in to xbox live (due to failed network)</span></li><li><span>Partial success logging into xbox live / intermittent log offs</span></li><li><span>In-built troubleshooter will cycle through error codes and troubleshooting steps, including requesting restart of devices, "you are not connected to the internet", NAT not open, "you are not connected to the internet", "Cannot get a Teredo IP address",
 etc.</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Detail:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Typically, the XBOX One will, upon first use function as expected, connect to live as expected and cause no problems. Upon a shutdown and restart, or in some cases after significant up-time (&gt;8-12hrs) the XBOX will start to drop
 packets. This can be from 10% to 100% in most cases. This then causes XBOX Live to intermittently connect then log a person out of live unexpectedly. Once the packet loss is significant enough, XBOX live will fail to connect. The troubleshooter will cycle
 through error messages depending on the level of packet loss, this will be due to some conditions for the test being successful, eg the NAT port test either returning a result or failing or simply the Microsoft Live servers DNS responding / or failing. The
 troubleshooter messages returned to the user is contingent on specific conditions for that test being met to return an error. The packet loss does not appear to be tested or form part of the troubleshooter - it simply influences the returned error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The XBOX has two power modes, "Instant-on" and "Energy saving". Observations has shown that the network state appears to be retained through power cycles in both modes and will respond to ICMP ping tests through a restart and/or
 exhibit the packet loss issue throughout the restart. The issue is resolved only when the network state is fully cleared/reset and the connection is re-established. The issue can again be produced by shutting down the XBOX and turning it back on. This, however
 may take a few attempts to reproduce or be observed by the user.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue is present, and can be reproduced using all most common routers and modems in all standard topology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How to reproduce:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Assume a real-use test case. Perform these steps to reproduce.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>From fully unplugged xbox one already configured, ensure latest firmware,</span></li><li><span>connect Ethernet cable to network.</span></li><li><span>Connect power and turn on.</span></li><li><span>Confirm network traffic and sign into xbox live.</span></li><li><span>Utilise the xbox, ie play a game/watch Netflix etc for a reasonable period. Eg 1 hour.</span></li><li><span>Shutdown the xbox from the menu.</span></li><li><span>Leave the xbox for a reasonable period of time, eg 1 hour or more</span></li><li><span>Select "Turn off the console" from the system menu or by holding down the X button on the controller</span></li><li><span>turn on the xbox</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue and symptoms should be reproduced. If not, shutdown/restart the xbox and repeat steps 4-8.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Workaround/Resolution:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The only way to resolve this issue is to cause the network state to be fully cleared from the XBOX. There is no way to fully resolve this issue, only workarounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As described in the forums and in Microsoft XBOX troubleshooting guides, performing a full power drain and fresh startup will resolve the issue. The following processes will often result in a temporary workaround.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Force offline mode and perform a full shutdown (most reliable):</span></em></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network settings &gt; Offline Mode</span></li><li><span>Go to Settings &gt; Power and Startup &gt; Turn off or Restart &gt; Full Shut down</span></li><li><span>Once the XBOX is off, turn it on, return to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network settings &gt; Go online</span></li></ol>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Force network state change by changing network settings:</span></em></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network settings &gt; Advanced settings</span></li><li><span>Select IP settings and enter in a fake and unattainable IP address, such as 1.1.1.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0.</span></li><li><span>Enter 1.1.1.1 as DNS</span></li><li><span>Note the IP address changing on the XBOX one network page. Confirmation of successful IP 'flush' will be present as 0.0.0.0 and/or the IP address you entered being set. This will fail a network state.&nbsp;<em>The XBOX won’t be a happy chappy!&nbsp;</em></span></li><li><span>Go back to the IP address settings, return the settings to Automatic OR your specific IP address and immediately restart the XBOX.</span></li></ol>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Force network state change AND port change:</span></em></p>
<ol>
<li><em><span>Change network settings as per above</span></em></li><li><span>Additionally, Go to Alternate Port selection and change the port manually to something else.</span></li><li><span>restart the Xbox immediately</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">According to forums some success has been noted for people rebooting their modem/router. This can indeed cause the state to change, but a restart of the XBOX is often also required. Hence:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Whilst in Go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network settings &gt; Advanced settings, Note the IP settings and Fully power-cycle modem/router</span></li><li><span>Noting if the IP address changes to 0.0.0.0 or a 169.x.x.x address, this confirms the IP settings are cleared. (Note static IP address is not likely to change), If the IP address did not change, continue to step 3.</span></li><li><span>Once modem is online attempt to reconnect to XBOX live, if failed, restart the XBOX.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Additional troubleshooting steps or combinations and variations of the above actions may result in successfully working around this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The following steps are&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;valid for occurrences of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this issue</span>&nbsp;and will not in most cases assist in resolution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Following the inbuilt XBOX troubleshooter</span></li><li><span>continuously restarting the XBOX without the additional actions above</span></li><li><span>Resetting Modem/Router to factory settings</span></li><li><span>Resetting XBOX to factory settings (issue will reoccur)</span></li><li><span>replacing a known working Modem/Router</span></li><li><span>replacing a known working Cat5, Cat5e UTP network cable</span></li><li><span>Placing the XBOX into the DMZ mode or configuring port triggering/port forwarding</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">--------------------------- Technical details below ------------------</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Technical diagnoses and troubleshooting</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The following assumes you have: Started with a fresh XBOX, configure and confirm online and able to sign into xbox live. Install a game for testing purposes. Connected the XBOX to a Switch/Modem/Router with uPNP enabled, DHCP assigned
 or Static assigned IP address with ICMP Ping enabled for local LAN traffic and/or no firewall between LAN nodes. Internet is confirmed working and sufficient for the purposes of connecting to XBOX Live. XBOX Live is currently online without service disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Turn on the XBOX and start a continual ping test from another machine or From the router on the local LAN.<br />
<em>Suggest, using Microsoft Windows based PC booted from an Windows install CD, thereby illuminating speculation of firewall and linux shaming and other such nonsense.&nbsp;</em>Suggest a static DHCP leased IP configured from router or a static IP configured on
 the xbox.<br />
Eg, Ping -t &lt;IP of xbox&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A fully working connection will have 0% packet loss and latency of &lt;5ms node to node. (realistically &lt;2ms or less on 1Gbps network).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. With continual PING, reproduce the issue as per the steps described above. Take note of the ping results, noting when the XBOX is "switched off" if you are receiving ping response or not. You will be able to identify when the
 XBOX is no longer on the network by a failed "<em>Destination host unreachable"</em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Upon restarting/reproducing the issue, you will observe significant packet loss usually &gt;20-30% and increased latency. You should notice sporadic latency and packet response. Symptoms of failure to sign into XBOX live and /or
 game launches and network dependent functions, such as checking for updates, signing into Netflix etc will be effected or fail outright.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As this is local node to node traffic within the LAN there should be no reason, for this to fail. At this stage you may wish to observe your DHCP/ARP table in your router. If DHCP assigned, confirm the lease granted time/date (if
 displayed) to identify if a new lease has been obtained. (not likely).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform the troubleshooting steps as above; continuing the ping test.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You should be able to confirm the connection and link state (visibly on router if needed) of the xbox one during a 'restart', despite the power mode set. You may notice a brief link drop and re-establish. However, if you successfully
 cleared the network state, you should observe a full 100% response to all packets at &lt;5ms response and no issues with network connectivity of the XBOX live. IF unsuccessful, you will see the link state is active throughout the restart of the XBOX but the packet
 loss will continue even after POST and home screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note however, if you do a full system power cycle (power drain/start) network state is not initialised until AFTER the POST startup. This, should however resolve the issue until reproduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It is expected that "Energy saving" should cause a full power off state, and clear the network state by default. However if the unit is still connected to the mains power and, a restart operation is performed, it appears to be retained
 and the issue persists. Performing a full shutdown from within Settings &gt; Power also does not seem to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Further testing possible:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Further isolation testing is possible to completely rule out the modem/router having "incompatibility" issues by:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Reproduce the issue as previously described</span></li><li><span>using a PC running a windows installer environment, directly connect a crossover cable or via dumb switch directly to the XBOX with a static IP on the same range and perform the ping test described above.</span></li><li><span>Perform the troubleshooting steps above</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It is expected that the results would be similar. This is on the basis of the testing and hardware already described by many users in the forum mentioned and by 3rd party forums. This is also due to the issue being able to be resolved
 by restarting the xbox alone, where the DHCP lease or static DHCP entry is present on the modem. Ie, the issue affects multiple devices where the lease was not cleared and settings of the modem/router were not purged but can be resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Speculations&nbsp;and comments:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Ethernet NIC chipset is&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">Realtek RTL8111HM according to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Xbox%20One%20S%20Teardown/65572</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This chipset has been noted publicly in many forums as having significant driver issues upon its release, causing packet loss and significant connection issues.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I acknowledge that the additional testing above has not been performed by me, nor have I tested this issue with respect to the Wireless NIC,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">MediaTek MT7612UN.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">I would suggest at this stage that there is likely to be a significant driver issue with respect to the NIC and/or a possible overall&nbsp;issue with respect to the power and sleep state affecting the NIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I submit the above based on testing I have performed and observed, and the information publicly available and linked in this document. I would welcome others to test and validate my findings and publicly confirm (or deny) this
 as an issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">I write this with the hope that Microsoft will acknowledge and action and resolve the above, and that it will provide clarity and a suitable course of action for owners of the XBOX One S whom experience this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">I am a new to the XBOX and thus far am&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp; that this issue has affected me and moreover so many people over the course of 2+ years without any clear acknowledgement or resolution. I am&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;that the common responses
 in the linked thread, is to blame the Modem manufacturer, the ISP, the cabling and other devices on the network. I am, perhaps overly skeptical, but I am concerned that this issue appears to have been so common yet seemingly has very little correct technical
 troubleshooting and identification&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;posted about it. This is clearly a device specific (XBOX) issue and it is highly unlikely that these issues have not been thoroughly troubleshooted and identified before I went out and bought an XBOX One S.</span></p>

<p>Hello Lyric!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this situation to our attention. It sounds like you have tried a lot of different steps and solutions to get this resolved. I understand your console starts off functioning fine and will sometimes maintain that state for a while but eventually
 packet loss starts and continues to the point where the console is unusable online is that correct? If so I recommend taking a look at these support articles for more information:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/browse/xbox-one/networking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Support Networking</a>. If you feel like you have tried all possible actions or troubleshooting on both your network and the console it is possible that the console may need to be serviced (possible internal component failure).&nbsp;You can find more information
 about how to replace or exchange your console here&nbsp;(within warranty guidelines):

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are more or less understanding correctly; I would like to clarify simply - The XBOX functions as expected and without fault until either specific conditions are met,</p>
<p>A) Usage beyond 8-12 hours (from my observations/experience but threshold unknown, suspect data transfer limit?)</p>
<p>B) Until a standard shutdown other than "Full shutdown" is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the original poster of the thread I referenced, a few other similar threads currently active in MS forums and with similar other 3rd party forums all indicate this issue and the symptoms, behaviors and conditions I have detailed.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this issue is isolated solely to the XBOX and does not seem consistent with a hardware related issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for example the Realtek NIC chipset itself is faulty, It is a huge misstep by Microsoft and even further by Realtek. Too much testing and quality assurance would have been done. A faulty chipset would, depending on the fault, cause power fluctuations
 or even full system crashes or inability to power on, fail at POST etc. In any event, the behavior and symptoms would degrade over time - ie the problem would get worse, mean time between failures would increase etc. It would likely also present as a complete
 inability to function, eg no link state etc.</p>
<p>Other component failures would also present with other symptoms. Instead we have 100% functionality and performance for a consistent period of time and it can be measured and reproduced - at least seemingly by my interpretation of other peoples posts and
 my own observations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I am wrong - then I am wrong. In any case I am the 2nd owner of my XBOX so warranty may be an issue there for me personally.</p>
<p>Given the points I have made, I suspect there is a software issue that needs to be addressed, and I really feel for those who have spent money on new cables, modems and even changed ISP's chasing a false resolution of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>George, I also did double check the troubleshooter link you sent me to, I appreciate that, however in this case those support articles are not appropriate to this issue. The troubleshooter will never accommodate for troubleshooting an unexpected fault condition..
 In this case, (IMHO) it would be where a physical link state exist, valid IP, subnet and gateway, and limited or no Up or down (or both) traffic is being received/transmitted. It would be interpreted by the most applicable built in troubleshooting rule depending
 on the number of packets received.. eg, if 50% loss may be that the NAT test fails or the connection latency is too high.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue can be so easily (buy annoyingly) resolved by restarting the device, then function perfectly again consistently until a failure condition is met, then it does mean that we can test and verify the fault and easily rule out the usual suspects.
 It should be a simple matter, if those who also experience this problem could confirm that they too A) have the problem and same circumstances and B) the resolution I offered resolves it, then the course of action would be clear... identify the cause and offer
 a firmware update and/or ..if hardware then offer a recall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who are IT savy and experience the same issue with their XBOX, I would appreciate if my observations can be tested and verified or, if it is the case, discounted and those results posted here.</p>

</p><p>It took several minutes - several, so many minutes once the CD is put in!!&nbsp; In some CDs after several minutes it showed 105 MB free of 656 MB.&nbsp; But it won't show any files (all 5 files which were&nbsp;dragged and out on CD&nbsp;were MP3 files)
</p>
<p>How come Win 10 can't burn CD as easily as it used to do in past and wste so much time and even CDs!!!.</p>

            I bought 3rd party software to try to get this to work and it's a no go. What is up with that? Why won't it recognize a blank Phillips CD-R disc? Am I wasting my money? I need to be able to burn CDs in the course of my business. It used to be easy. Why
 is it difficult now? I need a real workable solution. For the price of Microsoft products, I expect them to work!

            Hi Traffic,
<br />
<br />You can't really convert it to MP4/M4A unless you're certain it's encoded with AAC. One way to tell is you can open it in VLC Media Player or another media player of your choice. If it plays, it's an audio file. If it doesn't, it's most likely not a (...at least a commonly) encoded audio file that can be played.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.       
        </p>

            Traffic,
<br />
<br />Do they all play successfully? If so, you can just change the file extension on them.
<br />
<br />In case you haven't set it up yet, click the View tab in Windows Explorer and make sure you're in the directory where the song is. Make sure 'File name extensions' is checked.
<br />
<br />Replace .dat at the end with .m4a (audio container of MP4). If it plays successfully and it works, you can fix the other 995 songs with Bulk Rename Utility, and replace the file extensions at the end: <a href="https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php</a>
<br />
<br />When the program is running, under Extension, select "Fixed" in the dropdown menu and enter: m4a
<br />
<br />Then click Rename.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need any additional assistance in using that program, but other than that I wish you luck.

</p><p>I've wiped once already, still happens. Can't leave S mode on the Surface Go. All apps are up to date, Windows Update reports everything there is up to date, have restarted multiple times, all other configurations across both instances were correct so far
 as all documentation I can find requires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add in the touchpad randomly changing left clicks to right, random key input duplication, and Windows Hello's issues with my glasses, and this is a pretty disappointing first experience with Microsoft's Surface Hardware. As a tech reporter, I'm sort of stunned
 that this number, severity, and these types of problems could exist in a consumer-facing product.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to remove xbox live account from someone elses xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p><span>Ok so i got a brand new Xbox 360 and before that i gave my account to my friend. well after that i recovered my account and i got gears of war 3 and i played the beta in May. so in the beta it said that i
 would get all this stuff like skins guns charecters etc. well i didnt. after that i called xbox live and i asked why didnt i get the gears 3 stuff the supporter asked if i had accounts on anyones xbox and that is the reason why i didnt get the gears 3 stuff.
 so i was wondering if there was a possible way to remove my account off of his xbox without having to go over there and do it myself.</span></p>

            The only way you would have Word capabilities is if you are using MS Office.&nbsp; The Windows 10 Mail app only has the most basic functionality, and is certainly not connected to MS Word in any way,&nbsp; In fact the Windows 10 Mail app is a complete rewrite, and
 doesn't even have all the functionality that is in the Windows 8.1 Mail app at this point in time.

<h2>            Automatic updates won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I need help fast.&nbsp; My daughter has an HP G62 laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit.&nbsp; The computer freezes and is extremely slow when it doesn't freeze.&nbsp; I tried running AVG normally and in safe mode and it would only run so far and then freeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto updates doesn't work and I wonder if this is the problem.&nbsp; I had this happen to one of my computers when auto updates was turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In control panel auto updates is set to automatic.&nbsp; But when one tries to update a message that says "cannot update windows update turned off, restart computer."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In computer management, services, Windows Update properties(local computer) it says Service Status: Stopped.&nbsp; Startup type was automatic(delayed start).&nbsp; When I pressed start under service status I get the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows could not start the Windows Update service on Local Computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erro0x80070057: the parameter is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set startup type to automatic, press start get the same message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set startup type to manual, press start and get the same message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even set startup type to disable, press start and get the same message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me get auto updates started again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to Microsoft and tried several of their auto update repair programs.&nbsp; One wouldn't down load, for the reason, another said it couldn't find a problem, and I forget what the third did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!!!!</p>

<h2>            Problem with 0x0000007a KERNAL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>I've run into the BSOD a couple times in the last 2-3 weeks and I wanted to get help from the "Microsoft Answer Desk", but I'm about to move to a new apartment and really need all the money I can get. My complete error code is as follows:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>0x0000007a (0xFFFFF6FC40007DA8, 0xFFFFFFFFC000000E, 0x0000000320681860, 0xFFFFF88000FB5630)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below that it says</p>
<p>
</p><p>partmgr.sys - Address FFFFF88000FB5630 base at FFFFF88000FA7000, DateStamp 4f641bc1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The latest of the 2 BSODs occured while installing a game; Dragon Age: Inquisition. I specifically setup the install and then left to the grocery store. When I returned, there was the BSOD, and it's accompanying noise of not negligible volume. Since I've
 noticed some sluggishness lately when awakening my computer from hibernation I suspected my hard disk drive and proceeded to run a chkdsk twice. I aborted on both occasions due to the scan getting stuck on stage 4. After that I ran not just malwarebytes and
 avast scans, but I installed and scanned with Microsoft Security Essentials. It detected virtool/obfuscator.xz and removed it. I want to pinpoint the issue before trying everything under the sun, because even then who knows...I could try everything and it
 end up being the motherboard or something. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly appreciate anyone who will help me figure this out.</p>
<p>Here are my specs: Custom-built i5 4690k, 2 TB WD RE4 HDD, XFX R9 290, 16 GB DDR3, Asrock Z97 Extreme 4 on Windows 7 HomePremium.</p>

            <p>There's no reason to regularly backup your registry. There is every reason to backup your user data daily (documents, music, email, etc.) and, if you know how, to backup your software daily with a disk image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should backup your registry if you are making edits to it. If the edits don't work out, you can restore the registry to the way it was. Once you are confident that your edits are correct, there's no longer any reason to keep the registry backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if you try to restore a registry backup you made yesterday (or two days ago or last week or last month) you risk making your system unstable and crashing. That would be like replacing your 2016 Camry engine with a 2014 engine. The old engine might
 work in the new car, or it might not.</p>

            <p>Although CCleaner is a good program (I use it myself), I recommend that you use only its other functions and not its registry cleaning.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span><span>Registry cleaning programs are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and what vendors of
 registry cleaning software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit it may have.</span><br />

<br />
<span>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from the market almost immediately.
 Many people have used a registry cleaner and never had a problem with it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it the substantial *risk* of having a problem. And since there is no benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad bargain.</span><br />

<h2>            How to personalize my wallpaper to change by itself.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have had 3 other Surfaces in the past and the prior two used to change wallpapers on its own and I really liked it.&nbsp;<br />
One day I would see a beautiful sunset, and the next I'd see a waterfall or a frog in the forest.</p>
<p>The displays would already be set to change automatically so I've never had to set it up that way myself, except this new one isn't set up that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to put this feature on this surface but I can't seem to find the settings for it.</p>
<p>Anyone know how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Mustang.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the game at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; MS Soduku or Jigsaw &gt; Advanced Settings.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC, how does it work now?   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response and suggestion. Resetting the games under Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt;&nbsp; had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done in addition to what I wrote above was Resetting the games under Settings . . .</p>
<p>Reset the Windows Store: Wsreset</p>
<p>Remove and reinstall the games.</p>
<p>Restart the laptop many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately I am currently running Windows 10 1809 and am way past the 10 day limit to restore Windows 10 1803.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of restoring to a point prior to when the problem started from a checkpoint or if that doesn't work doing a complete restore from system backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you time.</p>

            Yes, I'd System restore if you have an restore point or reimage if you have an earlier version to go back to.  
<br />
<br />Are the games fully Updated from Store Settings &gt; Updates?  
<br />
<br />Since you're already onto resetting Store, I'll give you everything that works to repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks, Ronnie.
<div><br />
<div>So, MS wants us to pick sides between Google Apps and Outlook.com that had an ultimate fail yesterday. And in the process, pushing people to other devices and OS that supports universal standards.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really do love Surface RT and Surface Pro but if MS can't support basic things like calendar and contacts, my primary devices will always be Android and/or iOS. So, how does MS expect to help their current circumstances of poor sales by working against
 people who buy their products?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Shame.</div>

            I'm sorry but this has nothing to do with Microsoft. This is posturing by Google to create compatibility problems that cause people to get upset like you and get mad at MS.
<div><br />
<div>It takes time to ensure that what they create is of the highest quality and works properly, so they won't release CardDav and CalDav support until it's right. You must know that they are completely aware of the problem, though, and are working on a fix.
 You would only get angrier if they rushed and released a broken product, so be patient.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Work with the tools you can use for now (google apps via the web) until the support is there, and direct your anger at Google for removing support for a common protocol.</div>

            I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro and I'm happy I managed to add my existing Gmail and 2 Google Apps Free accounts before January 31 deadline. I love having these contacts and calendar together in Metro Apps together with my Skype and Facebook contacts. Cool!
<div>But my computer is a 3-year-old Mini 311 netbook, and I have to keep it as an apple of my eye. I hate the idea of not having my Google based accounts on a new computer when I decide to get one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not interested to listen who is guilty - MS or Google. With ditching EAS support Google made a blow at MS, and MS's failure to add CalDAV and CardDAV support to its Calendar and People Apps ruins the experience of new computer buyers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this support isn't added, my next computer will definitely will be an Apple, because of CalDAV and CardDAV. And many people will do so. In this Google vs MS war the winners will be Apple and iOS. And also Android, because it supports both Google-based
 accounts and EAS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;By obstinately refusing to add &nbsp;CalDAV and CardDAV support, MS is damaging its own sales.</div>

<p>Unfortunately as of today, Google seem to have pulled the plug on existing customers too.&nbsp; I've spent the morning having to reconfigure iOS devices to sync my Google Calendars which have mysteriously disappeared.&nbsp; The Win8 People/Calendar/Mail update released
 today forced me to reconnect to Gmail and lost the ability to sync with Google Calendar too.&nbsp; All in all, I've had better days!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm already looking for an alternative to Gmail / Google Calendar but want to find something that is supported across all of the platforms that I use and not one that ties me to a specific product or vendor.</p>

            I am currently testing zoho (zoho.com) which offers a free 5-user system similar to google apps, using a fremium model rather than an ad supported model.<br />
<br />
They support EAS for mail, contacts and calendar so they should work with Windows 8 as well as most phones and tablets.<br />
<br />
They import IMAP messages and contacts from gmail and google apps, which is more than google does, and they have a lot of other fremium SOHO services.
<br />
<br />
I will be posting my full review to techpotato.ca when I am done.<br />

<h2>            Skype Number</h2>
                    I am in Nigeria and I need to receive a call from Pakistan using skype. I am new to this service and it seems am losing my way around here. What information here on skype can I possibly use or send to this guy in other to receive calls through skype. I
 thought purchasing a skype number will do the job not until I was asked to select a country in other to continue purchasing a skype number, and Nigeria my Country is not in the list. Please what information can I possibly send to people in other to receive
 calls through skype. If I will be needing a skype number,&nbsp;how then do I get one since Nigeria is not listed in the countrys

            Hi there!<br /><br />Since you don’t have the option to get a number from Nigeria, you could try getting a number from another country available on the list. I know isn’t what you’re looking for but it could helps you. It’s only an idea.<br /><br />To see the list with all available countries click on this link <a href="https://secure.skype.com/my/skype-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/my/skype-number</a>

                    I had gotten an answer regarding failure in automatic loading of an update from Select Updates To Install. &nbsp;I completed the instructions and the update was successful. &nbsp;However the update is still listed in Select Updates to Install and continues to install
 and fail. &nbsp;How do I remove that update from Select Updates to Install. There is no option to delete or remove it. &nbsp;The update listed is "Updates for Rights Management Client for Window Vista (KB979099)".
