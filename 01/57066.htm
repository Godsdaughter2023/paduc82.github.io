            <p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which application are you using with webcam?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you try launching the webcam within the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to install the drivers for webcam from the manufacturer’s website and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also reduce the hardware acceleration and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start &gt; Control Panel.</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the classic view, double click the Display icon.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the Settings tab and click the advanced button. The Advanced Settings dialog box appears.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Troubleshoot tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You can disable the hardware acceleration completely by dragging the slider to the extreme left of the scale. You can also choose to turn down the hardware acceleration by selecting an intermediate value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved with hardware acceleration turned off, the source of the problem could be old video drivers for your video adapter. In that case, you need to contact the
 manufacturer of your video card to get the latest drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on updating drivers, refer the below article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Update drivers: recommended links</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 7</b> in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Failed in FIRST_BOOT phase with error 0xC1900101-0x30018 during SYSREP operation</h2>
                    <p>I successfully downloaded the MediaCreationToolx64 and the upgrade to Windows 10 went all the way 100% from what I could tell, but on about the 3rd reboot it advised that it had encountered an error (see above title) and it then reverted back to the previous
 Windows version (Win7Pro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought Microsoft really did a great job from all the screen displays during the upgrade process.&nbsp; Of course I was disappointed when it encountered the error and reverted back to Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; Am curious as to the cause of the failure and when
 a fix might be anticipated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Friday, July 31, 2015 Attempted upgrade again and was successful, no errors this time.&nbsp; Took about 2½ hours roughly on a Lenovo All-In-One Desktop IdeaCenter B320 that's over 3 years old. Took less time than a 6 month old laptop because I have this
 one hard-wired to my modem, versus Wi-Fi. So, recommend using a LAN connection versus Wi-Fi if possible.&nbsp;

</p><p>When I attempted to load MS' Preview pre-launch of Win 10 on a Lenovo laptop on Windows 8.1 several weeks before the launch, I ran into a problem where my Wi-Fi went away, and&nbsp;Windows restore wouldn't work. I was stuck between a rock and hard place as they
 say.&nbsp; So I had to resort to doing a reset to factory settings on the laptop in order to get it working again.&nbsp; MS' preview EXE file was a piece of *%*@.&nbsp; Luckily all my data was backup up.&nbsp; The&nbsp;biggest time waster afterwards was processing all the MS updates
 that had been downloaded previously before things were really back to where they were&nbsp;before I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the name of the Firewall you're thinking of is Windows Defender.&nbsp;I'm one week into Win 10 so far on two different computers, and other than having a couple of issues, seems to be pretty stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May the force be with all of you.</p>

            I have a Mitsubishi and the settings for TV and gaming are very different on mine. The game is half of what the TV is. I searched my TV and got my settings because I kept changing them almost every day. So far, I haven't changed them yet. Maybe there's
 a site for game settings. Good Luck!

<p>It's odd that your "normal" and game settings are that different, as all video is supposed to mastered to the same set of standards. The settings on my Bravia are the same for my BD player &amp; cable box as they are for my 360 and all three look absolutely
 stunning. The only time settings should really differ much is for different inputs (component, HDMI, etc) or if the signal is way off for whatever reason. I'd start with this site...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do one of the following, then retry the command: (1) reduce the number of running programs; (2) remove unwanted files from the disk the paging file is on and restart the system; (3) check the paging file disk for an I/O error; or (4) install additional memory
 in your system.</p>

<h3> joshua todd cowper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I remove &#39;Switch User&#39; from the lock screen&#63;</h2>
                    In Windows XP and below, when you locked the computer, it was <strong><u><em>LOCKED</em></u></strong>. Only the user that locked the computer&nbsp;and an administrator could unlock it. Yet, in Windows Vista and later, this doesn't apply. All you have to do
 is click on&nbsp;<em>Switch User</em> and another person can log on. Now, I'm sure that in some instances this is great, but I'd rather it didn't do that. Is there a way to remove the
<em>Switch User</em> button? How?

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer crashes while navigating shared drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer crashes while navigating shared drive</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with a Dell OptiPlex 7440 All-in-One workstation on my network. It is only about 4 months old and came with Windows 10 Pro already installed. &nbsp;About 2 weeks ago file explorer began crashing when navigating on the company shared drive.
 It works okay for some folders but other folders that are a few folders deep causes File Explorer to just completely close. Every other workstation can open these folders and files just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried shortening the file names. </li><li>I have cleared my File Explorer history and turned off the Quick Access frequently and recently used folders.
</li><li>I have updated all drivers and firmware including BIOS.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or tips is much appreciated.</p>
<p />

            I would right-click your desktop wallpaper, go to Screen Resolution, and then make sure the resolution is set to the recommended size for the display.&nbsp; Does that help alleviate the issue?

            <p>In case the above doesn't help...</p>
<p>Do you have the latest video drivers? If you go into Device Manager and look under Video controllers you'll see the make and model of your video card. Go to either your computer manufacturer's web page or the video card manufacturer's web page to download
 the updated drivers. The file should be an exe file so once you download it double click on the file and it will automatically install. If it's not an exe file go to the "Driver" tab on the video card in Device manager and choose "Update driver" then point
 it to the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to restart after updating the driver for everything to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check your monitor drivers.</p>

            <p>Which side of your screen is displayed? Left or right side? Also if the left side is displayed on the right, or the right is displayed on the left, then that can be a number of different things. If the second part is what is happening, it can be one of the
 following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Your screen resolution is set too low.</p>
<p>2) Your drivers are out dated. I'm not sure what card your computer has in it. The current one is an NVIDIA Quadro.</p>
<p>3) In the screen resolution settings, you should be able to change the position of your monitor depending on the amount of displays you have attached.</p>
<p>4) Your system may be outdated, and not able to support Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try to downgrade to Windows XP or Vista, and run this software to see if your computer can even handle Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped, many good wishes to you.</p>

                    My display is smaller than my 24" AOC 2436Vh monitor. I can't find an updated manufacturer's driver for the monitor. Not even on the manufacturers site. I have an ATI&nbsp;Radeon 3000 Graphics card &amp; I can't find an updated manufacturer's driver for it either.
 Again, not even on the manufacturers site.

<p>This is the reason why uninstall using Windows Powershell is not recommended as it is rather a far advance and tedious task. Since the troubleshooter for Windows apps did not work for you, we are recommending you to check your options found here on this
 link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery options in Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked into the recover options that you suggested, and assumed that I would have to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; Since I have been travelling for the past couple of weeks, I was not ready to dive into that process.&nbsp; Yesterday I installed a different calendar
 app from the Store (One Calendar).&nbsp; It required that I link my Google calendar associated with my Gmail account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after installing One Calendar, I got a notification that I had new mail.&nbsp; When I clicked on the notification, Windows Mail opened.&nbsp; It was mysteriously back.&nbsp; However, all of the settings were&nbsp;back to the original defaults.&nbsp; This was a result of&nbsp;nothing
 that I tried to do.&nbsp; However, there were a few Windows automatic updates performed a couple of days ago.&nbsp; I can only assume that the update included a reinstall of Mail and Calendar.&nbsp; Does that make any sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are unable to install KB2770917 update and fails at 96%. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What are the troubleshooting steps have you tried to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to KB2770917 update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b><span>I would suggest you to run Windows Update Troubleshooter and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to run the Windows Update Troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + C</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>Troubleshooting</b> and click
<b>Troubleshooting</b> under <b>Settings</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now type <b>Windows update</b> in the
<b>search</b> option.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Windows Update troubleshooter</b> to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and then try installing the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            I have tried every possible solution that I found on the web as well as within numerous Microsoft forums on this issue. The update issue deals directly with KB2770917. I did not run the Windows Update Troubleshooter since the issue is on my wife's laptop.
 I will try it over the next two days and see if that resolves the issue.

            U literally copy pasted from the microsoft help forum. Instead of telling consumers how to troubleshoot. Why not FIX THE **** UPDATE. There r 4 updates that conflicts with each other. Also the configuration loop is **** stupid. Failure to configure
 dont turn off ur computer... ****... For how long? What kind of piece of **** technology is this?! Just to update. Cant wait for my mac to come in.

<h2>            Critical Error&#58; Start Menu and Cortana aren&#39;t working -- in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I justwent throught the Windows 10 upgrade process, and now my computer is crippled by a Critical Error dialogue box. It says, Start menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try ti fix it the next time you sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried signing out multiple times and the same thing happens. I've shut down and restarted, but that doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me back up and say that immediately after the upgrade installed, I didn't get this error, but the start menu button would not respond, nor would the "Search the web and Windows" window that is beside it. The MS Edge icon and some other icons in the task
 bar also would not respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could right click on the start menu and select shut down or restart. At one point I got an error that said Critical_Process_Died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restarted, I got the Critical Error about Start menu and Cortana aren't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One time when I left the computer off for an hour or more, when I restarted, everything seemed to respond in the task bar, but everything was slower than normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, when the laptop lid was lifted up and the sign in window appeared, the keyboard would not respond, so we couldn't log in. Had to force a shutdown and restart, and once logged in, everything loaded incredibly slowly. Just to get an email sent took
 a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then tonight, the same task bar items became unresponsive again: start menu, search window, MS Edge, etc. I could open one folder from the task bar folder icon, but could not right click and open a second window. So, I restarted and then the Critical Error
 window came up again once I logged in, referring to the Start menu and Corrtana aren't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now can't get it to go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the discussions, I see others are having the same problem, and they are being asked to answer a bunch of questions, which I've copied below to save some time. I'll answer what I can below, but please offer us a solution to get our computers usable
 again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUESTIONS FROM ANOTHER DISCUSSION WITH SAME PROBLEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, please try and launch the Feedback app by pressing WIN + R (to bring up the Run dialog) and entering "windows-feedback:?contextid=213" and log or +1 a feedback for this issue. Making sure the feedback explicitly mentions Critical Error
 Dialog will also help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS DOESN'T WORK</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, If you can't launch the feedback app (or even if you can), we have some questions that might help us get to the bottom of this faster (there are a lot, but sometimes the smallest detail can be significant):</p>

            <p>You obviously didnt read my post or have a clear understanding of what's happing. You can't use windows, for the most part when this error occurs. After restarting, I managed to get a desktop without the error, and even though everything was extremely sluggish,
 I managed to get to the command prompt to run the scan. Scan found nothing wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reviewed the other two steps you suggested, but one was to revert to a previous build. This was an upgrade from Win8, not the Win10 preview, so that was irrelevant. But the last step in that suggestion was to start up in safe mode. OK ... I can start in
 safe mode without the error, but who wants to run their system in safe mode. There's no functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third suggestion had to do with making the U.K. language work, and is also totally irrelevant.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting running my computer without antivirus software? Or do you mean to uninstall AV, restart the computer then reinstall AV?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I just tried uninstalling the AV software and then relaunched windows. Everything is extremely sluggish still. Things dont seem to be responsive on the task bar, but about a minute or two later, the response happens and I end up with a dozen winows

            <p>I have been struggling with this problem for weeks.</p>
<p>I have read all the threads, tried all the suggestions, nothing worked, except the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Manager, Startup, and I have Disabled everything. Restart.</p>
<p>For the first time since upgrading to Windows10 I now have Start Menu running.</p>
<p>I'll now go through the process of Enabling one by one to see which is the culprit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also now get into System, Update &amp; Security, Widows Update, and have installed all the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: By process of elimination I have found that there was a single service under Startup that was preventing Start Menu and Cortana running. Service was Microsoft(C) Register Server, and it was trying to start the following file lezqEdlu.ouv, which was
 located in directory C:\ProgramData\FaciWahj. These file and directory names showed nothing on Google or Bing, so believe they are random generated names created by some form of malware. Previously had infection of RocketTab which had been removed by McAfee.</p>
<p>I have Enabled all other services in Startup with no further problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information is</p>
<p>a) useful to those poor folk who have had to suffer this CRITICAL ERROR</p>
<p>b) helpful to Microsoft in getting a fix out asap</p>

            <p>After scouring the many troubleshooting techniques on Google and yelling many horrible profanities, I finally managed to get my computer working without that godforsaken "Critical Error" message. One thread was particularly useful, and it revolved around
 restarting the computer in safe mode. I didn't want to uninstall Avast like many posts suggested, because I could not activate safe mode before doing so. So, I followed the thread's instructions: (1) do as the error message says and click "sign out now." (2)
 When you get to the lock screen, on the bottom right corner, click on power options. (3) Before clicking "Restart," press and hold shift. (4) While holding shift, click to restart. Wait a little while, and you should get to a screen with several options on
 it. Your computer screen should look like the one displayed at&nbsp;http://www.howtogeek.com/107511/how-to-boot-into-safe-mode-on-windows-8-the-easy-way/ under the bold subtitle that says "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Using
 the Advanced Troubleshooting Tools to Actually Enable Safe Mode." (5) Click on&nbsp;</span><br />
"Troubleshoot", then (6) click on "Advanced Options", then (7) click on "Windows Startup Settings", then (8) click on "Restart." This option should reboot your systems with the new configuration set. As for my own case, I waited about an hour with a black screen.
 I was so fed up, that I pressed and held the power button on my Lenovo desktop until it shut down. I then booted it up again by pressing the power button, and this time I saw a Windows screen that said "Restarting." I waited until the lock screen popped up,
 typed in my password with my fingers crossed, and BAM- no critical error message. I think my computer is still in safe mode, but I have not come across any access restrictions yet, and I have been on Chrome, played a game, and tinkered with system settings
 without inhibitors. So I will leave it be, because my problem has been resolved, and things appear to be functioning just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! I know it sure helped me!</p>

            <p>I was able to get Windows to open without the error screen after shutting down completely, waiting a minute and then restarting. Then I uninstalled Avast and shut the computer down again. I think I restarted in safe mode, then shutdown again, completely.
 Waiting a minute and restarted in regular mode. Windows 10 started without the error. I reinstalled Avast and everything seems to be working fine. Though, I find Windows 10&nbsp;a little more sluggish than Windows 8 so far.</p>

            I simply uninstalled the last Windows 10 update downloaded on 10/01. No more Critcal Error. Seems Microsoft is now illegally updating Critical Errors. I tried to with the Support Help Desk last night and was told I had to pay for that level of support.
 Really? This smart Cookie is no techie but Microsoft is notorious for this kind of BS.

<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Find a setting&#34; in Settings always returns &#34;no results&#34;, but search for settings applets works from Cortana box and in Control Panel</h2>
                    <p>I am not able to search for settings from the "Find a setting" box at the top of the Windows Settings window. I believe this is a new problem following the update to the Fall Creators Update, but I'm not 100% sure it wasn't happening before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I enter the same search term in the Cortana/"Type here to search" box near Start, it finds the Settings just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found various suggestions on the Internet, but all seem to assume the problem includes searching from the Cortana search box and/or from the Control Panel. Both of those work fine for me. Only searching from within Windows Settings does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did confirm that&nbsp;C:\Users\Colin\AppData\Local\Packages\windows.immersivecontrolpanel_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Indexed is set to "Allow files in this folder to have contents indexed in addition to file properties." I tried unsetting it and turning it back
 on, with no change in effect. I also deleted my index folder for the whole system and had Windows rebuild. No change after indexing completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the search works (instantly) from everywhere except the Settings window, I believe the index is fine. The problem appears to be the actual Settings window itself. It's clearly not showing results from the index like the other search locations are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? What can I try to fix this?</p>

<h2>            All  Windows 10 UI Apps Including Store Has Disappeared From Start And Taskbar</h2>
                    <p>When I started my PC today to my surprise all the Windows 10 UI apps including Store had disappeared from Start and Taskbar. They were gone from Start and Taskbar without any trace. However I can see all of them in the 'Apps And Features' tab of the Settings
 app.The Settings app icon is invisible in the Taskbar when I open it. What is the problem behind all this and how can I get all my UI apps back in Start and Taskbar? Here are screenshots:</p>

            Repair or Reset the missing apps:
<br />
<br />    Open Settings, and select Apps.
<br />    On the Apps &amp; features tab, find the name of the missing app. Click the app and select Advanced options (if available).
<br />    If a Repair option is available, click Repair. If this option is not available, or if Repair does not resolve the issue, you may also try the Reset option, though you might lose any app data that was saved.
<br />    Once the repair or reset is completed, the app should again appear in the app list and can be pinned to the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and reinstall the missing apps:
<br />
<br />    Open Settings, and select Apps.
<br />    On the Apps &amp; features tab, find the name of the missing app. Click the app and select Uninstall.
<br />    Open Store and then reinstall the missing app. Once installed, the app should appear in the app list, and can be pinned to the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />3. Re-register the missing apps using PowerShell – If you have a lot missing apps, advanced users can instead attempt to restore all of them at once using the following PowerShell commands. Note, however, that if Steps 1 and 2 were already attempted and did not restore your missing apps, this PowerShell solution will also likely not succeed.
<br />
<br />    In Cortana, type PowerShell. In the search results, right-click Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />    In the Powershell window type the following commands. These steps may take a few minutes to complete.
<br />
<br />        reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
<br />
<br />        get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />        $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
<br />
<br />        get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />    Once the PowerShell commands are completed, the apps should appear in the app list, and can be pinned to the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you recently upgraded to Windows 10 1709, try rolling back:
<br />
<br />I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<h2>            Windows 7 Live Mail. Error message 0x80048840. Was working yesterday, but not today&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7. Live Mail. Error message 0x80048840. </p>
<p>"Unable to send or receive messages for the Gallery Plus - Live account. Server Error: 0x80048849. Server: 'https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/Sync.aspx'. Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x80048849"</p>
<p>Found and tried the&nbsp;suggestions on other threads of&nbsp;going into IE Tools - changing LAN to 'automatically detect settings' and Advanced - Security: unticked&nbsp;Check Server Certifiacte Revocation - all makes no difference.</p>
<p>Network is fine. Broadband is fine. Live mail is not fine.</p>
<p>I've changed nothing since yesterday when it was working fine&nbsp;(apart from those settings above - and have tried both with those settings changed and without).</p>
<p>Don't particularly want to change it over to POP as it won't sychronise my account for use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Seems to be an intermittent fault. Sometimes it works without any issues; some days it starts out refusing to work, then miraculously recovers; other days refuses to work and comes up with this error message all day long.</p>
<p>It's SO frustrating as there seems to be no rhyme nor reason for it.</p>
<p>HELP!!! There must be a simple&nbsp;solution for this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As an initial troubleshooting step, I suggest that you reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail.<br />

Please follow the steps on this article below.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, but I've already tried that and it made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strange thing is that it's an intermittent problem - it's working fine right now!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to work better on my work BT wireless connection. On my home Orange wireless connection there are often more problems (though not always), which I don't understand as it's linked to a remote account, so the server shouldn't make any difference should
 it? I don't have any other problems with my broadband at home and my other laptop (which isn't linked in to the Live Mail account doesn't have any problems)..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've stopped downloading updates as the problem seemed to start after I'd downloaded and installed one of them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else you can suggest?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The error code that you are getting has something to do with connectivity. Your internet connection has big impact on this issue, based from your description that you mostly experience this issue when your Orange&nbsp;wireless connection, please be informed
 that there is always a big chance for a wireless internet connection to be interrupted which will caused you to get connectivity error code like this when sending or receiving emails through your Windows Live Mail. I strong suggest for you to use a wired internet
 connection to ensure continuous internet supply and eliminate connectivity issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Please refer to the Private Message Tab as I ask for information that I need to further investigate your concern.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to sign using any active login credential in order for you to see and reply to&nbsp;my private message.</span></p>

            <p><span>As what Marthee_E mentioned, this issue relies on your internect connectivity. What you can use to resolve this issue is use a wired internet connection or configure your account through POP3.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, I suggest that you perform the following steps to make sure that Windows Live Mail client is not contributing to the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A. Windows Update</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Update.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If any updates are found, click View available updates.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select the optional updates that you want, and then click Install. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>B. Remove your account from Windows Live Mail</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click the account in question, and then click Remove account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Yes to confirm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>C. Perform Windows Live Essentials repair</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Start button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Programs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Programs and Features.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Navigate your programs then right click Windows Live Essentials 2011.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Uninstall/Change.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Repair all Windows Live Products.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>D. Add your account in Windows Live Mail</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Windows Live Mail by clicking the Start button . In the search box, type Mail, and then, in the list of results, click Windows Live Mail.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the lower-left corner, click Mail.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the Accounts tab, and then click Email.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type your email address, password, and display name, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Follow any additional steps, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Add another email account if you
</span><span>want to add more accounts, or click Finish to start using Windows Live Mail.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>To add a Gmail account, change your Gmail settings to enable POP or IMAP access before adding the account.</span>
</li><li><span>To add a Yahoo! account, you need to have Yahoo!

<h2>            BootMGR, Windows Recovery and BIOS not working</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So the issue started as a "Boot MGR missing/corrupt. System cannot boot" etc etc error. I've had this a few times over the years so know how to fix it or recognize the guides that work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried booting from my Windows 64 install disc to run the system repair and see what I could see... After it finishes "windows loading files" from the CD (which I have tried 2 separate install discs and booting in all the ways available!) it gives me
 this!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.</div>
<div>2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next".&nbsp;<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer"</div>

</div>
<div>If I haven't made myself clear so far, the above comment is the result of me running the windows install disc! Which asks me to fix the problem by inserting the disc!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So to make sure I'm narrowing the problem to my HDD, which seemed obvious, I booted up from a spare HDD with windows on that was replaced a few weeks ago after the Mrs upgraded her HDD. That gives a "checksum data is incorrect - system cannot boot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So in one night 2 untouched HDDs, without any additions/deductions to their current state, suddenly become corrupt?... So I put my HDD in nmy partners computer to see if Windows loaded. It gets to the Windows Loading/Startup with the revolving image and
 then restarts the computer...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found a similar issue online who removed the Mobo battery for a few mins and reseated the graphics card and it fixed the problem and he could reinstall windows to fix his BootMGR error. That made no difference to me, and I had to remove the GFX card
 to get to the battery anyways!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So alas I have no idea what to do! I'm not even sure that it's a HDD error anymore as I cannot even get into my BIOS (both before and after the bios flash) as when I press the right button, the screen goes black and thats it forever. So I dont know if
 buying a new HDD will even work!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope this makes sense as theres 3 silmutaneous errors having a party in my computer now....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-BIOS/Mobo is potentially unresponsive</div>
<div>-Good old fashioned BootMGR error on 2 separate HDDs!</div>
<div>-Windows recovery environment cannot load from 2 different Win64 DVDs! On both HDDs!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help! :(&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></font></p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">Refer to the link and follow steps given in the KB article:</span></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)"><strong>Use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment to troubleshoot and repair startup

<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">I would suggest you to change the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to SATA (Serial Advanced Technology
 Attachment) drive in the System BIOS. You should be able to install Windows 7. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
a. Restart your computer and press the "F1" key on your computer keyboard as soon as you see the Windows logo appear on your computer screen.<br />
<br />
b. Press the "Up" or "Down" arrows on your computer keyboard until you've highlighted your computer's hard drive.<br />
<br />
c. Press "Enter" to see the BIOS settings for your hard drive. If the hard drive is IDE, then it will say "IDE" at the bottom of the hard drives description, and if it is a SATA hard drive, then it will say "SATA" unless there is a discrepancy with the BIOS
 settings. If so, you will have to change it from IDE to SATA.<br />
<br />
d. Press the "Up" or "Down" arrows on your computer keyboard until you've highlighted the SMART Support" option and press the "Enter" button.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">e. Press the arrows again to highlight the "SMART Short Self-Test" option and press "Enter."<br />
<br />
f. Press "Enter" one more time to start the test. The test should take about 1 minute and will change the BIOS setting from IDE to SATA if your hard drive is actually IDE but displayed as SATA.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">Also verify the ISO using a hash check (SHA1) and verify it matches the one listed on the MSDN website.
 If it does, try re-burning with disc verification turned on and try again.</span></p>

<div>Very good guide and what I used to fix my last BootMGR experience.</div>
<div><br />
<div><u><b>However:</b></u></div>
<div><u><b><br />
</b></u></div>
<div>-I cannot access BIOS menu the mobo menu as it goes to a constant black screen</div>
<div><br />
<div>-My windows logo is frozen when it reaches it that point, but I have to plug my HDD into another computer for that anyways! So I cannot complete<b> Method 2</b> either. Although it is a Sata drive and registers as Sata as far as I'm aware as I can access
 an F8 menu (to select boot priority) and it says it's Sata there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-When I try to enter windows recovery mode via 2 separate discs I get this error after it "loads the files":-</div>
<div><br />
<div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:
<div><br />
<div>1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.</div>
<div>2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next".&nbsp;<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer"</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance.</div>

<div>Thank you so much for responding to me :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also if I have to wipe the drive for an easier fix, I am more than happy. However I'm scared at this point that a fresh HDD into my computer wont work as I already plugged another fully functional one in to no avail :(</div>

<p>a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstalling the chipset drivers for my motherboard</p>
<p>b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restarting the PC&nbsp;</p>
<p>c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to Control panel/device manager/System devices and then unistalling every possible device (it is not possible to remove them all)</p>
<p>d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart PC and all devices removed in step C&nbsp;automatically reinstall themselves - restart PC once process is complete and the problem is solved</p>
<p>PS the problem device was a USB2 memory card reader</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will certainly help you
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>:
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to go to the device manager and
<strong>right-click</strong> on the device so that you will have the option to <strong>
upgrade the drivers</strong>. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturer’s website and install in
<strong>compatibility mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try to install the driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Right click </span></strong><span>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and select
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">previous
</span><span>the version of Windows from the drop down list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Also check with the computer manufacturer to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Refer: How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</span></strong></p>

            <p>This is quite typical of web mail.&nbsp; You can copy your contacts and inbox, but that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why you want Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; WLM is an application program on your computer that stores your email on your computer.&nbsp; You then can delete it from your webmail server.&nbsp; So, if you change providers, you still have your email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I know of to copy those stored folders from webmail, is to forward each of the emails in them&nbsp;to yourself.&nbsp; That can be very time consuming.&nbsp; When they arrive, you can put them in folders that you create on your computer under WLM.&nbsp; Then they
 are yours to keep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, that also means you now have the responsibility to back them up</p>

</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the Query on Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate your interest on windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>To begin with troubleshooting I would like you to answer the following question:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Are you facing the issue only with this game or other applications too?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>you can run the app troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To do so, please follow the below link and check if that helps.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><strong>h<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">ttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a></strong>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>if <span>&nbsp;</span>issue persists,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Update the driver</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>During Installation, Windows searches for the best Windows 10 driver for your machine.&nbsp;In a small set of circumstances, it may not be able to immediately find that driver at the time of installation.&nbsp;In these cases you may find that your Display
 Adapter is listed as “Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.”&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press<strong> (Windows key + X)</strong> and click on “<strong>Device Manager</strong>”.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Expand “<strong>Display Adaptor</strong>”.</span></span></li><li><span><span><strong>Right</strong> click on the driver and select <strong>Update driver software</strong>.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If <span>&nbsp;</span>the issue still persists,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps below to install the drivers in compatibility with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‘Properties’</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on the <strong>‘Compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 10 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            How can I pin the restart button &#40;or restart shortcut to task bar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having graphics issues with Windows 10 (old computer/graphics card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to pin a Restart Button (or Restart Shortcut) to task bar (as the task bar seems to be stable, when other menus are lost).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Right clicking desktop, new shortcut and browsing to system32 shutdown, it allowed me to create the shortcut, then pin to task bar, when I hit it, it runs something, but does NOT shutdown computer.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Provide the following information to assist you further:<br />
1)&nbsp;What’s happening when you click on shortcut key?<br />
2)&nbsp;Have you created shortcut for restart?</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you to create the shortcut for restart and check if it helps.<br />
1)&nbsp;First <strong>right-click </strong>on the desktop, choose New and then <strong>
Shortcut.</strong><br />
2)&nbsp;In the shortcut location box, you’ll need to enter the correct command.<br />
3)&nbsp;Restart Computer:&nbsp;<strong>Shutdown.exe -r -t 00</strong>(do not put period in the end).<br />
4)&nbsp;Shut down computer:<strong>&nbsp;Shutdown.exe -s -t 00.</strong><br />
5)&nbsp;&nbsp;After you click Finish, you should now have a new icon that you can double-click to immediately shutdown, restart</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please reply to us with more information for further assistance.<br />
Thanks.</p>
