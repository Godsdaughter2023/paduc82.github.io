<h2>            Windows 10 Wifi Connection Issues on Resume From Sleep &#38; Other Random Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm pretty good with Windows and troubleshooting but this one is beyond me and rather annoying and confusing. &nbsp;Normally it wouldn't be much of an issue for me &nbsp;but this is my Parents PC and the less they have to click around and ask question the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a Dell desktop with integrated wifi, I have checked with Dell support and updated the drivers, still the issue persists and I am told it is Windows doing this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already gone into the adapter and turned off the power saving mode. Unchecked "Allow Windows to Turn Off This Device"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read this before you assume anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem I have is that when the computer goes to sleep and then resumes the wifi will not auto reconnect to the home network. &nbsp;I have to click on the wifi icon on the taskbar, when the list that pops up it shows all surrounding wifi for a few seconds
 but not my home network which then displays after a second of two. &nbsp;I click on it and make sure "Connect Automatically" is checked and reconnect to it manually. &nbsp;So why wont Windows find and reconnect to my home wifi on its own when waking up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Problem. &nbsp;Half the time the "Connect Automatically" box is unchecked randomly in the network list which prevents the PC from connecting to it when booting up. &nbsp;Why is Windows randomly deciding when the box can stay checked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 3. &nbsp;My internet connection randomly stops working. Let me explain. &nbsp;When the PC has been idle for some time, not asleep. &nbsp;Or when the PC has been asleep and resumes and I manually reconnect to the network because Windows wont. &nbsp;My connection wont
 work properly. &nbsp;Pages wont load and I get the message "You are not connected to a network" . &nbsp;The wifi indicates it is connected. It is not listed as limited. &nbsp;Disconnecting and reconnecting wont fix it. Network troubleshooter says nothing is wrong. &nbsp;The only
 fix is to make sure I'm connected to the router and to then wait about one or two minutes and the connection starts working. &nbsp; What the heck is going on with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a DNS flush. &nbsp;I reset the IP Stacks I think I was told at one point "Access Denied" but then I got a message it was successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other PC's and devices connected to the router that work fine. &nbsp;When this PC isn't connecting properly &nbsp;the others are so I know I have no issue with the DSL or modem here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to roll this back to the craptastic Windows 8.1 from Windows 8.2 ooops I mean Windows 10.. hahaha. &nbsp;Seriously Windows 10 is like Windows 8 but just with more random problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I fix all this?</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Wade,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting is Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to&nbsp;assist you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your efforts in trying to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
I would suggest you to follow the methods below and check if this helps:
<p>
</p><p>You know that windows 10 is totally different from win 7 or 8. You need to get some updates to adjust your computer to the new system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What &nbsp;is the make and model of the router?</p>
<p>You may&nbsp;try and check&nbsp;if the router&nbsp;is working fine and then try the suggestions below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method1:</strong> Try to uninstall and re-install the Network Adapter drivers.
</p>
<p>You may follow these steps to uninstall and reinstall the Network Adapter drivers:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press “Windows Logo” + “R” keys on the keyboard and type “<strong><em>devmgmt.msc</em></strong>” in the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” Command box and press “Enter”.</li><li>In the “Device Manager” window, search for the Network Adapter drivers, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this device</em></strong>”.
 You may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> You can try installing the drivers in compatibility mode and check if this helps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the ‘<strong>Windows </strong>key on the keyboard.</li><li>Type <strong>compatibility</strong> in the search box and then press <strong>
enter</strong>.</li><li>Click “<strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>” option from the list appeared in the left side.</li><li>Select the drivers and install.</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We are happy to help.</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward&nbsp;to hear from you again.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Mapped Drive RED &#34;X&#34; Solved by Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc-31  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mapped Drive RED &#34;X&#34; Solved by Microsoft &#40;Finally&#33;&#41; But I cannot replicate the Instructions provided.</h2>
                    <p>The notorious "RED X Mapped Drive Syndrome" is well documented and has gone on for more that 7 years to my knowledge. When I installed my first NAS and could not get it to connect due to the Mapped Drives failing to be accessible, I embarked on a long struggle
 to find an answer. When on Win 7, &nbsp;one of the last links I discovered was from a software writer who identified the issue and decided to produce a Batch File to address the problem. This batch file called MAPDRIVE &nbsp;worked flawlessly throughout my use of Win
 7. Unfortunately moving to WINDOWS 10 revealed that it was not compatible, and brought the grief back. &nbsp; I then took a chance and called Microsoft's Help desk and managed to find a knowledgeable rep named Ariel. He did a Remote into my PC and after a short
 while and many re-boots, the RED X Syndrome was no more! &nbsp;I then repeatedly rebooted many times as I could not believe he actually solved what no one else prior (again to what I and many others could find) could accomplish.</p>
<p>The final request I made of him was to email the Step By Step he took to insure that all the Mapped Drives would be available each time I booted up. Unfortunately these original instructions never reached me and after multiple phone calls back to the Help
 Desk did a rep cobble together supposedly from his notes what one needed to do to perform this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Original text was a bit sketchy (for I am not as well versed in DOS as others) so I did a Step By Step myself as I rewrote the instructions as I would be using them regularly,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I cannot get the procedure (as written) to work. when I pull up the CMD command, I get no Mapped Drives shown. When I use the "net use" command, no Mapped Drives appear in explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm hoping others with more knowledge than I can make whatever corrections are required to make this work. Below are my instructions (Top ) and the original Help Desk instructions.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please just Add/Subtract to the below if you see any error:</p>

<h2>            Right Click cast to device not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Since after updating my Windows 10 on the 16/3/2017, the cast to device function is not working anymore.</p>
<p>After I right clicked and choose it to cast to my Xbox 1, the small windows comes up and the small spinning wheel just keeps spinning and shows "contacting network device..." and that's it.</p>
<p>I've allowed media streaming in the WMP and I can't seem to find any solution.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

            I'm having the same problem casting video to my Sony Bravia after the update of 15/3/2017.&nbsp; However, I can cast photos to the TV, so the device is setup properly.&nbsp; Cast to device from Microsoft Edge seemed to make the connection OK, the TV screen went
 black, but video never appeared and the TV reset.

<p>I can cast to ALL devices with music or pictures, any video file leaves cast to device hanging with contacting device. I have tried all known troubleshooting with no solution, weird that only video files no longer work.</p>

            <p>Had same problem. Uninstall 3/15/17 Windows update and no longer problem. Security update can remain.<br />
UPDATE:</p>
<p>MS <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>re-installs</em></span> the update and "Cast to" stops working.</p>
<p>Uninstall it again and "Cast to" works again.</p>
<p>There is obviously a problem with the 3/15/17 update (date changes on 2nd install).</p>
<p>MS needs to fix. More and more evidence - 10 is a bummer.</p>
<p>Can we selectively install updates and stop all others?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just installed&nbsp; kb4015438&nbsp; which is supposed to fix previous update problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So far, so good. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It remains to be seen whether a subsequent update will cause the problem to re-occur.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I had to look for this. Why was fix not auto updated? </strong></p>

            <p>Same thing with Sony Bravia TV. Even after uninstalling the March 15 update I still have the issue (although it keeps reinstalling itself.)<br />
</p>
<p>Some videos still work but I can't find any rhyme or reason as far as formats. Even then, they only work intermittently. These are all files that streamed properly in the past.</p>

            There's not really a way to do that for these purposes unless the two partitions are contiguous on the same physical hard drive. &nbsp; The easier solution would be to move content off of C: over to D: (for example, drag your Documents and Pictures folders
 to some place on the D: drive) to make enough room on C:.

<p>That's what I of course did already, hence my question. My D: partition is not contiguous, but a separate micro-sd 32 GB card.</p>
<p>With the anniversary update however the solution I proposed was offered, which gave me the opportunity to perform the upgrade. So any suggestion is welcomed.</p>

<p>Yes, moving your library folders should clear up space on your C Drive, <del>but&nbsp;<span>DO NOT</span>&nbsp;drag your Documents library onto your other drive, you can brick your system doing this!</del></p>
<p><em>Moderator Edit: it is supported and recommended to drag special folders to reassign their location and will not cause any harm.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to move your library folders (Documents, Music, Pictures . . . etc.), create the appropriate destination folder on your D Drive first, then right click a library folder, select Properties. Then on the resulting dialog, click the 'Location' tab
 and click 'Move' &nbsp;and redirect to the new folder you created on your D drive . . .</p>

<p>@Dave - dragging a special folder ('shell folder') to reassign it's location is not hazardous and won't hurt a system.&nbsp; It's documented, supported, and even the actual recommended way of moving a folder.&nbsp; Sure you can use the properties "Location" tab of
 the folder, but dragging the folder to a new place is what Microsoft recommends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the folder that is by default under C:\Use\name\videos\captures, captures is a special shell folder and has a location tab (just like Videos, Documents, Pictures and many others). &nbsp; But if you look up how to move a special folder, such as OneDrive
 or that Captures folder, you'll see the official instructions are to "just drag it wherever you want".&nbsp; The location tab in the properties will update itself automatically, it is not a dangerous thing to do and certainly won't "brick" a system.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Desktop Icons not showing</h2>
                    Hi, I have a dell all-in-one desktop, running windows 8. I've noticed that for the past couple days, my computer has been doing something weird. After logging on to my computer, it sends me to my desktop page as always, but there arent any icons. The icons
 on the taskbar load as normal (skype and spotify), but the desktop icons never load. I've looked around already, when I rightclick the desktop and hover over 'view', it says the icons are showing. No matter how many times I check and uncheck that option, they
 never appear. The only time they seem to appear is when I go to my files, click on the desktop folder, and wait. And it slowly loads until the icons appear, but this time consuming process can take up to half an hour or more. Whats going on? I have Norton
 antivirus, I've done numerous quick scans but it finds nothing. What should I do?

<h3> ullrichfischer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 explorer loses its place in a list of files when focus changed away from explorer window then back to it.</h2>
                    <p>I'm editing a series of image files with PC Paint.&nbsp; I have a list of about 200 files in a windows explorer window and am going through them one at a time to crop and delete irrelevant details, then saving the file and opening the next one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The explorer
 window keeps scrolling to the top of the list every time I switch from the explorer window to the pc paint window (by right click, edit on the file from the explorer window).&nbsp; Windows 8.1 would stay scrolled to wherever I was in the list when I was doing the
 same process there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've looked for settings that might get me back to the Windows 8.1 behaviour in these circumstances, but have been unable to find anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone know of a way to recover Windows 8.1 functionality in this context without going
 through the hassle of resetting my laptop back to Windows 8.1?</p>

<p>2. No.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I'm referring the the program which comes with Windows 10 and is just called Paint.&nbsp; It looks suspiciously like PC-Paint. did.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phenomenon is not consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can reproduce it by opening a file by right clicking on the file name, selecting Edit from the options there.&nbsp; That brings up Paint with the file open in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then set up a selection rectangle in the image, click
 on crop, save the file, then go back to the explorer window only to find that the window has scrolled up to the top of the list of files that I'm working on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I just open the image file, but don't make any changes in Paint to the image file, then when
 I close Paint and go back to the explorer window, the image file name is still highlighted and visible in the Explorer window.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm if I close paint, it doesn't lose its place in the explorer window, but if I leave the previous paint window up and just edit
 the next file, when I go back to the explorer window after changing and saving that image file, the windows explorer has lost its place and is showing the first page of the list of image files.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I scroll down (way down) to the file I was working on,
 it is still highlighted and shows the new, reduced size. </p>

            Well, I can't give you step by step instructions as how to reset it back to default but I can suggest. Back up all your data as you may lose it restoring. When you boot your pc, you should get a screen according to the manufacturer. There may be a message
 at or near the bottom that tells you to press any f key to access. If you are lucky, one may be factory reset. You can try that but again, no guarantee that your stuff will be saved. If you have no options, there is a way to make what they call bootable media
 for your pc but that will require you to do a clean install which from what you say, is out of the question. Sadly, it looks as if that is the only way to go right now man. Wish there was another way but it sure doesn't seem like it. One last thing to try
 would be system restore. You will not lose your files but you will lose programs installed after the date that you did the restore too. Again, make sure to back your data up before you attempt this solution. Make sure to chose a date to

<h2>            Lifecam Cinema - focus issue</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I just brought a lifecam cinema.&nbsp; It's running on 32-bit WindowsXP, SP3, with the latest Microsoft webcam software.<br />
<br />
My Lifecam Cinema seems to not be auto-focusing.&nbsp; I'm 3 feet from the webcam, and I'm blurry and unfocused.&nbsp; The objects in the room are also blurry.&nbsp; The only thing that is in focus is if I take an object and hold it about 3 inches from the webcam.&nbsp; The focus
 seems to be right in front of the lens.<br />
<br />
I've tried playing with the focus setting under the microsoft Lifecam software.&nbsp; I've tried it with the "auto" check on the focus setting.&nbsp; I've tried unchecking the auto and manually moving the focus slider bar around and hitting apply.&nbsp; No difference in focus
 - everything behind a few inches of the lens is out of focus.<br />
<br />
I've tried different light levels.&nbsp; I've tried moving locations and setting the webcam up on another XP box.&nbsp; No improvement.<br />
<br />
Is it possible the unit I have is defective, and not auto focusing?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            Just to close the loop - yes, the webcam was defective.&nbsp; I got a replacement and it focuses fine.&nbsp; So, the first one had auto focus issues.&nbsp; This is just to help those who look this up in the future.

                    So I've bought my little brother an xbox one and for the sake of convince, is it legal for me to have my own account set up on his xbox and make it a home console so he can use my xbox live and share my games? Or do I really have to get another xbox live
 subscription for him?&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Which operating system have you installed on your gaming computer?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to the Windows 7 Compatibility website and the Fallout 3 FAQ’s, Fallout 3 is not compatible with Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=Fallout%203&amp;v=Bethesda%20Softworks&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;s=Fallout%203%20GOTY&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=Fallout%203&amp;v=Bethesda%20Softworks&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;s=Fallout%203%20GOTY&amp;os=32-bit</a>

<p>I would suggest you to run the game in compatibility mode and check if this helps in resolving your issue:</p>
<p>1. Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
<br />
2. Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</p>

==================================================<br />
<br />
The broken port may be affecting all of the USB circuitry. On the broken port if the little pins are exposed make<br />
sure they are not touching.<br />
<br />
You probably need a real computer shop (one that does its own in-house servicing on Acer and not leeks and
<br />
peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or Acer's Support.<br />

<h2>            Unable to access or recover skype account &#40;probably hacked&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently unable to access my skype account ("luca_malatesta", not linked to the account I'm currently using to create this question). It looks like my password has been changed, and I've been disconnected from all the existing skype sessions on my
 desktop, laptop, mobile etc. Last time I was able to log in was last week, today I started being kicked out from all sessions as soon as I opened skype app. I don't know if this is due to someone hacking the account or to something else. Also, the email associated
 with that account no longer exists (I changed it back in the day, but it looks like the change had no effect and the old address is still being considered).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried account recovery (using a different email address) and answered all the questions I could. Unfortunately, I got an email saying Microsoft couldn't validate it was me, and I can't find answers to more questions since I'm not able to access my
 profile anymore. In the email it was also said that my account has been blocked as a security measure. Problem is, my credit card is registered on that account, and I'm afraid the possible hacker may have got access to the card details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I recover my account, or at least check what operations have been performed since the last time I logged in? If it won't be possible to recover the account, may I ask to shut it down for good, to be sure no other abuses can be operated in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone who could help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Is it possible to force uninstall a windows update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since some times now, each time I reboot my computer, there's a process that is bothering me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It uses up to 30% of cpu for about 10 minutes and it also is a windows update. (you can guess its TiWorker.exe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here's the path to the file</p>
<p>C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_31bf3856ad364e35_6.3.9600.17709_none_fa7932f59afc2e40</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also pretty sure it's related to the following update : https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/kb/3021910</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any thing I can do to make it stop slowing up the boot process? Is that a normal thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

</p><p>If the message you are trying to recover was sent/received for the last 30days, you can still recover it by signing in to Skype on a different device. But if the message was sent/received way back the 30days period, there is no longer an option to recover
 it.</p>

            Hi,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An IP camera is a web cam that is used for security surveillance and the data can be directly access over a network connection. As you can access these over the network connection, you will need a device&nbsp;password to access them as they are secured. The device
 password is provided by the manufacturer of the webcam. So I would suggest you to get the password from the manufacturer and then set up the IP cam. Once you're able to setup the IP cam, you will be able to access it on Windows 10 or even on a smart phone.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. </p>

<h3> winnieennenga  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I correct the spelling of my User Name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Surface Pro 4 256GB, i7, &nbsp;16 GB at a Microsoft Store in Omaha, NE, which has since closed. Like a lot of other community participants, I think Microsoft post-purchase support is lousy. Hopefully someone in the community can answer these two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The sales associate was trying to be helpful and set up my user id with the wrong spelling. Is there a way for me to correct this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The battery life on my Surface is just over two hours, from fully charged. I have an extended warranty. Does this mean they'll fix it or just talk about things to do to reduce battery use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Oh yes, the sales associate entered a password that he didn't share with me. Is there any way to retrieve that?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Winnie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry this happen to you, lets start with some of the basics and see if we can work on a solution from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is your user account a Microsoft account or a local account? If it is a Microsoft account, it should have a email tied to your account name, if not then its a local account. If it is a local account you can just create a new user account with Admin rights
 and just delete the other account. To do this just swap from the right &gt; click settings &gt; click Accounts &gt; from here you can create a new user account set it as a admin and then delete the other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.As a heavy user of the Surface pro 4 i would say you should get around 5-6 hours of battery life when normal usage.
 that. Make sure you have all Windows updates installed on your Surface. This is super important because those updates are design to fix a ton of misc problems with the Surface pro 4. If you are still having issues you can send your device in to
 have to register your Surface pro 4 to your Microsoft account if you did not already do this. You will have to ship the device out and they will repair it or replace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How do you log into the device without the Password? Is there a Pin set up on the device that allows you to log in? If so just go back to Step 1 or the second part of step 2 and that will take care of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if any of this has work</p>
        </p>

            You can edit the details of your MSID <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-the-name-on-your-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-the-name-on-your-microsoft-account</a> - but without the password, you will be stuck. You can try
<a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a> - but I suspect that this may also prove to be a problem. If you are logged in with the problematic ID, give these a try. Otherwise, your best option is to set up
 a new user with the spelling and password you want.
