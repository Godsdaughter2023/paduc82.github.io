<h2>            Programs Staying Behind Fully Maximized Programs</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if this is in the wrong section. Feel free to move it to the correct one if it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I am currently in Internet Explorer (sub any program) and it's full screen. IF I go to my taskbar and click on control panel (sub any program) it will generally open over my Internet Explorer Window. However, let's say I wish to minimize control
 panel. It's STILL open, it's just minimized to the taskbar. Now, let's say I need that window again. IF I click on control panel (which is still open) it will NOT appear over my Internet Explorer window. It WILL be there BEHIND it. I have to minimize Internet
 Explorer in order to see it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will do it even if I have Internet Explorer in the "half screen" mode and the control panel is, say, in the "middle" of the screen. I'll see part of it BEHIND Internet Explorer. And forget about trying to click on it to move it over Internet Explorer.
 It will NOT work. It will just drag BEHIND Internet Explorer. Now, mind you, it doesn't matter what programs I use. Internet Explorer and control panel were JUST examples.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, my problem is: WHY won't a program "restore up" ON TOP of other windows?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did NOT happen to me on XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 OR Windows 8.1. It is ONLY Windows 10. I know of at least 3 other people that have this same problem. I suspect that number is astronomically higher. I am almost positive this is a Windows 10 glitch.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked this question before and I decided to give up as the "so-called" microsoft employee that responded, didn't even know the difference between "restore down" and "minimize". Plus, I have read other forums of people asking the SAME question and
 NO ONE can even seem to understand what they are saying, let-alone give a plausible answer. In fact, in one case a guy that answered was so sure of himself that he almost demanded his answer was correct and "close the thread" but will "leave it open in case
 others have similar issue". This guy suggested turning off "hover mode" on the mouse. That is NOT AT ALL what the problem is!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suspect maybe microsoft KNOWS what the problem is, and currently has no solution. I suspect it is a built in glitch on Windows 10 that might require a major overhaul of Windows 10. So they are just walking around it to avoid it.<br />
</p>

<p>Hello Dixie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could have happened due to corrupted Windows component. If Windows 10 have features that are not working properly, we suggest that you run the System File Checker tool and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool to scan and correct any issues.
 System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in the operating system. SFC checks for system file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation
 Environment image.<br />
<br />
Kindly follow the steps in this article posted by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)">

<p>Sir, I do not mean any disrespect; but your answer is part of the problem I am talking about. This has been a typical experience with EVERY problem I have mentioned on this website. MOST of the time, I have had to solve the dern problem myself. In this case,
 I am now convinced it is a built in Windows glitch that should have never happened. Why can't microsoft just ADMIT when they have messed up; rather than trying to "beat around the bush" OR "blame the customer".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either microsnot (eh hem, I meant microsoft) is aware of this problem and has no intentions of fixing it, is trying to find a fix and just "beating around the bush" in the meantime, OR just plain doesn't know and doesn't care! The latter is probably most
 likely the case. The reason is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a supposed microsoft employee doesn't even know the difference between "restore down" and "minimize", they would not understand the problem I am having, let-alone be able to find out what's causing it, and certainly wouldn't be able to fix it! Also:
 if they are in a position for microsoft that involves "helping the customer resolve a problem" and said employee doesn't know the difference between "restore down" and "minimize", they certainly aren't going to care enough to want to fix it. Thus why I say,
 "they probably don't know and don't care!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is NOT a corrupt file. At least not one that a "file checker" is going to correct. I know this because of the following: from the moment I got this computer home and turned it on, I have had this problem. I know of other people with the same exact problem.
 It also appears on computers I've played with in walmart and microsoft stores. So, IF it is a "corrupt file", then you might want to step back and ask yourself: WHAT is wrong with Windows 10? DUH!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Buck Owens once said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You know people that don' know nuthin'? This'n don' even suspect nuthin'!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is apparently something that will require a "do-over" of the entire Operating (if you can even use that word) System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems with Windows 10. If I was to write a book about it, the prologue itself would have to be a novel!</p>

<p>
</p><p>You didn't mention Taskbar thumbnails in your scenario but you need to include (or exclude) use of them to provide a satisfactory repro procedure.&nbsp; So, when you say "click on control panel" you should be precise about what you are actually doing and to do
 it effectively you should be doing it with a Taskbar thumbnail.&nbsp; Does your problem symptom still happen then?</p>

                    The problem started after the 1803 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if I record any full screen game, it records the whole video as a black video. But it doesn't happen with the windowed mode.

<p>I have played through fallout a few times now but i can never quite manage to&nbsp;finish clearing out the deathclaw nest near sloan. Every time i try i always get about 2 or 3 of them and then i die.</p>

<p>The best (safest) way I've found to kill deathclaws is to snipe them from a safe distance from a safe location. A scoped sniper rifle or anti material rifle gives you the needed firepower. &nbsp;Don't use VATS, just use the scope. Crouching into the sneak position
 increases rifle accuracy AND makes it hard for them to detect you. Safe locations include cliff ledges they can't reach, or those nice conveyor belt towers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can acctually leave that particular part of the gameplay alone till you level up a bit, then come back to it, and finish things off. If you have the complete game edition, just guy the GRA Antimateriale Rifle with explosive rounds, those deathclaws go
 down fairly easy.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the regular game alone, a sniper/antimaterial rifle in sneak mode utilizing temp skill boost magazines for guns and critical hit, coupled with psycho, armor piercing ammo does wonders on deathclaws.</p>

<p>Always try to kill alphas and mothers first. Once you initiate combat, if you are not prepared, these things will be your worst nightmare. They are stronger, faster and more of a pain in the rear. Another thing to keep in mind would be to keep moving. Never
 stand still, as the deathclaws are much faster than you are, and if you stop to shoot, you are dead. So a tactic that I use effectively is to get either a high powered rifle such as the AMR, the Sniper Rifle, the Hunting Rifle (Or any weapon in 45-70 Govt.)
 and start out far away sniping. Pretty common suggestion. However, when they get close let them lunge, and then jump out of the way. If you time the dodge right, you should have a chance to fire before the try to swing again. If this kills them, good. Save
 and then move on to the next one. If not, repeat until they die, or switch to an automatic weapon (Try and avoid cumbersome heavy weapons) and aim center mass. This should help you out. Have fun in New Vegas! And good hunting friend!</p>

^This. The Deathclaws, at least in my experience, won't go up on top of the digging equipment, so you're free to shoot without danger.</p>

<p>I cripple their legs with a Grande launcher, or Plasma grenade and then finish them however with ease. They walk extremely slow and can rush you. Just make sure it's not a bunch of them. You might not be able to cripple all their legs at once.

            Hi YashSaxena
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />On Dell site, I notice a driver of higher version. 20.10.1.1190. Can you install this? Uninstall the existing driver first and then install this.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/in/en/inbsdt1/product-support/product/inspiron-15-5568-2-in-1-laptop/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/home/in/en/inbsdt1...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi YashSaxena,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />I suggest you to remove your WiFi driver:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "Network adapter"
<br />4. Right click on your network wifi adapter
<br />5. Click on "Uninstall Device"
<br />
<br />Then perform a disk clean up :
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />
<br />Once finished, go to Dell support site and download your wifi driver (Check on your notebook if you have a Intel or a Qualcomm adapter), then install it. Reboot your system and check if now your wifi connection is running.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if there are problems with the procedure, or if that solves your issue.

<p>i&nbsp; seen many users having trouble to install network drivers , but they try to&nbsp; install using setup.exe file And they failed &nbsp; messages .</p>
<p>
</p><p>another way is to&nbsp; get&nbsp; three files&nbsp; namely &nbsp;&nbsp; driver.inf ,&nbsp; drivercat.cat &nbsp; and&nbsp; systemdver.sys&nbsp; .</p>
<p>those&nbsp; 3&nbsp; files&nbsp; are important . File names&nbsp; are&nbsp; examples only.</p>
<p>Its&nbsp; better&nbsp; to&nbsp; search the correct&nbsp; driver&nbsp; by providing hardware<span> Intel dual band wireless ac-3165&nbsp;</span> device ID&nbsp; in internet</p>
<p>
</p><p>get&nbsp; zip filefrom internet , then unzip , go to device manager&nbsp; fom there you can install&nbsp; the driver .</p>
<p>Its&nbsp; very easy to install ,it&nbsp; does not require&nbsp; huge&nbsp; files&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App Left&#47;Right Scroll arrows missing in some photo folders but not all</h2>
                    <p>Just returned from a trip where I shot thousands of photos. I had uploaded them to google drive, then copied them to my PC upon my return. When I open the folder and click on a photo, the Photos App displays the file. However, I am unable to move to the
 next photo in the folder while still in Photos App. After working on the current file and saving it, I have to close the App and click on the next photo. Wasting time doing this. In other folders that I transferred files directly from an SD card, this does
 not happen and the Left/Right scroll arrows are present and work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anywhere in the folder or App to click or un-click something that prevents the left/right scroll arrows from being present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>The app doesn't seem to like directories with large amounts of pictures in them.&nbsp; I can open 1 folder (usually from my HomeServer on my network) with a few pics and it works right away, but then if I open another directory with more pictures it won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround (which is super annoying BTW to have to do!&nbsp; Esp when it works sometimes!)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;- in Explorer in the directory with your pictures hit Ctrl-A to select all pictures (or manually select a sub-set), then hit Enter.&nbsp; Then you can right/left through all the pictures that were selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or: </p>
<p>1 time only:&nbsp; Right click | Open with -&gt; Windows Photo Viewer </p>
<p>Change the default:&nbsp;Right Click | Open with -&gt; Choose another app, you can set it to be the default.</p>

<h2>            Using touch changed today in Smartglass Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I used to be able to use touch in Smartglass on my Win8.1 PC to move the "mouse" cursor in IE on my Xbox One. All of a sudden today instead of just moving my finger around on the screen and having the cursor follow me, there are arrow key buttons around
 the A button. What a pain! Is there any way for me to be able to drag around again? It was so useful before and is so
<strong>not</strong> useful now! Maybe there is a setting I'm not seeing?</p>

<h2>            Error message&#58; &#34;We weren&#39;t able to connect to the Store. This might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection timed out &#34;and unable to connect to Windows Store.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: New Windows 8 Surface 1 RT cannot open Windows Store</p>
<p>My old Windows 8 Surface RT fell victim to the 8.1 update crash and received my new Surface RT in the mail.&nbsp; I have spent the last day trying to open the Windows Store and failing.&nbsp; All the other standard apps work and I am connected to the Internet without
 a proxy.&nbsp; I have tried a windows store reset in the Run command box, tried a system refresh and also the troubleshooting of my network connections (none found).&nbsp; The Windows Store app either resolves to a white screen with not&nbsp;resolving to an error (crash)
 or&nbsp;sits on the green screen for several minutes and then resolves to either no network connect (which I do have as I can read email, search on bing, etc.) or resolves to "We weren't able to connect to the Store.&nbsp; This might have happened because of a server
 problem or the network connection timed out.&nbsp; Please wait a few minutes and try again."&nbsp; Once I got the home screen for the windows store but when I tried to open the page for My Applications, then it resolved to the ... wait a few minutes error message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have been trying again, in the afternoon, evening, 1 am (when servers should be less burdened, and now this morning.&nbsp; I have no other apps on this machine as it is straight out of the box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can get into the Windows Store just fine from my windows 8.1 laptop through the same network.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, in the Windows Store error state, the touch screen stops working to close the app (swipe down) or switch to other apps (swipe in from left) - I can swipe in from the right and get Charms bar, but selections are not acted upon by the Operating System.&nbsp;
 The touch screen resolves correctly only when I disconnect the touch type cover.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why is the Windows Store app not working?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 blurry screen fonts</h2>
                    Until yesterday Windows 7 was working fine for me. Then today, for no apparent reason, the screen fonts all look blurry. I've checked resolution settings, turned ClearType off and on again and deselected and reselected the option to smooth font edges,
 but nothing solves the problem

            I'm afraid this didn't help. It's definitely not a hardware problem as it was all working fine until a couple of days ago.

<h2>            Why does album art appear on all my music not just the one I want it on&#63;</h2>
                    I wanted an album art image on only one of my songs, and all my music carries the same image! I deleted the picture file, but no use. What can I do to remedy this? I cannot figure out how to prevent this from happening. I wanted just one album art for
 one song, and the whole kit and caboodle has the same artwork! The songs are from four different websites, as well, all in .mp3 format.

<h2>            Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard play button</h2>
                    <p>A Windows 10 forced update broke my Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard play button. It still sort of works, but now the application window has to be in focus for it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be fixed so it works in the background like it used to?</p>

            <p>Ok - I found the fix. It was not caused by a Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone who has Spotify installed with Windows 10 x64, it can interfere with keyboard media buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this you have to disable "SpotifyWebHelper" under startup programs.&nbsp; Under search, type msconfig, then under the Startup tab, open task manager, then disable "SpotifyWebHelper" and reboot.&nbsp; Problem solved.</p>

<h2>            Lost Windows Key after Downgrade to Windows 7 and Hard Drive Failure</h2>
                    <p>I have a client with an Asus laptop that allowed a downgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some time, the hard drive crashed, including the recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obtained a replacement hard drive, and the OS and driver recovery disks, but do not have a Windows 7 key. I installed Windows 7, but am now in the grace period of 30 days without activation. How can I recover the key previously used on this same machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>

<h3> itslonewolf38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 with a ton of Problems. How do i fix Audio and crashes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I hvae now been wandering among all the forums i could find and nobody had neither a specific nor a working solution for me:<br />
<br />
I have dwnloaded the Forza Horizon 4 Standard Edition through Game Pass yesterday but i have a lot of issues with the game. (I'm on PC btw. Win10)<br />
<br />
The Story:<br />
<br />
After finishing the download yesterday, i have started the game. Everything ran smoothly I had Audio, and the Intro Videos were playing nicely.<br />
Then i arrived in the menu and noticed that there was no sound. I thought oh well a menu without sound isnt nice but it works. So i started the game. My Ears exploded because i suddenly had sound again. Then the cutscene ended and i again had no sound. I searched
 Forums, asked friends and so on and so on. I didnt understand how to fix it until today. I searched again and found out that unchecking the "Disable all enhancements" box in the windows sound configuration did the Job. But here is an other important information:
 With no sounds i was able to play the game i controlled the car and all that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted i unchecked the box in the sound config from windows, restarted my PC and then started the Game again. YAY Sound in the menu. I chose continue in the menu and it started loading. But before i was able to control the car even before the cutscene
 really started, my PC froze COMPLETELY. I wasnt able to start task manager, CTRL+ALT+DEL didnt work so my only option was to press the Reset Button. I thought this was a one time occasion and i started the game again but now it crashed my PC in the Loading
 screen itself. I tried giving Forza Horizon a higher Priority and all these things i read in forums but nothing helped. After changing some settings in my sound driver, that i will revert again, i have some awful noise jittering on my Headphones but that i
 know how to fix.<br />
<br />
btw, my PC is not the best but i checked that my PC can run it with the requirements. My Drivers are up to date and windows also doesnt have any pending updates on my PC. I've tried everything possible but nothing worked. I will not reinstall it because i dont
 think that would help. It would be a waste of time I dont know if there is a repair function for the windows apps like you have on steam where you can verify game files but if there is please tell me i didnt find it.</p>

<p>have you reset the Router as there might be a issue with the settings that has occurred you can normally do this by holding down the reset button on the back of the router for 5 seconds I think as this is with sky routers recommended timing and then do a
 network check after </p>

            <p>Greetings Devious!<br />I don't think this is related to your network equipment, but instead an issue with a failing hard drive. <br /><br />If its possible, try the following instruction steps up front and let us know if the error code goes away.<br /><br />If you have a USB flash drive, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">configure this for use with the Xbox 360</a>. <br /><br />With your console powered off, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safely remove the hard drive</a> and plug in USB drive to a USB port on your console. With the hard drive removed, power on the Xbox. Install the system update, when prompted to do so. Download your gamer profile from LIVE.<br /><br />Let's pause there and tell us if this worked as a solution and we'll work from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taidara thanks for the advice , when I tried to sign in with my profile on a USB there was no problem.</p>
<p>I would like to know why I was getting the 80151911 error when clearly it was not network related. Xbox support could not even identify the problem</p>
<p>I will now have to transfer my data to an external hard drive then re format my hard drive and hope this doesn't happen again.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

While it's possible that there was an issue with the hard drive specifically that was causing the conflict, but from the connection codes that you linked it looks like your console was having an issue with a Static IP and DNS.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It possible when you removed and reinstalled the Hard Drive it reset your console's network settings to factory defaults so it grabbed an automatic IP from your router. This would clear up your sign in issues so you could connect to Live.</p>

                    <p>I've got the Lumia 950XL and I just got Continuum working!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: How do I shut it down safely? Ctl-Alt-Del doesn't do anything....there isn't a shutdown button on the start menu....</p>
<p>Do I just turn off the phone? Or unplug the Display Dock?</p>

            <p>I was in a chat session for a half hour.....they kept telling me it works when you plug it in to everything....I knew that....I had it working (although I had to switch monitors....who knows why...one works with my Apple Mac Mini the other works with the
 Display Dock)....they gave me a link to the user guide...which tells us how to hook it up....no hints as to whether there is a correct method of shutting it down. After the half hour I unplugged the Display Dock....phone went back to normal....didn't SEEM
 to do any harm....it would have been nice if somewhere along the line they told us the way to stop Continuum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it will be interesting to see what state it is in when I plug everything back in.</p>

            Mhm. That question nags me as well. Several times already, my phone remained in Continuum mode after unplugging. On my Lumia 950, I see that via totally blurry icons of Word Mobile, for example. All the universal apps still start within desktop mode, rather
 than mobile mode.&nbsp;Happens quite rarely, but it happens. I have to&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/restart-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restart the phone</a>&nbsp;to overcome this. Would love to find an easier way.

<h2>            Sound keeps stopping</h2>
                    Hey Everyone
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a very strange issue. I will be listening to music on YouTube and playing a game, then Windows will make a funny noise, then the sound will stop for a second or 2. This has been happening a while and I finally cannot take it any more. I think I
 have found what the issue is, but I cannot figure out how to fix it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was in the Device Manager today, then it did it again and I realized that it removed 'Audio inputs and outputs' I have tried updating the driver for this, and also reverting to previous drivers, but with no luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a BenQ monitor by the way (BenQ GL2450) with built-in speakers and i'm using a HDMI cable. I have updated the divers for all these, including my Graphics Card (Radeon HD 6770) but no luck</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help will be greatly appreciated, as it is getting quite annoying</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks :)</div>

<div>Hi Melloorr,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure your speakers are correctly connected to your computer.</p>
<p>Many computers have three or more jacks that connect to a sound card or sound processor, including a microphone jack, line-in jack, and line-out jack. Your speakers should be plugged in to the line-out jack. If you're not sure which jack this
 is, try plugging your speakers in to each of the jacks to see if any of them produce sound.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker effects that are known as
<span>enhancements</span>. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, you might need to update your audio driver.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If these steps don't fix the problem, check the information that came with your computer or speakers, or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>

    <title>Display Driver Issue in Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottj3scottie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Driver Issue in Win10</h2>
                    <p>The display driver I have for the "Intel HD Graphics" seems to be causing my Win 10 installation to shutdown immediately upon "normal" boot of the Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; After Win10 boots and the icons appear the laptop will randomly power down in a matter of a
 minute or two.&nbsp; I can boot in to safe mode or low resolution mode and Win10 will stay up with no issues.&nbsp; I have gone to device manager and tried to update device drivers for the display but it says I have the latest already.&nbsp; But it seems to me this driver
 is causing an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp; can I delete or disable the Intel device driver and then reboot and let Win10 attempt to locate some compatible display driver?&nbsp; Any other suggestions as to a fix?&nbsp; I don't see anything on the Intel or Toshiba websites either (Intel chipset running
 on Toshiba Satellite laptop)</p>

            <p>Finally having a chance to troubleshoot this some more.&nbsp; So I attempted to remove the display driver using device manager.&nbsp; I can do that successfully, but as you might expect the screen then turns black and you can do nothing else.&nbsp; If I restart my computer
 (by holding down the power button) the computer will boot, but when it comes back up it has loaded the Intel video driver again and then will lock up shortly after boot as always.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess the question is per the advice given, how do I restart in recovery mode after I remove the display driver?&nbsp; Since the screen goes black I can't navigate to the repair boot options and select them.&nbsp; And the machine seems to "self heal" and load
 the bad Intel drivers again at the next normal boot.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating....</p>

    <title>Desktop Shortcut Icons Broken Revert To White Default Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop Shortcut Icons Broken Revert To White Default Windows 7</h2>
                    This problem seems to be well documented, however I've yet to get a fix to work reliably.<br />
I have a two-day-old install of Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />
This morning I installed some ASUS motherboard drivers and did a reboot and my desktop icons reverted to the default white windows icon. Broken.<br />
The interesting part is that only programs installed to my Drive E:\ were affected. Drive e:\ is my programs and data RAID 1 box. Programs on my boot drive (SSD) are fine. I tried the IconCache.db trick and it worked until I rebooted and now I have the same
 problem.<br />
This occurred when I had not patched any Windows Updates onto the computer. After applying ALL current patches and even optional patches the problem went away....for only one reboot. Then it came back. Still have broken icons from programs on e:\ but working
 icons for c:\ programs. A boot timing issue is what I'm now thinking? But why? Something else?<br />

            First, thank you for taking the time to reply.<br />
Method 1: didn't even detect there was any problem. Running made no difference.<br />
<br />
Method 2: When I click on the broken program icon the program pointed to in the shortcut lnk does in fact run correctly.<br />
<br />
Method 3: Didn't seem to apply as programs responded by opening to their file extensions.<br />
<br />
Epilogue:<br />
I loaded all possible windows updates in an attempt to "cure" the problem to no avail. What seems to fixed the problem was changing my external drive array from using USB 2.0 to USB 3.0 port. I loaded the USB 3.0 driver on my ASUS M5A88-V EVO motherboard and
 plugged into the blue plug on the motherboard and viola, problem solved. This fixed another strange behaviour that I'd noticed which was Windows 7 "power cycling" my external drive just at the moment prior to the Welcome screen appearing. My drive's power
 light would come on (meaning drive is off) and then go back to on. Very strange behaviour. I think this was causing the "timing" issue. I think Windows 7 momentarily didn't see the drive and listed the links as broken. At one point during the problem about
 20 minutes after a reboot I noticed all the icons were back on screen!&nbsp; I don't know why using the USB 3.0 port doesn't cause this problem but it boots differently now.<br />
<br />
Now, unfortunately, since running all the updates my computer seems to be showing signs of the dreaded "Windows 7 Randomly Freezes After Running Windows Update" problem. Yikes. This box ran solid as a production video NLE suite running Premiere since late November
 (three months) with no freezes, now I'm getting system freezes that need a cold reboot. This is a whole system freeze not just the keyboard and mouse. At the moment of freezing the computer also stops responding on the network which I take to mean the network
 card is also frozen. Something from Windows Update. Something. But what?<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that you were able to get this to work until a reboot occured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on that, something must be happening during the reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here is what I would like to try:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix the icons as you mentioned above.</li><li>Perform a clean boot with the following article:<br />
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></span></li></ol>
<p><span>Reboot the machine and see how the icons look.&nbsp; If they are good, then something that loads during startup is causing this and we can narrow it down with the clean boot methods in the article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please note that this may also help with the freezes you are experiencing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Matthew_Ha</span></p>
