<h2>            Xbox One - Black screen after startup</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a major issue with my Xbox One and really hope someone can help me. When I start up my Xbox One, it enters into the usual green screen &amp; Xbox logo , it gets pasts that, but then cannot go any further, it just then stays permanently black. It's the
 transition to the home screen which isn't working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried every solving step that's possible, nothing has worked. I'm starting to think it is an internal malfunction and I'm now looking into a repair job from Microsoft. I've only had it 4 months, unbelievable really. The only thing I did do, was turn
 off the console by the plug this morning and after that it went wrong, but Xbox Support said to me this wouldn't cause that kind of error. Very disappointed, it seemed as if Xbox Support were a little perplexed themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thoughts, advice, tips? any comments welcome</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>All fixed and up &amp; running now,&nbsp;thankfully. I think my issue was pretty major and slightly unknown to Xbox past issues&nbsp;- but we&nbsp;managed to open up (this morning) one of the options screens, and pressed factory default.
</p>
<p>That has seemed to of fixed it entirely and I'm so happy.&nbsp;All the games, apps &amp; the gamertag was all saved too&nbsp;is a real bonus too,&nbsp;I think there was an option for that.&nbsp;I was a bit worried because we started the reinstallation of that game today, and on
 31% the console turned itself off. However, I found out my console was on&nbsp;'Power up' mode meaning your console can contiune to install while you are off the console, I also&nbsp;found out the reason it turned itself off was&nbsp;because my 'auto turn off' if you like,
 was on one&nbsp;hour, hence why it went off as the update was definitely longer than one hour. I've now set that to six hours auto turn off, meaning my console will now stay on until that update/download is fully complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add to all that, I have also set up my Kinect sensor which arrived yesterday which is also great for what I need it for.&nbsp;You don't realise how important and great it is, until you do not have it for a bit. I thought it was going to have to be sent off
 for repair, but luckily it's all fixed, it's great to have it back up and running again.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you may be aware, the current build of Technical Preview contains two Windows Store apps – the old Windows 8.1 Store (simply called “Store”), and the new Windows 10 Store, called “Store (Beta)”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the forums, you can find troubleshooting methods for repairing the Store app – for example,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-windows_store/how-to-solve-windows-store-starting-issues/c4497a58-d287-465c-b547-0c83b2f8105b"><span><span>this
 Wiki article&nbsp;</span></span></a><span>provides an excellent compilation of these methods.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unfortunately, these techniques will generally only repair the older version of the Store in Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are having problems launching the new “Store (Beta)”, we recommend running the following PowerShell script to re-register the new Store:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>In the Search box, type&nbsp;<strong>CMD</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Right click on&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>In the command prompt, enter the following command:</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This did not work whatsoever, a matter of fact I actually got red text in CMD telling that I had an error. This was the error:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80070005, Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005<br />

NOTE: For additional information, look for [ActivityId] 9e78d208-c2dc-0000-534e-7a9edcc2d101 in the Event Log or use<br />

    <title>Keyboard Driver on Surface Pro 3 not Supporting One Particular Key on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marclang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard Driver on Surface Pro 3 not Supporting One Particular Key on the Type Cover Keyboard &#40;But on the Login Screen it Does&#41;</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago, my Type Cover keyboard on my Surface Pro 3 (running Windows 10) stopped supporting my "!" key (as I type this, I just had to switch to the on-screen keyboard to type the exclamation mark). I'm using a Swiss Keyboard layout, which has the
 exclamation mark, the square bracket (using AltGr), and the double dots for combining with vowels (e.g., press followed by a to create ä) on the same key. On a US keyboard this would be the ] and } key I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my TypeCover has seen some wear, expecially around the hinge (where one could already see a bit of the flat cable showing through), I simply assumed a hardware problem. As my warranty had just expired (just my luck) I went ahead and ordered a new Type
 Cover (I went for the Surface Pro 4 w fingerprint reader, yay). Once it arrived and I exchanged it for my old Cover, I was surprised that the "!" key was _still_ not working! (when you read this, remember that every time a "!" comes up I switch to the on-screen
 keyboard to type it) :-D<br />
<br />
I thus deduced that the Type Cover was fine all along, and that it must be my Surface that's the problem. Either a hardware or a software problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I reinstalled Windows 10 (using the "reset" feature). Worked like a charm, one hour later I had a clean Windows 10 install. During the login process, I came across the password login screen. I usually use a picture password, so I never really use the text
 password. However, being presented with the input box I decided to try out the keyboard right away. And it worked! (I switched to copy and paste now to type the "!" mark, in case you wonder). All keys on my keyboard worked again. Yay! Happily I logged in,
 fired up an editor to confirm again, and... Zoink! The key was again not working. :-( But it did work a minute ago on the login screen??<br />
<br />
So I logged out again and tried again: Works like a charm in the login box! Onced logged in -- no go in any application: not in an editor, not in the browser, not in Word, Excel, Outlook, ...<br />
<br />
Then I tried installing different keyboard layouts. Before I only had the Swiss German keyboard layout, for several languages: English US, English UK, German, Italian. Now I installed the "US international" keyboard layout as well, which yielded me two more
 layouts, for a total of six option in my language bar: English US Swiss German keyboard layout; English US international keyboard layout; German (Swiss German layout); Italian (Swiss German layout); English UK Swiss German keyboard layout; English UK United
 Kingdom keyboard layout.<br />
<br />
Switching to a non-Swiss German layout, the key works in all apps. Switching back to a Swiss German layout, it doesn't work. Interestingly enough, while it still does nothing when using the German or Italian option, it now acts differently when having selected
 the "English US" or "English UK" language version: here, when I press the key, my keyboard _switches_ to the alternative keyboard for that language!! So I would be in "English US, Swiss German keyboard layout" and I press my "!"-key. Nothing happens at first,
 but watching the language/keyboard indicator in my status bar, I see that my keyboard now got switched from "ENG SG" (SG stands for Swiss German) to "ENG INTL" (for US International). The next time I press the key now yields the } or ] sign (depending on using
 SHIFT or not). Same behavior when in "English UK, Swiss German" -- pressing the&nbsp;"!"-key will switch to the "English UK, UK layout" option, pressing it again will then work (yielding "}" or "]"). When it German or Italian language mode, nothing will happen
 - also no switch.<br />
<br />
So, in summary, I have the interesting problem:<br />
<br />
- My Swiss German Keyboard driver only supports the "!" key when in the Windows login screen. When on the deskopt/in an app, it does not work.<br />
- It works just fine with another keyboard layout (ok, so I have not tested all possible ones, but US/UK layouts work)<br />
- When an alternative keyboard layout is available, pressing the "!" key switches from "Swiss German" to the next available layout (e.g., from "ENG SG" to "ENG INTL").<br />
<br />
Again: this is for a freshly reset Windows 10 install on a Surface Pro 3.<br />
<br />
Ideas? :-)<br />

            <p>Small update: after having written this post, I removed again the non-Swiss German keyboard layouts. I just now wanted to write some text involving the exclamation mark and, as usual, switched to the on-screen keyboard to type it in. Interestingly enough,
 even the on-screen keyboard won't let me type it anymore!!!! (I managed to use the handwriting recognition to insert the "!" marks just now) :-D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talking about weird! Maybe Windows 10 decided I use the "!"-character too often?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, so: I now can't type "!" through the type cover nor through the on-screen keyboard. Yes, will need to re-install an alternative layout and see if this will not only fix the key but also the on-screen keyboard. Stay tuned...</p>

            <p>Thanks Kiran for your reply. I just followed your three recommended steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I ran the "hardware troubleshooter", which asked me to reboot in the process;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I checked the "mice and other pointing devices", which confirmed that all my drivers are up to date. While I was at it, I also double checked the keyboard driver, as this seemed to me a more pertinent driver to verify: All up-to-date here as well;</p>
<p>3. I ran Windows update and confirmed that the device is up-to-date</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that -- again double-checking my initial problem description -- the problem persists as described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this is again for a fresh ("factory reset") install of WIndows 10 on a Surface Pro 3 with both the Type Cover 3 and the new Type Cover 4 with Fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            <p>Well, the "manufacturer" in this case would be Microsoft (Surface 3, Type Cover 4). And as I wrote - all updates have been applies, all "troubleshooters" run, etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look - I understand that this is a forum and all, but really: on a scale from 1-10 for helpfulness, your replies are surely at the lower end of the spectrum. Not sure why you even bother &lt;strike&gt;typing&lt;/strike&gt; copy&amp;pasting this in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, will have to contact MS directly for this I guess. But at least I tried.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Try these solutions given in the below link. You can resolve many issues by performing a two-button shutdown or reinstalling the Surface Cover driver.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the additional pointer Kiran.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed both suggested solutions, the two-button shutdown and, when that wasn't helping, also the driver re-install. No change: login box has the key working well, once logged in it ceases to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did another "reset this PC without deleting my files" but still the same. Finally tried "factory reset", which finally made the key work again under all situations. Now the surface is installing 215 windows updates (yes, 215 updates), so let's see if the
 key still works after that update fest finishes :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will post the final result in a bit (whenever my Surface is done with updating)...</p>

            <p>So: 270+ updates later (taking some 8 hours), I had a fully updated Windows 8.1 on my Surface Pro 3. All keys worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the update to Windows 10. This took a full day, as it simply would not install. Had to manually tinker with installing KB300850, which just didn't want to install, no matter what I tried (error codes 8007005), and also the Windows 10 update (which would
 throw error 8007139F). More than 12 hours of work, sorting through all those online forums and dozens of fixes. This is all from a factory reset Windows 8.1 install. No software installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I didn't own this product already, I would not buy it. Unbelievable how one cannot even cleanly update a stock Surface Pro 3 without any installed software. Usually failed software updates are attributed to this or that 3rd party software. But a stock
 Surface Pro 3? Nothing else installed except for what MS put on there??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, finally managed to update to Windows 10 with the "Download tool" available from&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An lo and behold: The "!" key still works, even after the upgrade!!!!!! (&lt;- extra "!" for testing) ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well. To be fair: it _did_ work before this all started, coming from exactly this vantage point (Surface Pro 3 running Win8.1 x64 fully updated, then upgraded to Win10). So I guess now I only have to wait for the _one_ update that will make the "!" key
 disappear again ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>After one day with the newly re-installed Surface Pro 3, I'm happy to report that the "!" key still works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>
</p><p>When bit by bit I tried to rebuild my previous setup (app install, etc) I also wanted to setup the new fingerprint reader on the Type Cover 4. Only to realize that I don't have the option to setup Windows Hello (and its fingerprint login service) :-O</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digging into the Device Manager, I see that there is an "Other devices" entry with a non-working device:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"FPC TSD TX"</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick search tells me that this is the fingerprint module on the Type Cover 4. Turns out all people mentioning this online are running Windows 8.1, which does not have a driver for the new type cover and its fingerprint reader. Of course, when I reinstalled
 I had left the new type cover on the Surface Pro 3, which worked just fine, though I never tried the fingerprint reader. It seems this now comes back to haunt me, as Windows 10 just refuses to install an updated driver for the keyboard. I tried all the above-mentioned
 two-button resets, the driver uninstall, etc. All to no avail: The "FPC TSD TX" device stays listed as an "unknown device", with no driver to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just great. So now I have the "!" key, but no fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, so maybe I should do the whole thing again, only now mount the old Type Cover before re-installing Windows 8.1?? Sigh. I can't believer that whenever there's a problem with the Type Cover, I have to completely reinstall the machine from scratch. This
 is just so painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>BSOD 7B is almost certainly associated with not using the correct drivers for your hard disk controller (or the mode that the disk controller is set to use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHKDSK is not going to solve this problem. CHKDSK is about repairing disk errors, not about correcting driver problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's go back to basics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check the model of your PC. The eMachines site is not listing an Ei305 or anything similar. Is it a laptop, desktop or netbook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did these restore CDs come with the PC originally? Or are you using recovery CDs from a different PC?</p>

            <p>Ok here's the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the side of the tower it plainly states that the PC was originally Vista, that's what the sticker says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, assuming that your recovery CDs are giving you (or attempting to give you) an XP system (because you have posted in an XP forum not a Vista forum), this would imply that the recovery CDs did
<strong><em>not</em></strong> come with the PC because those CDs would give you a Vista system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are adamant that it is an Ei 305, so I am forced to the conclusion that eMachines have "archived" (or just deleted) information regarding your PC. This makes it difficult for me to advise further. Googling Ei 305 does give results (but none that help
 me to help you).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vista has built in support for disk controllers configured for AHCI. Windows XP does not have built in support for AHCI. All of which ties in with the stop 7B that you are experiencing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The reason i'm claiming it is a XP system is that is whats on the getting started instructions that came with it ... ( Getting started with Windows XP ) ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if its Vista Home Premium can you still help or do i need to go to the Vista forum and i do appologise for the mix up .</p>

            <p>You can change the forum yourself by editing the original question (click the Edit link - only you can do this [or a moderator]). I will continue to assist, if necessary (and if I can), regardless of which forum this thread is in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I doubt that you are recovering Vista, purely because you are getting stop 7B. If you have Vista recovery CDs you need to use them, not the XP recovery CDs that you are currently using. If you do not have Vista recovery CDs then it doesn't matter what forum
 this thread is in. The chances of you establishing XP on a PC designed for (and built with) Vista are not good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened when you installed from the recovery CDs? Did it say "Recovering Vista" or words to that effect, or does it say "Recovering XP"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not there with you,&nbsp;so you have to be my eyes. What is written on the CDs? Is it handwritten with marker or do they have a proper branded image printed on them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When replying do not assume that I know anything about your PC/CDs etc by implication, please tell me everything you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows 7 boot winloader.exe problem</h2>
                    Hi there i have 7 ultimate and cannot boot after using a live linux usb to extend my boot partition. I get an error code 0xc000025 and says something about winloader.exe? I have&nbsp;tried&nbsp;using my win 7 install dvd and using the boot repair a few times to
 no avail. Just an idea, would using my vista computer with the 7 hdd as a slave drive and copy the vista winloader.exe? would that possibly work? I can see all of my files while connected as a slave hdd. Any help would be great.

            Ok so managed to get it working again. What I did was boot up a live copy of Ubuntu and then went into my good vista installation and copied the winload.exe (Drive/windows/system32) &nbsp;file into the windows 7 installation replacing the existing one. It&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;boot
 still complaining about unsigned something so I did a boot restore off the windows 7 DVD and it finally worked!

<h2>            windows 10 opens tabs randomly and also randomly forces my computer into sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>I am running a custom build machine, at first i thought i was over heating but my front display thermometer has never pasted 34c, then i looked into a faulty PSU and upgraded to a 750W, still having this issue. then i noticed the my front leds were flashing
 and i thought i wonder if this is sleep mode, so i booted up and put it in sleep mode and my front leds were blinking the same as when windows does it. this leads me to believe that my components are fine and set up properly. another issue i have been having
 is windows will open these 3 random tabs on their own. settings start menu and wireless device search. this happens at random with no noticeable cause that i can detect. it happen when i'm gaming or when i'm just idling, its happened 3 times already over the
 course of me typing this out.</p>

                    <p>My cortana bar now stays with "Type here to search" instead of "Ask me anything", even when not focused on the bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal or is this a bug?</p>

            Hi Dean,<br />
<br />
Cortana's displays message depends on how and where it was set up. It's random and it depends on how the region and language setting on the PC. Cortana usually says "Ask me anything" and it change if there are changes made in Cortana. The display message changes
 to make Cortana more personable because you can use it as a simple search bar and maximize all the other features.
<br />

            Hello, I have the same issue - When I first installed Anniversary Update the search box was saying "Ask me anything" and it was also in white bold text which looked nice and better than the clear case found in last updates. I then downloaded a couple of
 security updates and Cortana still works fine but search box text has changed to "Type here to search" instead of "Ask me anything" and the captions are clear and no longer bold, don´t know why ? I would prefer the search box bold caption of the first Anniversary
 Update.<br />

<p>The changes that was done, like downloading a security update or any major changes, could cause the change in the Cortana search bar. For now, we don't have an option to manually set it up or no option in the Settings menu to personalized it.

            Hi David. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How about from the Ease of Access icon in the bottom corner of screen?
<br />
<br />Try getting into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a> to reinstall the Keyboard driver in Device Manager.  From Driver tab, first see if Roll back is available; if not try uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall  
<br /> 
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> If nothing else helps try getting into Repair Mode by whichever method works here: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> to System Restore or do the Reset.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            I wasn't suggesting to go to Settings if Safe Mode didn't work as I understand you cannot get into Windows.  I suggested using whichever method here can get you into Repair Mode which uses different drivers so the Keyboard always works:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of the other methods in the link work, you may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<p>Hi Greg, hope you still there?&nbsp; I managed to get into windows 10 safemode and went through all the listed options that I could find but still cannot get the keyboard to appear. I went into safemode with networking some options required me to be connected
 to the internet. every time I tried to connect it said internet was not available in safemode. I decided I would do a clean install and have installed the media creation tool on another pc and have the windows media on a USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of questions before I proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My tablet was running windows 10 home ver 1709</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downloaded windows 10 said it is ver 1809, can that be used on my tablet. If not how do I get ver1709?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I need the windows Reg Code if I do where will I find this when accessing windows in safemode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>once again thanks for all your help.</p>
<p>

            Yes, David, you always want to install the latest version which is why it's all that's available in MCT.  
<br />
<br />You do not need a key to install, just skip the key as shown in tutorial:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />For Toshiba preinstalled at factory the key is embedded in the UEFI Firmware chip on motherboard and should auto-activate.  If not it may mean it's converted to a Digital License in which case the only key that can be present is the default generic version key it installs with:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

    <title>Start up errors&#58; &#39;Microsoft Process Kill Utility has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldsmithmk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start up errors&#58; &#39;Microsoft Process Kill Utility has encountered a problem and needs to close now. We are sorry for the inconvenience.&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I start my computer I get 2 identical messages that read: 'Microsoft Process Kill Utility has encountered a problem and needs to close now. We are sorry for the inconvenience.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have put up with this for a year or so because when I click 'don't send' a report, the message goes away.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this week I have been trying to download and install McAfee antivirus software. This does not work and, after, spending about 17 hours in total trying to resolve the issue, the McAfee engineers have told me that once I have&nbsp;solved the Windows problem,
 the antivirus software will install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help please?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that the Kill Utility (kill.exe) is configured to run at startup.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to disable the same from the startup entry and see if that does the trick.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Start” and click “Run.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “msconfig” and hit “Enter.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the “Startup” tab.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Uncheck any entry related to Kill Utility from the available options.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Apply” and click “OK.”
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you could use the Autoruns tool to investigate the programs that run at startup.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, I’d recommend you to run a full system virus/malware scan on your computer using
</span><span>Microsoft Security Scanner from the following link:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have an antivirus program installed on your computer, I’d recommend you to download and install the free Microsoft
 Security Essentials (MSE) </span><span><span>from the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            Is it your contention that XP installs a kill.exe program?<br />
<br />
Do you have a kill.exe program on your system in anyplace other that the XP Debugging Tools for Windows (assuming a Microsoft Support Engineer would/should hopefully have the proper XP debugging tools installed)<br />
<br />
If I said that I was getting this message:<br />
<br />
"Microsoft Process Jose Utility has encountered a problem and needs to close now"<br />
<br />
Would you tell me to look in msconfig for jose.exe and disable it?<br />
<br />
If I were to find in my msconfig startup jose.exe (or the kill.exe) would you not be interested to know how it got there in the place and first fix THAT problem instead of just disabling the startup of the program which only address the symptom of the problem
 by just keeping it from starting?<br />
<br />
Is just disabling a startup item so you now longer see it a good enough troubleshooting method for problems?<br />

<h2>            Details Pane at Bottom of File Explorer Has a workaround 3-28-18</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE 3-28-18!&nbsp;<span>Its been fixed on my computer when I installed newoldexplorer and uninstalled it...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The DETAILS pane was removed from windows when Microsoft moved to windows 10 from windows 7.</p>
<p>The ability to see the file details at<span>&nbsp;the bottom of the window</span>&nbsp;was gone until today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, with the update I installed this morning, I noticed that you can choose both preview pane and the details pane together and the details pane is on the bottom of the window with all the information!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After further review, it seems I installed newoldexplorer and then uninstalled it but the details pane is still there</p>
<p>
</p><p>at least for me, not sure if everyone got it.</p>
<p>i have:</p>
<p>windows 10 pro&nbsp; version 1709, os build 16299.125</p>
<p>
</p><p>i originally thought it was fixed but alas, not so&nbsp;<br />

<p>I finally got an answer from my support ticket: </p>
<p>There is a new additional license that is required for voice. On top of the "Skype for Business PSTN Calling International" you must also have "Skype for Business Cloud PBX".
</p>
<p>This was not previously the case and I had to have support send me the updated license to apply to our account. Once we got that added, I was able to license users again.

            Hi TinglyBassoon80,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />I suppose that Windows restarting itself is due to Update. If not, please perform a complete scan with Windows Defender. 
<br />Then perform a clean boot: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />If it is restarting itself for updates it coulde be that your device need some update but they aren't installed because of some problems. Can you check your Updates history?       
        </p>

            Hi Tingly.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's likely trying to install Updates that keep failing.  
<br />
<br />First check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About if you have Version 1809 and if not install the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />If not check Update History at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Update History to see if Updates are attempting to install repeatedly.  If so  then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Problem getting out of hibernation - a fatal error occured, but only after overnight hibernation</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
<br />
I am having a problem with my comp. waking out from hibernation. But ONLY when I live it hibernating for a longer time - fore some hours - for example overnight. When I put it to sleep or hibernation and wake it up imediately or even after one hour, everything
 works fine... but when I leave it in hibernation over night, the next morning I get: Status 0xc0000242 A fatal error occured processing the restoration data hiberfil.sys<br />
<br />
Hibernation is enabled, sleep is disabled, hybrid is disabled....&nbsp; my drivers are recent<br />
<br />
I Have Win 7 64bit, i5 CPU, 6GB Corsair RAM, ATI 5850, Gigabyte P55A-UD4 (rev 1.0) motherboard.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.

            Hi <strong>Malimazi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers!</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Make sure you are pressing the hardware power button to resume from<br />
<div>Hibernation or Hybrid Sleep, not just moving the mouse or pressing a key<br />
which only works for Sleep.<br />
<br />
2. Make sure you have installed the ACPI drivers and other power management <br />
related installs from the manufacturers website. <br />
If that fails, see if there is an updated BIOS for your precise model.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> <br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this assists you in resolving the issue or if further assistance is needed.<br />
Hope it helps.</div>

    <title>A long hard look at my Surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigdud  say:</h3>
<h2>            A long hard look at my Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Surface Pro 4 now for almost a year. &nbsp;Looking back over the past ten months or so, I've come to decide that with a few more fixes and updates it may
<em>rise </em>to the status of Piece-Of-Crap. Just a few more improvements and it'll be there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let me say that I'm a retired computer professional, with 56 years years of time in this arena. &nbsp;I mention this only so that my comments won't be dismissed as sophmoric carping of the uninitiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with this unit has been a disaster, starting with the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">never-ending</span></em> power/sleep problems requiring a boot with full reset every time I shut it down, to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>frequent inexplicable hangs requiring restart</li><li>loss of WiFi when returning from standby/sleep/hibernate</li><li>loss of internet connectivity even when WiFi is active</li><li>failure of the screen to respond to the pen</li><li>failure of the screen to respond to my fingers</li><li>failure of the pen buttons</li><li>inability to resize the Start Menu</li><li>icons disappearing from the Start Menu</li></ul>
<p>And probably more which escape my memory; I've followed this forum and have found many related and similar complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply cannot depend on this unit to perform satisfactorily without one of the above anomalies occurring every time I use it. &nbsp;I have no reason to believe that they'll ever be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid $1,500 for this device. &nbsp;Are these the kind of results one should suffer after laying out such a price? &nbsp;I think not...</p>

            I suggest you do the one thing you haven't mentioned, get a warrantied replacement. &nbsp;If you have access to a Microsoft Retail store go there. &nbsp;They are far more effective, motivated and empowered then the drones you have probably encountered from Microsoft
 over the internet or by phone. &nbsp;Be sure to checkout the replacement at the store before you leave and try to talk them into giving you a new not a refurbed unit. &nbsp;Point out the months of aggravation your current sp4 has given you and be sure to fully checkout
 the replacement before you leave the store. &nbsp;I have an sp4 and I have had not one significant problem with it since I received it on Nov 19, 2015 except with some problems after the install of the less than acceptable Anniversary Edition. &nbsp;I'm pointing this
 out so you will know that there are good SP4s out there, you just have to get your hands on one. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8 error code 0xc0000185, and can&#39;t boot from USB</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having the, seemingly common, windows 8 error 0xc0000185. I've read about other people who had that problem and tried a solution which was creating an installation media to an USB and booting the PC with that same USB but when I try to boot it it just
 goes trought the samsung startup then stays pitch black..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not used to using windows 8 its not my computer so I could really use some help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance..</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: The laptop is running Windows 8 PRO and I can only find media for the installation of the Windows 8.1, could that be a problem?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>IThe laptop in question is a Samsung Ativ smart PC 700-h01, using &nbsp;Windows 8 Pro. There were no hardware changes, and no significant software change, altought I haven't ruled out possibility of virus or some kind of malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried your methods as seen on other threads, but once I change boot priorities to USB and restart using the USB with the Windows 8.1 Pro media, it goes trought the Samsung start up screen, it loads for a while and then just goes pitch black. It didn't
 came with any CD/DVD so I've only tried using the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to press F12 or F2 to try to go to the BIOS it just refreshes the blue screen with the error code, the only BIOS like menu I could access was the UEFI Firmware settings by pressing Windows key when already in the bluescreen (its the only option
 I get in the error blue screen)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file that apparently is missing or something has this path: &nbsp;\windows\system32\windload.efi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>

            Hi,
<br />Try updating to Windows 10 October update version 1809, manually.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi Peter
<br />
<br />Try upgrading manually:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thats it, the Windows 10 1809 is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1809 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />

<p>Since the 19th of December (2018) there haven't been any new updates, besides Windows Defender definition updates. The next monthly update is expected on January 8th. However, I have read that Microsoft is being cautious about releasing this update, so you
 may not get it for a while, or until the&nbsp;<em>next</em> update is ready. Myself, I'm in no rush.</p>

</p><p>I don't recommend manual updates since it was revealed recently that users who check for updates manually might receive experimental code. Is that just FUD? Perhaps, but I'm in no rush.</p>

            I would suggest using a program to close your hard drive to your SSD. I have used Acronis true image to do this many times with great success.

            If you want to move it from hard disk, system image or cloning would be your options. The following article will show you how to do it step by step:

            Hi Muhammad, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />To get the best possible performance out of your new M2 SSD, clean install Windows onto it . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>
