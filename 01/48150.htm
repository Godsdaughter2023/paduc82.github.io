    <title>How do I restore MBR&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobplantz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restore MBR&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Win 8 on the first partition of my SSD. I installed Debian Linux on the second partition and inadvertently allowed Debian to install its bootloader (grub) in the MBR. I would like to have the Win 8 bootloader back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to restore the MBR. I booted from my (upgrade) Win 8 DVD and got into the command line environment. In the command line I entered:</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildbcd</p>
<p>bootrec /fixmbr</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first and second commands gave error messages saying something to the effect that they did not recognize the file system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My diagnosis is that Debian Linux reformatted the MBR portion of the disk with the ext4 format, which I know Windows does not understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is: At what level do I have to reinstall Win 8? Do I need to delete all the partitions on the disk and start all over again to ensure that I get a good (Win 8) MBR?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don't have a lot of personal data on the SSD yet, so it's not a lot of trouble to back it up before essentially erasing the disk.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since you used the Linux Boot Loader you need to use their methods to remove it. Then<br />
you can Format and Re-install Windows 8. Or you can use any methods Linux Allows to<br />
dual boot Windows 8 with a new install. <br />
<br />
As you found out bootrec /fixmbr will not override the Linux Boot Loader.<br />
<br />
Check with Debian Support and their forums.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p><br />
So, if I tell the Windows 8 (upgrade) installer to simply use the entire disk (an SSD), will it reformat the disk and install its own bootloader? Or would it be better to use something like gparted to remove all partitions from the SSD first?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have Ubuntu Linux on a separate disk (an HDD) and can use EasyBCD to add that to the Windows 8 bootloader. That's the way I had it working before I (stupidly) added the Debian. I will not repeat the Debian experiment.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to work with Linux as Windows will not be able to remove the Boot Loader. As I<br />
said check with the Linus Support and Forums for the distribution you used. This is a fairly<br />
common issue for them.<br />
</p>
<p>If you are willing to totally wipe the SSD then check with its support for the best method they<br />
recommend. Usually they will have a utility. Be sure they know the issue.<br />

<h2>            Corrupted Movie Maker in Windows 7, 32 bit Home Premium, associated error, and I can&#39;t find the files manually to use, uninstall, or delete.</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows Live Essentials Movie Maker installed on my system at one point, but then I kept seeing live pop up in task manager and no matter how many times I killed it, it always came back even though I wasn't using the program, so I uninstalled&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Windows
 Essentials&nbsp;2012 to stop that, and it kept popping up, so then I went into the system and manually deleted anything with Windows Live in the name via explorer and then a bit in the registry. It solved the problem, however, now I would once again like to use
 Movie Maker, and so I went to the download site to download Movie Maker, thinking this would reinstall it and I'd be set (other than having to watch it consume resources when closed). I tried to just get Movie Maker, but the windows site told me I already
 had it installed (I can't find anything that mentions it anywhere), so I found a different Movie Maker download, a prior version, that installed, but didn't have the features I needed, so I uninstalled it, so then I thought I'd install the whole Windows Live/Windows
 Essentials 2012 package, thinking that might overwrite the bad files Windows was detecting as an install, but it did not, it just installed everything ELSE in the software suite, and I still have no Movie Maker. It gave me this error (Error: 0x80280007)when
 I tried to redo the install:&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a167d0a-38b4-4ed7-95b4-f395cd03dc2f" /></p>
<p>Fine, dandy, I'm happy to do that, except I can't FIND it to uninstall it, and it's not in Programs and Features (uninstall or change a program list). So, two options. can anyone tell me how to</p>
<p>1. Make Movie Maker WORK, tell me where it is, and how to start it (it doesn't exist in Program Files at all).</p>
<p>2. Tell me how to completely remove ALL TRACES of ALL Windows Live Essentials 2012 so I can do a fresh install of it that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Windows support chat and asked how to remove the traces of Movie maker, and the tech told me to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;del \"%SystemRoot%\system32\dllcache\wmm.dll\"<br />
&nbsp;del \"%SystemRoot%\system32\dllcache\moviemk.exe\"<br />
&nbsp;del \"%ProgramFiles%\Movie Maker\.\"<br />
&nbsp;rmdir /s \"%ProgramFiles%\Movie Maker\"</p>
<p>But the thing is, none of those exist TO delete, and so I do not think he really UNDERSTOOD what my problem is (plus, he hung up on me). I didn't run them, it seemed pointless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively: Point me in the direction of another free software program that works like Movie Maker. I don't care who makes the software, I just need to put a bunch of short video clips together into one longer video.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live wont let me sign in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ames4u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live wont let me sign in</h2>
                    
<p>UK.</p>
<p>8015D02E</p>
<p>My problems are three in total: I have auto-sign in active for both my profile and Live connection. Profile works fine upon start up but my console will not sign in to Xbox Live. When I try to do so manually it prompts me for my email
 and password, both of which are still in the fields associated. Yet, when I confirm it promptly tells me it's incorrect and knocks me off my profile. I followed the advice on another thread and cleared the cache. The same nonsense is still happening, only
 this time I get this upon trying to sign into Live;<br />
<br />
<strong>Sorry, something's wrong with your Microsoft account. Go to https://account.live.com for help. Code: 8015D02E</strong><br />
<br />
I had to make a live account just to post on this site, and I was promptly given a ridiculous effing name that is nothing like my actual profile name because when I tried to use my account, it promptly kicked me over to Overlook which prevents me from doing
 ANYTHING but fill in a questionnaire that has information I never added to my email account.<br />
<br />
When I try to sign back into my profile, the same prompt occur's again. I am forced to restart in order to be signed into my profile but the problem with Live persists.<br />
<br />
I have tested my internet connection, and it works perfectly fine-it even connected to Live, but it doesn't activate on my profile AT ALL. So I know it isn't my connection.<br />
<br />
Problem 2; my xbox profile account is actually ames4u but the email associated with it is
<strong>[MOD REMOVED]</strong> but this email was deactivated for a few years back because some jag-off sent a virus and Microsoft deactivated it for the safety of my contacts. This happened when I had no access to the internet so I was completely unaware until
 a friend pointed out that she had gotten an email from me that her antivirus warned was dangerous. When I went to sort things out it became apparent that I would not be able to fix the problem. I cannot reactivate that email, (tried but was told to jump through
 a load of hoops which should not have been bloody necessary if I knew my damn password) and the email it was connected to that a new password would've been sent to was even older than that one and I have no hope in hell of remembering it's password. But that
 also meant I could not change my xbox profile's email without being prompted for a password which it repeatedly tells me is wrong, and I am far more worried about being locked out of my profile than anything else. But now because I cleared the cache a majority
 of my games that had DLC on it has prevented me from playing my games and I cannot update them due to the fact that I cannot sign in to Live.<br />
<br />
Problem 3: This was an old email I had made years ago, and it was locked down long before Microsoft rolled out this ridiculously unnecessary security update, so I never got the chance to update my password or security details before it was locked down, let
 alone put in my mobile number. I am now unable to reactivate it. Nor can I change the email associated with my Xbox account!</p>

<p>What am I supposed to do? I am not deleting my profile and losing my progress when it's clear microsoft is more interested in working my last nerve because god forbid knowing my password be enough to reactivate my account. I am not adding my credit card
 details. I use microsoft points to gain access to downloadable content. I do not pay for Gold Subscription because the 'benefits' are of no use to me and I hate multiplayer. There are only three passwords I ever use so it's just not possible that I am getting
 them wrong. I have one password tied to certain screen names so I know that's not the problem. Nor are they the kind of passwords anyone is going to be able to guess either.<br />
<br />
It now will not let me play any of my games that have any kind of DLC associated with it. It says my save files are damaged or corrupted. Kindly explain what the point of having an xbox is when it pulls crap like this? I spent a load of money on microsoft points
 and now I find that as soon as my profile takes a hissy fit for no adequitely explained reason, I promptly get robbed blind and have my games rendered useless. This is not the kind of buisness practice that instills a sense of trust or confidence in the consumer.
<br />
<br />
My Xbox is a year old, if that, and has been taken good care of. So it hasn't been used as a door stopper, stand in football, or used to trowel cement.
<br />
<br />
Can someone please for the love of all that is fluffy, explain to me what I can do? There's nothing I can do about the email, but I refuse to let my time, effort and money be flushed down the toilet because of this.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat one more time before I the get generic hokum response: <strong>I HAVE CLEARED THE SYSTEM CACHE.</strong>
<strong>IT NOW WILL NOT LET ME PLAY GAMES WITH DLC ATTACHED.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I WILL NOT DELETE MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT GIVE ME ACCESS TO XBOX LIVE IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD MY PROFILE AGAIN.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I CANNOT REACTIVE MY EMAIL ASSOCIATED WITH MY ACCOUNT. I HAVE TRIED REPEATEDLY TO DO SO TO NO AVAIL.</strong></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;ames2u,<br />
<br />
This does indeed sound pretty frustrating. If you have already tried to <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recover your account</a> to no avail, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Phone Support</a> will be the next step.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hate to point you right at phone support, but I do believe they are best equipped to handle this situation.

<br />
Let us know how it goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One S Randomly Shuts Down During Gameplay - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One S Randomly Shuts Down During Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>So, my Xbox One S decides to shut down during random moments of gameplay. The games that are affected by this is WW2 and Destiny 2. For Destiny 2, I can't get passed the cutscene where the Ghost says to Fly Fast. My Xbox will shut off when that happens. Then, for COD&nbsp;WW2, the Xbox will shut off during random moments of gameplay. Other games are fine, which is games like Minecraft and Battlefield 1, which is weird (especially BF1, since it's a power hungry game). My Xbox is connected to the outlet, I have performed hard resets multiple times,&nbsp;and I have contacted Xbox Support. However, the problem still occurs. Can anyone please help me ASAP? My birthday is kinda ruined because of that :(</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>iLoveBacon9</p>

                    <p>I am using an Acer Aspire E1-572 with OS Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a bluetooth USB stick to connect my laptop with my Logitech Bluetooth Receiver. Windows 8.1 merely allows me to pair with the receiver and then works, but as soon as I start my laptop again it says it's ''not connected'' in Settings, and when I click
 on the device it only gives me the option to remove the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install updates for the driver, but it states that newest updates are already installed. Troubleshooter did also not work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Attached is a picture with the error notification regarding one of my bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0888f2de-fd12-4843-8d2f-9c429d256100" /></p>

            <p>Hello Jorai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that none of the suggestions provided in the previous posts helped. I also appreciate your time and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Windows + R keys, type regedit in run window and press Enter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If user account control message appears, please click yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see a long list of registry subkeys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Each 32-digit subkey is unique and corresponds to a particular type, or class, of hardware in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click the following registry sub-key:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In the right pane, right click "<strong>UpperFilters</strong>" and select <strong>
delete.</strong> When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Similarly, in the right pane, right click "<strong>LowerFilters</strong>" and select
<strong>delete.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>f. Close registry editor and restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

<p>I run Win 10 64 bit 1809 17763.253 (all up to date, clean health, etc etc) - dropbox desktop app has stopped working, would not uninstall, i have deleted every trace of it and cannot install any version, online or offline, with

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a Gateway, purchased 12/2009, running Windows 7, and it had been running fine until the 1st part of November 2010. &nbsp;Since then, it will lock up randomly. &nbsp;The monitor goes black, the mouse wont work, CTRL-Alt-Del does nothing, there is no disk activity,
 but the on/off button stays lit. &nbsp;The only solution is to unplug (cut power) to the computer and replug the computer. &nbsp;It comes up as if it had an abnormal shutdown. &nbsp;The computer usually locks up during an idle period (no one using it), but it has locked
 up twice, 1st during a reboot and the other while being online. &nbsp;The system log does not have any unusual errors. &nbsp;Norton is current, and I have been running Anti-Malware scans with no errors.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            External hard drives do not reconnect after Windows 10 laptop comes out of sleep mode</h2>
                    <p><span>I have 2 4TB WD external hard drives connected to a Windows 10 laptop. My Ext HDs are recognized upon initial boot-up or refresh, but once the computer goes to sleep mode and then comes out of it, the drives are not seen until I restart or re-boot
 my laptop.&nbsp; This causes havoc with my scheduled backups since it can't find the devices where the backups are to be written.</span></p>
<p><span>Are there any settings in Windows 10 that I could apply to make the system recognize my Ext HDs after sleep mode???</span></p>

<p>There's no settings for this, what you are seeing is not how it should work, so let's try to fix the problem you've encountered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a troubleshooting step, try coming back from sleep mode and then unplug-replug in the drive.&nbsp; Does Windows detect it?&nbsp; Does it make the "something just got plugged in" sound effect?</p>

<p>Alright -- let's check device manager.&nbsp; If you could, first open it before sleep and check out the drives (they may be under drives or USB devices).&nbsp; Then you don't even need to close device manager.&nbsp; Just go to sleep mode, wait maybe 60 seconds for baseline,
 then wake up and see what changed for those devices. If the display in Device Manager doesn't refresh, click the "Scan for changes" button on the toolbar, which has a magnifying glass icon in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get to Device Manager quickly by either right-clicking your Start button, or by typing WindowsLogo+X, then tap M.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Device Manager - all my drives were listed under Disk Drives. I also looked at what was listed under USB Controllers. Then I let my laptop go into sleep mode. I waited for about 3 minutes before waking it up again. I rechecked both Device Manager
 and USB Controllers and everything looked the same. However, when I went to File Explorer and tried to access my 2 WD MyBook external hard drives, I get a "Location is not available" alert box that says "H:\ (or I:\) is not accessible. Access is denied."&nbsp;
 I have a WD Passport drive that wasn't available either but I initiated the WD Unlocker utility and it opened up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned the "sleep mode" option on the MyBook drives off several days ago since I didn't want them to go into sleep mode unless the laptop initiated it. I have both of these drives set to auto unlock when I log on to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            If you have any of the WD Wares (wd quick view, wd drive utilities, wd security) i found that when i put my computer to sleep it also locked the external hard drive (windows 10 64-bit, 4tb WD External) so whenever i would get out of sleep mode and try
 to access my hard drive it would say access is denied when i tried to open anything. I found opening WD Security and unlocking the hard drive fixes everything that denied me access to my hard drive upon waking after sleep.

<h2>            Update for Microsoft Works 9</h2>
                    I keep getting an update notice for Microsoft Works 9 on my computer.&nbsp; Works 9 is installed on my computer and was when I bought the computer from Dell.&nbsp; When I try to download the update I keep getting an error message that I need to insert the CD/DVD
 into the computer.&nbsp; I have no CD/DVD, these aren't supplied with the computer.&nbsp; I don't use Works, as I have Office 2010 on my computer, however I keep getting the update notice and no matter how many times I try, or even try manually, it won't download and
 the message that this "important" update needs to be downloaded.&nbsp; I keep getting the following message:&nbsp; Error(s) found:&nbsp; Code 8024002D, Windows Update encountered an unknown error.&nbsp; Does this mean I am the only one who has this problem?&nbsp; It has been trying
 to update for a couple of months now.

</p><blockquote>Just a FYI, and hopefully it's fixed SOON, but the newest release of 3d builder completely breaks the repair function.
</blockquote>
<p>It also says that .STL file that were created in 3d Builder itself need repair when you load them; and then can't repair them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other new "undocumented features" (a euphemism for bug) are:</p>
<p>Merge and Subtract sometimes go into the same sort of wait forever and fail as repair.</p>
<p>Split sometimes works but often gives you objects that need repair - which you can't do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ease of use of these functions was the main reason I used 3d Builder and recommended it to others.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft thinks it is proper to update a working program to non-working version without my permission I will never recommend this program again.</p>

            STL repair seems to have been broken after they updated to the new version with the updated GUI.&nbsp; I do like the newer gui but would love to have my STL repair back.&nbsp; The only way I have found to fix a STL file is to save it as a .3MF file and then open
 up that .3MF file.&nbsp; Then the repair will be successful.&nbsp; Wish they would fix it.

    <title>Win8 computer startup and waking from sleep very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjaming.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win8 computer startup and waking from sleep very slow</h2>
                    My startup normally only took 3-4 seconds. However, from one day to antother, it now takes about 3 minutes. Waking from sleep takes about the same ammount of time, however, once it is started up, everything works nice and quick. When starting up the booting
 (with the little spinning wheel) takes 3 minutes and when waking from sleep the screen just stays black for 3 minutes. I also noticed that the drive activity light only lights up ater the 3 minutes. I will include the result of my boot trace below. I have
 only purchased my notebook (Win 8 pre installed) a few month ago and everything worked fine untill this problem appeared. Please excuse my language, english is not my mothertongue.
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

            From inside Device Manager, uninstall the USB Controllers and then reboot.&nbsp; Windows should re-find and reinstall the correct drivers.

    <title>Missing almost all of my files after a restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shariq ali  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing almost all of my files after a restart</h2>
                    <p>So I updated to windows 10 last night and logged on this morning. I noticed none of my files had transferred over, but were still in my old user profile which is called sharq_000. To save time I cut and pasted my documents over to the new profile which was
 called TEMP. All my programs files were already on this profile. I then noticed some programs weren't running right so I restarted my laptop. When I booted back up I got the welcome screen saying it was readying my profile. I'm not sure if I got this screen
 already because I updated while I was sleeping. It finally finishes and I check and all the documents I brought over were gone. Now there is nothing in the TEMP folder, and I'm back on sharq and the only files here are the ones I didn't cut and paste over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click and go to properties on the user folder sharq_000 it reads as 9.36GB, but when I manually count everything including hidden folders I get no more than 2GB, the tool tip I get when hovering over the folder reads 1.65GB. So that must mean
 that my files are still on the hard drive somewhere right? How can I get them back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the online chat with this and the support staff I was talking with said he would notify the engineering team and then ended that chat without telling me anything else.</p>

            <p>Hi Sharig Ali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some digging in your case, I have the same problem like you but all the other places says that when you moved your files, it went to some new place and after it did the restart it went back to the old profile and the new profile never existed and windows
 deleted it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I find any way to fix it, I'll reply this with the fix, in the meantime I find no other solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>KT.</p>

            Hi Nureym,<br />
<br />
The file VCRUNTIME140.dll is part d the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
<br />
<br />
You should download that and install it to resolve these errors: <br />

            Hi Nureyni
<br />
<br />It looks like there is a previous version installed, go to Programs and features and uninstall the previous version, then install the new version.
<br />
<br />Note: only uninstall the same version (2015)

<h2>            Access Denied. Contact your Administrator</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so here's the deal:</p>
<p>My boss just bought brand new computers for our office which all have windows 7. Now all are files are located on a servers which runs on windows XP. If we go directly into the server through our computers we have no problem accessing the file, but if we
 try to open say a word document through MS word, we sometimes get the "Access Denied. Contact you Administrator" message. Now I have no problem going through the server each time, but my boss prefers to open up his word documents through word. I tried going
 onto the server and changing the folder&nbsp;options so that everything is shared but it didn't work. Is there any way I can fix this problem?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Is this computer on a domain network or simple home network?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let&nbsp;us perform the two listed methods below and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>It's a possibility that anti-virus is causing a conflict to open these files. The same was also discussed in the thread below.</div>
<div>You may follow the steps suggested by Joson ZhouMSFT, Moderator Wednesday, on March 19, 2008 at&nbsp;9:41 AM<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistanetworking/thread/52d4976f-3297-4a7f-a2ad-a6b04fdb4910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/itprovistanetworking/thread/52d4976f-3297-4a7f-a2ad-a6b04fdb4910</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>If it is on a simple home network you may try clean boot troubleshooting to find the conflicting program in opening these word files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are required to perform a clean boot to find the program that is causing this and then disable or remove it.<br />
Here is the procedure to do it:<br />
&nbsp;Clean Boot Troubleshooting:&nbsp; <br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
8. Also you need to uninstall and reinstall the problem software on your computer.</div>
<div>Reset the computer to start as usual</div>
<div>9. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
10. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.&nbsp;
<br />
11. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

 </blockquote> <p>Hey, Ocean!&nbsp;Sorry to see any frustrations. Currently, there is no way to do a Case Review for console bans. However, we have ensured that you should have received an email from the Enforcement Team. Check the email that you have associated with this gamertag, and let us know if you see it. Be sure to check Spam folders if you have them!</p><p><br /></p><p>If you don't see it there, get back to us so we can look into our other options. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<h2>            How can i tell if my computer touch screen compatible</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">I have a Toshiba&nbsp;laptop it was windows 7 when i bought it and then it upgraded to windows 10 but I&nbsp;was just wondering if it is touch screen compatible even though it wasn't when I bought it but just recently when it finally did some
 updates that wouldn't update for a very long time but at the bottom of the screen there is a keyboard symbol like regular touch screen tablets or some computers have so I was just wondering if someone could tell me anything useful to find out if I can make
 it&nbsp;touch screen without having to spend to much on it . Thank You I Appreciate anyone or anybody for your answers and replies .</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try exporting your file if you have the option to export to a picture file from your word processor.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you can’t then I would suggest using MSPaint or Photo Gallery to make your picture.
