<h2>            Windows 10 file sharing videos to android vlc after homegroup removal.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to use the Windows 10 HomeGroup file sharing to allow my android device to view videos from my PC, however after removing HomeGroup in the 1803 update I no longer can share my videos, and I can not for the life of me figure out this new folder sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the folder sharing everywhere I see it they say to right click and give access to certain people, but all I get is advanced sharing, which I still went through however it doesn't allow me to view files from my phone still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this please. Below is a screenshot of my sharing settings for my folder I am trying to share and then my system sharing settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Windows 10 store app they just enter a queue and say starting download and nothing is happening</h2>
                    <p>hello community, when i try to download apps in the app store for windows 10 pc they just enter a queue and say starting download and nothing is happening. i have also tried to click on the "check for updates" button and the dots just spin continuously.
 I feel like this may have been answered already but all the other posts i read seem to be dealing with an error message which i dont have. I checked date/time, proxy server settings. If it makes a difference i am using the app store from the start menu.</p>

<h2>            Is a Windows 7 license key valid for both 32-bit and 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    I received a NFR copy of Windows 7 Ultimate at the Microsoft launch today.&nbsp; It has a valid (I hope!) license key but the DVD is for 32-bit.&nbsp; Is the same license key valid for 64-bit installations as well?&nbsp; In other words, if I get a copy of the 64-bit
 DVD, can I use the license key I just received?<br />
<br />
This will be a fresh install onto a system that currently has 32-bit Vista.<br />

            Yes, it is valid for either 32 or 64 bit, its up to you which architecture you want to use. Please note 1 key, 1 license. You can't install 32 bit one computer and install 64 bit on another computer using the same key.

<p>Now that I know Win 7 64 bit works great with my hardware.&nbsp; Can I legally upgrade my Windows Vista 32 bit to Windows 7 32 bit?&nbsp; And keep both versions of Windows 7 on the same machine.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have one Windows 7 license you can only have one install of Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install Windows 7 32bit you will first need to format/delete the 64 bit install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to buy a second license/key to install Windows 7 twice at the same time. There is no discount on a second license if you already have a license.<br />

<h2>            Windows can&#39;t update important files and services while the system is using them</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've shifted to Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit after getting frustrated with Windows 10 performance issue. Since then I'm getting this error:&nbsp;Windows can't update important files and services while the system is using them. Save any open files and restart the
 computer, and then try to check for new updates. Windows update pop-up comes regularly, I've started my laptop hundreds of times but same message. My laptop performance also went down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did till now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded&nbsp;WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab &amp; run to correct the issue but nothing happened.</li><li>Downloaded &amp; run&nbsp;fixit tool from here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-7 but nothing happened.</li><li>Applied this approach:</li></ol>
<div>a) Open an administrative Command Prompt window.</div>
<div>b) Run the following commands and press Enter after each command:</div>
<div>Net stop wuauserv</div>
<div>cd %systemroot%</div>
<div>Ren SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</div>
<div>
<p>Net start wuauserv</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to solve this issue as I'm tired of this.</p>

            <p>If you used the back to 7 feature in Win10, you are unlikely to ever get Win7 working properly again, until you do a full clean install.</p>
<p>
Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reverting program just does not do the job correctly, and will leave your system
 in a state that you will not find satisfactory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Clean Install tip</strong></em></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

    <title>Cannot send an email with Windows Live Mail now - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot send an email with Windows Live Mail now</h2>
                    It was working fine but then it stopped after some Microsoft updates. I've called Dell &amp; Verizon and they both say it's a Microsoft "patch" issue. I've verified all the settings and they are correct. The&nbsp;"requires server authentication"&nbsp;box is&nbsp;checked
 also. I can receive emails just fine. When I finish an email and go to send it, it just sits in the outbox. If I click on the outbox and hit the "send/receive" button, it will send it but I shouldn't have to do that. Verizon is my email provider, btw...

            <p>Hello and thanks for the reply but it isn't set to offline. I get no error messages either. Yesterday I sent an email to myself and it worked only&nbsp;once. After that, I couldn't send anymore emails nor could I send them today when I tried.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I type up&nbsp;an email,&nbsp;I hit the send button,&nbsp;it goes right to my outbox and sits there until I manually hit the other send/receive button in the tools section of the toolbar. I shouldn't have to do that. All the settings are correct because it does work every
 once in a while. I hope you can help me with this problem soon. Thanks.</p>

I've always had the "send messages immediately" box checked but it still&nbsp;wasn't sending them. Just for the heck of it, I unchecked the box, clicked apply then clicked ok. Then I went right back into the settings menu and rechecked the "send messages" box and
 clicked apply then ok. Now it seems to be working.&nbsp; I've done this before and it worked for a while but then it started not sending emails again. I'll give it a day and see what happens but thanks for the advice. I'll let you know what happens tomorrow...

<p>
</p><p>I was working in a group at school and flipped my computer into tent (tablet) mode to show the whole group something. I somehow, inadvertently pinned my entire start menu to my desktop. My task bar is no longer showing on the bottom of my screen and I can
 only see what's open by touching task view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to unpin individual apps, I want them all to be put back where they were when I touch start. (along with the all programs feature.&nbsp; I really do not know what I touched but this is VERY frustrating!</p>
<p>

<p>I used to see all these apps ONLY when clicking on the home/start button. AND, my task bar used to be
 fixed on the bottom...and the settings still say it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, these apps all got pinned to the desktop....I want it back to the way it was. :)</p>

</p><p>Hi Cortne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you with your concern of resizing the cards and spaces in Solitaire, try to drag the border to adjust to the size of the screen with your desired size of the window. You may also look for the option "Large Print Deck", which can be changed by clicking
 "Game", then "Change Appearance".&nbsp; From there you can select a card deck and click "OK."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try to go to the store in Windows 10 and type Solitaire. Then select Simple Solitaire. It is the classic solitaire game. You can just uninstall your other Solitaire game if you would want to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

    <title>Apps not working after latest update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Apps not working after latest update</h2>
                    
<p>I logged onto my Xbox One earlier this morning, my brother and I were going to watch some movies but a majority of my apps weren't working: Netflix, Hulu, Movies &amp; TV, and Blu-Ray even though they worked the day before. Instead it had that they were ready
 to be installed even though they were already installed prior to the update. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling them but the download would stop with an error (I forgot the error code), saying it couldn't download because something along the lines of my
 internet was too slow. I had Star Wars Battlefront already in and I hopped on that and played a game with ease and even went on Sling TV and HBO Now which also worked fine. It will read a game disc but not a movie (DVD/Blu-Ray Disc). My brother went to his
 room and got on his Xbox One and his Netflix worked fine. The differences between his and mine is I auto-updated my Xbox and he didn't so he was still on the previous update, also mine is connected with an ethernet cable and his is wireless. I contacted Microsoft
 Support and spent about 3 hours with 2 different associates and they ran me through several troubleshooting solutions but none of them worked. So now I just have to wait until they come up with a workable solution/patch.</p>

<p>I have uninstalled the Apps from my Xbox One and my external hard drive. I then hard rebooted , unplugged all the cords and let it set for a minute. I then plugged everything back in and let the system come back up. I did that several times but tried different
 methods once back up such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A) Going to the Microsoft Store to install</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; B) Installing from the Ready to Install section</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; C) Signing completely out and deleting my account</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; D) Unplugging the ethernet cord from my modem as well</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; E) Going to Disc and Blu-ray under Settings and clearing the Persistent Storage</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; F) Switching between Energy-Saving and Instant-On modes</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; G) Switching between having the Apps directly download to the Xbox One hard drive and my external one</p>
<p>I found the error code listed when it stops downloading, it is 0x80072ee2. But as stated in my previous post I can hop onto games and play online, I played Star Wars Battlefront which I have the disc for and it plays and put in my Halo 5 disc to play a warzone
 match that worked just as well. I even watched Sling TV for a few hours yesterday afternoon. An update to my brother's Xbox One, it updated and he is having the same issues as well. He has a Kinect and that works well for him but the Apps show ready to install
 too. I just now tried putting a regular DVD in instead of a Blu-Ray and that won't work either. So I know for sure it is not my internet connection or an issue with Netflix and Hulu since the Blu-Ray Player and Movies &amp; TV won't work either.</p>

            <p>Well, that is certainly a lot of troubleshooting!</p>
<p>The last thing I would suggest doing is a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-factory-defaults-using-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a> on your console, and your brother's since he's having the issue, too. Because you have an external HDD, I suggest moving your games to that when you do the factory reset (only the games, remove any extra apps that you might have) and do a full reset when it asks you. Be sure that your external HDD is unplugged from your console when you do it!</p>
<p>That error code does normally suggest an internet issue, but it also could be just throwing whatever error it can. It's a "time out" error, so the downloads could be timing out, just not on your side. Give the factory reset a try and then let me know how the apps work after that. :)</p>

<p>So I went and did the factory reset and went through the usual set-up process and when I went to install the Blu-Ray player app it stopped again, error 0x80072ee2. So I don't know what to do anymore.</p>

<p>So I am having a similar issue with my apps, not sure if it's because the apps will be used for the background music in the future but here is my problem: I used to be able to use Pandora and I Heart Radio in the "snap an app" mode while playing a disc.
 After the update it no longer works. Just wondering if anyone else has this problem? Thanks!

            <p>gtrherochik - Snap has been removed for several apps, and it's likely this is what you are running into. However, to not commandeer this thread, if you have any further questions be sure to post up a new detailed thread so that our community can assist you further. Thanks for understanding!</p>
<p>CKM13 - It still could be related to your ISP. As an interim, I suggest attempting downloads on another internet connection. You can do this by using a tethering option on your phone, or taking your console or PC to another internet source. Let me know what your ISP says on Thursday, though! :)</p>

<h2>            Migrating Windows 10 from an existing HDD to a new SSD</h2>

            Hi SJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you clone the HDD to the SSD in the same PC, or did you save an Image backup externally, then swap the drives, boot the imaging rescue media to apply the external image?  If you tried both these methods and it didn't work then I'd use the expert's choice free Macrium to save an image externally, swap the drives and boot the rescue media it will generate for you to apply the image to the SSD.  Full tutorial here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If these all fail then do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />The best way of achieving this is to do a clone of existing drive to a new one, using a Software like you said-Macrium Reflect is our choice. 
<br />
<br />It is recommended to do it from a PE rescue disk and disk check on the HDD should be done before clone.

If these all fail then do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial. It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of
 your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<p><span>Hi, In terms of deleting unnecessary files you will have to use Disc Cleanup maintenance utility on Windows. Dick Cleanup will search and analyze your hard drive for files that are no longer in use and remove unnecessary files. Of cause
 you could use other solutions like CC cleaner but I wouldn’t recommend that because Disc Cleaner is much safer and easy to use, it was also designed pacifically for Windows. If you were using Windows 7 this is how you would navigate to Disk Cleanup and clean
 you hard drive. Press <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Computer</strong> left click on<strong>Local Disk C:\</strong> &gt; Press<strong> Properties</strong>. From the Properties window press the tab that is labeled<strong>General</strong>; now press the<strong>
 Disk Cleanup</strong> button wait for windows to analyze your hard drive. Once Windows has analyzed your hard drive press&nbsp;<strong>Clean up system files</strong> then press<strong>Ok</strong>&nbsp;in the next window and Disk Cleanup should delete unnecessary files
 and folders.</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of making your computer run smoothly you will have to defrag it. Disk Defragmenter is a Utility included in Microsoft Windows designed to increase access speed by rearranging files stored on a disk to occupy contiguous storage
 locations, a technique commonly known as defragmenting. The purpose is to optimize the time it takes to read and write files to/from the disk by minimizing head travel time and maximizing the transfer rate. As of Windows XP, Disk Defragmenter is also used
 to improve system startup times.</span></p>
<p><span>If you were using Windows 7 this is how you would navigate to Disk Defragmentation Utility.&nbsp;</span><span>Press<strong>Start</strong> &gt;<strong>All program</strong> &gt;<strong>Accessories</strong> &gt;<strong>System tools</strong>
 &gt;<strong> Disk Defragmenter</strong>. From the disk Defragmenter window press<strong> Analyze disk</strong>, wait for Disk Defragmenter to analyze your hard drive. Once Disk Defragmenter is done analyzing your hard drive press<strong>Defragment Disk</strong>
 and the presses of defragging your hard drive should start. By performing these simple presses once every 1 or 2 moths I believe that you will optimize your computer speed to at least 10 or 20%. Never trust registry editing software’s like Registry booster
 2011, PC Tools Registry Mechanic and others. These third party software will just make more problems and even slow down your computer in most cases. This Microsoft tutorial can also help you improve your computer speed.</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/maintenance/speed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/maintenance/speed.aspx</a></p>

<p>My TV is stating the Xbox one output is in 720 rather than 1080</p>

<p>Used to work fine with my xbox 360</p>

<p>TV is a Sony</p>
<p>I have been into the Xbox settings, but the only output option available is 720, there is no 1080 option.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Photo Gallery - Incorrect Time Zone in IPTC field - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Photo Gallery - Incorrect Time Zone in IPTC field &#34;TimeCreated&#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I beleive I found an other bug in latest verison of PhotoGallery 2012 (16.4.3505.912)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When changing the Time Taken the metadata is stored in 3 different places. By Convention, it is assumed that the local time is entered (not UTC)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Exif: DateTimeOriginal (9003)&nbsp;&nbsp;and DateTimeDigitized (9004) is update correctly. Without timezone because EXIF doesn't allow this. So this ok.</p>
<p>2) XMP: CreateDate is update correctly and timezone is added correctly. So this is also ok.</p>
<p><span><em><strong>Correction: After further investigation I found out that there is also no TimeZone information saved within the XMP tag. It is not really a bug but more a shortcoming.&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) IPTC: If there's already other IPTC metadata&nbsp; available the corresponding time field is updated or created (tag= TimeCreated id: 2:060), but with an&nbsp;incorrect timezone. The timezone is set to +0000 while the entered (local) time is used as timevalue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>example: (for IPTC)</p>
<p>Entered locatime was 12:05:22 in Brussels (TZ +0100)&nbsp; This should result in 12:05:22+0100 or 11:05:22+0000 but not the combination 12:05:22+0000</p>
<p><em><strong><span><strong>Correction:</strong> <em><strong>Actually the best solution would be just leaving out the time zone information. This is maybe against IPTC conventions but at least it is correct. &nbsp;Even a better solution would be giving
 the user the ability to provide the correct time zone information. You may never assume that the time zone of computer is the correct one!! Example: You go on a holiday trip in different time zones. At home you notice that the timestamps are incorrect. If
 the time zone information is saved to the file you should as a user be able to provide the correct one. By always adding +0000 to the IPTC TimeCreated tag you&nbsp;</strong></em></span><span><em><strong>assume that all photo's are taken in London (are
 the same time zone ;-))</strong></em></span></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have used different tools to analyse the metadata changes: PhotoMe, MetaDatatouh, notepad++, and others. What Windows Explorer, PhotoGallery, Picasa and others do with this data is a hole other story!!&nbsp; In this case&nbsp;I analysed the data in the file itself
 to make sure it was not a problen of wrongly interpreting the timevalue by one of these applications. Conclusion: the data was wrongly writting to the file!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is something that can be fixed relative easy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

            <p>Hi Cesar,</p>
<p>I will try to answer your questions, but I don't think there really relevant.</p>
<p><span>Q: What is the exact steps that you made to verify this issue on your end? If possible, please provide the steps.</span></p>
<p>1. Take any &nbsp;image file you want of the JPEG format. Source of the file isn't relevant as long it has at least one IPTC field in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open it in with Windows Photo Gallery, Select the file and change the Date or Time Taken. (Bottom left)</p>
<p>3. Open the file in any other application that can read IPTC metadata, or just open it in notepad. And you will see that the date/time is written with wrong time zone information</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp;<span>Is the timezone on your computer properly set-up?</span></p>
<p><span>Yes off course. Do you really think that I did all this investigation work without checking this. ?</span></p>
<p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span><span>What is the device used to capture the photos?</span></p>
<p><span>Like I have mentioned before, it is not relevant. I've used different files from different source. You can take any JPG file as long it's has IPTC data in it. Download it from
 the web or create a new file in Ms Paint, draw a smiley face and save it as JPG, add some IPTC metadata (Metatouch, Picassa or any other tool that writes IPTC tags)</span></p>
<p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span><span>Is it synchronized with the computer where you transferred the photos?</span></p>
<p><span>Not relevant. It has nothing to do with transferring photo's&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will send you some screenshots and some demo files you can test. Actually the screenshots files could be used as demo files, if you add IPTC data first off course.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think this together with my original message should be more then enough to regenerate the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards.</span></p>

    <title>WSCSVC - Strange Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carrollslemaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            WSCSVC - Strange Issue</h2>
                    Whenever I do a system restart, I get an error event, number 7023, "WSCSVC service terminated" for the reason it is "not a valid Win 32 application".&nbsp; First, note that it states that the service was terminated, not that it failed to start (and the "services"
 tab of task manager shows it as "stopped").&nbsp; Second, I find that there are a total of 6 copies of a wscsvc.dll file - two are named wscsvc.dll and their sizes are zero, and four are named wscsvc.dll.mui (alternate-language versions?) with sizes 8704 (which
 seems much too small from what I have read at other sites).&nbsp; The zero-bytes DLLs are in windows\system32\ and windows\sxs\amd64_micro... (very long string);&nbsp; the 8704-byte MUIs are in Windows\System32\en-US\ and in Windows\SysWOW64\en-US\ and in Windows\winsxs\amd64_Microsoft-wind......&nbsp;
 I'm reluctant to simply set its startup type to "disabled" out of concern that system security might become compromised.&nbsp; I will be most grateful if anyone can tell w

<h2>            &#34;Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage&#34; when connecting to Windows or Microsoft Update.</h2>
                    I am running XP SP3 with IE8. A/V is McAfee from ATT Uverse. I downloaded MSRT and ran in safe mode. Found no infected files. Could not run in normal mode because svchost.exe used up all CPU resources. Had 8 instances of svchost.exe running at once. This
 computer has only 1 GB memory and AMD 2Ghz processor. IE also jumps to random sites and opens windows all by itself. Just had it take me to 3 other sites while trying to log on to this site. I have another computer on wireless home network with Vista, IE8
 &amp;&nbsp;Symantec that has no problems. Will anything besides gasoline and a match solve this??

    <title>External monitor not working since upgrading to Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ss29672  say:</h3>
<h2>            External monitor not working since upgrading to Win10</h2>
                    <p>TLDR: <strong>Monitor is seen by device manager</strong>, but <strong>isn't being detected by other programs, and seems to
</strong><strong>loop</strong> through a <strong>discovery and disconnect phase. </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution Posted at Bottom!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I was using the Windows 10 Preview, and the monitor worked correctly. However, since going to regular Windows 10 the monitor has a troubling problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My external monitor is being powered by an Nvidia GT 555M through an HDMI port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the device manager&gt;monitors, the monitor is there "Hannstar HF229". &nbsp;Right clicking the monitor and selecting properties shows that it is connected to the GT 555M.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The monitor however is not seen by an external programs such as the Nvidia Control Panel, Intel HD Graphics or under System Settings&gt;Display.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the monitor keeps going through this loop where it is seemingly being connected and disconnected. The only way I know this is because of the sound events happening, "Dun dun din! and Dun dun".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, <strong>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers </strong>for the Nvidia GT 555M, the Intel HD 3000 and the Hanstar HF229. I have also gone through the registry and deleted the keys under the Nvidia location in event it was bad registry settings.
 I have also tried a different cable and hooking up to my TV. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked so far. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>What is happening, is that Windows 10 is now treating your external monitor as a projector.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hit Win+P, and force to project to second screen</strong>. Give it a second, but this will work.

    <title>Taskbar randomly stops working since update &#126; 25&#47;11&#47;17 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Taskbar randomly stops working since update &#126; 25&#47;11&#47;17</h2>
                    <p>Since the Win10 update last week, one of our PCs - the one we actually use for our business, loses it's taskbar and all associated functions randomly. Sometimes it's fine all day (ie yesterday) &amp; then it'll just stop working altogether (ie the day before
 yesterday &amp; today &amp; a couple of times last week). Usually I just restart &amp; it'll hold up for a while.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen several articles on retoring the Taskbar, most of which involve the Start Menu and or Task Manager. My problem is that when it goes, I'm unable to use ANYTHING to do with the taskbar:
</p>
<p>No taskbar left or right click functions, </p>
<p>No Windows icon activity (right or left click),</p>
<p>Start key not working, </p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts not working, so can't run any progs from command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using CTRL-ALT-DEL brings up the blue-screen page, but clicking on Task Manager just leaves the app not responding &amp; the little blue circle just going around and around and around...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can't restart Explorer, or do a system restore or anything much else apart from a cold reload which is REALLY not my action of choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give any useful information?</p>
<p>
</p><p>****Oh - as I've been typing this, some open apps have just appeared on the taskbar &amp; seem to respond.. Task Manager is still just going round in circles (has been for about 20 minutes now. Windows icon now works on R click only.
</p>
<p>Cannot open Settings from R click... and it's just frozen again.</p>
<p>Jeez... This is NOT impressive.</p>

<p>Hi André<br />
Have tried this - The cleanup utilities found problems but were not able to fix them; filechecker found errors &amp; allegedly did fix them, although there was no improvement to the taskbar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was skeptical about re-installing the grapics adapter, as I wasn't getting corrupted screen layouts or anything else associated with that particular nasty, but as a last resort, I did so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restart, it's ok at the moment &amp; all seems to be working well. However, I'm not about to believe it's fixed, as it does clear itself for a day or 2 or 3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know in a week if it's still good!</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance anyhow.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi again André.</p>
<p>Still the same I'm afraid. NO taskbar activity for several minutes after startup, then limited R click functions available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Manager still freezes everything &amp; oddly, so do the little utilities (such as the calculator..!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of a re-load unless you or someone can make head or tail of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.</p>

            Well, I recommend either a repair upgrade or a complete clean install at this point. 
<br />
<br />You might be better off performing the clean install.
<br />
<br />Repair upgrade:

<p>Hi Andre.</p>
<p>Yes, I went with the install option - files kept. Thus far at least it seems to be behaving, but this fault was always on &amp; off, so we'll have to wait &amp; see how it pans out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've just got to get the network talking to itself &amp; all the apps put back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, maybe you know: I've had to turn off networking with password credentials, as none of the other comps can sign on to the one that was re-installed &amp; my original password is not being accepted. I've tried a password recovery utility, but it doesn't even
 show any passwords,&nbsp; so that's useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything i can do to resolve this, as I don't really like having non-password access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annie</p>
