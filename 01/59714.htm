<h2>            Can&#39;t change lock screen</h2>
                    Title says it all. I have my Feedback and Diagnostics settings on Full, which is how many other problems like mine have been solved. But at the top it says in red text "*Some settings are hidden or managed by your organization." I have Windows 10 version
 1703, build 15063.540.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that this issue has something to do with the changes in the configuration settings. However, for us to identify the exact cause of the issue, we would like to ask for more information:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>•</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; Have you recently updated your Windows 10? If yes,
</span></span>did the issue only start after the update<span><span>?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•&nbsp; </span></span>Do you have another account on your PC? If yes, are you also experiencing the same issue regarding the lock screen?
</p>
<p><span><span>•</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; Can you tell us which edition of Windows 10 are you using?</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>•</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>

I have Windows 10 Home edition. There are no other accounts on the PC. I updated to the Creators update as soon as it was available to me, but the problem was happening before then. I have run a full scan of my hard drive with ESET Smart Security and the premium
 edition of Malwarebytes. I have also done sfc /scannow and repaired sector 83 on my drive. I don't think that has anything to do with this though.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that your old previous user account was corrupted. We suggest that you use the new profile account and migrate all the files from the old user account to the new one. Follow these steps for solution:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>This PC</strong>, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Local (C:) drive</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98132cc2-e61a-4a59-827c-de419fefc1e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98132cc2-e61a-4a59-827c-de419fefc1e3" height="188" width="144" /></a><br />
</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Users</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c590eb1-6796-41ad-b5ae-2799e6e8ac7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c590eb1-6796-41ad-b5ae-2799e6e8ac7d" height="147" width="344" /></a><br />
</li><li>Look for the username folder of the old account (ex: admin).<br />
&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd5f8e11-a3aa-487e-80d8-8a7f677215cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd5f8e11-a3aa-487e-80d8-8a7f677215cb" height="123" width="388" /></a><br />
</li><li>Copy all the folders from the old user account or you can choose which to copy.<br />
&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96656fb1-ce59-42d7-80bc-e460ade6562a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96656fb1-ce59-42d7-80bc-e460ade6562a" height="291" width="364" /></a><br />
</li><li>Look for the new user account folder and paste the one you copied. Highlight all the folders and click paste or you can press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Ctrl + A</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Ctrl + V</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to copy and paste the
 items. This will copy all the files and folders from the old user account to the new user account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may decide whether to keep the old user account or delete it. The old user account will also consume space on your computer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any questions or things you'd like to clarify, feel free to ask.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Reusing an OEM Windows license in a VM</h2>
                    I've purchased a new laptop (from Lenovo) with Windows 10 pre-installed. &nbsp;I'd like to remove the pre-installed Windows 10, install another (non-Microsoft, licensed) operating system and then install Windows 10 in a virtual environment. &nbsp;Can I do this using
 the Windows 10 license that came with my laptop or will I have to buy a new Windows license?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original&nbsp;OEM preinstalled License is tied to the original Hardware.</p>
<p>You now want to install it in a Virtual Machine instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/Pages/support-faq.aspx#fbid=u11sV_78rNg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/Pages/support-faq.aspx#fbid=u11sV_78rNg</a></p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>Can I install OEM software on a virtual machine (VMware)?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> You can install OEM software in a virtual environment as long as you have a separate license for each instance of the software. It is fine to use the OEM version as long as it is properly licensed. To be clear, a separate version of the
 software must be installed for both the “standard” and “virtual” installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where it gets tricky, as installing your copy of the preinstalled OEM Licensed OS in a Virtual machine&nbsp;means that it is no longer installed on the original hardware Configuration which includes the Motherboard where the Product Key is stored, as
 stated in the OEM License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Movie Maker&#58; Videos are unwatchable after being exported, please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kittymeowy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker&#58; Videos are unwatchable after being exported, please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>I recently bought a used Lenovo with Windows 7 on it, and just a few days ago I got the free Windows 10 update. I make 1-3 videos every week, and I use WMM because I don't need anything advanced. Unfortunately, switching to Windows 10 has caused major problems
 with WMM. When I import video files, they preview completely fine. When I export my projects, though,&nbsp; they come out as an unwatchable mess.
</p>
<p>The videos flicker constantly, sometimes getting stuck and flickering between blackness and a still image, and sometimes flickering between two scenes at one time. Then, after it finishes exporting, the project itself goes completely mute. My computer is
 fully updated as far as I can tell, and I've been working at this all day, but I can't find a solution on my own. I know it isn't a playback issue, since I've tried playing it in every media player I have. I don't see how my video files would be corrupted
 if they're playing fine within WMM. </p>
<p>Thank you for your help in advance.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for your quick response. I followed your suggestion, but unfortunately the video turned out the same as before, with black segments and flickering. After exporting, the WMM project went silent just as before. I also uninstalled and reinstalled
 Movie Maker, and the problem continues to occur. I tried recording a short clip within movie maker and exporting it, which worked fine, but projects with imported clips still come out as a garbled mess.</p>

<h2>            How do I set PDF via Bluebeam to preview in Windows 8 preview pane&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In windows 7, one can set the file tree preview pane to show a preview of a PDF file when you click on it once.</p>
<p>In windows 8, this does not work, even when you set Organize View to Preview Pane, and the reader to default reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions?</p>
<p>

<p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Your questions:</span></p>
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums.
<p>1. Do you have any other PDF Reader installed on the computer such as Adobe Reader?
</p>
<p>&gt; The group uses BlueBeam, although if no solution exists for BlueBeam on Windows 8 I will ask if Adobe Acrobat Reader is a workable alternative</p>
<p>2. Are you able to view the icon on the right hand side on the Preview Pane? </p>
<p>&gt; The icon of the file is there with the default BlueBeam image on all PDF files. No image of the file as icon is visible.</p>
<p>3. Which version of Bluebeam have you installed? </p>
<p>&gt; Bluebeam Xtreme</p>
<p>4. Is this issue specific to Bluebeam? Are you able to work with other Reader programs?
</p>
<p>&gt; Looking into this and will report back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check if you are using the latest version of Bluebeam on the computer.
</p>
<p>&gt; Yes, the latest version of BlueBeam Xtreme is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the multiple steps that are suggested in the article provided here.

<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to post the query in Bluebeam support forums to get more information.

</p>
<p>&gt; :) Have done at the same time I posted this Q here! (Not sure if the issue was one for Windows 8 or BlueBeam so I wanted to cover my bases...:))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. </p>
<p>&gt; Thank you!</p>
<p>I will look into the resource links above and post an update. It would be swell if you also check back here as if I find something relevant and have another Q I would love your input!</p>

    <title>Very Slow, Dragging Wi-Fi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chunkyhobbit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very Slow, Dragging Wi-Fi</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased an Acer Aspire E5-573G-56RG that came with Windows 10 installed. I have not had many issues with it in general, except when it comes to Wi-Fi. The connection speed is very sporadic, ranging from 1Mbps to 25 Mbps. I've tried just about
 everything I can think of to fix this issue, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Updated all drivers on system</p>
<p>a. Bluetooth USB Module Driver<br />
b. ELAN I2C Filter Driver<br />
c. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) Host Bridge - OPI - 1604<br />
d. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) PCI Express Root Port #1 - 9C90<br />
e. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) PCI Express Root Port #5 - 9C98<br />
f. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) PCI Express Root Port #3 &nbsp;9C94<br />
g. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) PCI Express Root Port #4 - 9C96<br />
h. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) Premium SKU LPC Controller - 9CC3<br />
i. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) SMBus Controller - 9CA2<br />
j. Mobile 5th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) USB EHCI Controller - 9CA6<br />
k. Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Checked for Windows Updates</p>
<p>a. Update for Windows Defender was available. Started installing, remained at 0%, didn't say it finished, then stated that PC was up-to-date.</p>
<p>b. Windows 10 Version is current.</p>
<p>c. Wireless adapter up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tested speed Wired vs. Wireless</p>
<p>a. Wired speed remained constant, around 25Mbps download speed, 2.5Mbps upload speed</p>
<p>b. Wireless speed sporadic, ranging from 1Mbps to 25Mbps download speed, 0.10Mbps to 2.5Mbps upload speed</p>
<p>c. Connected router to modem to PC, speed remained constant, around 25Mbps download speed, 2.5Mbps upload speed</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Reset all connections</p>
<p>a. Unplugged modem and router and plugged back in</p>
<p>b. Restarted PC</p>
<p>c. Forgot network</p>
<p>d. Changed connection from Private to Public to Private again</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Changed various settings</p>
<p>a. Disabled Bluetooth</p>
<p>b. Disabled Location</p>
<p>c. Troubleshot network issues</p>
<p>d. Checked Firewall settings, nothing unusual</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Tested different browsers, fiddled with their settings</p>
<p>a. MS Edge</p>
<p>b. Firefox</p>
<p>c. Google Chrome</p>
<p>d. Cleared browsing data, cache, cookies</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else there is for me to do. If it helps, I'm using the 5.0GHz Wi-Fi option of my router, as opposed to the 2.4GHz option.</p>

<p>Hello. I have tried Method 1 for the troubleshooting, and I will notify if there are any changes. So far I am getting the correct speed, but it may fluctuate, so I will observe it closely. Method 2 does not apply to me, however, as I do not have antivirus
 installed yet.&nbsp;</p>

            I have tested the speed via speedtest.net several times over the course of today and it is still fluctuating just as badly. I am at the end of my rope here.

<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a third party software installed in the system, you can try disabling built-in Windows Defender. Check if the speed enhances. Refer to the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press "Windows logo key + Q", and type <strong><em>defender</em></strong> in the search box.</li><li>Click <strong>Windows defender</strong> in the search list.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings </strong>tab.<br />

            Hello. I have disabled Windows Defender and restarted my computer. I left it going for the next 24 hours to notice any differences. There were none. I am still experiencing the issue. My computer is also up to date after restarting.

            <p>Hi, Julie.</p>
<p>The problem you are describing affects all of us to one extent or another. There are several approaches to take: some may apply to your Surface Pro 3, and some may not. My experience with Microsoft does not include the hardware side, I am sorry to say, however
 with that said, there still may be hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, color principles in short . . . Complementary colors for the wavelength associated with blue is yellow. This is a visible light complement not a paint or artistic complement. A degree of blue light filtering can be accomplished by adding a yellowish
 tint to as a screen mask literally a block of yellow coloration that is placed over the blue screen. This will tend to add the filter type of effect, but it may not be enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Display color calibration may offer the help you desire, but play with adding yellow while reducing blue. that should tend to balance the higher blue frequency with the relatively lower yellow frequency. That's the best description I can provide on how to
 try to do this. Tablets have blue light filter apps that can be obtained for free.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 sees my second monitor as &#34;generic non-PnP&#34; and won&#39;t let me set the right resolution</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have just installed Windows 7 Professional 64 bit on a new hard drive on my Dell Studio 540. The PC has an ATI Radeon HD 3450 graphics card, and has a Samsung 226bw 22" monitor on the digital output. This works fine, and has the resolution set to 1650x4050.
 When I was running Vista (on the previous hard drive), I had an old 14" flat monitor on the other output, and it worked fine (albeit at a low resolution).</p>
<p>I added an AOC F22s+ monitor on the other output, expecting to be able to set this to the recommended resolution of 1920x1080. Unfortunately, Windows has set the driver for this monitor to "Generic non-PnP" and won't let me set the right resolution. The
 maximum it will allow is 1600x1200, which (along with all the other resolutions it allows) is not using the monitor to its maximum capability, and is the wrong ratio anyway, so the display looks stretched.</p>
<p>I have run Windows Update, so have the latest drivers. I have tried installing other drivers, but nothing helps.</p>
<p>I tried unplugging the Samsung monitor and rebooting the PC, so that the AOC one was the only monitor there, and it still had it as "Generic non-PnP"with the wrong resolution.</p>
<p>Anyone any ideas? I'm at my wits end. AOC support didn't understand it, and could only suggest that the monitor was faulty, but the place where I bought it insist that it's working fine, and so won't swap it or let me refund (without a restocking fee, which
 is a rip-off).</p>
<p>I would really like to use both monitors, and would greatly appreciate any help anyone can give. I hope I've given enough information. If I haven't, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM SOLVED!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>It turned out that my VGA cable was faulty, and wasn't sending the right signal to the PC. The display worked fine with a VGA monitor, but the PC wasn't being told that the new monitor was a PnP. I tried a different cable, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who suggested things.</p>

<h2>            OEM Windows 7 download</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a toshiba laptop which came pre-installed with OEM windows 7 home premium - so no install disc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently had a problem with it so the only option was to format and re-install windows. I downloaded an iso of win 7 home premium and went through the installation as normal, but dont have the activation key as the sticker on the bottom of the laptop
 has rubbed off. I spoke to Microsoft who said I need to speak to Toshiba, so I spoke to Toshiba and they have now told me that because the OEM key is built in to the motherboard, i shouldnt have to enter a product key when activating windows.. so it seems
 as though I have downloaded a non-OEM version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone please point me in the right direction of, or provide me a link to a download of an OEM windows 7 home premium (64-bit).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Like I said, I dont have the product key and neither Windows or Toshiba look as though they are going to provide one for free so NEED AN OEM software build.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Daniel</div>
                </div>

            <p>What means of recovery did Toshiba provide?&nbsp; A recovery partition?&nbsp; Perhaps you have not destroyed it despite the reinstallation and can use that to get back your activated Windows 7 system.&nbsp; The instructions differ between manufacturers so you'll need to
 check your PC manual to find out how it can be used [if it is still there].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has the label on the PC really rubbed off or are you looking in the wrong place?&nbsp; Some are in the battery compartment of a laptop rather than the outside, just for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installation disks do not contain the Product Key even if they are described as OEM copies.&nbsp; There is no difference between a retail disk &amp; an OEM version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Toshiba meant was that the original Product Key was saved in the PC's firmware on the motherboard so it should not have needed to be entered again [I had this experience when I reinstalled on my Dell - it just completed and happily said it was self-activated*].&nbsp;
 The sticker on the back of the PC was there as a fallback in case this firmware Product Key was lost.</p>
<p><em>* I think the correct term is actually something similar to a "SLP Product Key".</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows really is telling you that it has not activated [see Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System - look near the bottom of the window] then you have somehow overwritten the Product Key saved in the firmware by Toshiba.&nbsp; Unless you can persuade
 them that this is somehow their fault then you are not going to be able to activate Windows without buying a new copy or getting the alternative number from the label on the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the label on the PC missing or might you still be able to read it with a bit of playing around?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">These characters are not used [thanks to forum member George 1009 for this info]:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span><span><font color="#000000">E,U,I,O,A,S,L,Z,N, and 1,0 whilst these might easily be misread
</font></span><span><font color="#000000">B and 8, G and 6&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Try taking a few digital photos of the CoA label from different angles &amp; possibly with then without the flash active and then playing around in a graphics app with the brightness &amp; contrast levels. Work separately for each photo
 &amp; each digit of the Product Key as what works for one area of wear may not work for another. If you have Office then use
<em><span>Microsoft Office Picture Manager</span></em> as it is very good at this.</font></span></p>

            Thanks for the reply Try*3.
<div><br />
<div>The label is clearly visible on the underside of the laptop but the text has been completely rubbed off - absolutely unreadable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the desktop, in the bottom right (above the clock) is the text confirming it hasn't been activated; says "Windows 7, Build 7601, This copy of windows is not genuine"</div>
<div><br />
<div>The HDD is partitioned; i was using the drive as a backup drive but there is a folder in there called HDDRecovery which I did not create, and can only assume it is the recovery folder for reinstall?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If yes, how do I go about doing that?</div>

            <p>HDDRecovery - this might be the recovery mechanism put on by Toshiba but you'll need to use the procedure in the Toshiba manual to use it [there is almost certainly&nbsp;a copy on their website if you have lost the original].&nbsp; Many PC makers put the recovery
 utility in a separate partition but the procedures given in the manual would explain just what has to be done in any case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the activation in the system dialog as the notice on the desktop might mean something else.&nbsp; [see Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System - look near the bottom of the window]
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, try to tell it to activate [see <em>Activate <span>
Windows&nbsp;7</span> on this computer</em> in Windows Help] to see if it can sort itself out anyway.&nbsp; Mine sorted itself out even though I had played around removing &amp; shifting partitions like there was no tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 instalaltion.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>

            The computer has definitely not been activated, and the windows activation won't let me activate without a product key - have already tried that but tried just a moment ago and it still asks for a key..
<div><br />
<div>I have found the manual online, but it only explains how to create a recovery disk.. But when i run the toshiba program, i get the error stating there is 'no HDD Recovery Area'..</div>
<div><br />
<div>I could really do with just downloading an OEM version of Win 7 home premium and using that as my boot source.. any suggestions?</div>

            <p>If the Toshiba OS restoration / Factory Restoration utility is saying that there is no hdd recovery area then it sounds as though this facility has been corrupted and so cannot help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reinstallation you attempted ["I downloaded an iso"] is all that you can try on your own - assuming that the ISO was the correct one i.e. for Home Premium &amp; for 32/64 bit as applicable.&nbsp; No installation ISO or DVD contains the Product Key.&nbsp; Your questions
 about "OEM version" versus "non-OEM version" are a complete red herring - Installation DVDs supplied by Toshiba or anyone else will also look to the Product key saved in the firmware [or that given on the CoA label on the PC].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your only hope is that you persuade Toshiba that the problem was their fault or try flattering them.&nbsp; They might or might not be able to give you a relevant Product Key {I wouldn't hold my breath personally].&nbsp; See if the Toshiba link provided by Andre above
 can give you any better answer - <a href="https://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/serviceUnitVerification.jsp?orderType=SFF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently running the windows 8.1 version and as we still have four days to download windows 10 for free im tempted to give it a go but as I require and use Windows Live Mail version 12 , Build 16.4.3564.1216 to handle mail gmail account, i wonder whether
 this tool will be installed along with windows 10 and will all messages, contacts embedded with it will migrate to the new OS W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried to export the current messages in Windows live mail but there is a bug and cannot do it....</p>

            <p>Windows Live Mail should survive the upgrade to Windows 10. Just in case, make a copy of the store folder and keep it in a safe place, e.g. on a USB memory stick or SD card. The store folder contains all your account settings, account folders and messages
 and calendars. It is by default</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="font-weight: bold">%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</span></p>
<p>You can open it by copying that black line, pressing Windows key + R, Ctrl-V to paste into the box and
<p>
</p><p>If you're normally signed in in Windows Live Mail, there should be no problem with contacts. If you're not, you might want to export your default contacts list as well. Use the
<em>Export</em> command in the contacts window to create a CSV file, then keep it safe, e.g. in your Documents folder or on the backup drive you used for the store folder.</p>

            It was indeed a smooth upgrading last night from 8.1 to Windows 10, every single&nbsp; file, application and piece of software suite was on the same place where i had left them. As far as WLM is concerned the suite, the messages, contacts and all settings were
 brought forward seamlessly and everything is perfectly working as in the old times with 8.1. Well done Microsoft engineers.

<h2>            All devices are connecting to the internet but me and my roommates computers</h2>
                    <p>Here are my specs on my wireless driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p>asus realtek 8821ae wireless lan 802.11ac pci-e nic&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know my roommates computer, but he has windows 10 on it like I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done everything I can think of and have looked up on how to get back onto the internet, I have cleared DNS, I have changed power settings, I have changed fast reboot (disabled and enabled). &nbsp;The only thing that seems to have worked was going into
 my wireless adapters advanced configurations, and I enabled 802.11d, and then disabled it, which temporarily gives me internet access for about a minute then it stops.<br />
<br />
I keep getting that I'm connected, but with no internet, and anything on chrome just shows that I have DNS issues.<br />
<br />
I have also used cmd prompt to renew my ip, and restarted. &nbsp;I also reinstalled drivers for my wireless adapter, and even my ethernet.<br />
<br />
Ethernet was ALSO not working.<br />
<br />
ANY help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Restart computer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let it settle in &nbsp;&nbsp; and allow windows to reinstall the drivers it self.</p>
<p>is this a laptop?...you may have an issue with the adapter it self...Have you tried a USB Wireless adapter....I use a Belkin to get faster speed and works way better than the built in system @ 300 mbs....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; built in Wifi usually is only @ around 50 to
 70 mbs.</p>

            <p>I have run the troubleshooter, and it says there are no issues being detected even though there is a lack of internet connection. &nbsp;I also just reinstalled the drivers just like you said, and nothing, still giving dns_probe_finished_no_internet.<br />
<br />
Here are my specs: geforce gtx 760, intel core i7 4770S @3.10 GHz 12 GB RAM Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is not a laptop, it's a desktop pc, and I have an external wifi adapter. &nbsp;It recognizes all of the wifi around, and my roommates computer also stopped connecting today even though the last few days have been fine.<br />
<br />
Yes built in wifi only gives about 70 mb/s, but that shouldn't hinder from connecting to the internet.<br />
<br />
Strangely the only thing that seems to work for only about a minute is enabling and then disabling 802.11d in my advanced configurations. It connects, lets me see websites, and then I get the DNS error again</p>

<p>What is being used as a 'Internet service Provider'?...do you have a modem in your room?</p>
<p>Have you tried a direct cable?....could be the actual wifi part of the modem since both pc's are affected.</p>
<p>My modem will send a signal through out the home and as far as the driveway...but my brother has basically the same modem yet the range sucks...I told him to exchange it but he says right now they can live with it.....it's free just to exchange the box.</p>

            I SOLVED IT!<br />
<br />
So, this is what was done; first of all some detail on the cable modem, it is a bit older, and the user ssid and password on the box didn't work. &nbsp;So I did what anyone would do when trying to access the modem via it's IP, I admin admin it. &nbsp;I got into the modem
 settings after about 3 hours of hitting my head against the wall trying to figure out how to log in to it. &nbsp;Ethernet wasn't working for either computer, so when I went in, thought there might be some MAC address filtering, and low and behold for some reason,
 even though we had recently logged into this modem and had no issues, and no one else had access to the modem it blocked us. &nbsp;I found that it had IP flooding enabled when too many devices access it, and then I looked at some other forums where people said
 the retailer made it so that it would also trip MAC filtering when it detected IP flooding to prevent hacking.<br />
<br />
It was simply just removing the MAC filtering, and voila back on. &nbsp;Well, almost, I also had to change the signal bandwidth from 20 mHz to 40.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone that may have a similar issue.

 I exit out of the media and go back to it they are gone, vanished, poof.&nbsp; I have tried restore media library and restarted computer come back they load on to the media player I exit out of the player and go back and once again gone.&nbsp; Please help...I have tried

<h3> urnabad roy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t find folder from desktop.</h2>
                    I recently opened my laptop, i saw all my apps as if they are newly installed &amp; properly organised, couldn't see my files which i made. I got a pop up message saying i have been logged in from a temporary account. After that I found all my files from users.
 I didn't know this thing about "temporary account" and had saved an important file on desktop itself. Now after 2 days when I have opened laptop i can't find that file which is really really important, please help.

<p>Hi UrnabaD Roy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can check for the lost file in the system using two methods. Follow either of the methods below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: Using Cortana</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<span><strong>Windows&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>key</strong> on the keyboard and type&nbsp;<span><strong>windows.old</strong></span>&nbsp;in the search box.</span></li><li><span>Select the search result which shows folder and drive location of the program.</span></li><li><span>Follow the file/folder path to check the contents of the same.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2: Using Windows explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press<span>&nbsp;<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>E</strong>&nbsp;</span>keys on the keyboard to open<span>&nbsp;<strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span>Click on<span>&nbsp;<strong>This PC</strong>&nbsp;</span>option from the left side panel of the window<span>.</span></span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;<span><strong>windows.old</strong></span>&nbsp;in the<span>&nbsp;<strong>Search This PC</strong>&nbsp;</span>box located at the top right corner of the window.</span></li><li><span>Follow the file/folder path to check the contents of the same.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you're able to locate the file you're looking for, you can now proceed to rectifying the issue with the temporary profile.&nbsp;When you log in to your Windows profile, your profile’s information and settings are picked up from registry entries and configuration
 files saved on your hard disk. Corruption of a single file can disable Windows from accessing it and it will log you to a temporary profile which you can use. I suggest that you enable the built-in admin account and run SFC to rectify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker (SFC) is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how you can enable the built-in admin account and run SFC:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Launch <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)
</strong>by typing <strong>Command Prompt </strong>in the search bar, right-clicking on the best match and choosing
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Type: <strong>net user Administrator /active yes</strong></li><li>Run a System File Ccheck by typing the following command: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong></li><li>Type <strong>net user Administrator /active no</strong> to disable the admin account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry if this is in the wrong thread/section I'm new to this forum but my question is what is the age in Canada that will allow me to upgrade my child account to an adult account. I'm going to turn 17 in a week and I am praying that after that I can enjoy
 anything I want online. To be specific I live in Ontario.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, judging by the kids who play CoD, I'd say getting around the age restriction is a pretty easy task for most.

<h2>            Missing split-keyboard and problems with small keys on on screen keyboard on Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>After using my new Surface Pro 2 with the on screen touch Keyboard for several days, the Keyboard changed after a Windows update, and is now not working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When selecting a mode on the soft Keyboard (both in Windows store apps and on the desktop) there are four options, in addition to the "minimize/close"-option to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before something broke, I was able to Select the first one (to the left) which filled half the screen with keys, the second one, which has a split-keyboard view very well suited for holding the surface with two hands, an handwriting-mode and a last mode
 I don't really know what it is supposed to do, since I can't remember to have seen it enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, I can only choose between the handwriting keyboard and the one to the left, but it doesn't fill the screen anymore, it is now a very hard to use small Keyboard centered to the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the lucky position that I have both this new Surface Pro 2, and an older Surface Pro. Both are updated with the latest updates, but the Suface Pro is behaving normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pro 2 is installed from the US English Windows 8.1 Enterprise distribution, and I have added Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokmål Language packs, and I have also installed a greek Keyboard layout (also have these on the Surface Pro that behaves normally,
 no problems using greek Keyboard split screen, and not-split with large keys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this pro 2 was updated, I probably had it docked with a Lenovo/Display Link USB 3 docking station (didn't discover the problem before I was out of Office with the Pro2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would like to have my soft keys back to normal...</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Which updates were installed recently?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the section “<strong>How will I know what updates have been installed?</strong>” to check the update history and let us know which updates were installed recently.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to provide a screenshot of your current keyboard layout so that we can check and assist you better:</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is hard taking these screenshots on the surface, since there is no keyboard print-screen key. It is not possible for me to capture the menu where you choose between Keyboard layouts (but IMHO you should be able to check out that function on Your own system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also hard for me to check which updates - I don't know what section you are referring to, I found it under Windows update, but no easy way to list every update (57 updates), but the attached screenshot has what was possible to show on one screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to attach the screen shot of the Keyboard on the desktop, but it is identical in full screen mode (any tries to capture using win+vol-down captures the Keyboard as it is sliding off screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard is supposed to fill the entire Width of the screen - but it centers in the midddle. On the other Surface the same Keyboard fills the full witdth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that something has been malconfigured since I had an external display Attached when some system change happened.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article and watch the video and check if you are finding it any different than that showed in the video:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to use the touch keyboard</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will also see in the video how to increase the size of the keyboard while using the thumb keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if it helps.</span></p>

            <p>This answer is very provoking, since it seems to me you are not Reading my Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard in the video is not the same as I include in my screenshots</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is no menu for changing the size of the Keyboard, neither is it possible to choose between keyboard types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS MY PROBLEM - IT DOESN'T WORK - AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY MY OTHER SURFACES</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using surface for over a year - I know there is a FAULT with the system - I do not need to know how the Keyboard IS SUPPOSED to work - but GET IT WORKING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else able to help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, i have lots of Windows 8 devices With touch, a Laptop (Lenovo X1), an Atom tab (HP), two Surface RT and one Surface Pro (I) - and now this Surface Pro 2. My daughter also have a touch-screen all in one, and my wife has a Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 2.</p>

            <p>Well I could do that, and I probably must.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is upgraded to W8.1 Enterprise edition, has joined an active Directory domain and I am mostly using Direct Access when I am not in Meetings at work, and it took a whole day installing it with&nbsp;all my Tools, so I hoped there was some other means
 for making the computer behave like a tablet again keyboardwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NeXT week I am in Meetings all day, and I need DA and my Tools, so I'll still be looking for an answer, while having to resort to the type-cover keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I still hope anyong can give me some tips on what changed the keyboard's behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reset the machine and it turns back like this, my support and defense for Microsoft and Windows 8 will get a serious dent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the crazy casing, it's IE trying to be helpful in some strange way.</p>

<p>

Also, have you tried both <strong>troubleshooting</strong> to search for Windows system errors, as well, run the

<p>
</p><p>The thing is&nbsp;a new system update arrived yesterday, and the problem went away after that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tip about the language pack is an important one, since I have installed an us-english Windows, and downloaded "norsk nynorsk" (norwegian variant), and this is a less commonly used language pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried troubleshooting, sfc I didn't know, but i Guess Windows seemed very happy With the system - no errors, only to me a bad experience when in "all touch".</p>

<h2>            How do I unblock  publisher on windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I need to unblock a Samsung phone app on windows 10. Windows keeps telling me "This publisher has been blocked from running software on your machine" and I can't figure out how to unblock it.

            Granted I'm not a fan of Samsung Kies but figured I'd try it in Windows 10, the directions given has no certificates at all under untrusted or trusted

            <p>Right click on the file you are trying to run and go in the properties, General at the bottom of the screen and make sure you do not have a message saying Security: This file came from another computer and might be blocked ..., if you do simply check the
 Unblock and click on apply and ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to run your app if you get a message saying the app has been blocked ... then do the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start, All apps, Windows Administrative tools, Computer Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you open: Local Users and Group, Users and double click on Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncheck "Account is disabled", Apply and Ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish, right click on Administrator and set password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the pc and login as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can simply run you app from the Administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. right click run as admin from a user account doesn't work! I tried :(</p>
<p>In my case it looks like the certificate was expired</p>
<p>good luck I hope that Helped</p>

            <p>HELLO! </p>
<p>you need to right click on file and click properties, then click and check unblock (its under hidden and read only)</p>
<p>
</p><p>then you need to install this software:</p>
<p>
</p><p>""FileUnsigner""</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>http://www.fluxbytes.com/software-releases/fileunsigner-v1-0/</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>maybe you will need to install .net 2 or..., anywhere, you drag your programs (setup file from Samsung or hp!!!) to program's icon on your desktop (or folder) and then you will be able to see ms dos (cmd) program, just click on any button on your keyboard
 and enjoy it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>now is the time to install your file without any problems!</p>
<p>
</p><p>------ just do this for trusted files from truested companies!!!! ----</p>

            <p>BD. I don't have any untrusted publishers listed on the tab. But yet, I can't install an app. It says that the publisher is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just been on the phone for over an hour with a Microsoft engineer. He took control of my machine and just messed about with it trying to install my program. Then he just hung up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the Microsoft engineers know what they are doing?</p>

<p>Is there some reason you are not include the KB number or description of the update that will not install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if this helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14246217-2124-4485-9f3c-9570464148bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14246217-2124-4485-9f3c-9570464148bf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with hardware devices (video, audio, network, printer) don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you are having a problem like that you
 should only get driver updates from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2063bb5-3aed-4321-9a47-236ebb0cb8e5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09dc4ee2-29ed-4bcf-aad7-831f687bee05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09dc4ee2-29ed-4bcf-aad7-831f687bee05" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

<p>well would you rather have no access to the content?</p>
<p>this only seems fair</p>
<p>as the previous owner would only have the right to the content</p>
<p>and rights do not transfer</p>
<p>ea just lets you licenses the content </p>
<p>they do not make money on used sales thats goesx 100% to the store</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 Codec problem.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows Media Player 11 doesn't seem to support .WAV music files. It says "Windows media player cannot play the file. The player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file".
</p>
<p>Do I need to install more codecs? </p>
<p>How do I go about doing this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>You won't receive a code, the game should show as free if you try to purchase it from the marketplace. If you are part of the preview program, you will not be able to download it until you are actually charged for the game about 2 weeks before Dishonored
