<h2>            Transferring data from Xbox 360S to Xbox 360E&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>My old Xbox 360 Slim is dying on me and unfortunately a new power supply hasn't fixed the problem. Therefore I've decided to buy a new one before they all sell out and I'm forced to go pre-owned.</p>
<p>How do I go about transferring my save games and downloaded titles from the Xbox 360 Slim to the E model? I can see a lot of guides via google about transferring from the original to the slim but nothing for slim to E.</p>
<p>Is it as simple as swapping hard drives?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Yup, just swap the hard drive. </p>
<p>The only other things you'll want to do is a license transfer. That'll move all of your game licenses from your previous console to your new one so you can play your games offline and any other accounts on your console can still share your content. You will
 need to redownload everything, but since your games are on the hard drive, you'll only be redownloading the licenses and not the actual game data so it won't take as long. &nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.com/drm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/drm</a></p>

            Hi Eric Kia,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Persian language pack is an add-on to the Multilingual User Interface Pack (MUI). To install Farsi language and Farsi keyboard layout in Windows Vista, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Open Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region, and then clicking Regional and Language Options.
<br />
2. Click the Keyboards and Languages tab, and then click Change keyboards.<br />
3. Under Installed services, click Add.<br />
4. Double-click Farsi language, double-click the text services you want to add, select the text services options you want to add, and then click OK .
<br />
Also check the link “Available Language Packs” <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722435(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722435(WS.10).aspx</a> <br />

    <title>Type Cover not working on SP3 but listen... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Type Cover not working on SP3 but listen...</h2>
                    <p>I know, it´s an ongoing issue and I´m definitely not the first one to post here, but I´m still not giving up. I have now installed the new Windows version 1903 and installed the newest firmware-package in hope it would fix something, although not mentioned
 in the patchnotes (who knows, MS could have patched it but not mention it, cause they´re aknowledging it publicly yet). Long story short, it does not.</p>
<p>I have tried forcing the Type Cover filter device driver onto the existing HID-device listed in the keyboards section of the device manager. Now it´s listing the type cover filter device, but it still isn´t working. Strangely I used to have a second, sometimes
 third and fourth HID device that have been greyed out but those are gone now. It randomly appeared and i tried to install the type cover driver onto it aswell and windows was saying it worked but driver and name had not changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funnily I presumed, that with the new firmware package there would be new drivers but the type cover driver is from sometime in the year 2017. To make sure it´s really this version contained in the package I made a copy of the old folder the drivers were
 installed in with other firmware packages and reinstalled the new one. It really is from 2017.</p>
<p>In case it wasn´t obvious, I have already tried out the 2 button method, disconnecting and reconnecting the cover, wiping the contacts, and all those other methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the SP3 used and it´s working perfectly fine except for the type cover of course. The type cover was new when I bought it but it with the spanish layout (it was the cheapest). I tried it on other SPs and it´s working fine but just like with everyone
 else the other type covers are not working for me.</p>
<p>I will ad some screenshots and maybe you might try it out and force the type cover filter device onto HID device aswell.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f616505c-d943-4e5d-b03f-4a5fba4a16f8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f616505c-d943-4e5d-b03f-4a5fba4a16f8?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee815dcd-fd53-4299-81fb-5ae7dd27b4af?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee815dcd-fd53-4299-81fb-5ae7dd27b4af?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Error code 1719 “The Windows Installer service could not be accessed, the Windows Installer is not correctly installed”<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
This problem may occur if the Windows Installer files are damaged or missing. Other reason can be incorrect permission issue on the related registry keys that Windows Installer wants to access.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to check whether the Windows Installer Service is running in Services.msc window.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click On start; In the Start search, type Services.msc and Hit Enter.<br />
b. Right click on Windows Installer and click on Start (Only if the Service has stopped).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Restart the computer and try to installing the game.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You’ve to try this method very carefully since it involves system registry modification. Try this method if all of the above steps fail.</p>
<p><strong>Registry Disclaimer:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base:</p>
<p><strong>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</strong> <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</a></p>
<p>a. Go to your friend’s computer with a Windows Vista (Any Version) that has the Windows<br />
Installer service running correctly and run regedit.exe by clicking on start and typing it in Start search.</p>
<p>b. Go to the location<br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\msiserver</strong></p>
<p>c. Right click on this key and select “Export” and save the key to a Flash Drive or other device.</p>
<p>d. On your machine under question, Run/ Double click saved .reg file (from working machine) and import registry settings into damaged Vista computer.</p>

<p>This was posted on this site by Raybo:</p>
<p>Hope it helps you as much as it helped me!&nbsp; I fixed 4 pcs with this problem so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible solution: I have seen this posted and tried on 4 Win7 64 bit pc's.&nbsp; They all had the value which I changed and all now are able to install/unintall which they could not earlier.&nbsp; Hope it helps!</p>
<p>HERE IS THE FIX THAT WORKED FOR ME :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start, then Run, then type regedit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENT CONTROL SET\SERVICES\MSIserver\WOW64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on WOW64, then select Modify&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Value Data to 0 (mine was set
 at 1) and Base should be Hexadecimal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close everything, reboot, and see if you can uninstall or reinstall...............it worked for me.&nbsp; Don't bother with Office XP Pro and Windows 7..............it screws up everything.</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I am experiencing the same on multiple x64 bit Windows 2008 Enterprise and Windows 7 x64 bit systems. We are in deep troubles because we cannot install the x64 bit software.</p>
<p>@ Jose, I don't see the WOW64 registry key, I have updated all my servers but this key is not available. Am I missing something here or I dont have to worry about the value data for WOW64 because this key is not available. I would still like to know if Microsoft
 has a KB published for this issue or what Microsoft has to say about the WOW64 registry key because when I was trying to search on the net I found a lot of users complaining that this key is not available.</p>

<p>Hello SysEng-Arun</p>
<p>I have found this problem on multiple Windows 7 64 bit workstations to date; so far no servers though it appears others have.&nbsp; Regarding the key, of all the workstations involved, there was one that was a 64 bit install but did not have the registry key
 either.&nbsp; What I did, believe it or not, was to manually create it based on another system's value that I knew was working.&nbsp; I rebooted and would you believe it actually worked!&nbsp; That was a new one for me.&nbsp; I don't know if this would be possible for you since
 it is a server but the system is now installing and uninstalling like a champ.&nbsp; I too searched Microsoft's KB and to date have found nothing regarding this.&nbsp; It is very bizarre that so many have this issue and there is no info about it from them.&nbsp; I hope that
 this sheds some light for you and please keep me posted on what you decide to do.&nbsp; Good Luck!&nbsp; Jose</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop - only works on home network</h2>
                    I've successfully used the Remote Desktop app on my iPad while connected to the same wireless network as my PC, so I know the setup works. &nbsp;However, I cannot access the PC from other places. &nbsp;I'm trying to use an iPad on a Verizon network, and I've verified
 the PC is on and connected to the internet. Any suggestions?

            <p>This takes some work - you'll need to know what your home's IP address is (the one assigned by your internet service company).&nbsp; Then you'll need to set your home router to watch for any incoming remote desktop requests and forward them to the proper IP address
 inside your internal network.&nbsp; This is known as "port forwarding" and <a href="http://portforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://portforward.com/</a> has a lot information about it, including how to setup most home routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you need to do this:&nbsp; When you're inside your home network, you can just connect to the other computer by name or IP (such as "Dell-LivingRoom" or "192.168.1.12").&nbsp; But when you are outside your home, those addresses lose their meaning.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Another example: say you are at a hotel saying in room 213.&nbsp; You can call the room next to you by dialing 215 on&nbsp; your phone.&nbsp; But if you drove across town and picked up a phone and called "215" it wouldn't do anything anymore. It
 needs more information to route the call properly (notably it needs to know which hotel to call before trying that extension).&nbsp; Remote Desktop is exactly the same.

<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 version 1703 for x64- based systems - recently all have failed to install</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that all cumulative updates for windows 10 have failed to install. All other updates for other software have been successful. How to fix this issue? It appears from my update history that particularly KB4040724 failed 13 times on 29 Oct and KB4048954
 failed 1 time on 20 Nov but I see further down the list that this one&nbsp;KB4048954 had been successful before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's make sure that we are on the same page. Sometimes, the update history still shows update errors that are already installed. Which build are you running? Press
<strong>Windows key + S a</strong>nd type <strong>winver </strong>then press <strong>
Enter</strong>. We are currently at OS build <strong>16299.64</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running an older build, run the automated troubleshooter to diagnose the issue. Go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            I will assume from the different version number and that it is 'smaller' that I must have an older version. I am presently doing as you asked, even though it went through a big update last night on shut down and today on start up.

<p>I did the troubleshooting option as you suggested - 4 fixes were found. I still have the same winver number and I just checked my update status which informs me that I am up to date. So I hope all is well?</p>

            Got it. I cannot believe I overlooked the 1703 that you included on the title. Anyway, it appears that your system is up-to-date.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#58; USB thumb drives are unusable</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp; a Windows 10 Pro (v.1703) laptop that denies writing of data to usb thumb drives.</p>
<p>I've tried several drives and all behave the same:<br />
<br />
The OS sees the drive and can read data written to it by Windows 7 computers.</p>
<p>The drive can be formatted by Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts to write data to the drive result in this error :<br />
Destination Folder Access Denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM an admin on this computer yet some additional admin rights are required to<br />
write to the USB drive. I am never prompted for credentials.</p>
<p>I can find no tool with which to grant the necessary rights, so rendering all usb<br />
thumb drives incompatible with this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many solutions (RegEdits, etc) to this rather disasterous issue and none have<br />
been effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating indeed.</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>

<br /> 
<br />Are you now or have you ever been using a 3rd party antivirus on this installation of Windows 10 (including any on prior versions if you upgraded to Windows 10 from either 7 or 8.1)?
<br />
<br />Are you now or have you ever been using any form of encryption?
<br />
<br />Have you tried multiple drives on all the USB ports?

<br />Have you tried all of those drives in other Windows 10 computers?
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />--------
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.

</p><p>What Defender change are you referring to ?</p>
<p>I believe I have all current updates in place.</p>

</p><p>The article you refer to is welcome but unsatisfying because there is<br />
no pathway to take ownership of the USB drive. </p>
<p>

    <title>Intel Wireless-AC 7265 not functioning after latest Win 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidkramer5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Wireless-AC 7265 not functioning after latest Win 10 update &#40;</h2>
                    After the most recent 1803 cumulative update, my Intel 7265 Wireless adapter no longer functions. When I look at it in Device Manager &gt; Properties &gt; General the message "Windows is still setting up the class configuration for this device (Code 56). I've
 tried updating the driver (it's version 19.51.12.3) using the Intel utility - no change. I tried rolling back the update but could only roll back from of the cumulative updates. The wireless aadapter does not appear in the list of network adapters (only the
 ethernet adapter shows up). This is a Lenovo X1 Carbon. How could a software update mess up something as fundamentally necessary to operation as the wireless connection? I am pretty sure the hardware is fine, and it wwas working fine prior to the update, so
 I'm blaming the update. Any advice would be welcome.

            Thanks. The description of the problem sounds the same as mine. However, I don't think there was a final resolution to the problem that was reported and Andre from Directly responded to. I have tried updating the driver in the usual ways. When I try to
 update it using the Intel PROSet Wireless Software updater v 20.20.0, using the "Repair" option, it churns for a while, seems to finish OK, but when rerunning the Intel Driver Support Assistant, it appears there was an error in trying to update the driver,
 and the driver version was the same as before. The current driver is 19.51.12.3.&nbsp; The Assistant says the latest driver is 19.51.14.1. It still doesn't work, sadly.

<p>I was having similar problems with Intel AC-7265 installed in my HP Spectre x360. Slow speed and random disconnects, especially after Win 10 updates. I tried a lot of recommended remedies (use an older MSFT driver version, prefer 2.4 G band, limit channel
 to 20 mHz, etc.) and they partially worked.</p>
<p>The radical solution was to REPLACE the AC-7265 adapter with a more recent version, AC-8265 ($25 on Amazon) which is Win 10 certified. No parameter tuning was required, so far so good pulling full 60 to 70 mpbs that my cable account allows. My "recycled"
 AC-7265 adapter was later installed in another notebook and worked fine. So, give this surgical solution a try.</p>

<h2>            Windows locking up and crashing while gaming</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've been having a lot of random crashes lately while gaming. First I just thought it was only Torchlight 2 but I just had the same type of crash occur during League of Legends.<br />
<br />
During all the crashes I'm pretty sure Skype has been running (even if I'm not on a call), so this part is somewhat curious:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99a7634f-d357-4868-8bd1-a5152d2d03cc" /><br />
<br />
So I went back through all my crashes and sure enough, there's Skype Update about 10 mins before each crash. I've since disabled the "Keep Skype Updated" option in hopes that'll resolve the issue but in case it doesn't I figured I should post here. Tried researching
 the issue but the responses and causes were all over the place.<br />
<br />

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm moderately tech savvy so any additional info you need to help me please let me know and I'll get it uploaded ASAP. So far I've already made sure my HD and RAM have no errors and ensured all drivers were up to date
 (they were).<br />

            You need to post the actual dump files to Skydrive so others here can download and analyse them -<br />
The files are found in Windows \ minidumps.&nbsp; If there are no files maybe you aren't set up
<br />
to generate them.<br />
<div>Type -&nbsp; sysdm.cpl &nbsp; in the Start menu search box.<br />
<div>Click the Advanced tab, then Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings.</div>
<div>Under - Write Debugging Information - select Small Memory Dump (256 kB) from the

<br />
(been running stable with my current hardware setup for a while, had a friend test the PSU recently with his tester and it came up fine)<br />
<br />
Only changes I can recall is Skype did an update and it's been running every time a crash has occurred.<br />
<br />
Regarding the bios settings I have my CPU OC'd so those settings are changed but ram and voltages are all set to auto and the system has had 0 crashes until recently (talking over 6mo stable). I just recently started playing TL2 and I've been keeping skype
 open more often because of it and did the latest Skype update too. Those are the only things I can think of that have changed.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean by this: (I believe a Page File is required to create mini-dumps too).<br />
<br />
I did however have to change the debugging info from Kernel memory dump to Small memory dump and the directory was already set to what you specified. I restarted right after and then checked the event viewer and saw a skype update ran again (even though Skype
 is closed) and that latest minidump should contain that info.<br />
<br />
I just moved to the latest Nvidia beta drivers since my last crash. If/When I crash again I'll roll back to the drivers you suggested.<br />
<br />
Again, I really do appreciate your help on this issue, just let me know what info you still need and I'll continue to upload and provide it.<br />

            The Page File is&nbsp; - AKA,&nbsp; Virtual Memory.&nbsp; It is usually enabled automatically by Windows but
<br />
can be found in&nbsp; <i>Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Performance &gt;<br />
Advanced &gt; Virtual Memory</i> . It is normally set to Window Managed.<br />
<br />
- Regardless of past stability you should revert the cpu to default clocks while troubleshooting.<br />
- I would be inclined to uninstall Skype as well. It can't be ruled out otherwise. If it does work out<br />
that the Skype updates are causing problems maybe you can set it up so it does not check for
<br />
updates when you re-install. <br />
Actually, anything that checks for updates automatically can cause games to crash.<br />
<br />
- I only have the basic tool for analysing the dump files, but it says TDR error, which is what I
<br />
thought is sounded like in your earlier posts. TDR don't always cause a BSOD though.<br />
The 310.90 drivers may fix the issue (Avoid BETA, especially when you have problems) but -<br />
<br />
If you don't already know about the dread TDR, it is an error system introduced into Windows
<br />
with Vista and it can create havoc for gamers. My understanding is it was meant to prevent
<br />
premature BSOD. but it can be just as big a problem troubleshooting as BSOD because, while
<br />
the error message always points to the graphics driver, it's often only because the graphics driver is active&nbsp; when something else causes&nbsp; lag in the system. This could be almost anything. Hardware or software.<br />
<br />
As you are getting BSOD the following registry entry may not help, but it's good to create one
<br />
anyway as MS has suggested using a time before the TDR of 8 sec rather than the default Windows<br />
setting of only 2 sec. To create the new registry key -<br />
Open regedit then -<br />
Navigate to -<br />
H_KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ System \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Graphics Drivers.<br />
Right click on the open field and click on New / DWORD (32bit) Value,<br />
Then name it:&nbsp; TdrDelay -&gt; double click it -&gt; Set the value to 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the psu test - Did he verify the stability of the +12V rail under load over a period of say 30 min.<br />
or so ? It does not take much of a drop in voltage (I don't know how small, but not much) to cause a system lag, crash or lock-up when the system is under load.
<br />
- Without wishing to sound alarmist - It's a good thing you have the 730W Raidmax&nbsp; as it provides
<br />
approx 576W on the +12V rails (24 Amps - 288W per rail )&nbsp; which is adequate for the 450W minimum recommended by Nvidia for a GTX660ti. The GTX660ti can draw up to 150W.<br />
However, most quality psu's would provide closer to&nbsp; the 730W listed on the label on the<br />
+12V rails alone.<br />
For example, even the lower end Corsair CX600M has&nbsp; 552W (46 amps) on the +12V rail.<br />
<br />
Good quality psu's are the best (safest) option on gaming machines as gaming stresses the system
<br />
a lot more than a general purpose, or common business machine. <br />
Cheap psu's are cheap because they have low quality capacitors, which when stressed for long periods, such as with gaming, too often burn out or just don't provide consistent power. The cheap capacitors also age faster, lowering the capacity of the psu quicker
 than with a quality unit. The circuit protection<br />
units are also known for either shutting the unit down too early, or too late.<br />
I'm not suggesting you run out and buy a better quality psu.&nbsp; Just that it is something to keep<br />
and eye on.<br />

            Regarding the PSU, I've heard that advice a lot, but honestly I've had nothing but good experiences with Raidmax and they're the longest running PSU's I've ever owned. I had put a 1,000w Roswell PSU in the rig when I first built it in 2007 and it died
 within days of the warranty running out. So I looked at the PSU in my rig that's been goin' strong since '04 and it was a Raidmax, so I got another Raidmax.<br />
<br />
In one of my other rigs I tried a high end Corsair (750w) based on repeated recommendations, since trust me when I say you're not the first person to tell me I need a new PSU. Well I had to RMA that thing in under a year, and I had to RMA the replacement in
 under 3mo, and the current replacement is a few mo in so we'll see how long until and if it craps out again.<br />
<br />
As for all the tests he ran on it, I don't know. I took it too him at work and told him that everyone is saying it's probably my PSU (since as soon as people see the brand it's the first thing they blame) so he took it overnight and brought it back to work
 the next day. When he gave it to me he said it passed all the tests he ran just fine. Turned out it was actually my HD that was dying at the time, which is what I had suspected but everyone said it was the PSU so I figured I'd rule that out before I bought
 a new HD.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This is my next PSU though</a>, mostly because of the 10 year warranty and I've never had issues with EVGA.<br />
<br />
Regarding the BSOD thing, that sounds right on the money, especially since one of the error reports that gets generated (there's a series of about 10, as you saw on my prior image, that get generated all at the same time) is this:<br />

            The registry key looks correct. Page File too.<i><br />
</i>Fingers crossed the 314.22 drivers are stable for you this time around too.<br />
<i><br />
"since trust me when I say you're not the first person to tell me I need a new PSU."</i><br />
- Didn't say that. Just a heads up regarding quality. You would always want to test everything,<br />
and not summarily dismiss anything.<br />
Bad luck with Corsair, eh !<br />
<br />
<i>"So I looked at the PSU in my rig that's been goin' strong since '04 and it was a Raidmax, so I got another Raidmax."</i><br />
- Fair enough.... Considering your Corsair experience especially. <br />
Mine was the opposite with my Corsair HX520 still running strong after five years. I didn't mean to suggest Corsair as the only option either. I do try to avoid fanboy promotions.<br />
Both my current machines have Antec True Power - Another psu that had a&nbsp; rough patch due to
<br />
Antec getting a supply of dud caps some years ago. <br />
Left them&nbsp; with a bad rep for a long time (still a bad rep with those who have not caught up).<br />
- But all the brand names have their dud's, and low end models. They use different mfg's for different<br />
models too. That's why it's nice to see a couple of reviews for specific models.<br />
- My main reason for the warning with Radmax was the Amps on the +12V relative to total Watts,<br />
probability of cheaper components,&nbsp; and I could find no reviews (except customer ).
<br />
<br />
- EVGA&nbsp; certainly have a good rep for their gpu's (never used one myself), so I imagine they would<br />
be selling good psu's as well .<br />
(sweet promo price @ Newegg, what ! Wish we could get those sort of deals here in Oz).
<br />
- Just saw a video and the rep reckons the design is all theirs this time rather than being a re-branded<br />
Antec.&nbsp; I wonder if they will still be using CWT as their mfg ?<br />
<br />

<p>Not every program can be configured to save directly to OneDrive, but many can. For example, all the Microsoft Office programs can be set to save files directly to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a larger sense, an increasing number of programs now save their results directly to the cloud, although not necessarily to OneDrive. An example is my son's Adobe Creative Cloud, which saves directly to his Adobe account online. My PDF editor (FoxitPhantom)
 can also save directly to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to conserve hard drive space, try to work with programs that can save directly to the cloud. But that's only the beginning:</p>
<p>
</p><p>More and more today, you can work with programs directly in the cloud - without installing them on your hard drive. Microsoft's Office Online does that. The online version of Office is not yet as feature complete as the installed version, but it's moving
 in that direction. Of course, Google's office suite, along with everything else made by Google, also works entirely in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cloud computing is the future for all of us. Eventually, Windows itself will move to the cloud, just like ChromeOS is today.</p>

<p>Bonjour Thomas</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have undertaken a quick google search of this, have you ensured that all of the following requirements are met?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Which version of Midnight Club: Los Angeles is available for backward compatible play on Xbox One?</p>
<p>
<strong>Answer</strong>: The disc version of Midnight Club: Los Angeles, the disc version of Midnight Club: Los Angeles - Complete Edition, as well as the digital version of Midnight Club: Los Angeles on Xbox 360 will all enable access to Midnight
 Club: Los Angeles for backward compatible play and include all previously available downloadable content.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It could be that the disc version of the game you have is not the correct one - however, I'm unsure why the digital version would be unavailable in your area.&nbsp; Perhaps reach out to Rockstar and see if they have any restrictions on it being available in France?</p>

    <title>Service Host State Repository constant cpu usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xaocel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Service Host State Repository constant cpu usage</h2>
                    <p>What is it and why does it have to consume 10% of my CPU all the time and how do i disable it?&nbsp; Need a fix ASAP cause my battery life dropped considerably ever since i upgraded to the darn 1803 Windows version... Suggesting clean installs won`t work cause
 i always do that with major updates. The machine is the surface pro 3(i7/512 version) if that`s of any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixes i attempted are going trough all the settings in the settings app and disabling most of the stuff i could disable, reset all the apps and uninstalled the ones i was able to uninstall.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When the service is running there`s a second process called COM surrogate which also uses about 10ish % CPU which makes it 20+% cpu constant usage. Feels like windows is mining crypto on our PCs these days...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: The only working solution i`ve found so far is to end the Windows Explorer process and run apps via task manager instead. Not all that great but it does go easy on the battery so yea still better than nothing.</p>

</p><p>A new thing i noticed is that enabling/disabling bluetooth will trigger both processes but the same happens when i open the settings app so it must be somehow UI related. The thing that bugs me tho is that this occurs randomly as well even when browsing
 the web via let`s say chrome or playing a game with game mode enabled/disabled.</p>

            As I said earlier, the link I found said the problem happened in 1709, and implied they found tips from earlier versions. 
<br />
<br />Keep playing with the problem and try to identify specific triggers.  The first step in trouble shooting is being able to recreate the problem.  The more specifically you can pin the problem down for MS, the more likely they are to work on it!
<br />
<br />You should also submit a bug report feedback to MS about the issue
<br />
<br />.

            Darn, i`ll have to reinstall feedback hub now. But anyways the problem is Windows Explorer related and shutting that off fixes it, which is fine by me :D

    <title>usb device not recognized after resuming from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerryyea  say:</h3>
<h2>            usb device not recognized after resuming from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavillon Series PC and an HP OfficeJet Pro 8500 All-in-one A909g Printer. The pc has Windows 7 Professional SP1 installed. I have been on 6 chats with HP Support Assistant Tech's about this problem and it remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Not every time, but frequently when I leave the PC idle, it goes to sleep (hard drive and monitor) when I return and wake the computer, in the lower&nbsp;right hand corner of the Desktop I see the message "USB device not recognized...etc" All I have to do to
 connect it again is turn off the power and turn it back on and things are fine until the next time. Since HP hasn't been able to fix it in 6 tries, and some were an hour or so long, I thought it may be something in Windows 7. The printer works just fine outside
 of this problem and I can just keep turning it off and on but it would be nice to have it working correctly.</p>
<p>Any and all help appreciated!</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p>I have the same problem with Dell Optiplex 7020 and Elecom-SMI USB flash memory in my company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB-flash drive is not recognized (shown as "unknown hardware") after almost every wake-up from S3-sleep. This happens when connected to intel USB2 controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT! There was a strange thing, some time ago. In USB3 port the drive lost its "removable" property. (i.e. no click for safe removal).</p>
<p>And it was not disappearing from the system during that period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I pulled it out and inserted it into the back-panel port, it became "removable" again and started disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there's probably a correlation between "removable" property and USB drives disappearance from the system after sleep.</p>
<p>Or, probably it only happens with Microsofts USBSTOR.SYS, while Intels iUSB3xxx.sys drivers do not have this
<span><span>disease</span></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried setting "AdditionalCriticalWorkerThreads=2". The system became awfully slow&nbsp; and non-responsive... And the USB drive was not detected on the system's boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 upgraded to Ultimate (upgraded on the top "7" of preinstalled by Dell) with latest updates.</p>

            Thank you for your reply. None of what is suggested in the link works. I have an HDMI cable. I also have a Windows 7 lap top that connects to the TV via the same cable&nbsp;but my HP Envy with Windows 10 doesn't connect. I would like to use the Envy because
 it is more practical.

            <p>PE,</p>
<p>If you connected with your windows 7 machine, you obviously know how to hook them up.&nbsp; If you're plugged in via hdmi on both ends and see nothing on your TV, then press windows key+p and see if it's on "pc screen only".&nbsp; If so, just click duplicate or extend.&nbsp;
 If still nothing, go to settings, system, display, and make sure it can see your&nbsp;TV (shows two displays in the box).&nbsp; If not, you may have a bad hdmi-out plug&nbsp;on your HP.</p>

            <p>I'm afraid none of your suggestions helped. So maybe there is something wrong with the HDMI out socket.</p>

<p>A couple more things to try:&nbsp; first go to settings, system, display, and click "Detect".&nbsp; In the "multiple displays" box the setting "duplicate"&nbsp;should result in showing a&nbsp;single rectangle marked "1|2".&nbsp; If you're set to "extend", then the box should show
 two rectangles, "1" and "2".&nbsp; If you're connected via hdmi and it's still only showing a single rectangle marked "1" (and already made sure your "multiple displays" setting isn't set to "pc screen only"),&nbsp;then go to control panel, Hardware and Sound, Devices
 and Printers, and see if your TV is shown under devices; it may be labeled&nbsp;as "Samsung TV"&nbsp;or may just say "generic PnP".&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Then go back to settings, system, display, Advanced display settings,&nbsp; Display adapter properties, click the "monitor" tab at the
 top, and lower the screen refresh rate down to 59 Hertz or lower.&nbsp; Click "Apply", then go back to display settings and click "Detect" again.&nbsp; If you've dropped your refresh rate, re-detected, and still don't see your TV listed in either settings/display or
 in control panel/devices, then&nbsp;look to see if you have a graphics icon in your notifications area.&nbsp; If you do, right-click it, select properties, and see if there's a "wizard mode" that could guide you through&nbsp;troubleshooting your settings.&nbsp; Lastly, right-click
 your start button and click Device Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;Open any "Display Adapters" or "Monitors" in that list, double click the individual device name, then click the "driver" tab, then click "update driver".&nbsp;If all those fail,&nbsp;&nbsp;then yes, it may just be your socket.&nbsp;
 At the risk of sounding like&nbsp;a complete idiot:&nbsp;"Did you give&nbsp;the plug a&nbsp;wiggle?&nbsp; Sometimes you just have to give it a wiggle."&nbsp; As dumb as that sounds, it's worked for me before...&nbsp; Sorry I couldn't be more diagnostic for you, but hope something in here&nbsp;either
 helps out or at least identifies where the problem is.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;In my devices menu the TV monitor appears as Generic Non PnP. When I plug in the HDMI cable it makes a little dong sound like when you plug stuff in and out of usb sockets which seems to indicate that there must be some sort of
 connection being made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With another laptop using the HDMI cable it is just literally "plug and play". Everything on the laptop screen is duplicated on the TV monitor. Unfortunately with that one which also has Windows 10 I can't watch UK TV abroad which I can on the Envy. All
 rather puzzling, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the HP Envy&nbsp;x2 non of the above &nbsp;happen regardless of all the suggestions you and anyone else on Microsoft support have made. Wiggling the HDMI cable doesn't help either ;-).</p>

<p>It's good&nbsp;that at least your computer knows your TV is there, and it's a settings issue and not a bad plug; software issues are always better than hardware issues. &nbsp;Funny you mentioned that on another laptop using the hdmi is just "plug and play"; Generic
 PnP means "generic plug and play".&nbsp; You said your TV is appearing in devices as Generic Non PnP, so it&nbsp;has been labeled by your computer as&nbsp;"non-plug-and-play" for some reason.&nbsp; How to get rid of that "Non" is the issue; there's something about&nbsp;your TV's&nbsp;resolution,
 refresh rate, or driver that your laptop is at odds with.&nbsp; I'll dig around a bit when I get a moment, and if I find anything useful I'll post back.</p>

<p>It seems that one of three solutions has remedied this problem for most people: Turning everything off and turning everything back on again, replacing a faulty HDMI cable with a good one, or replacing the display driver.&nbsp; Since you don't seem to be a simpleton,
 I'm going to rule out the first two, which leaves the display driver as the main suspect.&nbsp; You said you updated the display driver from the device manager with no results, but maybe performing a "download-and-replace"&nbsp;from&nbsp;HP will&nbsp;help where Windows didn't;
 it definitely won't hurt.&nbsp; You mentioned it was an&nbsp;HP Envy x2; turns out there are 121 different versions of that model, so here's a link to the list.&nbsp; Find your build model, click it, and first I'd run the driver checker (orange box, "check now") and if that
 fails you, open the driver-graphics-intel section and download&nbsp;the new driver&nbsp;straight from there (this link is all Windows 10-specific drivers).&nbsp; If it's a .zip file, extract it and then head back to Device Manager, Display Adapters, intel device name, right-click
 and "update driver software" again and let it find and install the new driver you downloaded.&nbsp; I do hope that method works for you.&nbsp; If not, then your laptop and TV hate each other and should be relegated to separate corners of the room.</p>
