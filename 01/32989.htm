    <title>Kinect Adapter for Xbox One S - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Kinect Adapter for Xbox One S</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there,<br />
<br />
I was looking into the Xbox One S and saw that EB games are offering them at discounted prices by trading in your original xbox one.<br />
<br />
I also saw that you can apply for getting the Kinect Adapter free. However that is provided that you can give the serial number for 1. The Kinect, 2. The xbox one s console, and 3. The
<strong>Original </strong>console.<br />
<br />
I'm just inquiring how will that work if I trade in the original yet I need all three at once to apply for the adapter?<br />
<br />
It's partly the reason why I'm holding out on buying it. Thoughts?</p>

    <title>Original Windows 10 Anniversary Update deleted my camera software&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimberlyhawkshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Original Windows 10 Anniversary Update deleted my camera software&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I seriously need some help. I have been trying on my own to correct this problem since I got the original windows 10 anniversary update! Before this update, Windows HELLO and my camera software worked perfectly. Now, I have no freaking camera at all! WTF
 MS? I KNOW this is a serious and widespread problem, as I am not even the hundredth person to complain about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a very SIMPLE solution to this "glitch"... INCLUDE THE DARN SOFTWARE IN AN UPDATE OR ALLOW IT TO BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE WEBSITE! Basically, let me give you the same advice you give users first, "Did you try rebooting?". This is what you always want
 us to do because it is the easiest way to get out of doing your job. We are not idiots and you get paid enough to "THINK", which means finding the easiest and fastest solution for this plague of a problem. ALLOW THE SOFTWARE TO BE DIRECTLY DOWNLOADED AND GIVE
 USERS THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR COMPUTERS AS THEY WERE PURCHASED AND PAID FOR! GIVE US THE SOFTWARE! I am a disabled woman that bought this computer for functions like the HELLO program, the CAMERA function, and other programs that depend on the use of the
 CAMERA that your buggy update ERASED on probably a million other computers besides mine! YOUR MISTAKE. FIX IT ALREADY!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />If its an external web cam and you have it plugged into a USB Hub, that will not work. You need to plug your web cam directly into the USB port on your system unit. USB hubs are not necessarily powerful enough to power devices like web cams. 
<br />
<br />Option 1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or right-click empty space on the toolbar.
<br />Open “Task Manager” and go to the “Processes” tab.
<br />Carefully analyze what programs are currently running in the background of the system.
<br />If you found an app that uses Camera, for example, Skype running in the background, click it, and select “End Task.”
<br />
<br />Option 2. Try a Clean Boot
<br />Click “Windows key” and type msconfig.
<br />Click “System Configuration” and open “Services” tab.
<br />Mark “Hide all Microsoft services” box and select “Disable all.”
<br />Open “Startup” tab and click “Open Task Manager.”
<br />Click on each startup item and select “Disable.”
<br />Close Task Manager and click “OK” on the System Configuration window.
<br />Reboot the system.
<br />
<br />If Clean Boot helped to fix error, we would recommend you to enable apps one by one. After each enabled app, check if the Camera is working. This way, you will isolate the problematic application. 
<br />
<br />As for Windows Hello:
<br />
<br />1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

            <p><span>Hi Bailey,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Some computers have a touchpad disable and enable hot key, refer to the laptop manual and check if it is turned off if so enable it and check.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Turn off the computer (when the touchpad does not respond, hold the power button down for up to 15 seconds to turn off the computer).</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Unplug everything except the power cord, including the following:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>•Speakers<br />
•Printers<br />
•Scanners<br />
•USB devices<br />
•Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)<br />
•USB flash drive or other external storage devices<br />
•External Monitor<br />
•External Keyboard<br />
•External Mouse<br />
•If your computer is attached to a docking station, undock it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Make sure the touchpad or your finger has no dirt, grease, liquids or food on it (the touchpad has to make a good contact with your finger to work correctly).</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. </span></span></span><span>Turn the computer back on and retest the touchpad.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6. </span></span></span><span>Make sure the latest driver for the touchpad is installed (you may need to use an external USB or Bluetooth mouse),</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, this might be an issue due to outdated or corrupted touchpad drivers on the computer. I suggest you to update the drivers from the Device Manager and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to update the driver.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>“Windows Key + X”</strong> together and select
<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Expand <strong>Mice and other pointing devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Right click on <strong>Synaptic touchpad driver</strong> and select
<strong>Update Driver Software.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try installing the latest drivers from the manufacturing website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            If you go into <strong>Settings</strong>, &nbsp;<strong>Music On This PC</strong> section, &amp; select
<strong>Choose </strong><strong>Where We Look For Music</strong>, You will see that the default path is the
<strong>Music</strong> Folder. &nbsp;I also had the same problem &amp; had 15,842 song files attached to Groove. &nbsp;My work-around was to create a folder - anywhere you want, &amp; designate a path to this folder. &nbsp;Then delete the path to
<strong>Music</strong>. &nbsp;I place only the music I want to appear on the Groove Player into this folder. &nbsp;I still haven't found a decent way to create a Playlist, though. &nbsp;There is NO drag &amp; Drop capability &amp; I end up having to add one Album at a time instead
 of being able to just add a folder with many song files. &nbsp;Thus another reason to revert to the folder I created with a path designated from Groove Player. &nbsp;This way I can see all my designated songs in a Song list rather than an Album list.

            <p>Sorry - but your reply did confuse me:</p>
<p>I do not have a link under the Settings to "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Music on my PC</span>" nor do I have "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Choose where we look for Music</span>".</p>
<p>
However I opened Groove Music and under the settings on their I located the Folders.
</p><p>I will deal with the deletions later ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You appear not to have read the problem that Groove Music has created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>denied me access</strong></span> to "My Music" which contains all my music albums in the Folder within "My Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has created <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">its own "Music</span>" Folder and downloaded all "My Music" to that Folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has also denied me access to "My Pictures" and "My Videos" alls 3 show an "arrow" link which I can only assume takes them to newly created Folders in my main Drive created by W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For as many years as I can recall I have accessed these three files via "My Documents" - now they are denied my accessing them?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In that case it sounds like you have an issue with the PC not the Grove app.</p>
<p>I have tried to reproduce the issue that you have however&nbsp;I was not able to get that error message.</p>
<p>The only possible&nbsp;issue is if the main account on the PC is not yours, the PC is&nbsp;a company PC&nbsp;or&nbsp;restricted PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advice to contact the&nbsp;Windows 10 Support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you confirm that you can't access the&nbsp;standart folder from the file explorer. if that is the case I will move the Forum entry to the correct Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind&nbsp;Regards,</p>
<p>Vasile M.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Vasile M</span></p>
<p><span>It was quite simple:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I placed a CD in the PC</span></li><li><span>Groove auto loaded it to play</span></li><li><span>At the same time I noted that Grove was downloading all my music files from “My Music” from the Documents Folder in Explorer to a new Folder “Music” under my PC (Bill PC)</span></li></ol>
<span>
</span>
<div>
<p><span>The same thing occurred with “My Photos” – a new Folder has appeared under “My PC (Bill PC) “Photos” which has downloaded all my photos from my own folder.</span></p>
<p><span>Also with “My Videos”</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I now have two sets of Photos and Music in two different areas of my PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is obviously s flaw in Windows 10 as it appears W10 Operating Systems that utilise Pictures &amp; Music -
</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>“Windows Photo Viewer and Groove</span></span></strong><span>” are set to be default and then take control of existing files. wish to take on board
 any folders and contents which exist.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Defaults should be selected by the user not by W10 at download stage.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have created a second Folder for My Music with My Documents as that is where I have always had them – the original Folder remains “no access”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Location is not available</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>C/Users/Documents/My Music is not accessible (also applies to My Documents - My Videos - My Pictures)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Access is denied</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I seriously look forward to getting an answer on this.</span></p>

            <p>I'm sorry but I'm having the very same problem and I don't believe it's my PC. I did not request Groove to hijack my music. Windows 10 called themselves performing updates and removed relevant apps where my music was stored and the "support" needed was also
 removed, therefore, I cannot replace my music where it was previously. I feel I made a huge mistake changing to Windows 10. My PC has never failed me nor has the Apps until now. PC problem, I don't think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to download the music app I had and depended on. Can anyone help me to get my reliable apps back?</p>
<p>

            There may be a simple solution to the problem, which lies with the video driver. Mine was not updated and had been replaced with a generic driver.
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Windows 8.1 has a default setting that prevents it from downloading updates to drivers over a "metered connection." This is nice feature for those who are connecting to the internet with a device that uses a metered connection, of course, but it prevents
 Windows from updating drivers properly.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Changing the setting from Off to On did the trick and the drivers updated automatically and quickly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To find this setting you need to go to Settings -- Change PC Settings -- PC and Devices -- Devices. You may see notices after the devices indicating that they have not been updated. Scroll down a bit and find the Download Over Metered Connection item and
 change the setting to ON.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to, you can then change the setting back to Off.</div>

<h2>            Synaptics Touchpad 3 Fingers Gesture not working in Windows 10 with Lenovo Ideapad Y700</h2>
                    <p>My Y700 has the a synaptics touchpad with the lastest driver version. My 3 fingers gesture works when I start up my laptop. However, if I put my PC to sleep, the 3 fingers gesture will behave strangely. It will go go back to previous page on my Chrome when
 I swipe to the left with 3 fingers and go forward when I swipe to the right. Other gestures such as 3 fingers tap to open cortana and 4 fingers tap to open action center work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this? Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello Jian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that 3 Fingers Gesture not working with your&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;laptop. We'll certainly assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates. I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to completely uninstall the touchpad driver and reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press “Windows key + X” and click on “Device Manager”.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the list of devices, you should see the touchpad drivers.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the device and then select "Uninstall".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<strong>Scan for Hardware changes”
</strong>option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Further, if there no updated drivers available on the computer manufacturer’s website, then download the latest drivers and try installing it in Windows 8 compatibility mode.
</span><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps, let us know the status of the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            DLC for two accounts on same xbox question</h2>
                    

<p>Ok, so when the 360 first came out i got oblivion and downloaded all the DLC and them my xbox broke so i got sent a new one.</p>
<p>When the new one came i found out that i could only play the DLC when i was connected to xbox live so i rang them up and they made me make a new account up (lewys87) and gave me the points on that account so i could download it again because it needed to
 be on a new gamertag (This was before all the transferring licence thing)</p>
<p>So i have a new xbox again and want to play oblivion on this gamertag so i recovered the lewys87 tag and downloaded the DLC again then signed into this account but when i &nbsp;load up oblivion the DLC isn't there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what do i have to do? just transfer a licence? or can it only be played on my lewys87 account?</p>

    <title>Rebuilding Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickherrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rebuilding Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>My computer is running very slow and my internet speed is very slow. So I contacted my internet provider and they checked my internet speed at their modem. They found when they use their own laptops, they receive the correct speed, 55-57 MBPS. But, my computer
 only shows 15-20 MPBS. The techs said my computer was at fault and that it probably needed to be "rebuilt". My computer is a HP and was bought in 2009. It has Window 7 operating system.
</p>
<p>I am not a computer wizard but they suggested rebuilding it. They said over the years my computer gets info built up in it, and the updates are probably a big cause of the problem.
</p>
<p>But, I don't have the Windows 7 CD-ROM. The computer had Windows 7 already installed in it when I purchased it. If I understood them correctly, they said to do a recovery media creation procedure, using the recovery manager. That procedure will evidently
 use 4 DVD-R, to I assume, gather all the info needed in my Windows 7 operating system.
</p>
<p>My questions are: is the recovery media creation procedure (evidently using 4 DVD-R) the way to create the necessary data recovery being I don't have the Windows 7 CD-ROM? Is that it's purpose? Also, is this in deed the correct procedure to retain my computers
 original efficiency? Is "rebuilding" the correct procedure?&nbsp; Being I'm not a computer expert, can someone explain the correct steps, in detail, to do that procedure? I would appreciate someones help. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I can help you and will try my best.&nbsp; I am a senior technology guy who supports 150 Windows 7 client computers and I do this work every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that your wireless speed on the Internet is at 15 to 20 is <strong>not
</strong>an indication of a problem in your computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume from what you are saying, that your internet service provider is telling you that you should be getting 55 to 57.&nbsp; That is a WIRED connection speed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get yourself an Ethernet cable and go to your modem and connect your Ethernet cable between your computer and your modem.&nbsp; If you are using a separate wireless router, connect to the router not the modem.&nbsp; Then run a speed test.&nbsp; Most commonly used on is
<a href="http://www.speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.speedtest.net</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your Internet service provider recommends a different one, use that.&nbsp; This will tell you if your slow internet is the result of your computer or your wireless network.&nbsp; I can tell you from a great
 deal of experience, chances are it is your wireless network and not your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, if your computer was born in 2009 and has never had a new hard drive or has been rebuilt, I would recommend a rebuild.&nbsp; I will provide you with a step by step to do this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do anything about a rebuild, first make certain your hard drive is in good shape.&nbsp; If you will tell me the model number of your hard drive, I will provide you with a link to the software you should download and run to test the HARDWARE of your
 hard drive.&nbsp; Frankly at the age of almost 8 years, I would be hesitant to go through all the work of rebuilding on your current hard drive and would seriously consider replacing it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we go too much further, would you please provide me the following information.</p>

            <p>Hello rickherrick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Recovery Media creation procedure needs to be done in order to be able to reinstall (rebuild) the Windows 7 operating system, like it was, when you got the laptop back in 2009. Think about factory restore. Your system will be brought back to the initial
 state and all installed applications after that state might disappear because of the fact, that they were not included in the system's initial (factory) state.</p>

            <p>Hi CT, thank you for your reply. I have only wired connection, not wireless from my modem. The provider test was done from between the modem (Ethernet cable) and my computer with a laptop from the provider. That laptop showed the good speed consistently
 (using the Ethernet cable connection) while my computer showed the poor wired speed using the same connection. Not sure, but I hope that resolves that possible question, CT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try and answer your questions you submitted. Bear in mind, I am certainly not a computer expert by any means but will try and answer your question nonetheless.

            <p>A&nbsp;re-build is called for.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing, make absolutely certain you have all your data backed up on a reliable external hard drive.&nbsp; I recommend two forms of backup:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple copy of all your data can be done by copying your data to the external drive.&nbsp; Most all if not all your data will be in c:\users\<em>yourname</em>\.&nbsp; There you will find Documents, Pictures, etc.&nbsp; Simply right-click and hold on the folder you want
 to copy and drag it to a window opened for the external hard drive and let go, choose Copy.&nbsp; Make sure you include all your data.&nbsp; It may not all be in the place I just named.&nbsp; I will provide you with a detailed procedure for this if you wish to proceed.</li><li>The second is to use Windows Easy Transfer.&nbsp; A nice program that is built into Windows 7.&nbsp; You get it by clicking the start globe (bottom left) and typing
<strong>easy </strong>into the text box then click on Windows Easy Transfer.&nbsp; That will start the program.&nbsp; It makes one very large file to be made on your
<strong>external </strong>drive.&nbsp; The file contains all the data it thinks is data and all your settings (you have many of them).&nbsp; Windows Easy Transfer works 98% of the time and when it does is almost magical they way it works out.</li><li>Keep in mind that programs cannot be backed up.&nbsp; They must be re-installed once the system has been re-built.</li></ul>
<p>If you decide to do this, I will give you a detailed step by step to do the re-installation.&nbsp; It is not complex or very technical.&nbsp; Just requires attention to detail and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second thing, make the DVD recovery set, but absolutely do NOT use DVD -R's.&nbsp; Only use DVD+Rs for this purpose. +Rs are much more reliable and precise.&nbsp; Atanas advice on this recovery set&nbsp;is good to follow, except use +Rs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your choice of security software is <strong>not </strong>a good one, but I can make recommendations on that later.&nbsp; You should download and run this malware scanner to remove any that is resident.&nbsp; ADWcleaner:
<a href="https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you are certain your DVD recovery set is completed properly and your data is backed up, I would then do the re-build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, if this is the original equipment hard drive, if it were my computer, I would spend the $60 or so that it will cost to buy a replacement.&nbsp; Make sure that new drive is a 7200 rpm drive, not a 5400.&nbsp; A 500 gigabyte one will do you just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you do want to test your old drive, I will provide you with the link for the drive tester software, only the information you gave me is about your video component, not the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To get the disk drive model number and check temperatures:</strong></p>
<p>Download and run Speccy.&nbsp; Speccy is a no-cost little utility that is very nice.&nbsp; It will give you a lot of information.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a> </p>
<p>When that starts up, it will take a few moments to gather the data.&nbsp; It will show you internal temperatures to determine if you are running too hot which could suggest a fan needing to be&nbsp;replaced.&nbsp; Click on the hard drive item and you will see the model
 number of the drive.&nbsp; Go back to the Summary, the click on the operating system.&nbsp; There you will find the 25 character Microsoft Product Key used to activate your copy of Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hi CT, thank you for your detailed reply, detail is good! But, being I am not very computer savvy, I'm not sure I'm up to the task of the various procedures? But, I am sort of adventurous and that can be good or bad! I might get myself into irrevocable trouble?
 Having said that lets start with your first paragraph, CT.</p>
<p>First thing, make absolutely certain you have all your data backed up on a reliable external hard drive.&nbsp; I recommend two forms of backup:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple copy of all your data can be done by copying your data to the external drive.&nbsp; Most all if not all your data will be in c:\users\<em>yourname</em>\.&nbsp; There you will find Documents, Pictures, etc.&nbsp; Simply right-click and hold on the folder you want

<p>I sort of thought just installing a disc in my computer for a back-up would suffice. That is exactly what I was doing when Windows said I needed a back-up. I can see it is more involved then that. Why don't you supply me with your instructions that you mentioned,
 " I will provide you with a detailed procedure for this if you wish to proceed." and I will see if I'm up to it, CT?
</p>
<p>Your second option, Windows easy transfer might be more better suited for me? Not sure, CT.
</p>
<p>You made the comment "Keep in mind that programs cannot be backed up.&nbsp; They must be re-installed once the system has been re-built."</p>
<p>That got me confused. Being, I have many programs installed on my system. When I access Window control panel, installed programs, I see many programs installed on my system. How do I efficiently reinstall all those programs? It seems like a daunting task?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will make sure I purchase DVD+R disk's, not DVD-R.</p>
<p>You made the comment, "As I said before, if this is the original equipment hard drive, if it were my computer, I would spend the $60 or so that it will cost to buy a replacement.&nbsp; Make sure that new drive is a 7200 rpm drive, not a 5400.&nbsp; A 500 gigabyte
 one will do you just fine."</p>
<p>How do I purchase such a device, CT? And, if I were to purchase a new hard drive, how would that change what I'm about to do, CT? Can you please explain?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did download and run Speccy, and I could see the various specifications. But, I really didn't see any spec's as to what is actually good spec's. The temps I could see, but it didn't show what is desirable. Nonetheless, it was interesting info. I did see
 the 25 character Microsoft Product Key used to activate your copy of Windows 7. What can I do with that, CT? I don't see a icon to access Speccy when I want to look at something though? Now that is loaded to my system, how do I access it?
</p>
<p>Hopefully you can be patient and understanding with my lack of computer knowledge, CT and we can work through this. Again, thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Let's break down your response:</p>
<p><em>First thing, make absolutely certain you have all your data backed up on a reliable external hard drive.&nbsp; I recommend two forms of backup:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A simple copy of all your data can be done by copying your data to the external drive.&nbsp; Most all if not all your data will be in c:\users\yourname\.&nbsp; There you will find Documents, Pictures, etc.&nbsp; Simply right-click and hold on the folder you want to

<p><em>I sort of thought just installing a disc in my computer for a back-up would suffice. That is exactly what I was doing when Windows said I needed a back-up. I can see it is more involved then that. Why don't you supply me with your instructions that you

</em></p>
<p><em>Your second option, Windows easy transfer might be more better suited for me? Not sure, CT.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend two forms of backup to be conservative. Both backup on an external drive AND Windows Easy Transfer on an external drive.</p>
<p>Backup on a drive internally mounted in the computer is poor practice.&nbsp; Buy a good quality external hard drive the connects via USB.&nbsp; Choose one of the big ones that is based on a full sized hard drive.&nbsp; They are much more reliable and last forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
 will include full instructions on how to do a backup at the end of this response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You made the comment "Keep in mind that programs cannot be backed up.&nbsp; They must be re-installed once the system has been re-built."</em></p>
<p><em>That got me confused. Being, I have many programs installed on my system. When I access Window control panel, installed programs, I see many programs installed on my system. How do I efficiently reinstall all those programs? It seems like a daunting
 task?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes diligence and patience, but you will need to re-install.&nbsp; This is no different than if you bought a new computer.&nbsp; Much of it is available online and mostly at no cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You made the comment, "As I said before, if this is the original equipment hard drive, if it were my computer, I would spend the $60 or so that it will cost to buy a replacement.&nbsp; Make sure that new drive is a 7200 rpm drive, not a 5400.&nbsp; A 500 gigabyte
 one will do you just fine."</em></p>
<p><em>How do I purchase such a device, CT? And, if I were to purchase a new hard drive, how would that change what I'm about to do, CT? Can you please explain?&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>One source would be Amazon.com.&nbsp; Go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com</a>&nbsp; type this into the search
<strong>7200 rpm 3.5 inch hard drive 500 gigabytes</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; and you will see there are lots of them for under $50.&nbsp; A brand new hard drive will assure you a longer life for your computer.&nbsp; The 7200rpm speed will result in noticeable performance improvement.&nbsp;
 You are about to invest a lot of time and it seems prudent to make it worthwhile for a longer life of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I did download and run Speccy, and I could see the various specifications. But, I really didn't see any spec's as to what is actually good spec's. The temps I could see, but it didn't show what is desirable. Nonetheless, it was interesting info. I did
 see the 25 character Microsoft Product Key used to activate your copy of Windows 7. What can I do with that, CT? I don't see a icon to access Speccy when I want to look at something though? Now that is loaded to my system, how do I access it?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has a very useful feature.&nbsp; When you click just once on the start globe at the bottom left, a text box will pop up.&nbsp; It is an over-arching search system for your entire computer.&nbsp; In this case if you just type speccy in that box, you will see a
 link pop up to the program.&nbsp; Simply click on that popup and Speccy will be right there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What temperature(s) did you see when you display Speccy?</p>
<p>Your Microsoft Product key is your serial number. The licence you bought and paid for.&nbsp; If you ever need to re-install from scratch, you must have that or you cannot re-install it.&nbsp; It is a valuable piece of information.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Hopefully you can be patient and understanding with my lack of computer knowledge, CT and we can work through this. Again, thank you for your help.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Rick, I am a patient man.&nbsp; I help a lot of people just like you a lot and I enjoy doing that.&nbsp; I am delighted to help you.&nbsp; Think of it this way.&nbsp; If you do
<em><strong>not </strong></em>do this work on your computer, you have two choices:&nbsp; Buy a replacement which will obviously cost a lot, or pay someone to do this for you, which could add up to a cost not too much less than buying a new one.&nbsp; So, in worst case,
 you will have spent a lot of time, learned a lot, and ended up with a pile of unusable hardware, resulting in your buying a new replacement.&nbsp; The payoff is the extension of the life of your current computer by several years at a pretty low cost, provided you
 are patient, a bit adventurous and determined.&nbsp; You will be spending $60 or so for a hard drive which in worst case you would not need, and the cost of a backup drive, which you should have under any circumstances anyway.</p>

            Hi CT, thank you for your reply. For your comment:<br />
<p>"What temperature(s) did you see when you display Speccy?</p>
<p>I see, motherboard-35C</p>
<p>graphics-51C</p>
<p>storage-29C</p>
<p>"Your Microsoft Product key is your serial number. The licence you bought and paid for.&nbsp; If you ever need to re-install from scratch, you must have that or you cannot re-install it.&nbsp; It is a valuable piece of information."</p>
<p>So, I should carefully record that important serial number. But, once I record it from the Speccy data sheet in the operating system link, what do I do with it then? How do I in-cooperate that info when rebuilding, CT? Or, it that spec or data already acknowledged
 when I go through the process some how? </p>
<p>It would be an understatement to say I appreciate your help and patience, CT. But, knowing my computer skills and knowledge, I'm just not sure if I should tackle this on my own? Having said that, if I do go to a service that provides such a service to rebuild
 my computer, I will need to do a back-up regardless, and it seems whether I go that route or not, getting a back-up is the first step. Can you walk me through that, CT?</p>
<p>Bear in mind because of my computer skills, I may ask stupid questions, but be understanding please.
</p>
<p>First question I have is: after buying the DVD+R disc's, I would have been assuming these are the devices to be used for my back-up. But you are saying I need to use a external hard drive, not the DVD's for my back-up data? If that is the case, why would
 I be purchasing those DVD's and doing the system recovery procedure with those disc's? Are you suggesting forget about that procedure?
</p>
<p>Secondly, if I do purchase a external hard drive, how do I connect it to my computer so I can and begin the back-up process? You seem to be suggesting I can use a USB port at the back of my computer? Being I don't know what a hard drive looks like, the device
 must have storage able qualities? </p>
<p>Again, I certainly appreciate your help, CT. But, I also don't want to waste your valuable time either. Frankly your help and understanding is better than most on these help forums. CT, and that is appreciated. I just don't want to waste that on me if after
 all is said and done, I go the professional service route. Let me see how I want to go about this. If I do decide to go to a professional service, for the rebuild, what suggestions do you have if I go that route, CT? Again, thank you for your help and understanding.
</p>
<p>

            <p>I am delighted to help.&nbsp; Even if you end up having this done for you, you will be a far wiser customer and buyer of the service which is a good thing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temperatures are fine.&nbsp; That tells me you do not have an over-heating problem.&nbsp; Fans must be working OK.&nbsp; That is important because the worst enemy to all electronic stuff is heat.&nbsp; High temps would tell me there are other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Write down that Microsoft Product key and keep it in a safe place in case you need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process you are likely to be doing is a Factory Restore.&nbsp; A Factory restore restores the hard drive to exactly, precisely what it was when you turned it on for the very first time.&nbsp; If you were not going to use the same old hard drive you would not need
 the set of DVDs that you will make to do this.&nbsp; If the Factory restore works as expected, you will not need the Microsoft Product Key.&nbsp; However, if for some reason the Factory Restore did not work properly, you would have to re-install Windows from start and
 then you would need the Product Key.&nbsp; And, by the way, in that case you would need to find someone who has a Windows 7 install disk to loan to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the DVD's for the Factory Restore are <strong>not </strong>for backup.&nbsp; They are a means to copy the actual copy of what was on your computer when it left the factory to an external place, so that you can use them to restore your hard drive to that condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correct you need to do a back up in any case.&nbsp; The Windows Easy Transfer is not really a backup.&nbsp; It is a method of returning all of your data all at once in just one program.&nbsp; When it works, which is almost always, it works extremely well.&nbsp; However, if
 there were a problem, you would need your backup.&nbsp; Anyway, you should be periodically backing up your valuable information on some regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An external hard drive is connected to your computer using a USB cable that connects to the external hard drive on one end and to any available USB port on your computer.&nbsp; In all most all cases, when you power up your new external hard drive and plug it
 in for the first time, Windows will recognize that and will automatically install all the software it needs to be able to "talk" to that external hard drive. It only does that the first time it "sees" it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will now give you some advice on what to buy in an external hard drive, followed by advice on how to do a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Backup hardware</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep in mind you should backup only your <strong>data</strong>. In most cases, you can get a pretty good estimate of the capacity you need to back up by&nbsp;opening the&nbsp;Computer window&nbsp;then on the C: drive, then to Users folder, and then to your own account
 – you probably will find your name listed. Now add up the sizes of your Documents, Pictures, Music and Video folders.&nbsp; Right-click on each and choose Properties to find the size.</li><li>If you need more capacity, then you need an <strong>external hard drive</strong>. These things come in all sorts of sizes and capacities and prices. Most of them are not well designed. Most of them will over-heat and cook your data if you leave them running
 for more than about 2 hours.&nbsp;Buy something that&nbsp;has much larger capacity&nbsp;than what you need because over time, your needs will grow. An external hard drive is really just a housing that contains the electronics that interface between your computer and the
 hard drive inside the housing. The hard drive inside is really an ordinary hard drive like in your notebook computer (2.5″)&nbsp;or the larger one (3.5″)&nbsp;in a desktop computer. The larger one will last longer. You can get the best of all worlds by buying the housing
 and hard drive separately and assembling them. It is so easy to do.</li><li><strong>Hard drives come in two sizes: </strong>2 1/2″ and 3 1/2″. Notebooks have a 2 1/2.” Desktop computers have the larger ones. The 3 ½” ones are actually about 20 times bigger and heavier, but are much longer living and reliable.</li><li><strong>7200 rpm drives</strong>.&nbsp; Most drives run at 5400 rpm.&nbsp; That is because they are quieter.&nbsp; They also run 1/3 faster and that’s a big bonus. When you buy your own two components and assemble them, you can select a faster drive.</li><li><strong>Solid State Drives (SSD) or thumb drives.&nbsp;</strong> Do not even consider this for a backup.&nbsp; SSDs wear out on each write.</li><li><strong>Hard drives have two threats: </strong>Heat and vibration or shock. The 2 1/2″ such as in your notebook computer is much more delicate and is also much more likely to be shocked with a bump, a drop or vibration. If the housing is
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>well ventilated and designed to dissipate heat, it can over-heat and destroy the drive.</li><li>Virtually all external drives use the USB connection to communicate. <strong>
USB comes in 3 versions</strong> — 1.1, 2, and 3. Your computer is very likely capable of version 2 and will communicate with a 1.1 device if needs be. Version 2 is 10 times faster than 1.1. Version 3 is&nbsp;up to 5&nbsp;times faster than 2.&nbsp; Most external hard drives
 today have USB 3, but be careful to be sure the one you buy has it.&nbsp; Hopefully, an external drive you would buy today would last longer than your current computer and maybe the one after that. It would be a good bet to invest in one that was capable of Version
 3 USB to take advantage of that when you have a computer that is USB Version 3 capable.&nbsp; You will need a USB 3 cable to connect your USB 3 external drive to a USB 3 port on your computer.&nbsp; The cable is different from the USB 2 or 1.1 one. Your new USB version
 3 external drive will work on your Version 2 ports on your current computer.</li><li><strong>Drive connectors/adapters</strong>.&nbsp; Make certain the drive you buy comes with the adapters or cables you will need to connect your particular backup drive with your particular computer(s).</li><li><strong>Size is a big question: </strong>A few years ago a 40 gigabyte hard drive was on the edge of bigness. Most notebook computers you would buy today come with 500 and most desktops 500 or more. In the after-market where you buy hard drives, 1000 or
 2000 gigabyte drives are pretty common. By the way, we call them 1TB or Terabyte. One terabyte is equivalent to 1000 gigabytes. One gigabyte is equivalent to 1000 megabytes.&nbsp; Drives have an interesting price curve. Price and size are not on a 45 degree line.
 Today, you can buy a 2 TB drive for $85 on sale. A 0.5TB is $50. So, buying really big is actually much cheaper in terms of dollars per gigabyte than buying smaller.</li></ol>

<em><strong>Backing up</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>You should NOT backup your programs. Keep the disks that have the software you bought along with the “product keys” or activation keys. There are also a number of programs that are free and downloaded from the Internet that do not need to be backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 and Vista, you will find a folder named <em><strong>Users (C:Users)</strong></em>.&nbsp; In that folder you will find each user that is set up on the computer.&nbsp; In the user folder you will find Folders for documents, music, pictures and videos, and
 others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy your data on to an external hard drive.&nbsp; Without a doubt a USB connected external storage drive is the best way.&nbsp; It’s best to back up on a routine basis, for example monthly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT recommend those pre-packaged external drives.&nbsp; Very few of them are capable of sufficient cooling or shock cushioning.&nbsp; Buy an excellent external drive housing for around $40.&nbsp; Then buy an internal hard drive and install it in the housing.&nbsp; It is
 so simple it will amaze you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly recommend the large heavy drives.&nbsp; They are the 3.5″ ones and are about 20 times the size of the 2.5″ ones.&nbsp; They are also far more durable and will likely last far longer than your current computer and more.&nbsp; The most important thing is that
 it will be reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend backup programs&nbsp;— even the one built into Windows.&nbsp; These programs were originally designed to save backup space.&nbsp;They&nbsp;usually produce files that are only usable by the program that created them and the space they save
 is not expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second benefit they have is to pre-program what is backed up, and in Windows 7, that is no longer a problem because it is all in your User folder, with minor exceptions such as Quick Books and Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making copies of all data files will allow you to replace a single damaged or lost file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, very high capacity external hard drives are available very cheaply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Although it is technically possible to backup to a memory stick (AKA thumb drive), it is a bad practice.&nbsp;
</span>Memory sticks are not that reliable, they are good for smaller files being moved.&nbsp; The memory technology inside has a limited capability of writes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I strongly recommend an external USB connect hard drive.&nbsp; They can be bought for $40 to $150 with vastly more space — like 500 to 2000Gb.&nbsp; They are dramatically faster — like 20 times.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend so-called “cloud” backups.&nbsp; When you do this, you are storing a copy of your data in someone else’s computer that may some day be hacked or just shut down.&nbsp; It is of little value since you can buy your own capacity cheaply.&nbsp;
 Then you know where it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In many years of doing this work, I have lost count of the number of clients whose backups did not restore because of problems with the way the backup
 software stored the data.&nbsp; Some of these systems backup what was changed.&nbsp; The result of that is that you have many individual files that must be logically reassembled to do a restore from this backup.&nbsp; If just one of these files is faulty, the entire restore
 is impossible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Backup software had its birth when space was very expensive and the software “compressed” the data to take less space.&nbsp; Today, that is certainly not an issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend a simple process of drag and drop.&nbsp; Connect the external drive.&nbsp; Make a folder on it with your name and today’s date.&nbsp; Open that folder as a window, not full screen.&nbsp; Slide that window to one side.&nbsp; Open&nbsp;your
 C: drive in another window side-by-side.&nbsp; Find the folders/files you want to backup and simply drag and drop to the backup.&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp;
<strong>Use the RIGHT button to do the dragging </strong>(opposite if you mouse is set up for a left-hander).&nbsp; That way, when you drop it, it will ASK you if you want to copy, move or cancel.&nbsp; Of course, this method takes away the automatic scheduling convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 But, I have never seen this kind of backup fail anyone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another hint, this is a Windows-wide feature – you can choose a number of folders at one time.&nbsp; If your list is contiguous, select the fist in the group, hold down the Shift key, select the last in the group.&nbsp; If your list is non-contiguous, select the first,
 hold down the Ctrl key, select each and every other folder.&nbsp; Then you can drag and drop a whole group at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backing up your favorites in Internet Explorer</strong>: Open Internet Explorer. Click File, Import and Export, Next. Choose Export Favorites. Click Next then Next. Browse to the same Backup folder. Give the file that you are about to export a name
 like: XXXX’s favorites xx-xx-xx. Click Save, Next Finish, OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you have data in files and folders in places in other folders, you will need to do the same thing with these. You will also need to repeat this process for each user on your computer.&nbsp;<em>Do not&nbsp;backup software or applications.</em></p>

            <p>Hi CT, once again, thank you for your reply. Can't get over how detailed your comments are! I have tried community help before, and while they can be helpful, they usually just get people lost. You definitely go out of your way (or maybe it' just your way)
 to try and make things understandable, and that's a credit to you. </p>
<p>I guess it gets down to whether I will attempt the rebuild or not. I was thinking along the lines of I will, thinking your help may get me over the hurdle? But, then I realized something, While going through the process, there will be a time when my computer
 no longer will be operative. And, being I only have one computer, my lone HP desktop in question, if I end up getting lost, or simply need help with what to do next, I won't be able to ask you or anybody for that help. It would seem I would be up that proverbial
 creek, and in the middle of a whole lot of trouble, CT. So, I believe I will have professional help do the rebuild. Can you offer any suggestions I should ask the service personnel that maybe doing the service, CT? I think that would be of great help to me,
 being able to ask them pertinent questions? At least maybe I could tell if I'm getting the right people to do the job? By the way, CT, I live in a rural area, Sequim, WA. and about the only named professional service is Office Depot. Any opinion on them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your comment of "Write down that Microsoft Product key and keep it in a safe place in case you need it" I certainly will. Understand I do NOT have that CD-ROM, but I guess having the 25 character serial number will maybe help.</p>
<p>You answered my question about the DVD's.&nbsp; "If you were not going to use the same old hard drive you would not need the set of DVDs that you will make to do this". So, the DVD+R are only if I decide not to use a external hard drive?
</p>
<p>You stated&nbsp; "The Windows Easy Transfer is not really a backup.&nbsp; It is a method of returning all of your data all at once in just one program". So I should do that procedure, CT?</p>
<p>You also stated "An external hard drive is connected to your computer using a USB cable that connects to the external hard drive on one end and to any available USB port on your computer.&nbsp; In all most all cases, when you power up your new external hard drive
 and plug it in for the first time, Windows will recognize that and will automatically install all the software it needs to be able to "talk" to that external hard drive. It only does that the first time it "sees" it" I understand that. I just need to determine
 what external hard drive to buy, and you made some recommendations I believe.</p>
<p>When you also stated "Keep in mind you should backup only your <strong>data</strong>. In most cases, you can get a pretty good estimate of the capacity you need to back up by&nbsp;opening the&nbsp;Computer window&nbsp;then on the C: drive, then to Users folder, and then
 to your own account – you probably will find your name listed. Now add up the sizes of your Documents, Pictures, Music and Video folders.&nbsp; Right-click on each and choose Properties to find the size. But when I did that procedure and right clicked on choose
 properties, I kept seeing 6.47 GB as the capacity no matter what folder, Documents, Pictures, Music and Video folders. It would seem I didn't do something right? So, I guess I don't know my capacity yet? Can you offer some help there?
</p>
<p>If I purchase a hard drive you are advocating a 3 1/2" size. And, I should get 7200 RPM, not 5400 RPM because it runs 1/3 faster.
</p>
<p>You are evidently advocating I get a version that is capable of USB version 3 external drive. I know my computer has USB 2 ports. So, I need something that adapts the USB 3 to USB 2 for my computer, CT? Or, will the USB 3 work automatically with my USB 2
 port? </p>
<p>As for the back-up, CT, you said " I will now give you some advice on what to buy in an external hard drive, followed by advice on how to do a backup". I would like, if you don't mind, CT, that I respond to that after I take in what you have explained prior
 to that section of your reply. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, or get over whelmed. But the back-up is certainly something I will have to address, and very soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thank you, CT for your help and patience and understanding, it certainly is appreciated, and I am lucky that you were the one who responded to my query. You have been very helpful.

<span>The subject computer is located in the pantry with a wall separating the kitchen desk where the monitors, keyboard/mouse and speakers are located.&nbsp; Hardwiring speakers/mic is not an option in this installation.&nbsp; Accordingly, I purchased a Kensington
 Bluetooth USB dongle [Cambridge Silicon chip] (hereinafter the "Bluetooth Adapter") and an
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can occur if any of the following scenarios exist on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You do not have permissions to the file or the file location.</li><li>The file is on a location that is not currently accessible like a network location or an external drive that is not currently connected to the PC.</li><li>The file has been moved or deleted.</li><li>The file or shortcut is corrupt.</li><li>The file may be blocked by Windows.</li><li>Your antivirus software may be blocking the file.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To narrow down the issue, we just want to clarify some information.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the other programs that you’re unable to uninstall?</li><li>Have you tried using another administrator account and experiencing the same issue?</li><li>Have you made any changes prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest that you perform the SFC tool to repair system corrupted files and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the command <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>

            <p>See instructions from Apple how to remove it:</p>
<p>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205788 </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, use Revouninstaller:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at http://www.revouninstaller.com (freeware). Heres a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and registry
 items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.

</p><p><span>The above issue may occur due to the presence of corrupted or missing app files &amp; folders on the computer. Presence of corrupted or missing app files &amp; folders will result in irregular performance of that particular app on the computer. The above issue
 might also occur due to the corrupted user profile on the computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Internet connection problems resulting from Windows Defender denial of mswsock.dll</h2>
                    
<p>Several days ago I got a notice from Windows Defender about the file mswsock.dll - not knowing what it was at the time, i had the file denied. Since then, even though I have a working network connection, I have been unable to connect to the internet using
 any browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then i have tried reinstalling browsers, using a different account, and performing several system restores, none of which have been successful.&nbsp; I do not have the option in Defender to restore this file, and even turning off Defender has not solved
 the problem.&nbsp; Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you get any error message regarding the mswsock.dll file?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
Let us run the SFC scan and verify it prevents this error to occur.<br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp; <br />
a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
sfc /scannow<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step I</strong><br />
If you are using a wired internet connection please check whether you face the same issue while working in the safe mode with networking.<br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
e. When Windows starts, use Internet explorer and check if the issue still persists.</div>
<div>For additional information refer to the articles below.</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step II.</strong></div>
<div>If the issue does not exist in Safe Mode perform Clean Boot troubleshooting to find the root cause of the issue.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong><br />
Let us perform the steps listed in the article below and check if that helps us in resolving the issue.<br />
<strong>You receive an error message in Internet Explorer: "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage"<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, If you have any other malware removal tools installed remove them and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<p>We had exactly the same experience for the same initial reason as Chrispy1014 and have tried all of these suggestions with no resolution. In safe mode we were still unable to access the internet and the IE8 diagnostic indicated that there was an error that
 could not&nbsp;be automatically fixed.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;also tried the commands <strong>netsh winsock reset </strong>and<span><strong>netsh int ip reset</strong> in that order, re-booting after each command execution.</span></p>
<p>As this has happened in the the last 48 hours we have attempted to recover to several previous&nbsp;restore points and finally succeeded to restore internet access that way.</p>
<p>Vista 32 bit</p>
<p><strong>The root cause&nbsp;was the Defender application&nbsp;notification about allowing or denying&nbsp;access to mswsock.dll&nbsp;- it DID NOT INCLUDE A PUBLISHER NAME so the event was deemed&nbsp;untrustworthy and denied. Internet access was impossible after that point.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just so you know... I had a lot of problems with an Upgrade from Win 7 also.</p>
<p>I ended up reinstalling the upgrade as a clean install keeping nothing...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to your problem, you might try a Startup Repair in Advanced Options...</p>
<p>Or you can try these boot Repair steps....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>1.&nbsp;In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt. </p>
<p>2. Type BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>3. Type BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>4. Type BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Type Exit, and then press Enter, and Reboot</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't need to buy anything... You already own the license...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to restore your computer to it's Factory settings and Win 7.</p>
<p>There should be&nbsp; a built in feature to do this. A key like F10 or something to start the process when you power on the machine... All manufacturer's are different, so I can't give specific instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the worst, you might need to purchase Recovery Disks, USB Flash, or what ever is used by Sony for this purpose. Unless you have already created your own... You may not need them if the software that is needed is still available after the upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess would be around $20 US for the Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just checked at Sony and found these instructions on how to do this...</p>
<p>This particular page isn't for your specific model, but if it doesn't work you will at least know what to look for...</p>
<p><a href="https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35585/p/48903,49902,49911,49915/c/65,66/kw/Factory%20Recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35585/p/48903,49902,49911,49915/c/65,66/kw/Factory%20Recovery</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens after the Automatic Repair fails and stops?</p>
<p>You should have some options as to what to do next...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced Options should show up here where you can select the Command Prompt to try the previous Boot Repair.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 will not wake from sleep BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekcraig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not wake from sleep  BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I have had this issue since the new year. &nbsp;When I close the lid on my laptop (ASUS Zenbook UX21) originally windows 7, windows 10 since release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many things from these forums to rectify the issue. &nbsp;One being that my SSD is dying,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the chkdsk and it came back clear</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a memory diagnostic too this came back fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am seeing sometimes is Kernal data inpage error.</p>
<p>Others I see c:\windows \system32\config\systemprofile\desktop refers to a location that is unavailable - I think I've fixed this</p>
<p>Occasionally I get Unexpected_store_exception. &nbsp;Though I've not got this since I done a windows 10 reset and kept my files.</p>
<p><br />
Below is what I found in the even log</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kavish,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes it is safe. Since the directx_Jun2010_redist pack is installed there is nothing you should worry about.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Web installer did not work probably because when there is an issue like timeout internet skips to download few files from Microsoft Server. It
 might be one of the reason why we installer did not work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any doubts please let us know we will be happy to help.</span></p>

    <title>Missing Chat History - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing Chat History</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife and I would like to go back through our chat history to our first Skype chat (we had a long distance relationship at the beginning) and that would mean going back to 2008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason all of my history is gone, but my wife has it going back to 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason why it only goes back that far and not to the actual very beginning? &nbsp;Surely if it's there going back 8 years, no reason not to go back 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew.</p>

            It may be due to your history settings.
