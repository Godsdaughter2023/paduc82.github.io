<h2>            Importing pictures in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I plug in my camera to import pictures the windows photo app comes up and automatically sets me up to import. I see the box to choose all the pictures, but no option to finalize my choice and import the photos. My family member said there is a continue

<h2>            XBOX One S freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I've been having issues with my ONE, with the console freezing in game at random times and random games (ex: Fifa 17, Forza Motorsport 5 and even Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime). It will freeze while playing. After a few seconds when trying to navigate in the menus, they would also freeze and the console would start responding to any input.</p><p>Also, the first time this happened, Gears of War started an update as soon as I launched the console (an update of 92&nbsp;GBs, that it's the all game... that was already installed!)</p><p><br /></p><p>I've already did 2 factory resets (with keeping the games and another resetting everything). I've since installed a few games and while I get to play a few of them (Gears of War 4 and Fifa 17), I'm unable to start a others (Battlefield 1 freezes just after I choose my profile).&nbsp;</p><p>However, I've yet to do a more lengthy play session after this reset to see if it will freeze or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br

<p>I was going to ask what update but I see you have put April 2018, this is not a recent update. October 2018 is the recent update.</p>
<p>Can you use the sign-in screen, if so select the Power icon in the bottom right hand corner, hold down the shift key and select restart. Select Troubleshoot then Advanced options then Go back to previous build.</p>

            Hi JenniOC,
<br />
<br />Try doing that steps:
<br />
<br />1. Restart you PC in UEFI mode (Follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/boot-to-uefi-mode-or-legacy-bios-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>)
<br />
<br />2. Once in UEFI mode click on "Advanced Option"
<br />3. Click on "Command Prompt"
<br />4. Digit "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER
<br />
<br />Then tell me what's the outcome.

<h2>            Windows To Go installed on my SSD and I can&#39;t get rid of it</h2>
                    I installed Win8Pro on my Acer W500 running Win7Pro. It now appears that I'm running Windows To Go off my SSD (only hard drive installed).&nbsp; I don't have a USB thumb drive or SDCard installed, so my SSD is the only storage device connected.&nbsp; When I boot,
 I get the message about not removing the media running WTG even though there is no media connected.&nbsp; I also get the WTG error message when I open the Shop application.&nbsp; How do I get rid of this and get back to normal Windows operation? I didn't get this message
 for a while after installing Win8, so I assume it installed correctly and the WTG was activated at some point after the install.

            <p>You might want to reinstall Windows.</p>
<span>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>

                    I am working with QT5.7 on Windows 10 with Visual Studios 2013 express (I had upgraded to QT5.8 &nbsp;and VS2015 and ran into many problems). The new Windows Kits SDK doesn't include the shell32lib and my Qt compiler requires it. What can I do? I can't simply

            <p>I finally figured it out. I had downloaded the archived Windows SDK that was associated with my Visual Studios version (VS2013 express) from this website:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select "Earlier Versions", on the bottom left corner, to view all SDK's. I tried to install Windows 8.0 SDK, but since I had components left over that I could not get rid of, from an earlier uninstall of VS2015 (even though uninstalled each component, cleared
 cache's, and even used a cleanup tool there were still components left and the new SDK barked about the 8.1 components) , it would not install the SDK 8.0; and I couldn't get shell32.lib without it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I downloaded the Windows 8.1 SDK, from the same website, and I thought I would try to re-install "it" and un-install the 8.1 and finally get all the components out of there so my 8.0 could install (at-least NOW I had a tool and could maybe do a FORCE
 uninstall). I installed the Windows 8.1 SDK, and before UNinstalling it, tried to install the Windows 8.0 SDK...... and BOOM! It INSTALLED!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you are running VS2013 and need Win SDK 8.0, but it won't install. Just install Win SDK 8.1 and THEN install Win 8.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition unable to install</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>today I bought the Minecraft win10 edition and wanted to download it but it didn't work. It just restarted the download like 3 times and at the end it said error. I tried every possible solution on google and nothing fixed it for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just says :</p>
Error Code 0x80246019<br />
<p>
</p><p>So I googled that and I tried everything without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10 pro, I updated everything and it still won't download the game onto my laptop..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can actually help me to fix that, since I don't want to have wasted 27€ on something that i can't even play..<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47a320e3-b1cb-4165-8e81-5365b9f4aa15?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47a320e3-b1cb-4165-8e81-5365b9f4aa15?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>

    <title>Cursor Jumps when typing in one window to another window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fr. yuri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor Jumps when typing in one window to another window</h2>
                    <p>Everybody has this limited to a laptop issue when in fact it is a windows issue. I have started dualbooting for some of my heavier project with linux so that I don't have to deal with this. But it happens on my desktop as well. I have two touchscreens. They
 are both far enough away from the keyboard that I am unable to brush up against them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be typing into the search box in chrome on the left monitor and the cursor will jump to the right monitor and I'll be typing in outlook. This is not limited to programs or technologies, but it has to be a windows issue. This only started happening with
 windows 7. We upgraded to 8 and it got worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'll be sitting watching a movie on the right screen in VLC and all of a sudden the left monitor decides to have a seizure. By seizure, I mean that the touch starts activating on it's own. I will watch it for a moment and see anywhere from 1 to all
 10 bursts going off at once at random intervals. After a moment, I have to unplug the USB input/output from the monitor and plug it back in. Then my keyboard and mouse both refuse to work, but they say that they are connected. After "touching" my way to the
 device manager, windows even says that my mouse and keyboard are plugged in and working, but they aren't. So I have to reboot and everything starts working again.</p>

d. Pick the "<strong><span>Device Settings</span></strong>" tab from the dialog box now. You can see the touchpad for your Vista machine highlighted on this screen. Select "Settings."<br />
e. Read the information provided in the next dialog box. It gives you options for tapping your<strong><span>touchpad</span></strong>, using the
<strong><span>buttons</span></strong>, <strong><span>scrolling</span></strong>,<strong><span>pointer</span></strong> motion and
<strong><span>sensitivity</span></strong>.<br />
f. Make any changes you want from the various topics. When you make a change, click "<strong><span>Apply</span></strong>." Click "OK" when you finish making all your changes.<br />
g. Do some work on your computer for a while, If the touchpad is still too sensitive, return to the "Mouse" menu and continue to adjust the settings until you get them just the way you want them.</span></span></p>

<p>The new Skype&nbsp;for desktop is a pre-release version of the application. Since this is still under testing, there are times that you might come across issues such as what you've experienced. You can help our developers in improving this version by leaving
 your feedback on this link: <strong><a href="https://feedback.skype.com/survey/answer/slf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a fully functional version of Skype, you can still utilize the classic Skype for desktop version which you can download using this link:

            so, you ship a version that is full of fundamental bugs on a previously already stable platform. I have set my updates to auto and pay the price. as a colleague said "I continue to be amazed that microsoft's ability to turn operational software into rubbish."
 I thought that that summarised my thoughts completely. maybe you should consider the reputational damage shipping such poor software does to Microsoft. This is not, bleeding edge, radically new software!!!!!!! anyway, it caused us massive complications and
 further damaged your reputation. We are leaving Skype. we were forced to find another solution and we have...............hardly a sustainable business model...&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Laptop randomly restarts after factory reset &#40;dumps files provided&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I was hoping you can help me address issues my recently purchased Lenovo 510 is having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently did a factory reset after the laptop faced a couple of BSOD. The laptop had been running fun since save for the screen occasionally flashing black for a split second, and one occasion where the laptop did not wake up from sleep after the lid was
 closed and later reopened. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in the last of couple of days the laptop has randomly restarted itself twice. The screen goes black (no 'Windows is restarting'), the laptop is restarted to the Lenovo splash screen and loads back to the log in screen as normal. Task scheduler shows
 nothing scheduling a restart, and windows is fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two dmp files were created in the minidump folder on these restarts, which I’ve uploaded to onedrive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>d<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!Av-cI-T0j0yVhQX0sV9KBDm1_AUa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mp dump files</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Ceilidhe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While we wait for other members to read the files for you, let's try to sort this out. If your device was reset to its factory state, there is a chance that its running an older version of Windows 10. If this happens to me, I would try a clean installation
 to remove manufacturer's built-in apps. Prepare a blank flash drive with at least 8GB of space capacity. Then use this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>and follow the instructions on how to create an installation media. For a detailed instructions, you may refer to this<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
 Forum Article</a> created by Andre Da Costa about how to clean install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation media should automatically install the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update or Version 1709. You might need to run the Windows Update to bring your device to its latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Hi John, apologies for the late reply. I can confirm that the laptop is fully up to date, including the 1709 update that was installed immediately after the factory reset.

<p>Got it. Other than that, it could indicate a performance issue or malware infection. Let's try reinstalling your graphics card. Go to
<strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt; <strong>Display adapters.</strong> Completely uninstall the driver. Restart your device afterwards. Download the appropriate driver from the manufacturer's website and install it. Observe if it will make a difference.</p>

<p>Hi John, apologies again for the late reply. We are currently experiencing internet issues, so university is the only place I can get online at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I viewed the dmp files using Bluescreenview, it gave the error code 0x00000124 and the&nbsp;ntoskrnl.exe 75da83 driver as the cause of the restart. From what i've read, it looks like it may indeed be caused by a faulty driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will attempt your suggestion of uninstalling and reinstalling the graphics driver later tonight, as I am without the laptop at the moment. Just to confirm, the graphics are provided by a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">AMD APU. I should uninstall the related
 driver, restart and download the AMD driver provided by Lenovo, correct?</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t boot up Windows 7 - keep getting Blue Screen with &#34;CACHE_MANAGER&#34; error</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new MacBook Pro in January and purchased Windows 7 to run on it. I've successfully run it since then, but just last week my computer froze and now when I try to restart it, it goes to the black "starting windows" screen and then immediately
 flashes to a blue screen for only a few seconds that says:</p>
<p>CACHE_MANAGER</p>
<p>If this is the first time you'v eseen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps.</p>
<p>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manfuacturer for any windows updates you might need.</p>
<p>If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to selected Advanced
 Startup Options, and then select Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Technical Information:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x00000034 (0x00000107, 0x00000420, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</p>

<p>Initializing disk for crash dump...</p>
<p>Beginning dump of physical memory...</p>
<p>Dumping physical memory to disk: 100</p>
<p>_______________________________________________</p>
<p>I tried booting my computer up in safe mode, but it doesn't work - goes to the same blue screen and crashes. I also tried the "startup repair" tool, which did not find anything to repair. I tried the memory diagnostic and it did not find any problems.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help someone can provide!</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer lately?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
I would suggest you contact the computer manufacturer or motherboard manufacturer to assist you in disabling the Video caching, Disk caching and BIOS caching in BIOS and check if Windows 7 installs fine.</div>
<div><strong>BIOS DISCLAIMER</strong></div>
<div>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may refer the below mentioned link.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
I would recommend you to perform a system restore using a Windows 7 DVD. <br />
Here is how:<br />
To open the System Recovery Options menu using a system repair disc or a Windows 7 installation disc<br />
If your computer's system is severely damaged and you cannot access the System Recovery Options menu on your computer, you can access it using the Windows 7 installation disc or a system repair disc you created earlier.<br />
To use this method, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the disc.<br />
a. Insert the disc.<br />
b. Restart your computer using the computer's power button. <br />
c. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc. <br />
o If your computer isn't configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer.</div>
<div>d. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.<br />
e. If you are using the Windows installation disc, click Repair your computer.<br />
f. Select the Windows installation you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
g. On the System Recovery Options menu, click a tool to open it then choose System Restore and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information on system restore visit the following link.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important:</strong></div>
<div>If&nbsp;you are able to boot&nbsp; the computer successfully I would recommend you to update the hardware drivers and run the check disk to check any errors on the disk. Also, run an online virus scan to scan any viruses on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the following articles for more information.</div>
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong><br />

    <title>Windows Still Producing 30GB SSD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Still Producing 30GB SSD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear MSCSA</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter has this HP laptop, called 'The Stream'; and am shocked that devices after the year 2015, 30GB SSDs are still being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device has an WinOS Update that cannot be accepted and nothing extra has been added, in any way on this device.</p>
<p>Last night I tried to compress the drive disk, but it doesn't seem to have made any difference.</p>
<p>Today I decompressed to re-compress; but am wondering if anyone knows a bit more about this laptop, could you tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this device accept a considerably larger storage SSD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does two reputable companies ("MS Window" and "HP"), allow their products to be sold and purchased to users who, particularly these days.</p>
<p>Need space for those everyday "security patch updates" and maybe add some tools, like 'Adobe Reader', or install the the IE Web Browser for any benefits a user can get from using Java tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can direct me with some help please.</p>
                </div>

<br />
<br />As I understand the process HP decides what to build and the specs as well as the version of Windows.
<br />
<br />That is a nice computer with low cost due to the small SSD. The drive probably can be upgraded though what I would do is use a 3.x USB (faster) or a 2.0 USB drive for more space. Either a thumb/flash drive or an external USB drive.
<br />
<br />The unit does have both a 3.1 and 2.0 USB port.
<br />
<br />External I/O Ports :
<br />
<br />1 USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-C:tm:); 1 USB 2.0; 1 HDMI; 1 headphone/microphone combo - And some models have more ports.

            You don't mention specifically which HP stream. There are several versions. But I see there is a 32GB one starting at around $250.  The simple reality is that it'll cost around $100 to buy a larger SSD and probably $50-100 (at least, probably more) to have someone install it for you and re-install Windows.  You might want to consider just buying a new machine.
<br />
<br />You ask why? It is simple, to make money.
<br />
<br />If you look at the minimum hardware specifications for every version of Windows (not just Windows 10), everyone agrees that they are too low for anything but the very lowest scale use, ie web browsing ONLY.
<br />
<br />Remember, Win 10 was released summer 2015 and all of the planning happened years before that.   BACK THEN even a 32GB SSD was expensive.  So MS played the numbers game and decided that 32 GB was adequate for a minimal Windows computer.   And it has been for 2 years. But now, the simple process of using a Windows machine for 2 years, installing applications, constant Windows updates, general detritus collecting on the machine means that too often there simply no longer is enough free room to do the most recent major update to the Fall Creators Update version.  Even taking extreme steps to free up space on the HD has been proving inadequate.

            Hi Tommy,<span><br />
<br />
This might&nbsp; happen because of the following reasons:<br />
1. Browser fails to load&nbsp; the pages.<br />
2. It can also be caused because of virus. <br />
<br />
I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </span>
<p>1. Which antivirus application are you using?</p>
2. Which browser are you using?<br />
<p>3. Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</p>
<br />

<p>I have had nothing but trouble with yahoo and yahoo mail </p>
<p>I am tired of all the changes that yahoo has been making lately.-</p>
<p>Even typing this reply I am having trouble as the cursor will jump back up into the message and I have to go find what I just typed.</p>
<p>I guess I'll switch to Google and see what happens there.</p>

            <p>I too have had&nbsp;problems locking up when using Internet Explorer&nbsp;for Yahoo's home page and&nbsp;email, and the problems have escalated over the past year to the point where I just now opt for Google or Mazilla Firefox browsers instead of Internet Explorer. When
 I open Yahoo in those I don't t have the problem. Am no computer expert but I personally&nbsp;think the add-ons in Yahoo are causing the problems - all the ads with pop-ups, they slow down the use of the site, so me thinks.&nbsp; Yes the cursor problem is also annoying
 and slows down responding considerably.&nbsp;I don't know what updates or fixes are available, but the only way I know how to accommodate the problem, is to click on the document where you want to begin typing and move the&nbsp;pointer arrow&nbsp;down and out of the way
 before you type a single letter. At some point inputting text you'll catch up to the pointer arrow and then you have to repeat.&nbsp; "If they can put a man on the moon, why can't they......."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !</p>

            <p>From my experience Yahoo! mail freezes up because of the ads on the right side of the browser window. The freeze happens when the ads are running and when the ads are changing/loading. Typing a new message is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded/installed a FireFox plugin to block ads like this. It works well. I don't have the problems with Yahoo! mail anymore. (I run FireFox portable.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: The only problem is that I have to turn off the plugin or use a different browser when using Outlook/Hotmail. Otherwise I get a message that says to turn the ad blocker off, and Outlook mail won't let you do anything until you do. I don't mind when
 Outlook prevents you from blocking their ads because those ads don't prevent a user from using their mail like Yahoo!.</p>

<h2>            Search box keeps opening</h2>
                    Since &nbsp;upgrading to win 10 when scrolling up or down a web page the search box will open. I've tried hiding it but it still pops up and it's very annoying. I'm using a hp laptop with 2 finger scrolling. I've gotten it to stop by putting the task bar to
 the either side but I'd rather not do this. Any ideas why this is happening?&nbsp;

            <p>I'm having the same issue with the scrolling fuzzbalz. Haven't found any answers yet. I have to reset all my touchpad setting every time I boot up.&nbsp; Also still dealing with the Contara problem. She is always popping up. Very annoying. Come on MS, can you
 guys do something about these issue, at least let us know if anyone is even working on them.</p>
<p>Windows 8 was a minor disaster, lets hope 10 doesn't end up being another. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is there a list of known issues anywhere on line we can look at?</p>

            I did run the fsc and it reported no problems. Any other suggestions? Is someone at ms working on this problem? I also have issues with my touchpad settings reverting back to default at bootup. Thanks

            <p>I have found a (less than ideal) fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that maybe two-fingered trackpad scrolling was somehow triggering the keyboard shortcut for the search box, I disabled the Win+ keyboard shortcuts. The problem is gone. Of course now I can't use any of the windows key shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have my pointer settings so that hitting the ctrl key shows me where my pointer is on the screen. It will often do the alert while I'm just trying to scroll, so the trackpad is clearly somehow triggering the ctrl button as well as the Windows+S key.
 Why is the trackpad triggering keyboard buttons? I would love for it to not do that.</p>

            Thanks, I give that I try. I believe that's it's an issue with the synaptics software with windows 10, my synaptics ver is 19.0.12.95 and is dated 7/15/2015 and as far as windows 10 it's up to date? But clearly has issues, but that's what I believe is
 causing the issue.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t resume from sleep but turn on.</h2>
                    <p>I just clean installed WIndows 10 onto my PC after it fails to load Windows previously. Now I got a new problem; Windows won't resume to its last state after I put it to sleep or hibernate it. When I wake my laptop from sleep, it will just turn on and load
 Windows like it was shut down before. In fact, all windows that I have already opened before putting my laptop to sleep also lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It supposed to turn on the screen straight to the lockscreen (not loading the windows all over again and losing all my opened apps or windows), and all my opened apps and windows should be there just like I left before putting it to sleep.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already try to reset Windows 10 just now, and the problem still there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope anyone could help me since I tried to google but many of the problems are Windows won't turn on and resume at all. Where as mine, Windows did turn on like normally but it didn't resume from its last state.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Sanim,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be either due to some issues with the power settings or corrupted system files on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the below methods and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Power Troubleshooter
</span></em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong><em>Power</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It could be a compatibility issue with the new
<strong>Fast Startup component</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the below steps and check:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>
Control Panel</strong> / <strong>Power&nbsp;Options</strong>. </span></li><li><span>On the Left side menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Change settings&nbsp;that are currently unavailable</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Scroll down to the
<strong>Shutdown&nbsp;settings</strong> section. </span></li><li><strong><span>Remove</span></strong><span> the check mark from the
<strong>Turn&nbsp;on Fast Startup</strong> option. </span></li><li><span>Select the <strong>
Save Changes</strong>&nbsp;Button.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Shut Down</span></strong><span> the computer, wait a couple of minutes and
 then use the <strong>Power Button</strong> to start the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to restore default settings of power plan and check if it helps.</span></p>

            <p>To: Joythar K</p>
<p>I have tried all the methods you have listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>The Power Troubleshooter didn't came out with any problem other than "Brightness settings is too high".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>After I unchecked the <strong>Turn&nbsp;on Fast Startup </strong>option, I shut down my laptop. After a few minutes I powered it up and open couple of windows and apps. Then, I put my laptop to sleep. But the problem still persist. Windows didn't resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>The option “<strong>Restore default settings for this plan</strong>” is greyed out. I assume that all the settings haven't been changed from the default since I just reset Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, but all the 3 methods are not solving my problem. Anything else I can try?</p>

            <p>Wow....I'm having the same problem. Unfortunately, I dont know how to fix it. I have contacted Microsoft Tech Support 4 times and ASUS tech support once, no help. I believe windows 10 has installed a bad driver or this is a new problem with the os itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im starting to think that this is a intel graphics driver issue as if you go into device manager and unistall the intel graphics and switch to the microsoft basic adapter then the laptop resumes from sleep fine. The only problem is that it makes the computer
 really slow and automatically installs the intel driver again.</p>

<h2>            Customer support insulting&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Of course I'm typing this on my iPad, as I cannot log onto my windows based laptop!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;After being prompted by Microsoft to download Windows 10 &nbsp;over 6 weeks ago , I reluctantly "upgraded" from 7 to 10. Instantly I was notified that Edge does not support "extensions" , which made my Norton Security service no longer relevant . What is an
 extension ? which &nbsp;Microsoft support could not explain in layman's terms , so I called one of my best friends, who was the former IT Director for the Gates Foundation &amp; he explained it to me in one sentence what extensions are in the software world ( of course
 I asked him why does The Gates Foundation need a separate IT group &amp; he said that there is no one MS product that gives The Foundation what they need to run the business!?! HMMMM? Doesn't that tell you something?) . However , he then asked me "Why are you
 downloading Windows 10 ".? As he informed me there are lots of issues that they have not resolved between Microsofts various platforms , E. g.; MSN, Office 365 , Outlook, Internet Explorer . All of which I use everyday ! Well , I used to use!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st week I did the "start here" process and my nightmares began. Files and folders were missing , yet I could access them on my iPad!?!) AND I no longer had access to my 365 Outlook email. But a "new Outlook " came up on the "tiles" , which was the strangest
 email account that I've ever seen . No toolbar, no folders and no way to add new folders . 1st call to "Support " and OMG the "tech" asked me to spell my first name 3 times and then asked me how I pronounce my name 3 times ( btw it's Barry!!) . He told me
 that it was the new and improved "Free" service and I could always go to the "other" Outlook email service via Internet Explorer, which I did. Hmmm, isn't this Windows Live? Sure looks like it! He said no. I asked where my "real " Outlook email is and he said
 that that was a 365 product &amp; he said he could transfer me , which he tried and I was disconnected!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the folks at 365 &amp; they told me they were having all kind of issue with Windows 10 &amp; to make it work properly I had to upgrade to 365 2016. I paid for the upgrade and for a one year service agreement. I told them that I already pay for an annual
 MSN agreement and they informed me that this was a separate group and I needed a separate contract and fee!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Week 2 , began having "crashing" issues ! Called "Support" , again went through the "how do you spell &amp; pronounce " your name &amp; I was told it was probably my router causing the problem. I never had an issue previously with 7 , nor do s my son have issues
 with his MacBook Pro, nor my wife's business computers ( she is a Director for a major software company based in San Fran!) . But , just in case it was "our" issue , I replaced our flawless Netgear product with a Linksys router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Week 3; continued having crashing issues and called "Support" &amp; no issues with my name. They told me to go to recover and go to a reset , which took hours! But did not resolve &nbsp;my problems. They told me they would escalate and when they transferred me ,
 &nbsp;I was disconnected!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Week #4 - still no access to the "real Outlook" &amp; no access to 365 , as I keep getting a pop up saying "not verified ". Try to verify &amp; it says I need a key #. I call 365 "Support" and they tell me that since I'm a previous customer I do not need a key number
 &amp; it's a Windows 10 problem! Computer continues to crash!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Week #5- I call "Support" back as now in order to turn on my laptop , I have to constantly hit F12 to reboot , to login. Still no access to the "real Outlook " , still getting the pop up to verify with a key # and he tells me to go to Recovery &amp; walks me
 through the process &amp; restart. He runs into my computer and says "Uhoh" &amp; says he needs to escalate. I do get transferred and as the "supervisor " is chatting with me we get cut off. Oh , did I mention that the last 2 calls they took my cell number, just in
 case we get cutoff. They never called back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Week #6 - All of my pictures &amp; personal files &amp; folders missing! F12 reboot to login, No " real Outlook email, no 365 suite ( all fee based and paid for in advance!) , AND when I finally get on , everything is back to where I was 6 weeks ago and the prompts
 tell me to "lets get started"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTING TO HAVE TO CALL SUPPORT AGAIN AND WHEN I REQUEST TO BE MOVED BACK TO WINDOWS 7 I'M TOLD THATS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IF ITS AFTER 30 DAYS FROM "DOWNGRADING" TO 10 &amp; THAT I CANNOT GO BACK TO 7!?!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTING TO HAVE TO ASK FOR A SUPERVISOR WHO TELLS ME &nbsp;THAT FOR ME TO "TALK" WITH THEM I HAVE TO PAY $99 DOLLARS FOR A ONE TIME ISSUE OR PAY $149 A YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTING TO BEING A PAID MSN PREMIUM CUSTOMER SINCE 1998 ( my wife asked me 10 years ago "why is there a 9.99 a month bill on our automatic withdraw from Microsoft ? And I reply " my internet service" &amp; she's says " really, I didn't know anyone paid for
 Internet "! And then she asked " what is $ 12 for Zune &amp; $15 for Xbox Gold?" I embarrassingly said for service &amp; she said " have you ever actually had them fix anything and I said "No" , always upgraded to the newest and greatest!?! Do the quick math , $10,000
 over 20 years times how many customers? I guess I helped pay for Paul's front "window" on Mercer Island &amp; Bill's in Medina!</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTING TO BE TOLD THAT THIS IS MY ISSUE AND IN ORDER TO FIX IT I HAVE TO PAY FOR SUPPORT AND AN UPGRADE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTED THAT THE ONLY WAY I CAN CONTACT YOU IS WITH EITHER AN iPHONE AND OR A iPAD!! ACTUALLY I'm NOT BUT YOU SHOULD BE! AS WHEN I WENT TO THE AT £ T STORE TO "UPGRADE" MY iPhone AND&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTED THAT MY LOYALTY TO MICROSOFT FOR OVER 20 YEARS HAS BEEN A PERSONAL FLAW ON MY PART , THINKING YOU ALL ( yes , I'm from the South ,NOT SEATTLE)</p>
<p>ARE BETTER ( you're not!) CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS ( you could learn from Lowe's !)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTED THAT MY SON , DAUGHTER , WIFE &amp; MANY FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES WERE USING APPLE PRODUCT &amp; ANDROID/GOOGLE &nbsp;&amp; MOZILLA/FIREFOX &amp;I DEFENDED &nbsp; &nbsp;MICROSOFT PRODUCTS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSULTED !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I called the folks back at 365 &amp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for coming back to us with the information and sorry for the delay response.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know how did you upgraded to Windows 10 through Windows update or Windows 10 ISO?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to run app troubleshooter and check if it helps. Follow the below link to run app troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to re-register the Windows store app. Please follow the below steps to re-register:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>start</strong> and type <strong>Powershell</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the <strong>powershell</strong> and click on
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>And run the following in a Command Window to re-register:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml</strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run SFC scan. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files and
<strong>DISM</strong> to fix things SFC cannot. Follow the below link on how to run SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></a></p>

<h2>            KB3176936 - problem with game and uninstalling the update</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
Yesterday (9/5/16), my PC (Lenovo Z51) made an update -&nbsp;KB3176936. Everything seemed pretty fine, unless I ran one of my favourite games - FIFA 15. Until updating, everything had been running really well, but now, after the Windows is at its 'newest' version,
 I can't see the textures of some objects in this game. It's frustrating! If I had only knew, that updating will end with more troubles with Windows, than it was before. I tried to uninstall it - SURPRISE - there is no option like uninstalling the KB3176936.
 I'm really confused. <br />
Is there any solution for my problem? I really appreciate every suggestion that may help me.&nbsp;<br />
Greetings,&nbsp;<br />
Filip&nbsp;

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the display driver and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. Press “Windows key + X” and click on “Device Manager”.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. In the list of devices, you should see the Display Drivers.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Right click on the device and then select "Uninstall".
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. In the Action menu of Device manager, select “Scan for Hardware changes” option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, to run the program in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please follow the below steps: </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1) Right click on the Program </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2) Click on Properties </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3) Click on Compatibility tab </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4) Select Run this program in compatibility mode (try different Operating systems)and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Unfortunately your tips didn't work. I did everything like you sad, but still - no rendering of some objects. It's really frustrating, and surprising. Actually, the game worked really well before. I will be grateful for some other clues that may help. Thank
 you for your time, and for your reply!</p>

            <p>I am having a similar issue with my flight simulator "X-Plane" by Laminar Research. Prior to this update, it works great. In fact, there are many who block this update because it has such a hard hit on this simulator. It will take us from a great 60 frames
 per second to a 3 frames per second rate in which renders the simulator inoperable.</p>
<p>I tried all the suggested tips exactly as stated and still doesnt work.</p>

            <p>This has not only impacted FSX but also X-Plane and my entire display for normal windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot understand why I decided to build a Windows driven PC for FSX. I should've stuck with running all my Flight Sims on my iMac.

<p>
</p><p>These automated KB's installs from Microsoft truly and honestly irritate me, specifically when they have messed up a perfectly working system.</p>

<p>Why am I not surprised this is still an issue.</p>
<p>But on a more serious note, after you've selected the file in step 5 then what.... leave it selected and see if it heals itself?</p>

<p>Ok so what if you haven't even saved a file yet? A friend is getting this and has not saved anything yet, it's his first tune he wants to save. So he has no corrupt file to delete....???</p>
