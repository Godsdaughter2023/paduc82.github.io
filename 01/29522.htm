            Thanks but this is too confusing. The only thread<strong> I replied to</strong> and the only issue I raised was "Windows Live Mail can not copy hyperlinks from one e-mail to another."&nbsp; While I want feed back on
<strong>that </strong>issue I have no desire to receive responses to every&nbsp; branch of a discussion that I did not comment on and that is irrelevant to anything I inquired about or responded to. &nbsp; I received
<strong>your reply to ME</strong> (not someone else who ventured to a new branch) Your email is a<strong> reply to me</strong> and you wrote: This should assist
<strong>you</strong>" (me, the recipient you addressed yourself to). You are responding to me on an issue I never raised.&nbsp; You are therefore "replying" to me on a discussion I have not participated in.&nbsp; You are therefore replying to the wrong person.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox Live Ambassadors Question&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saulseeker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Ambassadors Question&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>How long do I have to wait to get back in? Yes I think I did get removed from the Ambassadors program, but it wasn't intentional I accidently just put wrong word usage down. I said, "Hello fellow XBLPET member." Then they took it like I was impersonating,
 which makes sense, but I really didn't mean it. Anyways that's besides the point, all I want to know is how long will I be kicked out? Is it permanent or just temporary?</p>

<p>If you got kicked from the Xbox Ambassadors program there had to have been a violation of the Code of Conduct for Xbox Live or the Ambassadors Code of Conduct so there is a good chance it is permanent unfortunately.

<p>First off another thing I would also do is remove your signature as you aren't offically an Xbox ambassador. Even know you have been kicked off the programme as such and 'once' were an ambassador at this moment in time you aren't until you get an answer
 and you don't want to be mis lead once again.</p>

            <p>Wrong phrasing or not, it was put in by you and the PET's take this very seriously. &nbsp;You're lucky you didn't get your tag banned for this.</p>
<p>However, be aware that in order to take part in the ambassador program you can't have had any enforcement action against your account within the last 365 days.</p>

 drive after it restarts, but this quickly cancels for some reason (without any dialogue or explanation) and goes back to the purgatory like loop and sign in screen as described in the initial question. The laptop additionally continues to restart every 60

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above link to Rohit Chettri's solution does not work. When the power button is selected on my screen a very small and empty gray box comes up above it. There are no options to select in it. Thus, the steps cannot even be taken to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the post by Wasim A is inconsistent with what my problem is. The laptop does not say that the password is incorrect, it does not even recognize that it is being submitted after hitting the enter button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The use of other irrelevant threads to attempt to answer this begs the question of whether my above post was read in full or at all. Furthermore, it was not even acknowledged that the laptop restarts every 30 seconds. Since my initial problems are not being
 addressed, my frustration only grows as I continue to be without use of my once fully working computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my proposed solution:</p>
<p>1. Microsoft begins to care about customer service and realizes there is a problem here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Microsoft offers to receive my laptop my mail and see if they can have their technicians correct it while covering whatever shipping and handling expenses there are, etc.</p>
<p>***Now one of 3 different paths***</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3a</strong>. Microsoft's technicians correct the issue and restore the laptop to its previous functionality and return it with a compensatory mechanism for all my inconvenience (gift cards or pre-paid services, something to say we're genuinely sorry).
 This restores the customer's faith and experience with the company and provides incentive for continued business in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3b</strong>. Microsoft's team cannot correct the laptop. They extract what they can from the hard drive since there is precious irreplaceable information on there and send that to the customer. Microsoft then provides a check in full for the cost
 of the laptop which was ruined by their product, then provide&nbsp;a compensatory mechanism for all my inconvenience (gift cards or pre-paid services, something to say we're genuinely sorry). This restores the customer's faith and experience with the company and
 provides incentive for continued business in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3c</strong>. Microsoft continues to submit useless information and/or ignore their customer. The customer calls their lawyer and files legal action. Microsoft demonstrates poor customer service and an inability to admit their mistakes which saves
 them about $1000ish dollars in present time but causes them to lose out on tens of thousands of dollars in future sales from this customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a student without my laptop for the past month. I would appreciate if some real solutions could be offered to the problems at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the person reading this cannot help me with my above plan then paste or message me the email or phone number of someone who can. I am not going to give up on this.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro disconnecting Bluetooth for no reason</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this is a common problem with Surface but it's getting more and more annoying. I have Designer Bluetooth Mouse and Keyboard, so I was expecting flawless work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problems with BT&nbsp;without any reason, cause or pattern. Interesting is that I have no problems when streaming music via BT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. BT disconnects for few seconds and reconnects (I can live with that)</p>
<p>2. BT disconnects all devices and I have to switch off/on to get it working again</p>
<p>3. BT disconnects all devices and wan't reconnect any of them, sometimes also looses WiFi and the only thing that helps is restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it also looses card reader and sometimes it helps to turn off/on i device manager, but more often only restart helps...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the above happens randomly, sometimes 5 minutes after restart, sometimes it's all fine for a week (I only sleep my Surface, don't use turn off) and another time it cracks every 10 minutes so I can't work and have to close all projects to restart,
 blind using my finger, as I have a monitor connected...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Win is maintained very well, updated, virus free and I'm a power user.</p>

<p>I was hoping for a more advanced reply. You've posted some very old drivers, updated via update automatically anyway. As stated before every thing is up to date and works fine as intended unless it disconnects for no reason. This is probably a hardware/driver/firmware
 glitch, getting more and more annoying, which is strange...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can try (from simple solutions, not rewriting drivers) is to make a fresh install of Win10pro, which might be usefull anyway.</p>

<p>Nope, the keys are working until nothig works but I've <strong>solved it</strong>! Thanks for your clue, it gave me an idea to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>uncheck Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong> for keyboard and mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>which is strange as now I can't turn it back on (no reason to though). Looks like this solves the issue, but I can still feel like it disconnects for a fraction of a second, which is very livable now - ok!</p>

<h2>            Finding a USB port number</h2>
                    Right, Windows 10, using software to program an external piece of hardware, it uses usb to connect it but asks for the port number. I cant for love nor money figure out how to find the damn thing. I can't seem to find any numbering in device manager or
 anywhere else.

            Hi  EdwardElder77 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Port number?
<br />There is a DeviceID number for USB devices.
<br />Try this.
<br />Go to search and type powershell and then right click and select run as administrator.
<br />Type the following command.
<br />
<br />gwmi Win32_USBControllerDevice |%{[wmi]($_.Dependent)} | Sort Manufacturer,Description,DeviceID | Ft -GroupBy Manufacturer Description,Service,DeviceID
<br />
<br />See if that gives you want you need.

<p>Okay, tried that, didn't help, if anything I am now even more confused.<br />
This is the screen I'm looking at, asking for Port in the top box, which I'm guessing means the USB connection. Hence why I'm asking for port number, but I think I have totally confused myself.</p>

            This problem only happens at Pogo.com?&nbsp; Strange...&nbsp; They may be using some non-standard port to get their games working and your firewall software or antivirus software may be blocking it.&nbsp; I did a little reading and they use a variety of ports (Depends
 on the game apparently)&nbsp; So you may may want to try loosening your firewall rules a bit.&nbsp; Can you tell me what antivirus and/or firewall software you use if any?&nbsp; If it's a commercial package, you may have support with the company.&nbsp; You might consider calling
 their support and explaining your problem.&nbsp; Typically they can guide you through adding an exception for the website you want to go to (In this case, Pogo.com) and that will help fix your issue.&nbsp; Otherwise, I can only help you so far because there are many
 different kinds of firewall software and I can't know how they are all working.&nbsp; But I'm 90% sure this is your issue.<br />

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors <br />
existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or <br />
worse to steal your identity. <br />
<br />
Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make <br />
unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

<h2>            windows 8 64bit system is freezing</h2>
                    Built a brand new pc myself from scratch. intel i7 3770k with asrock z77 extreme 6, crucial 8gb memory, sapphire radeon hd 7970, samsung 840 256gb ssd, &nbsp;and windows 8 64bit. my system is randomly freezing when i open certain applications like musicbee,
 speccy,. sometimes windows 8 freezes at that white spinning circle during boot time. memtest86 showed clean memory. my cpu temp is 30c, i use artic silver. chkdsk shows 0 bad sectors. when i run sfc /scannow i it tells me i have a bunch of errors it cant repair.
 im not sure why my system is freezing like i cant move the cursor or do anything other than hit the reset button on my tower.
<div><br />

<div>here is some of the random cbs.log i get from the scannow</div>

<h2>            Swap product keys between machines</h2>
                    I have a now deceased PC with Windows 10 Pro and a new laptop with Windows 10 Home. In the process of moving all my files to the new machine, the power supply of the old machine blew up. I'd like to swap the product keys and eventually resurrect the old
 one. Is this easily done (the swapping I mean)?

            Hi Lonny.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this video streaming in a browser or using a player, and which player?
<br />
<br />If a browser make sure it has the latest Flash player:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br />
<br />If a player try resetting it in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features in its Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />Try installing the most popular and reliable Video Lan player to see how it compares:  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>.  It will also play DVD's which isn't' included in Windows 10 Media Player.
<br />
<br />See here to Reset Windows Media Player:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/restoring-default-settings-in-windows-media-player-12-2438897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/restoring-default-sett...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi lonny, is this a video you have downloaded?
<br />
<br />If so, 
<br />
<br />Check if HEVC or H265 is mentioned in its file name ?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 cannot play HEVC video, Windows 10 does not have the codecs to play these files
<br />
<br />Try the VLC Player and see if the video plays properly:

    <title>Unusual error in the Diagnostic System not Running plus the Microsofts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj buster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unusual error in the Diagnostic System not Running plus the Microsofts email response, confused here, new</h2>
                    <p>I just bought this 64 bit Compaq Presario that was a demo model; I liked it because it was loaded. They told me at the store, it won't come with what it is supposed to; but I do have my what they said was OM disks? Original Manufacturer? They kinda dissed
 me off because I had to wait nearly 3 hours for my computer to be ready all because they had to remove 'their' personal info off the data from what I understand as I took it over to my sister in law's house; so now I am turning this whole message over to her
 because I don't understand this and she is the expert.</p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Hi, you prolly have seen me post around the forum board; and indeed what is posted above is quite true and has every right to be angry as much as I am. So livid was I it was no wonder he took it over to his buddy's house to try to figure out how to work
 it and it wasn't functional. Rather than contacting me or returning it back to the store - they wasted hours on messing with it trying to figure it out themselves until when they elected to return it back to the store. He was informed it was NOW HIS responsibility
 to install the OEM (not OM) disks back into the OS. Exactly what they were doing for 3 hours is over my head as I wasn't present there, but I can understand why they were so irritated and frustrated as well as angry when they would not honor the warranty because
 it "suddenly was 'SOLD AS IS' ..." in spite of the receipt. I did some internet checking and having spoken with HP who was quick to inform me a shocker; this unit actually was owned by someone else before and why it was put on display as a demo is over their
 heads too but they do have the Store's number and the Assistant and Tech's names who were involved.</p>
<p>He was basically RIPPED OFF; it was nice of HP to work with me to get this resolved, however the Synaptics is shot (it's sad to know but true); a mouse must be used and this is (May 28, 2010 when it was registered but they were unaware that it had been returned
 back to the store nor were they ever aware it was put back up on displacy either and sold as a demo for a marked down price of $699.99 from $899.99 which it does indeed have a 5 star processor and it has been upgraded to DDR3 (according to the dates on the
 dual core DDR3's - one is April 2011 and the other being May 2011). Yes, it was Win 7 Ultimate and it came with MS Office 2010 Starter; but he was provided with:<br />
<br />
1) Promotional disc of Win 7 Ultimate 64 Bit OS disc (not in a box but a flat mailer, same what I have except mine is a 32 Bit OS) - what struck me odd was the fact the key to it looked awfully familiar where I had to pull mine out; while the flat mailer is
 somewhat similar - his seems to have been used quite heavily as it was well worn which makes me wonder if the Techs there were using it to install into other OS or upgrades? The disk itself was scratched and worn, yet, his friend as well as he did indicated
 that they were told it is original to this OS; but I cannot understand how the key would be the same as mine?).</p>
<p>2) The Promotional Microsoft Office 2007 Ultimate Disc was also provided but in a sleeve with the Microsoft code on it which made it very difficult to read as it was well worn. I have Microsoft Office Ultimate and it comes in a BOX that slides open (it's
 annoying, I know); not put into a sleeved and slapped with the OEM info. </p>
<p>(Before anyone jumps the gun - YES - both of them are GENUINE MICROSOFT DISCS / or / DISKS - they match up and align to what I have only that mine is 32 (or x86 platform version) while his, being 64 bit OS version)</p>
<p>This part I do not understand; both of them implied their Tech had lost the original Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Disc, but had everything backed up on another (?) and made a flash on a Transcent 16K (pocket) of that Professional Plus with the
 Key. He was advised it was zipped and all he had to do was unzip it and reinstall it.</p>

<p>================================================</p>

<p>What I found on his OS was hardly ANY Microsoft in the OS at all, even though I had went to the msconfig and the no GUI boot but elected the OS and SYS log as to know exactly how this was starting up to begin with? It had everything that left me perplexed
 beyond measures, even ready boost when there were no ready boost installed, for example. I was finding all sorts of programs running at start up but it wasn't listed in Services to Firewall nor could I locate them in Winsys to Sys32. Running SFC/SCANNOW, having
 already downloaded and installed MSC (Microsoft Security Client aka Microsoft Security Essentials) due to what I saw very strange tracking to tracing; no other options but to also run Malwarebytes (free version).</p>

<p>a) SFC/SCAN now was a total failure</p>

<p>b) MSC ended up being disabled automatically, would not even enable Network (even wnet attempted manual mode in the wide array of scope); it was out of the question</p>

<p>c) Malwarebytes - picked up tirades of junk galore where there were backdoors to hacks including variants. There is no way I could reinstall or run the HDD via computer diagnostics in such a mess like this. But there was one option here:</p>

<p>i) CCleaner - downloaded that, uninstalled everything that I could and can</p>
<p>ii) Taking the dreaded (do not ask me for it because I will not provide it to you) Microsoft Clean Up Installer (not the real name but Microsoft will know what</p>
<p>I am in reference to; because it is so damaging to the OS) and running it on purpose and deleting everything that was in there until it was empty and bare.</p>
<p>iii) Taking "hostile" take over now for the OS is crippled now; over everything via the Ownership and wiping out everything as much as possible in regedit to</p>
<p>manually remove everything into the trash (except for CCleaner - as I kept it running as it helped cleaned out more junk to speed it up) until I was D.O.A.</p>
<p>by the time I reached to the winsys area and deleting them all in sight as well as everything in Windows. You do not even WANT to know what all they</p>
<p>had in store in there.</p>

<p>This alone took hours; having to do this manually, to make sure there's nothing left behind in the memory. Having crashed it and received the BSD (Blue Screen of Death) ... mission accomplished; had no OS. Next process was now to run the computer diagnostics.
 I could only shudder to find out there was much more left behind (nearly 2 GB of junk!) however, the computer diagnostic equipment at my friend's house did an excellent job of wiping it all out clean within about 20 minutes, and then proceeded a re-run which
 in approximately 2 minutes, the result was clean. Then the test run (extensive) came up clean.</p>

<p>REINSTALLATION of his 64 Bit OS:</p>
<p>Same thing - TWICE which has left me totally perplexed, while keeping in remembrance of above pertaining to Synaptics (it's shot but HP is looking into it because of the OS Sys Info provided to them is somewhat altered; it is unknown if they had upgraded
 this or refurbished this machine without their consent; the problem is, while it does have Win 7 Logo and AMD Vision logo on front, it does not have the Microsoft's OEM Sticker on the machine itself anywhere. What they were able to obtain via their system
 aligns to what I have, so this OS was registered and now unregistered, not to confuse anyone, it is the system info that is spilling out the beans.) every time I am assisting him in installation of Win 7 Ultimate, the Office 2007 and 2010 What I do not understand
 is, my Office 2007 Ultimate does not come with MS Works 9.0 but his does and creates a duplicate file which I have to work on this offline. Because this has both x85 and 64 in Program Files, I have the CD and Flash back ups for all the Add-Ins associated with
 both MS Offices.</p>

<p>While all Firewall to Services are all configured properly, even in MSC to UAC - he let me handle this matter to get his new computer back to where it belongs as he was so angry and "ticked off" in which I don't blame him for I had personally never seen
 such a big "crappyola" like this for the amount of money paid in which even Compaq (HP) even implied he way overpaid it for they were far cheaper than that and an email was sent to him which he forwarded it to me so I could print it out (from his mobile phone
 as I was working on the computer). Indeed, it was troublesome (not the installation) but getting the Services to stay put where they are supposed to be, for example Diagnostics, BITS, NAP, WAT/WAS, et al to Network constantly going Public (while everything
 in Fireall ans well as extended Firewall) just would not stay put where they belonged (yes, they all were configured correctly). ALL OF THESE THINGS OCCURED AFTER THE SP 1; it was FINE before SP 1 - even when HP had indicated the WiFi's vulnerabilities and
 provided me the link to download that latest update (I think it was June 14? 2011) all that which was updated; however. Even when he used the WiFi after the installation of SP 1, as secured he was; he was finding other Users (unknown) who were attacking his
 network draining out his resources and taking over his mouse and/or taking over his webpage (the Remote is Disabled).</p>

<p>1) Running SFC/SCANNOW had found errors and repaired it and reading the CBS log file just literally blew my mind; great was it that all of these as implied above, had occured after the installation of SP 1</p>
<p>2) The DEP was turned off (it was on)</p>
<p>3) In Windows Firewall; everything in Private was now moved over to Public</p>
<p>4) I could see that hacker(s)? had struck him without his awareness while he was online, hitting him in wide array of attempts of removing the "Trusted Installer" and one could see in CBS log files of their failed attempts, but under various DNS/IP which
 I had tracked it down and found them to be in the Black List so it was not trackable. I did get a name (but it could be very well a fluke) of "Chung Wu" but I am not falling for it because of the distance and knowing everyone around here we just do not have
 such individuals.</p>
<p>5) The COMMANDS via the WiFi mode was to disable the Firewall without the user knowing it and to disable MSC and all antivirus, spyware, et al - and I could read the commands of what they were trying to obtain but it was resulting:
<br />
V:\ FAIL</p>
<p>Command\Delete/ [10 days history]/ [10 days logs]/ [Tracing]/</p>
<p>2011:8:10:<strong>(note this is the year, month, date)</strong>02.42.241.043<strong>(note this is the DNS/IP example read it backwards - 340.142.24.02)</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(Much of this was repetitious but not always the same DNS/IP, but in variations of commands from variations of encodings<br />
and codes. Unfortunately, he did not realize I wanted to save this to send it to Microsoft so they could read it; deleted it. *sigh*</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft needs those codes and encryptions that they had broken into to gain over "Trusted Installer".)</em></strong></p>
<p>6) No one around here has a V drive or a Server with that drive either; however I was slightly amused to the fact whoever it was managed to get into the AppData and got a hold of Windows Update log files and turned around and deleted them (unable to delete
 the SP 1 though).</p>
<p>7) Then it became interesting, after the failure in English; he/she managed to install Chinese into the System (that was when the mouse froze and the read sign popped up FROZEN where one was unable to even turn the Notebook off, I told him to remove the
 battery (since he was on WiFi and wireless); he removed the battery for 5 minutes and we moved to another location... Once the battery was put back in, the FROZEN remained, even when on D/C (direct current or plugged-in via adapter). No one had any control
 whatsoever over it.</p>
<p>7a) Once the FROZEN was gone, I immediately went to work and the OS was crippled., being it the 2nd time around I needed that</p>
<p>SFC/SCANNOW and while that was running, had TM, Services, Firewall, Regedit, et al - all opened and attempted to restore</p>
<p>everything in its place</p>
<p>7b) It will not permit a "Home Network, even though I am static" that was wiped out with some virtually unknown DNS/IP Addresses which did even</p>
<p>manifest itself on the CBS log. But running the ipconfig isn't reflecting it? Having to reinput all this info? Double, triple until one is in the Twilight</p>
<p>Zone beyond comparison.</p>

<p>This time around I have informed him NOT to touch the WiFi; I really believe this may be the culprit of the whole episode (we have a lot of hackers out here as well as Mime Sniffers - does not matter if you are secured with WEP to WPA in any shape or form;
 routers or built in encryption - they will MIME you to death even if you are only on only but for a few days).</p>
<p>I have EXHAUSTED every means and avenues; the diagnostics are coming up clean (computer) so the OS Sys is not infested. I ran MSC, Malwarebytes, AND McAfee's Online Scanner (different from Windows Live Scanner) due to my awareness of several MAJOR TROJANS
 out there but I am unsure if I should post them because if one looked it up they are going to be overwhelemed by the mass variants of such and that is just ONE.</p>
<p>8) Trying to work to SALVAGE what is there (FIX IT won't resolve it); so far I have managed to restore more than 3/4th of what has been disabled and re-enabled them all manually (in various ways) but more than anything else I believe this: DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM
 NOT RUNNING - (for it is a chain reaction which others are dependant on it) THAT I CANNOT GET IT GOING OR ENABLED. I have exhausted every means and methods from Hardware device deletion to *OFFLINE* - "hostile take-over" of the files necessary so they would
 be back under "Trusted Installer" and running in the right mode in Services. Even the command prompt is a failure...</p>
<p>9) I had him to send Microsoft a Live Chat and I would work with him but once we got there it states that his new OS for assistance is "expired"? Color me confused on this one. Until I decided to put this whole topic on hold and go with the "boys" back to
 the Store where they obtained this computer so I can have a word with the Manager and Techs myself; especially with these discs (or disks) that were given to him. It wasn't that they were not Genuine Microsoft; they are 100% Genuine Microsoft.... before we
 posted this. Since now it has been 3 days, that Store (been there a long time, that I know but I never liked it in there; went there a couple of times, while cheap - yes, but had this weird feeling something was not right. This is not a major Department Store,
 if it is a Chain Store or 3rd Party Store, I can't advise but they do a lot of computer, phone, printer, et al - repairs too as well as buying them but those that have been repaired and made anew are SEPARATE from theBrand New items in the opposite end of
 the Store (think of it like a Bargain Basement) in which many do not have OS OEM disks - there are signs there that simply such warnings and including "ALL ITEMS SOLD AS IS, NO REFUNDS, CHECK ITEM OUT BEFORE YOU BUY!" Store Policy and made this indication
 repetitiously and both of them had implied that it was in the brand new area. When we arrived there, the Store itself was now pretty much empty and bare; "CLOSED, OUT OF BUSINESS" printed on two pieces of paper, one on window and another on door, everything
 from the name of Store up there to the decals on the door (Store Hours to Credit Cards including BBB had all been peeled off). While we were there, as implied, I've been there; I asked them where was this item - both immediately showed me the what was left
 of, the sloping wall shelf with brace (for notebooks/laptops and it used to be phones but that was moved to a glass case and that wasn't there anymore either) so I asked 3 times if the item was back there or over by the small side between the Storage Room
 and the Tech Door Room? NO, It was right there.</p>
<p>9a) With both of them talking at the same time (along with their body languages); they were indeed telling the truth. But when I questioned them what about right</p>
<p>here (knowing this is where you purchase the item(s) and or supplies; especially more items which can be stolen and walked out the store with which would
</p>
<p>be right behind the counter. They told me exactly what it was, they were telling the truth. I hated to inform my half-brother in law that he had been ripped off</p>
<p>and both of them are not understanding the disks. Yes, they are genuine, but NO - they are NOT to this OS; most likely they were going out of business sans</p>
<p>without any implication by the Owner that only the Managers knew about it so they could clean out -OR- the stuff that did not sell has been relocated to a</p>
<p>different location (they go by various names, that is another reason why I dislike it; I loathe stores like that, to me personally it's almost just as bad as a
</p>
<p>telemarketer in a boiler room - they have a legal name, but all over the place they are named this, named that, et al. So in turn what is Tech World here, could</p>
<p>be Technology Systems over there, Electro-World there, get the idea? Sounds like a Ponzi system, but where's the Headquarters and I know in turn they run</p>
<p>from them because of what becomes available or discontinued hails from their Headquarters, that info isn't provided. On the receipt, one isn't provided a Store</p>
<p>Name or Number, it is ironic, just a regular old fashioned styled cash register which only has a name and the purchase (sans the item's name on it) price on</p>
<p>receipt. They do not even use bar code scanning (not that I know of) for all the price tags are in white or red, clearly marked on the boxes and is removed by</p>
<p>the Cashier / Assistant Manager / Manager. </p>
<p>9b) Once we returned back to my residency, he was using his friend's mobile phone (he had been borrowing it - as it is his buddy's back up phone) letting every-</p>
<p>one know about it all and visibility upset. I had been working on this for hours, after he had calmed down, we tried Microsoft again, which he is eligible for</p>
<p>and again it comes up expired. I instructed him what to do, and he just gave up and left it to me to handle it all because he is not computer savvy and is too</p>
<p>upset. I had exhausted every means and methods - even with the email of the "known issue"; we tried that and below is the result of the outcome (I removed</p>
<p>his email address for his safety reason). I had done all I could to gain access, and ... ?</p>

<p>MICROSOFT - IF YOU WANT - YOU CAN TOUCH BASES WITH ME AT HEAD STORMS AS I HAVE COMMUNITY PRIVILEGES HERE AND NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS; I AM UNSURE IF EMAILING HIM WOULD BE OF HELP BECAUSE HE REALLY IS CLUELESS. HE HAS LEFT HIS OS WITH ME TO WORK ON
 IT TO GET IT BACK UP AS WELL AS I AM IN RAPPORT WITH HP TOO TRYING TO GET THIS STRAIGHTENED UP. I AM NOT EVEN SURE MYSELF IF THIS ITEM WAS A "CHOP SHOP" WORK?&nbsp;PERSONALLY, I AM CONCERNED TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS GIVEN WHAT WAS IMPLIED ABOVE AND IN ADDITION,
 I AM NOW NOT BUYING THIS STORY OF "THE TECH LOST THE MS OFFICE STARTER DISC" FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND... THE OEM IS FROM HP, THEY ARE STILL INVESTIGATING AND IT DOES NOT COME WITH A DISC, IT COMES WITH AN IMPLICATION YOU HAVE TO RIP YOUR OWN HARD COPY OF THE
 DISC AND THE MS OFFICE STARTER VERSION IS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE OS SYS. I HAVE ALREADY VIEWED THE WEBSITE AS WHAT THIS OS IS AND UPDATED IT AS IT HAD NOT BEEN UP-TO-DATE WITH ANYTHING FROM BIOS TO VARIOUS HARDWARE/SOFTWARE.&nbsp;THE DDR3 IS NOT HP'S, SOMEONE
 PUT THAT IN THERE - NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DDR3'S AS THEY ARE TOP QUALITY (Expensive Ones).&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT IS HAPPENING IS --&gt; THE FILES HAVE BEEN MOVED; UNAUTHORIZED ATTEMPT (WHILE HE WAS ON WIFI) - I JUST CANNOT NOR HAVE ANY POWER TO GET HIM BACK ON THE PRIVATE NETWORK, ALL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED, I DO KNOW FOR A FACT, IT IS MISSING FILES BUT IT
 IS STILL IN THE REGISTRY AND I HAD MANUALLY INPUT THEM (Programs and/or Programs (x86) and/or Windows - wherever it is missing IN); RUNNING THE MICROSOFT FIX-IT ACTUALLY MOVES THE FILES ELSEWHERE WHERE THEY DO NOT BELONG. I AM UNSURE IF IT IS RECOGNIZING THIS
 IS A 64 BIT (even though I had gone to Win 7 Ultimate, 64 Bit OS) - AT LEAST WE ARE STILL ALIVE THIS TIME AROUND, CRIPPLED BUT STILL ALIVE; AS MUCH WORK I HAD DONE WAS MANUAL MODE TYPE... THE PROGRESS SO FAR IS DOING GREAT.</p>
<p>AS FOR SYS RESTORE - IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION BY REASON OF THE ABOVE HACK, I WOULD HAD POSTED THE CBS LOG FILE RIGHT HERE ON THE BOARD IF HE HADN'T DELETED IT (He was so angry and upset about this too).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HERE'S THE RESULT OF THE EMAIL PROVISION FROM MICROSOFT AND HAVING EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS TO GO THERE TO OBTAIN THIS:</p>

            <p>I just found something else out - his friends who had also purchased items (OS and Phones) from that same store ... actually were all the same thing ... can you say "CHOP SHOP"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this excessively rare for a business that had been around for quite some time; however, I am unsure if there's a possibility that the Owner had sold out to another. What happened is also, his buddy's OS a Win 7 Professional which he got which what
 he thought was a bargain; turned out after he CRASHED. Had him to bring it over, it's a 64 bit OS, of interest, running the computer diagnostics had revealed to me 2 differing conflicts of interest; his also had the Microsoft Label removed as well. The only
 difference here was, the original OS was a 32 bit, I found that out and originally was a DELL, but in a&nbsp; HP Tower. I took it apart and found tirades of stuff in there that were all kinds which were mainly whatever that was there that worked and fit, so be
 it type attitude. I cannot express the anger that I had within me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the computer diagnostic scans - I had to remove some components out and replace it with the proper compenents (because it is a 64 bit OS) in addition to having him purchase the right few small parts (no biggie here but will make the OS improve in performance.
 However, I was beyond irritated to see the HDD being a used Segate (for a 32 bit or x86 platform) and that item was the most expensive thing he had to purchase. He cannot understand this concept because it was working fine at the store. I made it clear it
 only takes a few minutes to switch a hDD and connect it; so he invested himself into a 1 TB&nbsp; (which was on sale) Sata and I installed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was interesting of what he had for the OEM discs as well; they were Genuine Microsoft Discs but they were what the Techs use, not for the general public to have in their possession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So both of them basically have the same thing in general perspective. While the father of one made implications to call the Police, but how? What are they going to arrest? An empty store? Who can you prove?&nbsp; I made it clear to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the phone, his buddy's friend just got locked out today for "non-payment" of what he had just paid? Leaving his mother in a rage and a fight over her son's Service Provider which indicated his phone is activated and fully functional, however, it turns
 out that phone itself isn't even of that XXX Name, they apparently had taken the data and everything eithin and put it into another phone and hence, why it turned out the way it did. Right now his phone is at the Authorized Dealer's shop to figure out who's
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now going back to his buddy's friend's OS - it's a legitimate 32 bit Dell, but it is also a legitimate 64 bit HP .. so the decision here of "who reigns supreme?" According to the computer diagnostics after it was fully run, it showed that the 64 bit was
 the denominating factor and the mainboard (or motherboard) was of HP even though it had Dell in there. Ohhhhhhhhhhh ... my head hurts just thinking about all of this; the mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL RULE OF THUMB TO EVERYONE:<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE, PLEASE - WHATEVER YOU DO, WHEN YOU SHOP FOR A COMPUTER (OF EVEN A WINDOWS PHONE) MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS GET THE MICROSOFT GENUINE STICKER LABEL ON THE OS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOR YOUR INFORMATION - WINDOWS 7 DO NO COME WITH OEM DISKS - YOU HAVE TO RIP (OR BURN) YOUR OWN; SO MAKE SURE YOU STOP BY AND GRAB SOME CD-R'S AND INCLUDING AT LEAST A 16 GB IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT; FOR A READY BOOST
</strong>(Whie do not dedicate the entire drive - leave some room to breathe)<strong>.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEVER LEAVE THE STORE WITHOUT CHECKING WHAT'S IN THE BOX FIRST! CHECK IN THE STORE, OR IF IT IS ALL POSSIBLE, CHECK ALL SYSTEMS BEFORE YOU PAY FOR IT.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An honest person or Store / Department Store - will never refuse this; they have nothing to hide; it is wise to do your homework first ... as the saying goes, if it is too good to be true, it prolly is!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DON'T BECOME A VICTIM AND GET RIPPED OFF ... even if the product comes up as "Genuine" ... just because does not mean anything ... thoroughly check every nook and cranny, like the Southerner's would say "If ain't dere, it ain't so". Still holds true!
 It does pay to shop around, look at other OS and you will see it ... if it is there (Microsoft's Label) you will know itis so)...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>With the economy being bad in various areas; keep in mind of this --&gt; BE WISE! Just because a Store or Computer Repair Shop or what-not that had always been there, may not necessarily be of the same Owner, the original Owner could have sold the business
 (or it could have exchanged hands several times over - who knows unless one looked up the history) and another one&nbsp; is in its steed and turned its great reputation down the cesspool into a "Boiler Room" with its shoddy "Chop Shop" or&nbsp; "Illegal" type situation.
 Keep in mind ... when in doubt ... ASK QUESTIONS! A Genuine Sales / Assistant Manager / Manager / Owner / Tech - would be more than happy to answer; while those of chop shop would wonder why you're asking too many questions and would be making excuses or act
 suspicious as if you were some type of an undercover. Something to think about; but really, I feel sorry for all these folks that had been suckered in ... if they had only KNEW, IF ONLY KNEW .... what they were walking themselves into. For your own sake&nbsp;as
 the old adage goes "LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP!"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>==============================</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As of now ....</strong> there is little I can do at this standpoint but to work with everyone with what I can; yet, superimposed, also seeing the demolishing effects it has taken upon those who were there, and I shudder about the others...<br />
<br />
Don't ever let this happen to you!</p>

<h2>            Fan for the Xbox one s stopped working.</h2>
                    <p>My fan just stopped working when I was playing fortunate, I did hit the Xbox once were the fan was and it was making a lot of noise but me and my dad opened up my console and the metal plate was bent so be bent the plate back into place so it wouldn't rub on the fan and make noise. Than the fan started to make the same noise I tried to ignore it and now the fan just stopped working and the Xbox keeps on overheating. I don't know what to do for the subtopic or the topic so I put random thing there.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I'm ol' school so please be patient. So my console has died an untimely death (RRoD):( It is the older model where the hard-drive sit on top of the console. Time to buy a new one:) Am I able to use my wireless controllers and HDMI cable on a new console?
 Also how can I transfer my account and downloads to the new console? My old hard-drive won't fit onto the new consoles. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><em>Hey :).<br />
<br />
You can move all of your data from the old HDD to new on one&nbsp;by using an official MS transfer cable. Alternatively you can move your Profile and saves to a USB flash-drive from your old HDD.<br />
<br />
Then re download any DLC to your new console using your <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download history</a>.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This link contains a guide for both methods</a>. (Including using the DRM tool to transfer you game licences to your new unit).<br />
<br />
Also while I am posting here is a guide on <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2122754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to insert the 250GB HDD into the 360 's'</a>.<br />

Your HDMI will work fine as will your controllers.<br />

            <span>Hi Jaganmohan,<br />
<br />
1. What is the format of the file that you are trying to play?<br />
2. What is the exact and complete error message that you get?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
You receive a codec error message, or audio plays but video does not play when you play media files in Windows Media Player 11<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t set Notepad as default app for .nfo files. Says &#34;Application Not Found&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried going into the settings and default apps, and selecting Notepad. When I click it, it does exactly nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried to write the Assoc/ftype command in administrator mode: ftype MSInfoFile="%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1" which also didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried to right click a .NFO file and selected always open with, which also didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the registry database in administrative mode to see if the path was correct under:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\Notepad.exe\shell\open\command</span>, which is was. Not that I was allowed
 to edit the default path if it hadn't been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. It's completely unacceptable that I can't change the default program to notepad, which actually reads the .nfo files I have&nbsp; correctly. They're essentially just notepad documents with a different file format. Coming from windows
 7 less than a week ago, I find this utter lack of control completely unacceptable. Anyone have a solution for me? I'm running Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also just tried to install Notepad++ but that is the exact same problem. I think it might be that I can't change ANYTHING for the .NFO file. What gives?</p>
<p>

<h2>            cd-drive of laptop ejects by itself</h2>
                    I have a hp pavilion dv6. running windows 7. Recently I noticed something very unusual. I am not sure if it is so , but I think after installing some updates from hp a week ago, the cd drive ejects automatically. When i searched web for similar problems,
 I found that whoever facing this problem has a typical pattern, either the cd drive ejects when they insert a disk or they start their pc. But in my case I dont have any reason like this. It just ejects now and then, without any cd inserted.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community forums!<br />
I understand that the cd-drive of the laptop ejects by itself after a Windows update. To get this issue fixed, I would suggest you to try the troubleshooting steps:<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Perform the hardware troubleshooter and check.<br />
<strong>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter<br />

<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists then you may try the troubleshooting steps from the knowledge base article:<br />

            The troubleshooting report says,<br />
"hardware changes might not have been detected"<br />
<br />
Method 2 is not applicable for me because I can read and write from the dvd drive just perfectly.<br />
The problem is it ejects automatically just now and then and from last two days it has increased noticeably.<br />

            <p>Keep in mind that there is an alternative to replacing or fixing (if you can) a built-in DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can buy an external DVD drive for about $20 or $30 that plugs into any USB port.&nbsp; It can then be used on any PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a desktop, you can buy an internal DVD drive for under $20 and they are very easy to replace.</p>

<p>A windows update was evidently installed on my computer last night. Now, this morning when I turned on computer, it is like a brand new one. Everything - documents, everything on Quicken, photos, i tunes, bookmarks on Internet Explorer are gone. Can't get
 the default printer to work even though I have re-set it to be the default. I even got the screen when I turned it on that said Welcome, and congratulations on your new Dell Computer. Please help!!</p>

<p>We just experienced a similar problem. With the update on our brand new machine!&nbsp; We'd just gotten our drivers installed for our printer (CM1017MFP) and then Windows 7 has to update.&nbsp; We accept the notification and let Windows do its thing.&nbsp; When the desktop
 loads we immediately noticed that things weren't quite right.&nbsp; Icons were missing the bar "thingy" was moved back to the middle/top of the screen.&nbsp; MS Outlook has apparently been reset and who knows what happened to all of the contacts?&nbsp; How can anyone conduct
 business this way?&nbsp; I am confused and wonder how MS could drop the ball in this way.&nbsp; If you have any idea what I can do to get my settings and information back PLEASE help.</p>

            I have a $1500 Dell paperweight.&nbsp; This is only a few months old.&nbsp; I am on a ACER as of now.&nbsp; The Dell was working fine for me as IO turned it on at 7 AM for my work at home job.&nbsp; I took my dog to the Vet at 1230 Friday.&nbsp; Came home turned on Dell at 230.&nbsp;
 Goes to Dell logal and then goes to a completely blank screen.<br />
<br />
I get on my back up computer, find dell number, call in, and get some guy from India on the phone.&nbsp; He said cannot do anything unless I give them $149 one time only for three hours or 279 for one year.&nbsp; U guessed it.&nbsp; The more expense the better the service
 i guess.<br />
<br />
Tried to run some test.....&nbsp; NO good.&nbsp; Seems to be that Windows 8 is COMPLETELY GONE on my Dell.<br />
<br />
No system reboot, Nothing, I just lost everything.<br />
Indian Guy said he is sending me Windows 8 to download and reboot.<br />
<br />
How the heck with all the fancy garbage and lip service am I going to get all the photos back.<br />
They claim no computer is protected from virus or hacking.<br />
I do nothing on my computer but work related.&nbsp; End of Story!<br />
<br />
Thank Dell!&nbsp; You owe me a NEW laptop.<br />
Yes, I do have a service number.<br />

Why doesn't Microsoft explain why this happened and what is being done to prevent it in the future?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll go through the recommended actions but guys have to be totally brain dead to think every mom and pop is totally knowledgeable on how to do this.&nbsp; Tell
 people what the issue actually is, why it happened and what is being done about it like a responsible company would do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank God I didn't have any immediate to do and luckily my most important documents are on Dropbox vs. anything Microsoft.&nbsp; So at least
 I can work from another computer - likely my Linux one which won't do things like this.&nbsp;

            <p>hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to bed with my computer having 58 programs over 3 years of having my laptop.&nbsp; I only did some research that day, as well as watched a movie on Netflix the night before.&nbsp; When I woke in the morning my computer was doing up dates as usual (I don't want
 the updates).&nbsp; When it was finished updating to windows 10 all my programs were completely gone I lost $1000's in programs and software.&nbsp; All the programs that came with my laptop from HP everything completely gone.&nbsp; I knew it was wrong to do the system restore
 after they played with my computer because all my restore dates also had been wiped.&nbsp; The techs did it and made my computer worse, I have no control over my computer and spent 2 full days on the phone with techs.&nbsp; My laptop is completely destroyed useless
 I am disabled and depend on my laptop for everything. Microsoft tries to tell me that the update could not have done this, well I see on here that it has happen to many. I am still with out my computer and have to wait for a level 2 tech now to contact me.
 I need someone that knows what they are doing. The techs on the phone knew less than me I could be a tech for Microsoft because I can fix more than they can.&nbsp; Be careful about there what they tell you to do much of it is simple and not going to help at all.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Sir this is incorrect and even makes the problem worse. One my laptops system restore points were wiped by the update.&nbsp; Two, there was no update history to see and nothing to uninstall that is the first thing I looked at.&nbsp; The windows 10 update completely
 wiped every thing on my laptop.&nbsp; Please stop telling people to do this because the techs created a restore point on my computer ran it and put the nail in the coffin of my laptop.&nbsp; THIS IS VERY BAD DO NOT BE TO QUICK TO DO ANY SYSTEM RESTORE.

<p>My machine just updated 11/14/2017 with Windows 10 Version 1709 - wiped out all my printers and on top of that will not allow any to be loaded - tried loading them several times and always say" Driver is unavailable" &nbsp; - really bad for my office.&nbsp; I have
 to copy the print program and take it to another machine to print it out - I am on a DELL with an I7.&nbsp; I turned off my firewall to see if that was it - made no difference.&nbsp; Based on what I have heard from other people in the office it is happening to them
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afraid to do the reset might wipe my autocad program&nbsp; out&nbsp; -which form reading the blogs it is doing that to other people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- looks like it is time to go Apple if this does not get resolved - tired of these updates.</p>
