<h2>            RB3 Disc Bands that I expected to see more from but didn&#39;t</h2>
                    
<p>I remember&nbsp;getting excited&nbsp;when I saw the RB3 list of songs which included alot of bands new to the game thinking that we would have to see some DLC from their wide selection but for some reason we haven't.&nbsp; Where is more content from the following bands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cure</p>
<p>Elton John</p>
<p>Primus</p>
<p>INXS</p>
<p>Echo &amp; The Bunnyman</p>
<p>The Smiths</p>
<p>Tears For Fears</p>

<p>Yes. We need more Cure and Echo. I've been wanting more Interpol since RB2 but I guess it's just easier to churn out more Avenged Whateverfold than artists who only have one song in the RB library.</p>

            When you are at home do you use the wireless connection or is it wired? And when you are in your office or on the train do you use the wireless connection?

<p>Use the wireless connection on both, train and home, also use the wired connection at home but still get the same problem.&nbsp; Tried stopping the wireless service from starting up but still bsod.</p>
<p>Can start in safe mode but not safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>Any solutions welcomed before I switch to an Apple I am sick to death of BSOD on Microsoft products.</p>

            Many months ago I got the same problem with our Toshiba Satellite &nbsp;(SA50-109) &nbsp;model No. PSA50E-06U03RDK and I had actually given it up.
<div>The laptop had always worked wireless, but all of a sudden some time last year it refused to start , i.e. showed the blue screen with exactly the above error message.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Inspired by what I now have found on the net I have now tried to start it up in several loacations and for no good reason it does run fine in some locations, but never from my house.</div>
<div>Today I tried to start the laptop in the garage of a house 40 meters from my house and it works just fine. When I walked with the laptop towards my house, the error came shortly after I was no longer sheltered by my neighbour's house and there was view
 to my house. To me this indicates, that it has something to do with the wireless sinal and Windows XP. But what is going on?</div>
<div>&nbsp;Except for the situation above, where the laptop is moved, the error comes only on startup of Windows XP, service pack 3 &nbsp;and I have exactly the same experiene as Sunnylord described April 15, 2010.</div>
<div>Microsoft!! please tell us what is wrong and please give access to the update, of driver or whatever (is it the 2200BG??) in such a fashion that it can be run in safe mode without net access, &nbsp;so that the equipment eventually can run normally everywhere.</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you have an issue with </span><span>pinning apps to your taskbar</span><span>. I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue, I will surely help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How are you trying to pin apps to the taskbar, is it from the start menu or the all apps?</span></li><li><span>Did you right click on the tile on the start menu and try pinning it to the taskbar?</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">
</p><p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span> This issue can occur due to user account corruption or missing/corrupted system files</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any apps which are already pinned to the taskbar, try unpinning it and pin it again to the taskbar?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have another user profile you may try pinning apps to taskbar and check if that makes any difference</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest that in command prompt run the SFC scan by typing sfc /scannow.</span></p>
<p>Sfc /scannow will inspect all of the important Windows files on your computer, including Windows DLL files. If System File Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace the corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided the SFC scan help article for further help<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">:

    <title>Surface Book 1 Clipboard battery is erratic. Many reddit users - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 1 Clipboard battery is erratic. Many reddit users reporting the same, at the same time</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Book is less than a year old, and at the same time as multiple reddit users, and around the time MS released a firmware update related to the battery, our batteries are behaving badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, they drain quickly, and drain beginning at 100% charge, where before the clipboard waited to drain until the base had been used to 70% or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, the battery drains very fast, and when it hits around 40% it dies almost instantly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We are all experiencing the same thing, so I am pretty sure it's a firmware related issue. Perhaps related to kiosk mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we get a fix???</p>

    <title>RB3 Achievement Guide - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ride the piggy  say:</h3>
<h2>            RB3 Achievement Guide</h2>
                    
<p>There are 62 achievements with a total of 1250 points.<br />
1000 points are On-Disc achievements. 250 are considered DLC Pack 1 achievements.<br />
<br />
Most of your achievements can be tracked in Career &gt; My Goals. I listed where each achievement is tracked in case you're missing one or feel like you've achieved it and haven't received credit.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Tune Up 4</b><br />
Calibrate your audio/video setup for the optimal Rock Band 3 experience. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Rock Band Basics<br />
Use auto-calibration with the RB2 Wireless (or other compatible controllers) or manually set your calibration.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Self-Made Dude or Lady 5</b><br />
Create a Character.</p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Rock Band Basics<br />
Hop in to the Customize menu and create a new character.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Best. Name. Ever. 5</b><br />
Rename your band. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Rock Band Basics<br />
In the Customize menu, rename your band.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Well Connected 6</b><br />
Connect your Rock Band 3 Band with rockband.com at http://www.rockband.com. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Rock Band Basics<br />
Unavailable at the moment, link your RB3 band with rockband.com using the Account Linking code found in the RB3 pause menu shell Options &gt; Extras &gt; Account Linking</p>
<hr />
<p><b>You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet 20</b><br />
Maintain overdrive for 60 seconds. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Overdrive<br />
Easiest done with a band that is coordinating full overdrive bars. Suggested songs: The Kill by 30 Seconds to Mars, Handlebars by Flo-bots, Are You Gonna Be My Girl. It can also be done in solo play using Guns 'n' Roses' "Sorry" on expert guitar. YouTube has
 some great videos to follow on that.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Millionaire Club 25</b><br />
Get 1,000,000 on one song. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Score<br />
Possible with 2 players on Hard/Expert depending on the song or 3 or more with players on medium or easy. Find a song you enjoy that has a good portion of triple chords or a lot of notes in general. Use overdrive together and keep your multiplier up! Dire Straits'
 Walk of Life or The Flaming Lips' Yoshimi both have a ton of triple chords and paired with a good bassist and drummer you can easily snag a million points.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Rock Band Master 25</b><br />
5 Star on Medium (or 3 Star on a higher difficulty) any 50 Rock Band 3 songs. </p>
<p><b>Rock Band Legend 30</b><br />
5 Star every song in Rock Band 3 on Hard.</p>
<p><b>Rock Band Immortal 50</b><br />
5 Star every song in Rock Band 3 on Expert.</p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Epic Rock Band 3<br />
These three work in conjunction. Use your career "My Goals" section to track what songs remain. 5 starring all songs on expert up to 50 songs will net Rock Band Master then completing the set list will get Legend and Immortal as well. I recommend going for
 all these AND Endless Set list 3 at the same time. The ES3 is unlocked from the start so you can hop right into it immediately. Anyone who is platinum in RB2 can easily achieve all these at once.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Alex's Luggage Combination 30</b><br />
Beat a Rock Band 3 score of 12,345,678.</p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Rock Band &gt; Epic Rock Band 3<br />
Get a combined career score on all instruments totaling over 12,345,678. Finishing ES3 or playing 80-100 songs will grab this pretty quickly.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>HOPO-cidal Maniac 25</b><br />
Kill 53,596 Hammer-ons and Pull-offs. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Guitar Goals &gt; Epic Goals<br />
One of the most time consuming achievements in RB3. Takes about 1.5-2 weeks of solid GUITAR (must be done on guitar) playing to net 53,596 HO/POs WITHOUT strumming them. If you have the habit of strumming your HO/POs you will not get credit for them. Stick
 to songs with a lot of HOPOs such as Antibodies, Green Grass/High Tides and many DLC songs. Keep track of your progress in MY GOALS.</p>
<hr />

Get 100% accuracy on Expert Guitar. </p>
<p>Career &gt; My Goals &gt; Guitar Goals &gt; Epic Goals<br />

<h2>            Surface Book - keyboard constantly stops working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just got my Surface Book last month but since I'd had it it has a recurring issue where the keyboard component stops working.&nbsp; When I get this issue the only button that does work is the attach/detach button.&nbsp; Sometimes it resolves itself, particularly
 if I use right click on the trackpad, or if I detach and re-attach the tablet.&nbsp; It's really frustrating and I'm almost at the point of returning the laptop for a non-Surface product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest why this is happening?&nbsp; The laptop is all up to date and I have also followed instructions which I found elsewhere which suggested I hold the power button and volume button for 15 seconds etc to reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

<span><span>The tool takes 10-15 minutes to run unless the tool resolves a Windows Update issue and there are additional Windows Updates that need installed.</span></span></p>

<p>This would be very useful if say you need to print a mock design and show it to someone who needs to know the dimensions.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi BRUNO.,<br />
<br />
<br />
3D Build has an option to display the distance between 2 points that you indicate by using
<strong>Measure</strong>. However, if you would like to have persistent measurement, that option is not yet available. I do see the convenience of having that kind of information, so I suggest that you create a feedback though the

To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            My son&#38;&#35;39&#59;s live account is not accessible</h2>
                    
<p>He was prompted to login with email/pwd last week.&nbsp; Which he did but then was told it was incorrect.&nbsp; So I assisted with resetting the pwd and then got an error to contact live support.&nbsp; Tried to login via PC and got message that someone might be using the
 account, that then prompted me to submit some form.&nbsp; did that and was told to change the pwd.&nbsp; Did that and then got the second message AGAIN!&nbsp; Contact chat and went thru all troubleshooting still no go.&nbsp; Transferred to phone agent and same results.&nbsp; she then
 asked me to login with my id and submit a form.&nbsp; Did that.&nbsp; And holy cow.....same results.&nbsp; I have read that the account is blocked, but I yet to be able to talk to anyone that can, or will, actually unblock the account.&nbsp; I have talked to 2 supervisors in
 customer service and they have been able to do nohting.&nbsp; this is absolutley absurd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>his tag is Crzy Mnky</p>
<p>MICROSOFT XBOX HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is the first attempt on here, so hope the moderators have more authority, access, or brains, etc....</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear you're having issues with the account.</p>
<p>If this is the one that has to do with the security proofs as well then try these steps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Go to System&gt;Settings&gt;Storage and find your sons account and delete the profile only (not profile and contents)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Clear the cache 3 times</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Restart your console</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Go to Social&gt;Sign In/Out&gt;Download Profile and follow the instructions to download the profile.</p>
<p>My son's account had this same issue and the steps worked for him. &nbsp;Hopefully you'll have the same amount of luck with it.</p>

<p>When you sign in get the message "It looks like someone else is using your account" you prove ownership by getting the code wherever they tell you. Then yes it tells you to reset your password for security, after resetting the password you are required to
 sign in again with that WLID. Sometimes the email field can be auto-populated by your own WLID or another and you have to select "Sign in with a different WLID" then put the email there. But I just want to confirm you are getting the code right? After that
 you should be signed into their WLID account summary page and be able to add security. Child accounts however require the parent to sign in after signing in as the child account and it can be confusing.

<p>Kimberlu: I think the main issue is I cant get them to send me the code to an email that is still active. one would think this should be very simple, especially considering this is a family account and my id is still active. &nbsp;And I am not sure what you mean
 by "Child accounts however require the parent to sign in after signing in as the child account and it can be confusing." &nbsp;I have never had to sogn in after my son for him to access live.

<p>Yes it is simple, but the requirement is that the email had to be put on BEFORE you lost access. At this point if you could change the email it's being sent too then a hacker could too. So since you've never had to sign in after your son on account.live.com
 or when he changed his privacy and online settings that means you created him an adult account. You just put your information in when it asked (at account creation), or your dob? If you can't do anything on account.live.com, but you can sign in, right? So
 you sign in, it says it looks like someone else is using your account, get the code we sent you at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** right? And you can't get that? So to unblock your MS account you can do two things, the best is that stupid form after selecting "I
 can't use any of these options" your going to fail, I know it's very email based questionaire, it doesn't matter. This form is required to get help from Xbox support. Do it a few times for that MS account, if you have another child do it for theirs too if
 you are having problems. Then call support next to the console and they can escalate for a password reset provided you can prove ownership (i.e there's a name, address, phone, security question, and/or cc on file). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other method of unblocking the MSA is going to windows.microsoft.com signed into your own MSA. Then in their search bar put "Account Blocked" and then select "My outlook.com account is blocked" then it'll ask you to select your issue "it looks like someone
 else is using your account" because that's your issue. It'll bring you to a page outlining the steps, first of course is signing into account.live.com which I know you can't. Then after that it says "Contact Support" you select that and it'll bring you to
 a different form to fill out but it's easier, it just asks what happened, what's wrong, what account are you trying to get into. That way you can attack it from both ends.

<p>no it seems it is not so simple, this was the response I got today, it seems you do what support tells you to do and they wont unlock the account.</p>
<p>Your security is important to us</p>
<p>Recently, we received several requests to gain access to <b>[Mod Removed]</b>. Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your ownership using the information that was provided. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are
 committed to protecting your personal information, and our careful account recovery process is intended to protect you from any possible malicious activity.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Because there have been multiple unsuccessful recovery attempts for this account, we recommend at this point that you create a new account. It's quick and easy, and we have tools to help you import contacts, connect with Facebook, and even receive messages
 from multiple email accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; Open a new account</p>
<p>With a new account, you’ll be able to use the following services across all of your devices:</p>
<p>Best-in-class email with unlimited storage at lightning speed and serious security.</p>
<p>Stay connected with friends and family, see social updates and chat with Facebook friends, and make ordinary moments memorable with video calls.</p>
<p>Free online storage for thousands of docs and photos, shared your way.</p>
<p>Don’t get locked out again</p>
<p>Once you create a new account, we highly recommend you update your password reset information with a phone number or alternate email address. This will make it easier for you to gain access to your account in the future if you are locked out again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; Open a new account</p>

<p>I need help with pairing/syncing a Bluetooth headset to a Windows 7 laptop. I don't see in my Control Panel a place for a Bluetooth device, but I found in my BIOS setup screen that I can turn the Bluetooth feature on. Does that mean I have an adapter already
 built in to my laptop? How can I pair/sync it to my laptop?</p>

<p><span>Hi Gamerchic82,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To add the Bluetooth headset, you can follow these steps</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start and the Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Now
 click on View Devices and Printers under Hardware and Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure Wireless is enabled on the laptop and turn the Headset on.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Make sure that your Bluetooth is ON. Your laptop

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your PC &amp; rerun the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, try to make the following changes:</p>
<p>A. We suggest that you turn on <strong>automatic updates</strong> using the link below as your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update: FAQ.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>B. Make sure that the <strong>Windows Installer </strong>service is not disabled:</p>
<p>1. In the <strong>Search </strong>box, type <strong>Services</strong>.</p>
<p>2. From the search results, click on <strong>Services </strong>to run the app.</p>
<p>3. Look for <strong>Windows Installer</strong> and make sure that the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
startup type</span> is not <strong>Disabled</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10c7936c-61c9-4e7b-8e4c-2c0431c5fa40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10c7936c-61c9-4e7b-8e4c-2c0431c5fa40" height="199" width="607" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After making the changes, run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter again to see if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Rolando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion - I've done this and still get the problem. Windows is still reporting an issue with a driver but all seems ok (see below screenshots)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to determine which driver/device it is referring to and I can then try uninstalling and reinstalling it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Did Windows prompt you to choose a path to save the scans?
<br />
<br />Go to File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; Pictures and see if you find something there.
<br />
<br />Take a look at this article too, please.

            Hi,
<br />If you used Windows Scanning utility, you would find them in the Pictures folder.
<br />If you have used an application of theirs, See the Settings where the Scan destination is configured.

<h2>            Super Street Fighter 4&#58; Arcade Edition Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>Since I can't find the proper place to post a question about SSF4AE, I guess I'll ask here...</p>
<p>In order to get every single new costume pack that was released for the game, what do I have to buy from the marketplace? Is it the "Super" and "Ultra" costume pack only, or is there more I have to buy? And will the new characters (Yun, Yang, E. Ryu, Oni)
 have new costumes?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Super and Ultra "complete" packs will give you all the costumes (1440 MSP each). &nbsp;You can also use the costume pack for Street Fighter IV with Super Street Fighter IV.</p>
<p>I believe that the new characters will get new costumes later.</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went on vacation leave for 1 month so I didn't open my computer for 1 month also, then I came back 3 days ago and this problem starts to pop-up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>"Windows</strong></span><strong> Update error 80072f8f" </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do exactly what the Windows Help and Support ask like checking the date and time, but didn't make any difference, I also run the
<strong>Windows Update Diagnostic </strong>and<strong> MicrosoftFixit</strong> as suggested also with no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 Professional with SP1, windows update is working with no problems prior to my vacation leave, problem only started after I came back.</p>

<h2>            Drivers update for Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030 on HP DM4-3099se</h2>
                    <p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I'm having a strange problem. &nbsp;Intel released new drivers to update&nbsp;from version 15.11&nbsp;to 16.11. &nbsp;I downloaded them from Intel website, ran install, success. When I go into Device Manager to check on the driver version, I see it is still 15.11. &nbsp;I have tried
 a number of things, including deleting the drivers from the Device Manager and running the install again. &nbsp;However, in this case Windows 8 automatically installs even older drivers, version 14, dated 2011. &nbsp;I'd like to try the new drivers because it takes
 very long for the net to comeback after I wake up my laptop. &nbsp;Version 15.11 was installed by Windows Update, those drivers are dated January 2014.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the device and drivers that you have recently installed, not getting updated.</p>
<p>This might be due to the pending Windows Update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first step, let us restart the computer and then try installing the driver updates and check if you are able to update or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s perform some steps to update all Windows update along with Optional Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong> Try updating <strong>Windows Update</strong> along with
<strong>Optional Updates</strong> if it is pending. It will help in increasing the performance of the computer.</p>
<p>Step 1. Press and hold <strong>Windows and X</strong> key simultaneously.</p>
<p>Step 2. Click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 3. In the search box, type <strong>Windows Update </strong>and click on it when prompts.</p>
<p>Step 4. Click on <strong>Check for Updates</strong> .</p>
<p>Step 5. Try installing all pending updates including Important and Optional Updates.</p>
<p>Step 6. Restart the system after that and check.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter.
</span></strong><span>The troubleshooter is intended to automatically detect the issues and apply the necessary fix.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press
<strong>Windows key + X</strong> and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>In the
<strong>search</strong> box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></li><li>In the Troubleshooting window, from the left side listed options, highlight <strong>
View all</strong>.</li><li>Moving on, in the same window click <strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> in order to launch
<span>
Windows Update Troubleshooter. If it asks for Run as Administrator, click to proceed further.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Once the troubleshooting has been completed, click
</span><strong><span>Close.</span></strong></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Restart the Computer so that changes can take effect.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p>After performing the steps, try installing the new Intel drivers and check the driver updates in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it can resolve the issue. If the issue persists, please reply us we will be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

 for his account.&nbsp; I have even reached out to Microsoft support was told that someone will&nbsp;get&nbsp;ahold of me by email to help correct the issue and all I got was an email telling me that I needed to pay them for a year's worth of system service in order to get
 help with this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Best to perform a Custom /Clean install of XP. Never can tell what unwanted (like viruses) may exist.</p>
<p>1) Jot down the make and model of your computer.</p>
<p>2) Verify the 25 character product key is still affixed to the case or bottom of&nbsp;a laptop.</p>
<p>3) Go to the manufacture's support web site and find out which "F" key you need to press when booting the computer to initiate a reinstallation of XP (or use the Recovery Media if you have it).</p>
<p>4) Reinstall XP and create a new user account. Note: If using the "Recover" CD media you will need to reenter the product key to activate Windows.</p>

<h2>            groove music is fairly useless and unreliable Lets get windows to go back to making windows media player fully function in windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Since loading windows 10 I cannot reliable trust groove music. It &nbsp;loads and unloads at will (at present it says it is uploading 160 tracks but it has nothing in it even though I loaded over 26000 this is a regular occurrence and it seems to have a lack
 of user control.</p>
<p>I was very good with the windows media player I could change where files were, putting them in my own folders and moving track with ease to form my own albums or play lists, change and edit tabs etc to ensure that say CSNY, CSN &amp; Y, csny, Crosby Stills Nash
 and Young, all end up in the same place.</p>
<p>No such facility with Groove.</p>
<p>Please lets get rid and get back to a workable windows media player for windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Geoffrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's determine why Groove Music is not working smoothly on your computer. Please answer these questions for us to understand this better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you encounter any error messages when using the app?</li><li>Have you tried checking for updates through Windows Update?</li><li>Was Windows Media Player removed from your computer after upgrading to Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>We suggest you check if there are any updates available for Groove Music in the Windows Store. You can go to this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/groove-music/9wzdncrfj3pt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">page</a> using your computer to
 check if there is an available update for the app.</p>
<p>You can also go <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14209/get-windows-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to download Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help.</p>

            <p>In terms of its capabilities I'm completely with you... WMP is still the better option although sadly MS seems to have completely lost interest in improving it. You should still be able to use it in much the same way as always on W10 though (apart from playing
 DVD).</p>
<p>Having said that Groove should function correctly too (even if we don't much like it!) - Have you tried a reset? This is an option that is easily missed but it can correct problems...</p>
<p>Go to Settings - System - Apps &amp; Features... when the list has populated select Groove and 'advanced options' and you'll see the reset button. Try that and see if performance improves.
</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to look more closely at WMP. - Cheers, Ric.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Heres an interesting one.</p>
<p>I just uploaded an album direct from cd. groove shows all but one track correctly but fails for some reason to put track two in the same folder?&nbsp;</p>
<p>while it seems trite if this happens on a regular basis then how can you trust the system. In windows media player if this happened I could find the error in the track information and edit it to put it back in the correct folder.</p>
<p>I spent a considerable amount of time doing this with music from various sources but all my edits seem to be undone by groove music.</p>
