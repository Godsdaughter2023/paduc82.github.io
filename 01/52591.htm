<h2>            UPDATE FOR WINDOWS 10 KB4074590</h2>
                    <p>Received message that above update installed, hit install and screen read:</p>
<p>"Working on updates 2%</p>
<p>Don't turn off your PC. This will take a while.<br />
Your PC will restart several times"</p>
<p>It has been at 82% for 24 hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happened the last time - 36 hours - and I eventualll switched off. When I rebooted, it told me the update had not been successful and it was reinstalling previous version of WORD 10! I therefore do not want to shut down now it is stuck at the 82%
 mark again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully I have a tablet with which to post my question. VERY FRUSTRATED as computer itself is totally unusable at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved from: Windows / Windows 10 / Install, upgrade, &amp; activate </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time frame to complete the installation of an update is dependent on factors like the capacity of the device and size of the update. An issue with the update components of your device and/or broken system files may cause errors during download and/or
 installation process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the details that you've shared, we'd recommend to let your device work on the installation. There are situations that it may look like it froze on a certain percentage although background processes are still completing a task. We can conclusively
 say that the installation has stalled or failed is when the computer presents an error message or stop code. When this happens, the device is expected to revert to the previous iteration of Windows 10 that is installed on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once reverting is complete, we'd recommend running the <a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update Troubleshooter</a> to find and fix related issues. Refer to the steps below on how to use it.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download the&nbsp;Windows Update Troubleshooter</span><span>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>O</strong></span><strong>pen</strong>
<span>in the pop-up window.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong><span>&nbsp;and follow the steps in the wizard to find and fix problems with Windows Update</span><span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>To maximize the software isolation process, we'd recommend performing the steps
</span><span>below to reset the Windows Update components:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong><em>Search</em></strong> box, type <strong><em>cmd</em></strong>, right-click the result and select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>.</li><li>Once the <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em> starts, copy and paste the following commands and press
<strong><em>Enter</em></strong> after each line in order to run it:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>SC config wuauserv start= auto </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>SC config bits start= auto </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>SC config cryptsvc start= auto </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>SC config trustedinstaller start= auto<br />
<br />
</strong></em></li><li>Once done, restart your device to apply the changes and try to install the <em>
<strong>Windows Update</strong></em> again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Resetting Windows Update components is a known fix for issues involving slow and/or stalled processes during installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after you've performed the steps.</p>

<p>I will wait a further 12 hours overnight and if it hasn't moved from the 82%, I will shut down, reboot, wait for the return to previous edition to complete and then follow your installation and steps. I thank you and will advise of the outcome.</p>

            Tried the troubleshooter, even though it didn't conform to your directions, without success. Then tried your second directions and had just completed when usual Update advice notice came up, so I chose restart and now have black screen ... been that way
 one hour so now going to turn power bar off as no alternative. So frustrated and angry! What do I do NOW?

<p>Thank you for updating us. The behavior of your device after after performing the commands are unusual.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To maximize our isolation process, we'd recommend performing an in-place upgrade to overwrite the existing configuration of your computer with default settings. This essentially eliminates multiple factors such as corruption and broken system files. To do
 this, you can perform the steps posted by <strong>PaulSey</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">
link</a>. We've also created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWh0YRmnT8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
YouTube video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/9BWh0YRmnT8?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/9BWh0YRmnT8?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> for you to provide you with additional visuals on how to complete the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This process will use an ISO to install Windows 10. You'll have an option to keep your files so you're assured that there will be no unnecessary data loss. Once this process is complete, you're device will have all the updates installed including KB4074590.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>

<p>Tried both recommendations. Got so far and screen went black for approximately 8 hours. Switched off! Rebooted this morning and it immediately started updating and has now frozen ... again at 82%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think my only option&nbsp; now is to shut down, allow it to revert to previous version of Windows&nbsp; 10 and then go in and reactivate WINDOWS 7 option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now followed directions from two responders, both also froze at 82% and I am thoroughly frustrated and fed up. Have been without the use of my desktop for almost two weeks Because of this evidently WINDOWS glitch with update 2018-02.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting an update. Based on the results that you've shared, we'd recommend performing a clean install of Windows 10 to fully isolate software issues. This essentially wipes data on your hard drive, leaving no trace of corruption and will start
 your device as fresh when it's completed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To guide you in completing the process of performing a clean install, we'd recommend checking the post of
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Since this will remove/delete data on your computer, we'd recommend backing up your files to secure them prior to initiating the process. To do this, we'd recommend performing the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I eventually had a chat session with Microsoft, who did an updated re-install only to have the same&nbsp; freeze-up. Seems my system is no longer compatible with current updates ... so updates option has been cancelled and my computer will continue as is until
 I replace it. Thanks for your help and suggestions

<p>Thank you for reaching back to us. We've exhausted isolation steps specifically targeting the software aspect of the device. If the clean install process that we've recommended above didn't suffice, we'd recommend engaging the manufacturer of the device
 to look further into its hardware aspect (compatibility and performance). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Should there be any progress or new items that were defined by the manufacturer that relates to the software, please let us know so we can facilitate it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update on your concern.</p>

Choose "advanced keyboard settings"<br />
<br />
Choose "language bar options"<br />

In the menu bar above, choose "advanced key settings"<br />
<br />
Then choose : "Press the SHIFT KEY"<br />
<br />
Then APPLY and OK

            <p>Hi Teajay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know – when using the Canadian Multilingual Standard Keyboard, does this happen with all the
<span>&nbsp;</span>keyboard layout that you select from the “<strong><em>Control Panel &gt; Language</em></strong>” or is it only with the Canadian Languages (English (Canada) and French (Canada))?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a Canadian Multilingual Standard Keyboard, the “<strong><em>Right-CTRL</em></strong>” key has a different functionality as compared to the “<strong><em>Left-CTRL</em></strong>” key. It is used with the combination of other keys to produce special characters.
 For example; when pressed with the letter “<strong><em>P</em></strong>” it gives the special character “<strong><em>?</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. If you need any further assistance, please get back to us and we’ll be glad to assist you with it.</span>

<p>I recently got a new PC, I upgraded from a Microsoft Surface Pro 2 to a desktop PC. I haven't been able to install any programs I've had before on my new computer. My Surface tablet ran Windows 10 Pro &nbsp;and so does my new machine. I haven't had this issue
 before on the tablet. &nbsp;I'm trying to install Lego Digital Designer 4.3 and Itunes 11.6 but Windows won't install. They're both from legitimate sites and I don't know what to do. I'm really frustrated...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jackson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reading the description that you provided,&nbsp; we may need to take more steps for us to resolve your concern about installing programs due to incompatibility in Windows 10. To start with, we suggest that you perform a clean boot to the computer. Clean Boot
 temporarily disables all third party applications as well as all Microsoft non-essential services so only basic drivers will run. This will help us find any third-party software which can be the cause of this issue. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, search for <strong>msconfig</strong>.</li><li>Select<strong>&nbsp;System Configuration</strong>&nbsp;from the search results.</li><li>On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong>&nbsp;check box, and then tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Disable all</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click Open&nbsp;<strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in <strong>Task Manager</strong>, for each startup item, select the item and then click&nbsp;<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Close <strong>Task Manager.</strong></li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes and feel free to get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>

    <title>People app - how to show last name first in list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> labromaniac  say:</h3>
<h2>            People app - how to show last name first in list</h2>
                    <p>My people list at Outlook.com in a regular browser lists my contacts last name first, then first name such as: "Jones, Bob".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My people app on my Surface pro does not seem to allow me to show the contacts this way. Settings &gt; options will allow me to order the contact list by last name but I cannot seem to find a way for the list to also show the last name first as on my outlook.com
 site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes it so hard to look up names on long lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help me solve this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Sorry, you can't make it show up first.&nbsp; You can order it by like name as you found, but it won't show up first.&nbsp; Be sure to send feedback from the app (open the Settings pane to do that) to request this feature to be added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can always use your more familiar contact list apps you used before you got Windows 8.&nbsp; That might be Outlook or something else, but whatever you used before will still work now.</p>

                    The mouse I have been using for over a month now for some reason no longer works after I dropped it. The problem is I've dropped it before and didn't have this problem. I checked to see if the batteries were dead or if the usb had something wrong with
 it, but neither of those had worked and I don't know what the problem is. Its a Wireless Optical Polaroid Mouse, Model No. PCA10 I'm running Windows 10 on a ASUS Laptop.

<p><br />
Do you have an email client installed, ie. like Windows Live Mail or Outlook or Thunderbird or whatever? Windows 7 does not include a built-in email client like XP did.</p>
<p>If you have Windows Live Mail (for example)&nbsp;installed you can create the email then click the
<strong>Attach file</strong>&nbsp;icon.</p>

<p>You can also navigate to the folder your Word document is in, right click on the file and select
<strong>Send to &gt; Mail recipient</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don't have an email client installed look at downloading Windows Live Mail 2011 (free). Only select Mail from the selection of essentials programs.</p>

<p>If you choose a different email client like Outlook 2010 ($$$) or Thunderbird (free) for example the procedures are similar.</p>
<p>To select the default program...</p>

<h2>            KB4041676 shows &#34;Requires a restart to finish installing&#34; even after many restarts</h2>
                    <p>In the update history on one company laptop, update "2017-10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4041676) Requires a restart to finish installing." All of my other systems say "successfully installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran SFC, tried updating Nvidia drivers to see if it would cause it to check, downloaded the Windows Update troubleshooting tool and I even tried downloading the update manually and running but it said it was "already installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking I should try to uninstall it and retry the manual. Any other ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>May have answered my own question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the update and rebooted. Still showed the update (in history) as "requires restart" but, after automatically checking Windows Update, asked to run the install for KB4041676 again. So, I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now a second entry for KB4041676 appears in the history and shows "successfully installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is all good now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's because they have no clue how to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They provide unhelpful information like using W7 and W8 fixes, which don't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Perhaps this will help some of you that have this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this same problem after I removed a Windows 10 machine from my company's AD Domain and enrolled the machine in the Windows Insider Program to get the pre-release Win10 Anniversary Update. After enrolling in the fast ring and waiting for a few hours,
 the update downloaded and installed. After rebooting, I went into Windows Update and saw
 My company has a WSUS server to manage Windows Update. It appears the registry entry wasn't reset when the machine was removed from the domain and the GPO that controlled the WSUS settings was&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">removed.<br />
<br />
Here are steps that I took to fix this:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. In regedit, go to: "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate".
 In my case, I had WUServer and WUStatusServer reg values which pointed to my company's WSUS server. Also under the AU key, the UseWUServer value was set to 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Delete "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate".
 Export it first just in case this doesn't fix your problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3. In the Services.msc MMC snapin, stop the "Windows Update" and "Background&nbsp;Intelligent&nbsp;Transfer Service". Then restart both of them. (I'm
 not sure if BITS really needed to be restarted, I just do it out of habit).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>4. Go back to Windows Update in Settings and press the Retry button. In my case, Windows connected to Windows Update and pulled down a Windows
 Defender signature file. Success!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
YMMV. Best of fortune to you.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<div><span>I Have had this BSOD happen twice yesterday and once today. I do not think that the things that I was doing on the computer to cause the BSOD is related. Once was when I was on a web page, one happened when I shut the laptop lid for a few minutes,
 and once when I was playing online POGO games (does not use that much resources). Last night my dad tried to resolve it by running a disc check and not to sure what else and must have erased the other minidumps. So attached is the last two files.</span><br />

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have not done most of the steps, It was not going into sleep/hibernate, I dont have a AMD chipset, &nbsp;I did restore it before and checked if I have the latest drivers while the blue screen issue was happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I have not got the BSOD for a few days now. It must have been the WLAN antenna frayed and grounding out. &nbsp;I will post if anything happens but it seems all is good for now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

                    <p>I didn't see anything like this in the search but figured someone knew the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking to buy a 2nd console for our home but wanted to know how the game titles would work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all of the games (gold or not) are under my account which is also the gold account.&nbsp; The other accounts are all part of the family grouping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>So how do the titles work on the 2nd console if we buy one?&nbsp; My account will be on it but it wouldn't be the 'home' console.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Will the kids be able to still play the games that are licensed under me if they play on the 2nd console (gold and not)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Will they get the gold benefits (playing online) of my account on the 2nd console as well?</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, there are forum listings about NAT issues with multiple consoles but they are older.&nbsp; I'm assuming the S / X won't have issues like this or is it still there?</p><p><br /></p><p

            <p>Smwutches gave a good description of how it works. I game share with my wife. I am the Gold member and she does not have Gold. In order for her to be able to play any games (since we buy digital, all under my account) she has to be logged into her profile, which is signed into my 'Home' Xbox One. If memory serves, anyone who plays on my home Xbox will have access to my games and XBL.</p><p><br /></p><p>I play on her 'Home' Xbox One S and I have access to all of my digital content and XBL. It only works this way for digital titles. Not sure what's going on with the disc title, but it shouldn't happen with digital as long as you have the Home consoles set up properly. If you have your Home consoles properly set, you should only need to purchase one digital title with the account that has Gold and anyone logged into their own profile on the Gold owner's Home Xbox should have access to all digital content owned by that account. Something else you may want to keep in mind is that anytime you happen

            No, VLC does not have that option.<br />
<br />
The freeware Format Factory has a Video Joiner <br />
option that will join the files very quickly and may be <br />
worth a try.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup280.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag FFSetup280.exe out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />
Next...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Once installed...open Format Factory...in the left<br />
pane...choose...Advanced / Video Joiner...<br />
Left click the Add File button and import your video<br />
clips. Choose an output format and left click OK.<br />
<br />
Left click the Start button on the toolbar and your <br />
video files will be combined.<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

<div>I did not make any changes to my PC&nbsp;.</div>
<div>Only normal automatic update from Microsoft.</div>
<div>This problem is intermittent. This morning it took four goes to get it to open up correctly.</div>
<div>I shut&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;down and have just&nbsp;switched it on and it has loaded up as it should.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The message&nbsp;is "windows found a problem and needs to close."&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I remove my&nbsp; Incredimail and reload it I will loose all my email's and contacts.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards Alan Tyler</div>

            <p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see this error message "windows found a problem and needs to close", when that particular application stop responding in middle. Since the problem is happening only with

IncrediMail </strong>application files. However I see that <strong>IncrediMail </strong>
developer's team have claimed that the <strong>IncrediMail 2.5</strong> is&nbsp;fully compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for any available update for <strong>IncrediMail </strong>and try to update&nbsp;it&nbsp;to see if fix the issue.&nbsp;If the problem still appears, then please get in touch with
<a href="http://support.incredimail.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>

<p>This did not help me.&nbsp; I even uninstalled the old and reinstalled the 2.5 and it opens but everything is frozen.&nbsp; Can't click into any emails or folder or menu at the top.&nbsp; IncrediMail support referred me to a third party fix man to fix the issue between
 M/S Windows 10 and Incredimail by remote accessing my computer to fix the issue then wants to charge me $99 to fix.&nbsp; Very afraid to do this.&nbsp; Is there no one at M/S that can walk me through fixing this compatibility issue??&nbsp; Have tons of emails and folders
 in IncrediMail that I can not access!!!!&nbsp; Please someone help!!</p>

            <p>I have 3 computers, one on Win 7 and the other two on Win 10. Incredimail crashes every time I try and open it on Win 10 computers - but remains OK with Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the recommended temp fix suggested by Incredilmail, but that doesn't not work. Have uninstalled Incredimail 2.5 andre-installed to no avail. Have back-ups on remote hard drives for all emails - have tried using them in the "restore" process. That
 doesnt work either. Still crashes. &nbsp;Very very inconvenient!!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I may have found the solution. By uninstalling Windows Security update KB3132372 dated 30 Dec, both Windows 10 Computers now allow me to use Incredimail. Hope it works for you.&nbsp; Graeme.</p>

<h2>            how do I get rid of an unwanted pop-up window on my desktop-it is not in my control panel</h2>
                    I keep getting a pop-up window showing weather on my desktop. I went into the site hoping to get rid of it. They wanted personal information so I got out of it. I tried again and was told to go into the control panel programs features and uninstall there.
 They are NOT in there. Then I sent them an email telling them to "get the **** out of my computer". I received an email from today telling me the same thing. (control panel). They have more than one site address which are the following. tribalfusion.com, mindspark.com,
 weatherblink.com. The one that shows on the weather pop up is tribalfusion.com. They may have other ones too, I don't know. I want them gone, but I am not able to get rid of them. Please help me. I already used the Microsoft Safety Scanner ( on the quick scan)
 and it came up clean. Should I do the full scan??

<h2>            GTA 4 Autosave On X-Box One S</h2>
                    when I try to auto save I am prompted to sign in and then download my profile. However, I am already signed in, so what profile would I be downloading? Also, when I press the start button during the auto save dialogue there is a brief moment when the screen
 presents other options regarding selection of storage devices, but I am unable to access them. All this leads me to being unable to access auto save or save via the safe house. What can I do?

<p>

            I have follwed your advice and still no success. Now I must investigate my network connection. After I select "download profile" I am presented with a "checking network connection", and it then says it failed to connect to X-Box live even though I was
 able to remove my profile and sign back in immediately after. I am able to connect to my mobile broadband on my Lumia 950 and download games at 6-8 MB/s. I did a series of network tests and it said there was an "MTU, NAT, and UPnP problem." When I did an advanced
 network test it said: MTU, 1358; packet loss, 0; signal strength, 100; download speed, 38 Mbps. Sometimes my NAT is open, other times it is moderate. How would I address this issue? Is it GTA 4, my X-Box One S, my Lumia 950? I miss the days of the N64 and
 Mega Drive.

<p>Hey Godzilla thanks for keeping us informed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the persistent issue however none of the steps posted above mess with the connection to the internet or Xbox Live. What we believe is happening is to use the save feature (cloud saves) the console needs to be connected to the internet and
 the console at the moment is having trouble doing so as per the Network Stats provided. We suggest looking into
<a href="https://portforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Port Forwarding</a> with the ISP since they are better equipped to look into the Network Hardware settings. Give it a shot and keep us in the loop of how it goes!&nbsp;</p>

            Is being connected to the internet, and connected to Xbox live the same thing. I went on to the Xbox live website, via edge on the Xbox, and logged in and then tried to play GTA 4, and the same problem happened. GTA 4 could not connect to Xbox live in
 order to download a profile. A profile that I am already signed in with and using.

<p>Couple things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure you password is not longer then 16 characters the 360s including the emulator on the Ones do not like passwords longer then 16 characters. So if you password is longer then 16 characters you would need to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; A. Load the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; B. Hit the start and select buttons (small round buttons on either side of the big xbox button on controller) at same time</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; C. The 360 guide will pull up there should be a choice of download profile there click on it and enter in your email and password. You may need to hit the Y button to sign in first.</p>

<p>Hey Godzilla thanks for keeping in touch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short answer, no, being connected to the internet isn't the same as Xbox Live:<span>With Xbox Live Gold, you get multiplayer gaming, free games, game discounts, and more. And on Xbox One, share your Gold benefits with everyone on your home console.
 This is a paid subscription. To further troubleshoot this we need a bit more information, does the account in question have an Xbox Live Gold subscription? Is the console connected to the internet? What are the Network Stats on the console (to check this go
 to Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network Settings&gt; Test Multiplayer Connection) Let us know so we can get this figured out and you back to gaming!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hey there Godzilla!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to save GTA 4. Please don't squish my house.</p>
<p>Now if the aforementioned troubleshooting steps don't work. Try redownloading your profile from inside the Xbox 360 emulator itself. Launch an Xbox 360 game (like GTA) and when it brings it up, press the
<strong>menu</strong> and the <strong>view</strong> buttons on your controller (the ones to the right and left of the guide button). That will bring up the 360 guide. From there, go to
<strong>Settings&gt; System Settings&gt; Storage&gt; Memory Unit&gt; Profiles </strong>and delete your profile. Once you've done that, press "<strong>x</strong>" to download your 360 profile from Xbox Live with your email and password.
</p>
