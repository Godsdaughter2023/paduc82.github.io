<h2>            Annoying default mail popup</h2>
                    I've had a new Windows 10 HP laptop for a few weeks now and I constantly (about once a day) get this annoying popup that states I need to set my default mail app. Right now I have it set as Google Chrome but I guess it doesn't like that (I use gmail for
 email, not anything Microsoft). Is there any way of eliminating this popup from constantly reappearing?

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to set a default email application in order to prevent the pop-up message from showing up. For steps on how to change the default programs in Windows 10, click this

            Thanks, I understand how to set a default mail app, but I thought I already did. I have it set to Google Chrome, but I guess that's not considered an app. What "app" do people set it to if they use Gmail?

<p>To further isolate your concern, try to set either Mail or Outlook as the default email application. If the issue persists, there's a possibility that a third-party application is triggering the error message. Therefore, we suggest performing a clean boot.
 This method helps to eliminate conflicts between applications or services by starting Windows using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. To do so, follow the steps provided on this

<p>I am guessing that the problem stems from the fact that my Office 365 license does NOT include Outlook and I mistakenly launched it when I first had the laptop.</p>
<p>I typically use Thunderbird which I have used for many years but I tried setting Mail as the default.</p>
<p>The annoying message pops out soon after startup or logging in and then at intervals after that.</p>
<p>Task manager shows the task as COM surrogate (32 bit) - dllhost.exe</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Console &#38;amp&#59; its Accessories Are Plagued by Problems &#38;amp&#59; Issues, &#38;amp&#59; There is NO Accountability Held at Microsoft.</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong><span>This is my real experience with the short time frame in which the Xbox One has been available.<br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>If you are part of the Xbox community and you find yourself struggling in the same manner that i am or worse, or maybe you only have had to replace just a controller
 or two, please comment, add your own personal experience, call them, send letters or express your frustration during a "live chat", i have done all of these things and i can not get one answer from anyone.<br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Its highly doubtful, but i figure the more that people complain and demand accountability, maybe some day we will get help or compensation for these problems
 that just don't seem to go away.</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><br />
</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>Dear Microsoft, it is with great regret that I have to go to this extent to inform you of the constant &amp; consistent issues I have experienced with my Xbox One console. I would like to not just get a response from a general customer service representative,
 but would like to get a response from someone in a management position, who can help identify a corrective action is order to support my issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have been a member of Xbox Live under one gamer tag for over 11 years and a different gamer tag for a couple years prior, so pretty much since Xbox Live went live. I started with Counterstrike and eventually took a liking to the Rainbow 6 series and the
 competitive game play that they offered and branched off from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have owned not only the original Xbox, but have at home 2 of the 5 Xbox 360’s that I have purchased over the span of that consoles popularity, now I own an Xbox One Kinect console, which happens to be the centerpiece of my living space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have experienced the “red ring of death”, I have been compensated for issues, I have had warranty fixes, I feel I have been treated fairly. But over the course of the last couple years and the problems that have plagued my Xbox One console, I think it’s
 only right that someone is held accountable for a defective product/products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My console started off working fine for most of its 1<sup>st</sup> year, towards the end, it would not read discs without having to eject &amp; insert multiple times and eventually did not read discs at all, along with making loud grinding noises, we decided
 it was best to send it in for repair. We then came to find out that the manufactures warranty expired 10 days earlier, but Microsoft granted us a 30 day grace period and picked up the repair costs, I was more than grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Great, now that’s fixed, let me elaborate on all the current &amp; ongoing issues we have experienced regularly since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have had 2 controllers with the left thumb stick going bad, causing gameplay to drift to the left without touching it. I have relinquished ownership of these 2 controllers to private parties under auction, with full disclosure that they may be defective
 and have purchased replacements for both. With the thumb stick issue set aside, I have owned now 5 controllers, purchasing 4 of them, all 5 controllers will randomly and regularly disconnect from the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As of recent, my new Halo Master Chief controller will disconnect &amp; when I reconnect, my headphones are not registered by the controller or the system. I get no volume &amp; no options for the headphones in the settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After trouble shooting I shut off the controller and turn it back on, in which it controls NO features what so ever and I have to shut off the console and attempt to re-sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have never been able to sync a controller using the sync buttons that are on the controllers and the console, I have always had to use a micro USB cable &amp; physically plug the controller into the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am constantly have to “hard reset” the console by holding/touching the power button until the console shuts off and then unplugging the power cord for 30 seconds, followed by plugging the power cord back in and restarting the console fresh. Most of
 the time this solves some issues and things work OK for a little while. I have done this twice in one sitting, but I never really have to do this more than a couple times per week in the past but more &amp; more as of recent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The consoles always seems to lag a little, switching from screen to screen on the dash board or when texting a message or typing in key words to do a search. It’s a minor irritant as compared to the full spectrum of issues I have experienced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The wireless connectivity was from time to time just horrible; I finally resolved that issue (but not after purchasing a new router) by hard wiring an Ethernet cord directly into the console from the router. Problem solved, I have since had very minimal
 issues with connecting to Xbox Live services since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have my console in a TV stand that is not enclosed and has plenty of room for airflow. I have a 2 terabyte external hard drive plugged into the console with all of my installed games, apps &amp; whatever else can be driven on the console, I have nothing installed
 on the internal hard drive except for the factory per-installed stuff. I chose to do it this way, because it heard that the console would perform better with less stored on the internal drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With everything that has been stated, at what point does the console become defective or a lemon, when does it become the manufactures obligation to correct the problem, who is held accountable, it shouldn’t be me . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have owned other consoles in the past built by your competition, but have always found Xbox to be my personal favorite, I would never switch platforms, even due to all these issues. I have spent thousands of dollars on your products for myself &amp; my family.
 I have also encouraged other people to do the same, in which some cases they have switched over or started fresh with Xbox &amp; Xbox Live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like a solution to my problem, whether it be a check made out to me in the amount that would be required to purchase a new console or a voucher that is redeemable for the full value of a new console at a local retailer or a replacement console that
 works properly sent to me or a temporary replacement console sent to me prior to me sending in my console for repairs at no charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I or my family shouldn’t have to be without my purchase (again) and not able to use it for 3 weeks, given the circumstances, that would be unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Again, under the circumstances, special exceptions should be evaluated and made on Microsoft’s behalf for the problems that plague some of the units and/or accessories that are defective and slip through the cracks and make it to the consumer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 03.21.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;-I send this January 19<sup>th</sup>, with the assurance that it would take 2-4 days to get a response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-After 4 days, I followed up with a live chat to customer service, I was assured that I would get an answer but it might take another week or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-After a couple weeks, I followed up again and was assured that upper management is aware of these issues and to give it time as my case very detailed and overwhelming that it will take a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-So I followed up last week, 03.17 or 16, almost 2 months later, I still can’t get an answer, I’m still getting the same response from customer service, but now recommended that I start sending letters. I was also given a phone number and a fax number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As the issue was stated above about the Halo Master Chief controller, it now is not registering headphones at all. I figured the controllers were warrantied for a year like the consoles, but come to find out it’s only a 2 month warranty and my option was
 to pay for the fix or to buy a new one, because I quote, “the Microsoft store is having great deals on console bundles &amp; accessories!” just trying to get me to spend more money on a defective item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Below is my ticket number for my original chat in which I had copied and pasted this document into the chat window for a customer service rep to forward to upper management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Please keep this ticket number: [<strong>Mod Removed</strong>]&nbsp;and I will personally give this chat transcript to our Manager.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 03.24.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;My other controller just randomly loses sync and was very difficult to re-sync, and since I cannot sync anything using the sync buttons (as stated above), I had to hard wire the controller to the console and navigate the dashboard selections until the controller
 finally registered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 04.03.16</span></p>
<p>Sunday night I was playing “The Division” and all of a sudden my TV goes blank and the console starts making a vibrating sound, I listened for a minute and called my wife over to listen and then it changed tones and made the noise louder and faster, I got
 up to shut it off and the power button did not respond so I was just about to disconnect the power cord from the back and it hard-reset its self on its own.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 04.04.16</span></p>
<p>Monday night I finished a game of “Pure Pool” and went to the dashboard to check something and the dashboard screen froze, but you could still hear the sounds made if you make selections, then the screen went black, no vibrating sounds this time, but the
 console turned back on and loaded the green Xbox loading screen which is usually a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also, I have yet to receive any kind of answer or communication from Microsoft on my initial ticket number [<strong>Mod Removed</strong>].</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 04.18.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Console kept dropping internet connection constantly, after hard reset of both the console and the router, I kept getting dropped. This lasted for hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update 04.19.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Picture displayed on my TV is no longer bright and colors are dull. Watched a video and noticed that the brightness was scaling up and down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update 04.20.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Gave up! But thanks to Game Stop offering a great deal, I traded my crappy, defective, lemon console in towards a new one and received a $200 credit, along with some of my old Xbox 360 inventory of games and a few Xbox One games, I was able to make up the
 difference and the new console only cost me $11. So we will see how long this one lasts. Oh, and I traded my crappy, defective, lemon Halo Master Chief controller with the console, so I was able to get rid of that and gain a new one that works properly in
 the process. So Game Stop is going to profit off of Microsoft’s mistakes and I hope the person that has to deal with the garbage that I parted with will give you guys as much push back as I am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The difference was immediate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Colors and graphics very sharp and bright.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Performance was beyond that of the old console by far, I forgot how nice it used to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Connectivity and online services were immediate &amp; seamless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Controller works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-No more loud fans or discs spinning at a light speed, no buzzing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How unfortunate that I have received no response from a company that is held in such high standards and dominates the market, I am truly saddened by the product and the service as it has always been my favorite “pass time” activity and it bothers me that
 the amount of time and money I have invested into your company obviously means nothing and has been brushed under the rug – so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With that said I look forward to working though and helping implement solutions that will make the Xbox gamer &amp; gaming community a better place to be and work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 04.25.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Controller for new console has randomly disconnected from console upwards of about half a dozen times already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: 08.02.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Head phone jack built into the new consoles controller no longer working, sending in to be replaced, but I have to spend my hard earned money to pay the shipping fees to send back a non-functioning Microsoft product. Retail stores don’t charge me to return
 broken or defective items, why does Microsoft?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also, I have yet to receive any kind of answer or communication from Microsoft on my initial ticket number [<strong>Mod Removed</strong>], from January 19<sup>th</sup>, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update 08.11.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Controllers, once again, are losing sync to the new console, very difficult to re-sync, sync buttons on the controller &amp; on the console do not work, I have never been able to get the buttons to work on either console I have owned (must be a negligence issue
 like the headphone jacks on the controllers). I have to use a micro USB to re-sync the controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update 09.08.16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Controller purchased last holiday season, not even a year ago, the left analog stick is not functioning properly and is the 3<sup>rd</sup> controller to do so and it is to the point that it is almost unusable. Not to mention that now I am out 2 controllers
 as I will be sending in the controller listed above from 08.02.16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is very frustrating as well as very unfortunate, this situation needs to be addressed and compensated ASAP, it is absurd that myself or anyone for that matter has to keep purchasing $60 controllers that do not work properly, how is it even LEGAL to
 sell a product that is clearly broken AND then charge people to replace them AND forcing them to pay the shipping charges.</p>
<p>Good business practice would be to accept responsibility for the re-occurring problem and next day ship 2 brand new controllers to me or whatever item to anybody, especially if the issue is known, persistent, vast and happens in under a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I honestly believe that the 2 month warranty on controllers is a shady business practice because Microsoft is aware of their problems with the controllers and they do not want to be held accountable for them breaking, therefore after 2 months they can ignore
 the customers problem and blow them off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And as stated over a month ago, I have yet to receive any kind of answer or communication from Microsoft on my initial ticket number [<strong>Mod Removed</strong>], from January 19<sup>th</sup>, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Nice customer service makes me proud to be a dedicated member of the Xbox community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>

<h3> orileystrikes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 15&#47;16 Disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I've already looked up the issue and found a few people saying something similar, so I know I'm not going crazy. I literally used Microsoft Word yesterday and as a writer, I kind of need it back pronto. The Office Suite was purchased at the same time as
 my ASUS laptop and I've never had a problem with it until now. A moment ago, I tried to open one of my documents only to find that the entire suite of programs was just gone. I've checked all of the data folders in the C and D drives. There is a folder where
 it used to contain all of the information, but the folder is basically empty. No applications, no templates, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a product code, it's been tucked away for so long I don't know where it could be. I've had it for years and now it's gone. How do I get it back?</p>

            It says Office is installed, but all of the actual programs have been deleted. When I click on Office to reinstall, it says that I have to do it through Office 365 and get a subscription. I'm not paying for something when I already own it.

            Hi ORileyStrikes,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. First see whether they are installed or not. To check this type Excel or Word or PowerPoint in Windows search and see whether they come up or not. If yes, they can be pinned by right clicking on them.
<br />
<br />2. Another way to check it - type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; See whether you have your Office listed here or not.
<br />
<br />3. Start Excel by double clicking any Excel file &gt; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; In Processes tab, right click on Excel &gt; Open File Location &gt; See whether Word.exe and Excel.exe and Powerpoint.exe and other MS Office product exe are there or not. If they are there, right click &gt; Create shortcut and pin the shortcut 
<br />
<br />4. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br />(it might ask for product key. Hence do it if product key is available)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<div><br />
Ok, I was struggling with this problem for a while, and THIS IS HOW I FIXED IT:<span>
</span>
<div><br />
<div>- I went to my <b>Libraries </b>(as suggested by a tech) and deleted my <b>Photo Library</b> by right clicking and hitting
<b>delete</b>. (NOTE: in this process you do not lose your photos, so don't worry.)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>- I then deleted my <b>Videos Library </b>the same way. THIS IS KEY. This was NOT suggested, but it is the only way this process worked for me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>- I then right clicked on <b>Libraries </b>over to the left and selected <b>
Restore default libraries. </b>(All photos and videos will be restored)</div>
<div><br />
<div>This took me hours of frustration, so I hope this helps.&nbsp;</div>

            This is a known issue in which the previously hidden recovery partition become visible. The solution is as follows<br /><br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter. To do this: <br /><br />1. In Cortana, type cmd and press Enter. Then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator. <br /><br />2. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter. <br /><br />3. Type list volume and press Enter. <br /><br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove. For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “E”, note the volume number for Drive E. <br /><br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. <br /><br />select volume &lt;volume number&gt; <br /><br />When typing this command, in place

    <title>Touchscreen Blocked by Group Policy Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> see2xu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchscreen Blocked by Group Policy Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So, I popped for a 32" touchscreen display (3M C3266PW) after enjoying my Win8 touchscreen laptop experience so much, and now have it working with my desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, in Connected Devices under Settings, the 3M MicroTouch Controller shows as "Setup Blocked by Group Policy".&nbsp; I'm not a member of a group, and I prefer to establish my own policies, thank you very much, MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I find on this site relates to typing "grpedit.msc" in the command line for Win7, but that isn't an option for me with Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any advice the user community might offer, or, better still, for MS to fix yet another nagging problem with the OS of the future. ;(</p>

<p>Hi Mellsabela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your Surface keyboard may stop working due to driver issues. Just to clarify, have you made any changes before the keyboard stopped working? Also, what troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? You can use the on-screen keyboard to type in the search
 box and reinstall the Surface cover driver as advised on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023473/surface-troubleshoot-your-surface-type-cover-or-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after reinstalling the driver, we recommend that you reset your Surface. For more info, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore or reset Surface</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update, and let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>
<p>

Regards.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you've already tried to reset your Surface and the keyboard still does not work, then the keyboad itself could be the problem. The easiest way to test is to try it on another Surface. If you know someone who has a Surface Pro 4, swap keyboards for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can take the keyboard into your local <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store</a> and have it checked. If you're outside the US, refer to the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>It just checks that every file is accurately written to the drive by making sure the file system's record matches the actual file (for example, that the logged file size and the actual size are the same).&nbsp; This takes a lot of time to read every file, which
 is why a CHKDSK process can take several hours (or more).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHKDSK scans are not necessary and should not be run unless your computer has a problem.&nbsp; The NTFS file system is a jounaling file system that is very resilient to errors and self-corrects as needed.&nbsp; It can handle delayed write failures and power outages
 and will schedule checks when necessary. In most cases, running a check on your own is just a waste of time (and unnecessary disk usage, which will shorten the life span of your hard drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can end it safely if you want, just press Ctrl-C together.</p>

<h2>            Random charges by &#39;Microsoft &#42;Xbox&#39;</h2>
                    <p>On my online banking statement, it says that I've been charged £11.99 by Microsoft *Xbox however on my microsoft payment history, no such payment took place so have I been billed wrongly or is my bank card being used by someone else.?</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>OK guys my other laptop fell from my little table onto my carpet a few months ago, and the screen was damaged in so much there was a black area
 top right, it wasn't to much of a problem as 98% of the screen was OK, and it was still working as it did, but seeing as the sound had packed up previously, I decided to get another&nbsp;</span><a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/?&amp;_nkw=refurbished+laptop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Shopping Link Added by SkimWords">refurbished
 laptop</a><span>, I've decided to save my pics and documents off the dropped laptop but when I powered it up all I've got is writing on the screen ! no
 sign of windows, and its telling me it cant find an operating system, does this mean the hard drive has packed up,? Its an HP probook 650G1 And the bottom cover just un-clips I have had a quick look to make sure there were no leads or plugs unplugged but that
 is all, I don't mind buying a new hard drive but does that mean I'd also have to purchase widows? I was using widows 7 on it and I am sure the recover &amp; and installation DVDs i have were for this machine ,&nbsp;</span>
<span>
<span>
&nbsp;I&nbsp; found a windows 7&nbsp; installation disc&nbsp; which after 3 attempts&nbsp; loaded&nbsp; &nbsp;selected&nbsp; rellevant&nbsp; language&nbsp; ,country and keyboard&nbsp; &nbsp; ok,&nbsp; but now its asking for&nbsp; drivers&nbsp; but the driver dvd I have is not for this machine</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;I purchased&nbsp; it&nbsp; refubished&nbsp;
 I was&nbsp; using&nbsp; windows 7&nbsp; &nbsp; but I cant remeber&nbsp; if it was originally&nbsp; windows 8&nbsp; which i didn't like so I might have&nbsp; got&nbsp; the classic look&nbsp; windows 7&nbsp; download from google.&nbsp; there is no pruduct key&nbsp; visible but there is a&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
Pro windows 8&nbsp; sticker on&nbsp; the bottom , so maybe its not&nbsp; recognising&nbsp; the&nbsp; windows 7 installation&nbsp; dvd&nbsp; I am trying&nbsp; ,&nbsp; the intel inside i5&nbsp; with hologram&nbsp; sticker is on the inside too the serial number&nbsp; &nbsp;for my machine is,&nbsp; 5CG428F4JG.&nbsp; if thats of any use&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have&nbsp; managed to find&nbsp; the bios section and have&nbsp; upgraded to 01.43&nbsp; &nbsp;25/01/2018, which has&nbsp; registered on the information page F1,&nbsp; and it has passed the hardware diagnostic check.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are able to install Windows 7 on your other refurbished computer, we recommend that you update the drivers using this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15054/windows-7-automatically-get-recommended-drivers-updates-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. We also suggest that you check the manufacturer's website of your machine and install the drivers if you'll encounter any issues updating the driver from the link given. On the other hand, we'd like to know the make and model of the other refurbished
 computer that you'll be using as a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>If it were mine, my first action would be to remove the hard drive. Then mount it in an external hard drive enclosure (you can buy these things fairly cheaply).&nbsp; Then hook the external drive up (USB) to a working computer.&nbsp; It is likely you will be able
 to then copy your data files from the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing is to run manufacturer's drive tester software to test the drive while connected to the working PC.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you will give me the model number of the drive, I will give you a link to the proper manufacturer's software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your data off.&nbsp; Determine if the drive is usable.&nbsp; Then try to install if it shows OK&gt;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 build 7600 says This copy of Windows is not genuine</h2>
                    
<p>I have been running Windows 7 on two desktop PC's (separate versions of Win 7). One crashed badly so I tossed it&nbsp;and I now have a laptop to replace it.&nbsp; The other desktop started to receive the message as above.</p>
<p>Both desktops were running with absolutely no problems with Win 7.&nbsp; Now this message....so I reinstalled the version of Win 7 from the crashed desktop&nbsp;onto my working desktop.....still getting the message.</p>
<p>I assume I wil need to contact Microsoft to deactivate the version of Win7 on my crashed desktop to enable activation on the working desktop?????</p>

<p>Microsoft's Response: Microsoft is committed to helping prevent software piracy, which often results in end users being the victims of software counterfeiters. Counterfeiters abuse product keys to create fake software packages and distribute these to the
 public. These packages are not licensed, do not have Microsoft support, and can also include dangerous malware and spyware.<br />
<br />
Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key to
 multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become
 non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to www.microsoft.com/geniune and follow the links provided to repair windows.<br />
<br />
Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory can
 secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.<br />

<br />
EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
If you have a similar PID, or your key is blocked and you want confirmation post a new thread with a report from the MGADIAG tool, download and run the tool, click copy and paste it in a new post here and Darin Smith from MS can verify your key for you. NEVER
 post your key, the report will suffice.<br />

<p class="contentCodeblock"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Original Post</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across the problem when I needed to install python on my computer for some school work but when I tried to install it I got an error message saying: "A program is already being updated" and I checked my task bar and I had no updates in progress or
 installations in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then got an error from my anti virus saying "Update failed, Update has detected running installation. Complete that installation before starting update". I then checked my windows update to find there are no updates in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to ask if there is anyway to see what is being updated currently and if there is away to stop all current installations of any programs to allow me to install things that have a higher priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p class="contentHeader1"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>How to Fix</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: that from what I have found its people who use AVG who have the problem but with other antivirus am guessing if you can fix the problem by reinstalling your antivirus after updating the other applications first or installing the other applications
 you want to update first</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you have AVG then contact AVG support and ask for the AVG remover tool (don't worry we will reinstall it again in a bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Now restart you pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Re-install AVG and now restart your pc again</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. AVG should be updated</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now go find the application(s) you want to install and install them</p>
<p>

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p>I am having a very similar issue.</p>
<p>I tried to install an application. It refused as it said there was an update running. I assumed it was a windows update and left the PC for a few hours.</p>
<p>When I came back the result was the same.</p>
<p>Incidentally I tried to update AVG and it refused, saying there was an update running.</p>
<p>After a search, I came across advice to uninstall AVG and reload.</p>
<p>AVG fails to uninstall, saying there is an update running.</p>
<p>That failed uninstall generates a heap of log files.</p>
<p>I have tried the troubleshooter options described above and they failed to find any problems.</p>

    <title>Toshiba Portege Touchpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianlparkinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Portege Touchpad </h2>
                    Vista updated my Toshiba Portege on the 15/16th October 2009. Since then my touchpad has not worked although an external USB mouse is fine. I have reloaded the touchpad drivers from the Toshba site but this has not solved the problem.<br />
Do you have a fix?<br />
Kind Regards<br />
Brian

<span><span>Hello BrianLParkinson,<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<span>
<p>
Since this issue that you are experiencing started after running Windows update, you can use the
<strong>System Restore Tool </strong>to restore the computer to an earlier point in time before this problem started.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
</span>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;Before you proceed please back up your data</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Start, type
<strong>system restore </strong>in the Start Search box, and then click <strong>System Restore
</strong>in the Programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the System Restore dialog box, click
<strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click <strong>Next.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to<span>&nbsp;
</span>experience the issue, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Finish.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If this is an update issue, the best way to fix this is to only apply your updates one at a time to determine which of the updates is causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>All Programs</strong> -&gt; <strong>
Windows Update</strong>, click <strong>Change Settings</strong> from the left menu. Select
<strong>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</strong>, click
<strong>OK</strong>. When you are notified to install a new update, from this window click
<strong>View Available updates</strong>, uncheck all updates and select one at a time, install it, restart your computer, test, and update again. Once you find the update either continue to skip it, or look it up at
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/</span></span></a></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can also post back with the Update KB Number you are having trouble with.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Please reply and let us know if your issue is resolved or if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Maximizing Longevity &#40;lifespan&#41; of console and accessories</h2>
                    
<p>I seem to have an issue with EVERYTHING related to video games (not just Xbox, but Playstation, too!) dying of old age in less than 2 years!! I don't play the games or use the consoles PERIOD for more than about 11 hours a week or less (average for adult
 gamers, I'm 31 btw, is 9 hours a week of games, considerably more if u count non-game use of the console, such as streaming video). Why do wild mountain lions and feral (feral means wild) domestic cats have longer lifespans than the consoles and the game software
 (both those feline species live about an average of 4 years in the wild, 12 years in captivity, gaming equipment kicks the bucket in less than half of the 4 years!).&nbsp; What the heck am I doing wrong?! I follow all the advice in instruction manuals and all the
 advice (that I can find) on manufacturers websites. I also stick to to a very strict policy of not leaving consoles on for more than 105 minutes in a row (shut down in less than 1 hour, 45 mins after turning them on/usage, NO exceptions. The time between these
 105minutes-or-less sessions of being used typically is anywhere from 5 or 6 hours to a couple days of being turned off entirely.&nbsp; Now accessories, like the controllers, battery packs, and both kinds of charging methods TAKE THE CAKE as for as short lives.
 I swear, I've seen house flies live longer than those things (6 month life expectancy for those insects). Same rules re: time on, time off.</p>

<p>I use all the consoles/handhelds I own for less than 11 hours a week COMBINED (including non-game use, such as movie streaming). They all croak in less than 2 years! If the number 31 confuses u, 31 is my AGE, not hours of use. Sorry about the bad grammar
 in original post regarding the placement of the number 31.</p>

    <title>IKEv2 Using Wrong Machine Certificate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe pitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            IKEv2 Using Wrong Machine Certificate</h2>
                    <p>I have two IKEv2 VPNs setup on my Surface Pro 4, both use Machine Certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two Machine Certificates on the device, one for each VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One works absolutely fine, however, the other sends the wrong certificate and as expected gets rejected. "IKE authentication credentials are unacceptable"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server sends a certificate request for the correct CA, </p>
<p>Windows sends certificate requests for its full list of trusted CAs, including the correct CA,</p>
<p>Windows then ignores the certificate requests and sends the wrong Certificate (i.e. the one for the other VPN).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the same machine certificate onto my Android Phone, using StrongSwan I can connect fine to both VPNs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to get Windows to respect the server's certificate requests and send the right certificate?</p>

    <title>no windows 10 icon on windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanfleege  say:</h3>
<h2>            no windows 10 icon on windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>I have updated my&nbsp;windows 7&nbsp;as much as I can. It tells me there are no more available updates yet I still do not have the windows 10 icon on my tool bar. I would like to upgrade but everytime I go to microsoft to try to find out why I can't it redirects
 me to a spanish page because I live in Mexico. I speak and read in English, sadly my Spanish is not good enough for me to understand technical terms. Any ideas if perhaps my windows being in English may be the cause of the lack of the windows 10 icon? Or any
 ideas on how I can get it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
