<h2>            Remember when people played for fun &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I do, I remember people playing simply for the fun of it, with some kind of fair play and just wanting an enjoyable time on the game.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly all I see are people trying to have some 1337 stats by an means.</p>
<p>Just some of the more underhand tactics that have developed so far;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two people working together in free for all games - An example in halo reach rumble pit, two people working together to kill enemies and in matches like King of the Hill and Oddball working together to defend so one person holding the oddball and hiding
 while the other defeends them, not a huge advantage you might think but when you're taking down one person who is meant to be defenceless having an armed person and unarmed one to deal with really changes the game. Another variation being in racing games where
 one person works to win while the other works to take other people out of the race and stop them challanging the lead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using map glitches - most common in COD games before patches people climbing under the map (or in team fortress 2 over it) to get to a spot where they can kill people but can't themselves be killed. Or on Monday night combat climbing round sections that
 aren't meant to be climbed to be able to perfectly shoot the enemy money ball from cover without being able to be hit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forcing people offline - using DDOs attacks on them, it happens and its not nice to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jamming timers - on Magic the Gathering there are various ways to stop the timer, people intent on winning at any cost will stop the timer then simply walk off meaning you can either try and wait them out or you can quit and be givne a loss</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quitting when losing - people seem to do this alot, the game looks lost so they simply quit (fair enough if they join the game in a state where they are losing as they aren't responsible for it getting to there) but people just up and leave the moment they
 are losing even by 1 point or worse still they wait till right before the end then quit on you. A much worse one happened to me a while ago playing GTA IV race, I was in a boat race 8 laps and every-one else but me and one guy had quit i was in second, after
 a bit I got a message saying "Please don't quit thanks in advance" I had no intention of quitting and messaged back saying "I'm here to the end" then on the last lap I pulled a damn fine move, overtook the guy and was racing for the line, he then quit because
 he wasn't going to win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ruining the other teams game - this happens on quite a few where a second person in the party will deliberately join the other team, TKing them or killing certain people, often destroying their equipment, this happens alot in Left 4 Dead when some-one has
 a split screen player, normally one will simply work to stop the other team winning rather than working with his team-mates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stacking the odds - Some games stupidly don't force balanced teams in these people will happily stack teams against players then throw a paddy because you won't let the game start with 8 people against 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camping - no I'm not on about people sitting there with machine guns in cover I mean the guys who can spend the entire game sitting round a corner with a shotgun simply 1 shotting people who come past, normally in such a spot grenades won't bounce round
 or with space the move/ hide from grenades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modding - super health, infinate ammo, no reloads, firing rockets insteals of bullets , you name it its probably happening some-where. Gone are the days when people modded to make cool levels or neat bits like the infamous goth Halo reskin, or the flying
 turret vehicle. People are just out to win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boosting - simply for a high spot on the leaderboards some people will do anything, a show of how bad this has become was the quake wars&nbsp; competition where the top so many on the leaderboard were invited with VIP quake con passes, unknown to people each
 match was recorded and the way points were earned was too. the top 100 people on the leaderboard all were found the have boosted and when they complained about not getting their invites were told they had boosted and didn't deserve them. The top person had
 apparently spent 36 solid hours in a split screen match with one controller on one side driving a tank up then using the other controller damanging the thing then one again repairing the tank, for 36 hours !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is what has cause this to become so rampant ?</p>
<p>Are these the people who if playing snakes and ladders would refuse to go down the snake or who "couldn't count properly", Are these the people who go "Its my ball i'm going home with it" because they aren't winning ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worse still is the main excuse given </p>
<p>"I Piad for the game i should be allowed to play how I want"</p>
<p>The Answer being so did every-one else and they don't want people spoiling the game for them, btu then again selfish people don't seem to give a damn about any-one else and the way the world seems to be going its teaching people more and more not the look
 out for any-one but number 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any-one else fed up with people ruining games simply so they can get a few more numbers ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>welcome to online gaming.....its never going to be perfect, especially in games which rely on competition between gamers to keep them playing. Dont like the online community of a game, dont play it or adapt your style accordingly. I have had more fun just
 playing the single player way of gaming Life since happily allowing my account to go silver and havent looked back once, I dont miss online gaming at all at the moment...I have taken myself out of the above!</p>

<p>Some people still play games for fun. &nbsp;I still play Halo 3 just for fun, and pretty much everyone i've played in big team recently have just been playing for fun rather than stats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find normally if i'm playing seriously and competitively i get annoyed when i don't do well so i just tried and ignore stats and all that rubbish. &nbsp;It doesn't mean anything to have a decent k/d or massive kill streak, etc but people think it matters and
 will cheat to get it just for bragging rights.</p>

<p>I play games for fun. So do a lot of people I know. I don't play Call of Duty to get prestieged. I got it at Christmas and am not even on prestige 1 yet. I like single player and multi player but I play for fun.
</p>
<p>Normally when I'm trying to be really competitive I just get really angry and just do terrible.
</p>
<p>My friend got all the achievments on Cod: WaW recently but he was in a modded match and asked the guy for them. He keeps saying "Oh come on, we'll search for a modded match". I keep saying "no I'll get them legitimately". I like getting achievments for a
 little bit of bragging rights but I like the fun of getting them! The endure achievment was a great chevo. the1337gamer, didn't I get that with you</p>

<p>The people constantly quoting their kill death ratios,win streaks or moaning about why the leaderboards have them in one place when they should be higher,it drives me mad ,just play the game.</p>
<p>but the biggest annoyance for me is the quitters on anything that one on one because they are going to lose and "stain" their record,fight night champion or the ufc games spring to mind,you lost get over it,its not the end of the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happened to me earlier. I was in a Manhunt match in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. I wondered why my team had lost so badly, then the next set of rounds I noticed how a member of my team and a member of the opposite were both standing up on a high roof
 just standing there. Then I noticed that no matter where or how I hid, the same guy new exactly where I was hiding.</p>
<p>I waited till about 30 secs before the end of the match, then snook up on the enemy and stunned him. The next round I was the hunter. So I made my target the guy who constantly took me out. I managed about 8 tills on him before the match ended. Once it had
 I quit and joined a Wanted match.</p>
<p>I got an invite from the "spy" on my team, wanting me to join his private match. I declined. I then got a message soon after saying "join or your a total ***". I blocked communications and went on to get on of my best scores ever. (About 7000, without bonuses)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens a lot in Infestation in Red Faction: Armageddon. Standard wave mechanics means kill or be killed. If someone isn't getting enough kills half way through the wave, they quit. If they get downed, they quit, if they bleed out, they quit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spawn camping happened a lot on Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The thing they seemed to forget though was the kill cam and the ability to spawn near team mates or in a different location. I remember this happening a lot on Ghost Recon also.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modders = Scum of the online gaming community. I don't care if you use it to gain advantage in single player but in multiplayer, you are just being a complete and total smeg for brains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for playing for fun. The only time I've experienced fun in online console gaming was on the Original Xbox. Mechassault 1 being the most fun.</p>

<p>I remember when the first Mods for Race Mode in GTA4 showed up, it totally killed the enjoyment of the game, best moment was when some guys car was so fast he would take off like a rocket but claimed he knew how to
<b>'boost start' </b>his only problem was his car was so fast he would crash on every corner &amp; we would all catch up to him. When I pointed out he had obviously increased his cars top speed but forgotten to increase the cars breaks or cornering ability the
 whole room started laughing at him so hard he quit after threatening to hack all are accounts.</p>

<p>Why I preffered xbox live on the original xbox you still go idiots but was a few percent where people would meet up and game and play to be competitive but enjoy at same time and actually talk, none of that seems to happen anymore, just people all out for
 self glory.</p>
<p>People put out the argument I bought the game i'll play how I want, thats fair enough but don't go into a community and ruin it for someone else, not like you go to a public event you payed for to act like an idiot and ruin for someone else.</p>
<p>Why there needs to be better game types and system matches implemented to be used, the only reason I like COD as they had a game type for chat its like why go into a game type which is tactical and not talk, just wonder my mind sometime.</p>

<p>Hello Klarenze28,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Computers, that are built by large manufactures, that come with Vista Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Vista, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's
 computer hardware. So when Vista was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Vista looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2) COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited
 situations. The key must be manually activated, but you must Activate by Phone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; Situations such as your (where the OEM SLP key is not self-activating, as it should) the resolution
 is to change out the OEM SLP key&nbsp;(that is currently in Vista) with the COA SLP key found on the sticker on your computer.&nbsp; The normal way to do this is by&nbsp;clicking 'Start', right-clicking on 'Computer', selecting 'Properties' and clicking "Change product key"
 (lower right hand side of the window).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Below are alternate steps to Change the product key</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Click the Start button</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) Type: slui.exe 3 and hit the Enter key</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3) Type in the Product key from the sticker on your computer</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4) Click the Next button.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5) You will be asked if want to Activate, click ok</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>6) It will attempt to Activate by the internet and will return an Invalid Key error (this is ok, continue to step 7)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>7) Click the Start button</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>8) Type: slui.exe 4 and hit the Enter key</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>9) Select your location in the drop down menu and click the Next button</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>10) The next screen provides the number to call to Activate by Phone</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: when you call that number, you will first hear an Automated Voice that will try to Activate Vista for you. If the Automated Voice gives you an option to talk
 to a Live Activation Rep, select that option. If not, do not enter any numbers. This should force the Automated Voice to transfer you to a Live Activation Rep. Trying to Activate thru the Automated Voice will not work, in your case, only thru the Live Activation
 Rep will your Activation be successful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also try calling your local Activation Call Center for further assistance:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/resources/vol/numbers.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/resources/vol/numbers.mspx</span></a><br />
</span></p>
<span>
<p>If you don't have access to the start button, then you must be getting a pop-up window that have a number of options. One of those options should be something like "Enter new product Key" or "Change Product Key".&nbsp; Use that option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
</span>

                    <p>I have a Maxtor OneTouch Mini USB drive.&nbsp; It worked fine on my old computer and seems to work on a Windows 7 machine but not on my new Windows 8.1 machine that I just purchased.&nbsp; I have been seeing all kinds of posts about certain drives not working with
 8.1 but nothing about this one in particular.&nbsp; I plus both USB plugs into the computer.&nbsp; Light comes on the drive and I can feel it running.&nbsp; Nothing every shows up on the computer (not listed in disk management either).&nbsp; Is there a specific or general solution
 to this problem?&nbsp; My entire back up is on this drive so I am anxious to get access to it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Network Interface Card IP configuration issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian scanlon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Interface Card IP configuration issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to bother you with this issue but I cannot seem to fix it myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a PCIe Startech&nbsp; <a href="https://www.startech.com/ie/Networking-IO/Adapter-Cards/PCI-Express-Dual-Port-Server-NIC~ST1000SPEXD4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ST1000SPEXD4</a> dual gigabit network Interface Card (NIC).</p>
<p>The card is mounted in the PCI slot and is detected on the windows 8.1 x64 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the recommended drivers (Realtek RTL8055) specific for windows 8.1 x64.</p>
<p>The drivers were installed correctly. However the NIC ports would not establish a connection to the internet,</p>
<p>nor to localised devices (network cameras). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the on-board (motherboard) network adapter (Intel) and it connects to the internet (and local devices) fine.</p>
<p>In addition, I have USB3.0 network adapters (<a href="https://www.startech.com/Networking-IO/usb-network-adapters/~USB31000SA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">startech USB3100SA</a>), and once I installed the realtek drivers for them, they also worked as
 intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been busy trying to debug the issue and am not sure what the exact issue is. I have reinstalled various drivers, and also the latest drivers - no joy. I have also disabled the on-board NIC during driver reinstallation in case there were compatibility
 issues. Also, I disabled the on-board NIC to see if the issue was a subnet conflict, -again no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running windows 'network adapter diagnostic' tool, it identifies that both of these ports on the PCI NIC are
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>"Ethernet X doesn't have a valid IP address"</em>.
</p>
<p>I have searched the internet for possible fixes and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went on the command line and performed the standard <strong>ipconfig /reset</strong>,
<strong>/flushdns</strong> &amp; <strong>/renew</strong>. However the renew command works for the on-board NIC, it throws errors for the PCI NIC ethernet adapters.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>"An error occurred while renewing interface Ethernet X : unable to contact your DHCP server. Request has timed out."</em></p>
<p>I have tried passing command line commands such as </p>
<p><strong>netsh winsock reset catalog</strong>, </p>
<p><strong>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log</strong> and</p>
<p><strong>netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>the last two commands (above) throw a similar error:</p>
<p><em>"Resetting Interface, OK!</em></p>
<p><em>Resetting Neibhor, OK!</em></p>
<p><em>Resetting Path, OK!</em></p>
<p><em>Resetting, failed.</em></p>
<p><em>Access is denied.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Resetting, OK!</em></p>
<p><em>Resetting, OK!</em></p>
<p><em>Restart the computer to complete this action."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fresh install of windows 8.1, no antivirus is installed.</p>
<p>Has anybody any further recommendations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>B</p>

            Hi <strong>amit79806,</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Have you installed the Audio drivers from the manufacturers website? </li></ul>
<br />
Let's try the following methods and verify if it resolves the issue:<br />
Let's make sure that the speakers are connected to the computer and switched on and Windows Audio sound is up and running and not mute or low.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1: Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services for No Sound in windows 7</strong>
<br />
Lets try Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services for No Sound in windows 7, Visit the link below and click on green button that says "Run Now" and follow the instructions appears on the screen.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</span>
</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Show Disabled devices and Set speaker as default</strong> <br />
Perform the task mentioned below to set speaker as default:<br />
1. Go to Start and click on control Panel.<br />
2. Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.<br />
3. In the new windows click on the tab"Playback" and right click in the window and click on Show Disabled devices.<br />
4. Now check if Speaker is listed there and right click on it and choose enable.<br />
5. Highlight that speaker and click on "Set as Default"<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: To update your Audio driver in device manager:
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View hardware and devices<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click your Audio controller, and click Properties<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Driver tab<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Update Driver button.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows will now search for an update for your Audio drivers locally and on the internet, then walk you through the process of installing the driver.&nbsp; If it is unable to find a driver you can go to your Sound Card manufacturer’s website and download any updated
 drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Windows Vista Ultimate product key already in use on another device</h2>
                    <p>I know this version of Windows is now out of its extended support phase but for educational purposes I wanted to have a legitimate copy of Vista Ultimate, so I bought a copy of from an auction site with a legitimate, retail product key. However, when I tried

<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use the automated phone activation method but the teller said the key is already in use as well. I then tried to call customer support but he said that support for Vista has ended and he is unable to help me out. He told me instead to come
 here and ask the question here instead. But I wasn't sure if I can ask here or if I have to speak to another representative via live chat.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can only give you the same advice as you have followed; contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message means that it is either still installed somewhere else or it has been installed elsewhere at some stage and then uninstalled..</p>
<p>But the activation mechanism still thinks that it is installed elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sort that out you need Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only advice we can give you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a phone activation and hold on for a real person to assist you.</p>

            Hi Iain.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if either one of these fixes the temp profile issue:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-y...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-w...</a>
<br />
<br />If not from the temp profile see if you can repair the install enough that you can Sign In with your profile.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help then access Advanced Startup Options by whatever method works in this link, to try a Reset:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary to  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool  follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  Then choose Troubleshoot options to locate Reset.
<br />
<br />If this all fails then use the booted media to do the vastly superior Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

In my Home Premium, it is called Center Desktop, not center image.<br />
<br />
See if you can get rid of the 2 thick black borders&nbsp;this way...<br />
Right click on open space of desktop &gt; Personalize &gt;&nbsp; Desktop Background &gt; under "How should the picture be positioned", put a dot in front of the<strong>FIRST

<h2>            Windows 10 signing in with a temporary profile</h2>
                    <p>Last night when I logged into Windows10 (Upgraded from Win7) I was signed in with a temporary profile and most of the icons for my applications are gone. &nbsp;I googled and found some possible fixes including the registry fix changing the profile.bak rename
 fix but that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on next steps? &nbsp;Given I upgraded from Win7 I don't have Windows 10 disks and Win 7 was installed by my computer store so I don't have windows disks for a frsh install either so I am at a loss to know what my next step should be.</p>

            <p>I'm having almost exactly the same issue. I rebooted and signed into Windows 10 using my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up all my email accounts (Personal, Work, Church, Hobby) and my mail began flowing in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set up my Office 365 account, and Word, Excel, et al., downloaded and were up and running perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set up Edge with my New York Times front page, and signed into my WordPress account for my websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After seeing that everything looked great, and considering how much stuff I had done over a two-hour period, I decided to re-boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...And now I'm stuck with a temporary profile and can't do anything. Email won't open. Can't access my Excel&nbsp;databases or my Word docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EDIT:</strong></span> I note that when I re-boot, I get my personalized background image that I set up, and&nbsp;the photo icon for my Microsoft account. I enter my password, it is accepted ... then I get "Setting
 Up Windows" (or words to that effect), my personalized background image disappears, and I get the generic background and the "temporary profile" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that hundreds upon hundreds of people are having this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the fix?</p>

 change it.&nbsp; How much will I lose if I revert to Windows 7/8.1?

            <p>I am searching for a solution to this same problem on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly use my profile on my Windows 10 PC and have a second profile for my wife who accesses her profile only occasionally - she has an Apple computer, also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not noticed any problem accessing my profile, but yesterday when my wife tried to access her profile after an absence of over 1 week she got the temporary profile with none of her files visable. &nbsp;I restarted the computer and found the same temporary
 profile for her along with the icon telling me that it was a temporary profile and that all files would be deleted when closing that profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Windows 10 to recognize my wife's profile?</p>

            <p>Exact same thing happening to me. I have had to build a new profile for my wife and the same problems are happening. Fortunately I had backed up her files before the profile started having issues. There are walk-thrus out there that show how to get the files
 back when a profile goes into the temporary loop so all is not lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like there are many people having this problem. One would think that the fundamentals would be down by now. Can't believe Windows 10 is having this problem with profiles.</p>

            System file check does not work; people are still having this fundamental problem of being assigned temporary profiles, which is so time wasting and frustrating, bordering making using Windows 10 unusable.&nbsp; What is the fix, please?&nbsp;

            Try these steps in addition to all of the ones I gave you earlier:   
<br />
<br />Check your proxy server settings
<br />
<br />    Disable proxy server on Internet Explorer.
<br />    Press Windows Key + R on the keyboard.
<br />    When Run dialog appears type inetcpl.cpl and hit Enter.
<br />    Windows 10 can't detect proxy settings
<br />    Click Connections tab, and then click the LAN settings button.
<br />    Windows could not automatically detect proxy server
<br />    Check if your proxy settings are okay.
<br />    Windows won't save proxy settings
<br />
<br /> Reset TCP/IP
<br />
<br />    Press Windows Key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin) from the menu.
<br />    Windows proxy settings keep changing
<br />    When Command Prompt starts, type netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt.
<br />    Windows 10 proxy settings not saving
<br />    Restart your computer and see if the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />If you’re still having issues on your PC or you simply want to avoid them for the future, we recommend you to download this tool (100% safe and tested by us) to fix various PC problems, such as file loss, malware and hardware failure.
<br />
<br /> Uninstall your antivirus software
<br />
<br />Using your computer without an antivirus is not the best idea, but fortunately for you Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender that will protect you when you remove your antivirus software. According to some users your antivirus software such as AVG  can cause some issues with proxy on Windows 10, so it’s advisable to remove your current antivirus software.
<br />
<br />After removing your antivirus software check if the issue is resolved.  
<br />
<br /> Check for malware by downloading, installing and running scans with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner:

<h2>            Lots of  New Skyrim Info - Direct from Devs</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">game’s director</span></span>,&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Todd Howard</span></strong>,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lead designer</span></span>,&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Bruce
 Nesmith</span></strong>; and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lead artist</span></span>,&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Matt Carofano</span>&nbsp;</strong>we now have a lot more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will the character be able to change into certain creatures?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;We’ve done various things like that in our previous games, and it’s something that we probably won’t be talking about specifically on this one. Don’t read anything into that, we just prefer to not discuss this one. We’d like to leave
 that an open question until the game is out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What sorts of cosmetic options, like beards, tattoos, or body proportions, are available? Can we edit them later in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;There is a large amount of customization available for each race. You can choose from multiple hair styles, beards, scars, and face paint. Each race and gender has a light and heavy build and you can pick any level in between. We’ve
 completely redone our facial system, and we’re really excited to show off the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is armor handled like in Oblivion (with each body part being welded together) or in Morrowind (with each body part separate)? Will you be able to wear both clothes and armor at the same time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;The armor system is very similar to Oblivion’s. The main difference is that the upper and lower body armors, the cuirass and greaves, have been combined into one piece. This helps create armor styles that have the look we needed for
 Skyrim. In most of the Nordic designs we created, the upper armor would completely cover the lower armor, making it unnecessary. We get much better visual results combining those pieces, and it renders a lot faster too, so we can put more people on-screen,
 so that was an easy tradeoff for us. We can also make a lot more armors now, so the number and variation types are more than we’ve ever had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are the main and faction quests branching or linear? What about side quests?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;We’ve focused on telling one story well. There are decision points in all the quest lines that can change things, but overall it’s a single story. Because the side quests are smaller stories, they are more likely to have major branches.
 For example, you can decide to save or betray someone, which changes the whole end of the quest. Overall the quest structure in Skyrim is closer to Oblivion than Fallout 3, in that there are many more quests, but they have fewer branches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are loot and quest rewards level scaled, like in Oblivion? Will there be any powerful un-scaled items?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;We’re handling leveling stuff similar to how we did in Fallout 3, but with a few new twists that we hope players won’t even notice. The enemies and loot are based on the “encounter zone” you’re in, so it could be higher or lower level
 than your current level. We do have a new concept of epic or “special” loot that you can randomly find in many cases, regardless of the zone, and you will still get better stuff in the better zones with your level higher. Same goes for quest rewards. We try
 to make them appropriate for what you did. Sometimes that is random, sometimes that is a set item. There’s a lot of specific stuff that is very powerful, like the Daedric artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will items present in Morrowind but not in Oblivion, such as spears, medium armor, and mark/recall spells, be making a return?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;They are not in Skyrim for the same reasons we didn’t include them in Oblivion. I’ll address each one. First spears, the truth is we’d love to do them, but it becomes a priority and development time thing for us. We feel it’s better
 to spend our time right now making sure the gameplay for the other play styles is really solid. That includes sword, sword and shield, two-handed weapons, and bows. You can also add magic to that list. Getting those all working well together, while feeling
 different, is our priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as medium armor, that’s not a time or polish thing, it’s a design choice to focus on two armor types and making sure those feel different and the player appreciates them. We try to make your character move and feel different between light and heavy
 and having a 3rd one in the middle just muddies it up in how it plays, as well as visually. And even now, we still have to tweak those two armor types so they feel different, while remaining fun. Every time we slow down heavy armor more, it feels bad, but
 it’s the main way of balancing it. We’ve added other ways of balancing it that feel right-like different stamina drain rates when sprinting and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark and recall is one where it’s a lot of fun, but like levitation, was removed so we could design better gameplay spaces and scenarios. We were really limited in Morrowind because the player could recall or levitate out of many situations and break them.
 There was a lot of good gameplay and level design work that we just couldn’t do and now we can. Back then it seemed like many good ideas we had were shot down when another designer would say “oh yeah, I just levitate or recall away.” So we got rid of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will we be able to have relationships with the NPCs, romantic or otherwise?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely! You make friends with people by doing things for them. Friends in the game will treat you differently. Some of them will even agree to go with you into dungeons and on adventures. You can even get married. If you own a
 house, your spouse will move in with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are there any new armor/weapon materials unique to Skyrim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;One of the most prized and rarest sets of armor is made from dragons. It can be forged in both a light and heavy variant. You’ll see a return of many armors from previous games, such as leather and steel, however these have been redesigned
 in the Nordic style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can we have some specifics about the PC version of the game? How will its UI be different? Will there be a 64-bit executable?</strong></p>
<p>Todd: 64-bit specific exe? Not at this time. As far as UI, it visually looks the same across the platforms, but the controls are entirely different. There’s also a lot of “power user” stuff we do with the keyboard from how favorites work, to quick saves,
 and more that is similar to what we’ve done before in that area. We’re packing a lot of info on the screen and the whole interface is much less ‘look at giant fonts!’ than, say, Oblivion. The PC version also gets higher res textures, larger render modes, and
 a bunch of other effects you can scale up if your machine is a beast. Last but most important, is the Creation Kit we’ll be releasing for the PC. Modding the game and making it your own is very important to us and our fans, so we’re going to keep doing whatever
 we can in that area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How will enchanting work in Skyrim? Will we have to constantly refill our enchantments with soul gems like we did in Oblivion, or will it be more like Morrowind in which the weapons recovered after a certain resting period?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;The method in Oblivion worked really well, so we kept it. Magic weapons use charges and have to be refilled with soul gems. Magic armor is always on and doesn’t need to be recharged. Soul gems and their lore and usage are a staple
 of the Elder Scrolls.</p>
<p>We have revamped the enchanting system though. Enchanting is now a skill. The better your skill and perks, the better you are at creating enchanted items. You’ll be able to find enchanting stations all over the world, which will make it much more accessible.</p>
<p>There are some changes from Oblivion, including the effects you can use when creating items, as well as how you learn effects. You now learn enchanting effects by “breaking down” a magic item you find, as opposed to them coming from spells you know. This
 allows us to separate enchanting from the other magical skills better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences between the races? I guess they’ll have different skill bonuses, but will they also start with different perks or have different “hard-coded” attributes, such as different running speeds or maximum encumbrance, etc.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;They each start with some skills that are higher by default, but those aren’t hard to overcome with another race in a short time. They also have different starting spells and each has its own passive abilities, like before, as well
 as powers, like before. So Khajiit can see in the dark, Orcs have a berserk power, Redguards have Adrenaline Rush, and so forth. They work differently in the new system, but the flavor is the same. We kept all the racial movement speeds the same, that’s now
 a factor of what you’re wearing and have equipped. And starting max encumbrance is the same and is based on your Stamina attribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there any game content (story, quests) that might be locked for a character based on race/faction/politics allegiances/morality/choices? Or one can experience all the content in one single play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;We do have some stuff that gets locked out based on decisions you make. It’s wherever it felt natural. It wasn’t a goal that you could or couldn’t play everything with one character. The game’s honestly so big that we don’t think about
 it much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To what extent will our racial / gender selection at the start of the game affect our gameplay? Are there relationships affected by these choices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;Your race is very important. It’s more than just how you look. Each race has a bias toward certain types of characters. If you want play a wizard, it will be easier with a High Elf or a Breton. If you want to play a warrior, it will
 be easier with a Nord or a Redguard. However, just like in Oblivion, we don’t force you to follow that bias. If you want to be a Nord wizard, that’s completely viable.</p>
<p>Gender does not change any initial skills or abilities. There is nothing that men do better than women or vice versa in the game. Other characters will recognize your gender and address you properly. Some may have prejudices for or against a particular gender
 as a part of their character, but it won’t change what you can or can’t do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to include non lethal ways of defeating opponents?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;Depends on what you mean by “defeat”. We have various stealthy ways of getting past people, and the various poisons and spells allow you to basically render enemies harmless to you, whether that is casting a calm or fear spell, knocking
 them down, or something else. Oh, and we now have tavern brawls that are non-lethal! I love those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will boss fights involve interesting mechanics involved as opposed to just more health and hits harder?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;We have many new combat behaviors in our AI that makes fights with certain enemies very dynamic and interesting. It matters what the enemy can do. Dragons, for example, can do a lot of things from multiple shouts, bombing runs, picking
 guys up, and more. An enemy that has a sword and shield, a bow, magic spells, and potions will use all of those things, and those fights are the most interesting. But we also design some combat encounters where the player simply may get mobbed by more simple
 enemies, and those have a different pace and strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do companions have skill and perk trees we can train?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;No, you only manage your own. Though companions often have certain perks so they behave different or better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is the culture in Skyrim strictly Nordic, or are there places (like Cheydinhal in Cyrodiil) that show influence from other cultures nearby, like architecture, religion, etc</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;While there are pockets of other races in the game, we focused on the Nordic culture and their regional differences. The architecture between cities is dramatically different and reflects how the Nords live in that area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, the dragons are big and powerful. Did you include some destructible environment so they could leave marks and scars everywhere they attack? Can they demolish buildings, break trees, start avalanches, burn houses, things like this that emphasize
 their power?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;They do leave marks and scars everywhere, but as far as destroying buildings and such, it’s rare. It does happen, but not a lot. Systemically destroying our spaces is something we have not found a good way to handle yet, because it’s
 so dynamic. We’re dealing with places that we have NPCs living, and providing quests and other game services. It’s something we avoid in every game unless we can specifically wipe it off the map, like Megaton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any difference between the animation sets of male and female as well as human-like and ‘beast’ characters?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;The animation system is completely new and dramatically improved. You will notice huge difference from previous games. There are differences between male and female animations, and even beast races have some specific animations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will any sort of karma system be incorporated like there was in Fallout, or will it be the Fame/Infamy system of Oblivion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;We don’t provide a numeric score that you can track, but the game knows if you’ve been naughty or nice. We felt that a number really didn’t do your fame justice. Characters in the world will acknowledge the specific things you have
 done rather than just a generalized reputation. If you are a criminal, they’ll know that too. But if you pay your debt to society, all is forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will crafting (weapons, armor) be effected by the tools you use as well as the ingredients used in the crafting? Such as the hammers and clippers, mastery level of the weapons and your level? Basically, will I be able to produce a more powerful,
 or even unique, weapon if I use a master hammer or clipper as opposed to novice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;The blacksmith’s shop includes a forge, a grindstone, and a smithing bench. You can improve your weapons at the grindstone. The higher your skill, the more you can improve them, and the more damage they’ll do. Same thing for armor
 with the smithing bench, only the armor rating gets better. The forge is actually used to create new weapons and armor from raw materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will your character have a voice? So that you can hear yourself having a conversation with other people?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;You do have a voice, but you only hear it in grunts and shouts. So we have recorded for each race and *** you can play, all the different combat grunts, as well as the dragon language shouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Obviously every character is “Dragonborn”, but not every character will be playing the same way. The question is: Will dragon shouts support all types of characters? Are there long ranged shouts? Some kind of stealthy “shout”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, the shouts support all character types. We’re not ready to talk about the other shouts yet, but soon enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are there going to be places where you can use nature to your advantage? Like make a trap out of a falling tree or climb a tree to stealth attack an enemy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;Yes and no. You can’t make things, but our environment is so dense, you’re almost always using the natural terrain to get an advantage, especially with stealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will you be able to carry on after the main story?</strong></p>
<p>Todd: Yes, absolutely.</p>

<h2>            One Computer with Two IPs - One IP Could Not Be Registered On The Interface</h2>
                    <p>Environment: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Workgroup with three Windows 7 Pro desktop computers each with single NIC's and no wireless capability.</li><li>Each computer is configured to use DHCP on the router.&nbsp; There is no domain controller nor DHCP server.</li><li>One workstation with machine name MAIN-PC, is sharing a folder and has a DHCP provided address of 192.168.0.120.&nbsp; For this example, let's presume the shared folder is open to the Everyone group in both share permissions and Windows security permissions.</li><li>Machine names CLIENT-1 and CLIENT-2 have mapped network drives to the shared folder on MAIN-PC. For each one, Advanced TCP/IP Settings shows NetBIOS setting configured as Default (Use NetBIOS setting from the DHCP server.)</li><li>An additional half dozen computers also share the internet connection.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While using CLIENT-1 or CLIENT-2 both ping and tracert to MAIN-PC returns an incorrect address of 192.168.0.169, instead of 192.168.0.120.&nbsp; The mapped network drives, which reference machine name MAIN-PC, doesn't allow access and prompts for credentials.&nbsp;
 The shared folder on MAIN-PC is open to Everyone group so permissions aren't needed. Also, using Windows Explorer and browsing to
\\192.168.0.120 shows the open shared folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While using MAIN-PC, a tracert to 192.168.0.120 includes the words "Tracing route to MAIN-PC" which is expected.&nbsp; However, a tracert to 192.168.0.169 includes the words "Tracing route to MAIN-PC" which is not expected. A tracert to MAIN-PC includes the words
 "Tracing route to MAIN-PC" and displays the IPv6 address.</p>
<p><br />

Description:<br />
The name "MAIN-PC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :0" could not be registered on the interface with IP address 192.168.0.120. The computer with the IP address 192.168.0.169 did not allow the name to be claimed by this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does MAIN-PC with a single network interface and no addition IP addresses on the NIC, have two IP addresses 192.168.0.120 and 192.168.0.169?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does CLIENT-1 and CLIENT-2 resolve the machine MAIN-PC to the wrong IP address 192.168.0.169?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that in a WORKGROUP, NetBIOS is being used for name resolution.&nbsp; I have run ipconfig/flushdns on MAIN-PC, CLIENT-1 and CLIENT-2.&nbsp; The phantom 192.168.0.169 still appears.&nbsp; How do I troubleshoot this further?</p>

            <p>Also when a device is designated to provide services to client computers it is better that they do not use DHCP or if they do for the DHCP server be configured to always allocate the same address for that specific device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting the DHCP server router so as it allocates from a limited range within the subnet frees up a set of address to be used as static IPs for servers, printers etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming nobody has done anything tricky like MAC spoofing then if it has a different MAC it must be a different computer. Does MAIN-PC run virtualisation of any sort because the VM could have its own MAC. Not as useful as it used to be but you can look
 up the 1st 3 pairs of a MAC address on line and find the network device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also on the Clients run nbtstat -c to see what cache they hold and nbtstat -r to clear the cache.</p>

<h3> donaldscharfenorth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t install over my Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo desktop running Windows 7 Home Premium (x64) Service Pack 1 (Build 7601), 8GB RAM, 2TB HD. Windows 7 was pre-installed on the system and Control Panel/System shows Windows is activated and the Product ID number. I also have the software key.
<em>It is a legitimate and activated Win7 installation</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been tearing my hair out off and on for weeks trying to upgrade to Windows 10. I hit Microsoft's "Get Windows 10" download and run the program, but nothing happens. Nothing. It's been said that insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and
 expectin a different result. If that's true, I must by now be completely insane. I've been all over the web looking for, and trying, various solutions. I've run the various script files on CNet, Info World, etc. with no luck. I tried running "refreshgwxconfig-B"
 and got the message that <strong>it no longer exists</strong>. I ran the Microsoft Win10 update diagnostic troubleshooter and it tells me "The Get Windows 10 App is not available for this version of Windows." What?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing I have run across in trying to find a solution has worked and I'm at my wits' end. I know just enough to be leery of the .iso answer. I'm not sure I'm smart enough to do it properly and not lose anything, especially what's left of my sanity. If I
 can't get this system upgraded to Windows 10 I'm going to take a hard look at Linux. (I don't mean that as a threat. I simply don't want to continue using an OS that's no longer supported and I don't want to scrap a perfectly good computer.)</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response, but I thought I made it clear in my initial post that I've already tried the download link you furnished and I've already been through Andre Da Costa's suggestions. I've also tried a half-dozen other "fixes" I found on Microsoft's
 site and other sites on the web with no luck. Perhaps a careful review of the errors I listed in my initial post would be in order. There appear to be a couple of crucial items that are not on my computer, i.e., "refreshgwxconfig-B" and "gwx.exe" for starters.
 ("gwx.exe" is mentioned in Da Costa's thread. I believe the download at your link is the same thing, just a slightly different name. Tried it a few times, didn't work.)</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Does the issue persists with all programs or just the specific ones? I would suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Try to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows
 from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.<br />
</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Perform a Clean boot. Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article
 mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Surface Book latch failes to open</h2>
                    I have a surface Book laptop with a detachable keyboard but lately it hasn't been working right. For some reason one of the magnetic latches is failing to release when ever I push the button on the key board or on the screen. Only my left latch is working
 and it doesn't seem to be effecting the keyboard. I've tried updating, cleaning, and restarting it but it hasn't resolved the problem.

<p>Hi rapopRocks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would have to review some settings and perform several troubleshooting steps to resolve this. First, see if an update was recently installed by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>(Windows key + I) &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security </strong>
&gt; <strong>View udpate history</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, double-check if the batteries are nearing low levels when the problem occurs. Click on the battery icon on your taskbar and verify that both Battery 1 and Battery 2 are higher than 10%. If not, recharge the Surface first before attempting to detach
 the keyboard again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong> to ensure that the Surface
 is running the latest driver and firmware udpates and check for other software issues. Afterwards, perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you mentioned that you have tried cleaning the pins and connectors. It's true that dirt may cause the detach feature to fail. To clean the clipboard properly, use a cotton cloth wet with rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further test the problem, let's try to detach the keyboard while you are in the UEFI. From an off state, press and hold the Vol + button then press and release the power button. Once you are in the UEFI, press the Detach key on the keyboard and see if
 the problem will occur. Do this for up to three times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update the post with the results of the troubleshooting. I will be notified when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can so we can work on this further if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem with my Surface Book 1. Whether I press the latch icon on the screen or on the keyboard, the light on the keyboard button will turn green and I will have to quickly detach the screen and if I do, only the right side detaches
 while the left is very difficult to detach, i.e., it gets lifted slightly but not completely and if I move the tablet as if forcing it to detach, it seems to be able to come off but with some effort.&nbsp; I am afraid that the latch gets damaged when I do this
 so I'd rather not do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After pressing the detach buttons and the light flashes green, If I don't detach quickly, the light will turn from green to red and will the "latch failed to open" warning appears and I won't be able to detach the screen anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to read as much as I can here in the Microsoft Forums about this latch problems and it seems that it is not an isolated case and happens to some people so please don't ask me to try this and that as I have tried them all, even resetting the
 computer and the OS and the problem stays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please tell me what else I can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />

    <title>Why is a Windows 7 scheduled task running hidden&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is a Windows 7 scheduled task running hidden&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>I am migrating from XP to Windows 7. I moved a scheduled task that worked fine under XP to the Windows 7 environment by re-creating the job in the new scheduled tasks manager, and calling the same batch (.CMD) file. In the task properties General tab, the
 Hidden checkbox is <strong>not</strong> checked. The CMD file runs normally (visible) if started from a CMD window prompt or from Explorer.</p>
<p>When the task is started by the Task Scheduler, it runs hidden. The CMD window is not visible and the UI of the program that it runs (a backup program) is not visible. The processes are listed in Task Manager, and they are running under my user name (not
 SYSTEM or LOCAL).</p>
<p>Can anyone explain why this task is running hidden, and how I can make it visible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi timg11,</p>
<p>Do all the scheduled tasks run hidden?</p>
<p>The Task Scheduler user interface (UI) is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that replaces the Scheduled Tasks Explorer extension in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2000.</p>
<p>To view the hidden scheduled tasks, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Click Start. In the Start Search box, type task scheduler. Then, in the Programs list, click Task Scheduler.<br />
2. On the View menu, click Show Hidden Tasks.</p>
<p>Refer the link below and refer the Hidden scheduled tasks section that describes the hidden scheduled tasks:</p>
<p>Description of the scheduled tasks in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/939039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/939039</a></p>
<p>The above article is for Windows Vista. It holds good for Windows 7, too.</p>
<p>If you are having problems scheduling tasks or getting tasks to run correctly, first ensure that the Task Scheduler service is running. You can verify the service is running if you click the Start button, click Control Panel, click System and Maintenance,
 click Administrative Tools, and then click Services and verify that the Task Scheduler service's status is Started.</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more details on Task Scheduler and troubleshooting the same:</p>

    <title>windows 7 extract all command not working used command prompt and now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skizzy smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 extract all command not working used command prompt and now cant see images only numbers</h2>
                    <p>I have a friend who has windows 7 home premium and he &nbsp;received some images from me that were zipped. ( I sent them as email attachments with gmail, but i did not zip them )</p>
<p>He could not find the ' extract all' command. &nbsp;I looked on the net and found a fix which was : &nbsp; &nbsp;To get the " extract all " command that is used to extract zipped files if using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
You have to run Command Prompt as Administrator in Windows 7.&nbsp;<br />
Do this by clicking in the following order:&nbsp;<br />
Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Right Click on Command Prompt &gt; Select Run as Administrator&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 2: Type in the following commands &nbsp;exactly into the Command Prompt:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
regsvr32 /u /s zipfldr.dll then hit Enter &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; ( i am not sure why, &nbsp;but there is a space after the 32 and 2 spaces after the /u and a space after the /s )<br />
<br />
Next type in the following&nbsp;<br />
<br />
regsvr32 /i /s zipfldr.dll then hit Enter&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He did this and now tells me that he cannot see any of the images in his picture files he can only see numbers. &nbsp;Im not sure if he means filenames, I will ask if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the command prompt instruction be reversed? &nbsp;Whichever way is easiest, neither of us are experts. &nbsp;Please help, ive messed up his computer!</p>

            <p>I would use System Restore to undo it cleanly.&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi2.wp.com%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg%3fw%3d610" height="16" width="16" />+R</strong> to show the Run box, type
<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore process, or try another date.</li></ol>
<div>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://i0.wp.com/cmdrkeene.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/restore.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi0.wp.com%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f08%2frestore.png%3fresize%3d580%252C466" height="466" width="580" /></a></li><li>
<div>System Restore can undo recent changes to the system, without affecting your personal files.</div>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This restores backups of your registry and system settings, but doesn’t touch any of your files. It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn’t fix the problem on the first try. When you aren’t sure where
 to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.</p>

            Thanks a lot for your reply. &nbsp;My friend did try a system restore but it did not bring back the images. &nbsp; He said that it seemed to affect the picture files that were in folders. &nbsp;I &nbsp;did resend some pictures using Yahoo Messenger and he saved them, I think
 just to Downloads, and those were OK. &nbsp; &nbsp; I will tell him to try doing a system restore again, maybe a slightly earlier date. &nbsp; If that fails, I will let you know. &nbsp; Thank you for answering.

            Just to be totally clear:&nbsp; System Restore has a chance to help repair the ability of the ZIP Extraction Tool, but it won't actually restore or bring back any files.&nbsp; System Restore is a tool that just makes regular backups of key system files and registry
 settings so you can fix them if a problem happens or a file gets broken/corrupted.&nbsp; But it can't actually be used to bring back any non-system files (like pictures/documents/etc.).

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>thanks for the fast reply. &nbsp; &nbsp;I will try to be clear although im not very good at computers. &nbsp; My friend had pictures in folders. I sent him some pictures that arrived zipped. I found that fix on the net and sent it to him. After he did that command prompt
 instruction, all his pictures that were in folders, ( most of them I think) lost the original filename, and he could not open them or see thumbnails. There was just a list of numbers, I think the same amount as there were pictures. &nbsp;So he did a system restore.
 &nbsp;I dont know if he now has the extract all command or not, but the pictures in folders are still numbers, not like they were before the command prompt fix. So am I right, that the system restore has not restored the picture files to how they were before that
 bad fix? He has lost the ability to see them? &nbsp;Have you experience of this number thing happening to picture files, and is there a way to convert them so he can see them?</p>
<p>by the way, its all his pictures that are now numbers, not just the ones that were zipped. &nbsp; If needed, he could take his computer to the store he got it from, they do offer free advice. I feel so bad about this. he is 6 hours behind me as he is in St, Louis
 and im in the UK. so there will be delays in asking him. anyway thanks so much for helping and I hope you can help in future as I make mistakes. &nbsp;Thanks, Kris&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The command you used should not have been able to rename any files or cause them to show up as numbers instead, so I'm not sure how that happened.&nbsp; I've never seen it before.&nbsp; Maybe if he could post a screenshot of what it looks like I or another member
 might recognize it and know how to undo it.</p>

            <p>Kris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just jumping in to make the observation that in your original question you said that your friend received files that were zipped even though you had not zipped them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Extract all" command will not show on the right-click menu if the file that you are working with is not a zip file.&nbsp; So the first question is, why did your friend think that the attachments you sent were zipped?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second question is, do you have a third-party compression utility installed that might be automatically compressing (zipping) files that you attach to your outgoing email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither the command prompt commands you described nor the System Restore should have produced a strange result like "all his pictures ... are now numbers, not just the ones that were zipped."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the System Restore can be reversed (see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq#1TC=windows-7</a>), it might be faster in the long run if you explained to your friend how to log in here and ask for help directly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If he is willing to do that, send him the link to your question (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/windows-7-extract-all-command-not-working-used/b67d20c9-52d0-415d-9869-d97c2346e65e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/windows-7-extract-all-command-not-working-used/b67d20c9-52d0-415d-9869-d97c2346e65e</a>
 or -- shortened -- <a href="http://tinyurl.com/kmmzh2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/kmmzh2y</a>) and ask him to "Reply" to your question.&nbsp; He should include the complete text of any error messages that he gets, without paraphrasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Shawn suggested, your friend also should include a screenshot of the "pictures that look like numbers."&nbsp; Here's how.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the image that you want to capture showing on the monitor, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Start Orb and type "Snipping Tool" (without quotes) in the Search box and press Enter</li><li>Place the cursor on one corner of the section of the monitor that you want to capture, press the left mouse button, drag to the diagonally opposite corner (e.g., top left to bottom right), and release the mouse button
</li><li>Click the "Save" icon (floppy disk!) and select a location that you'll remember, like the Desktop.&nbsp; You can keep the default file name (Capture.jpg).</li><li>Close the Snipping Tool window</li><li>In the new Question or Reply window here in this forum, click the "Insert image" icon (second from right)
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dbc9c50-61fe-4b7c-a523-9e4ce54c7e92" /><br />
</li><li>Click the "Browse" button and navigate to the folder where the screenshot (e.g., Capture.jpg) was saved.</li><li>Select the file and click Open</li><li>Click the "Upload" button</li></ol>
<p />

            <p>Hi &nbsp;LemP and Shawn</p>
<p>thank you for taking time to help me. &nbsp;Im helping my friend because hes even worse than me with computers! &nbsp; I got an image from him of his explorer screen showing his Downloads folder with the list of files that are numbered. &nbsp;I tried to find out things
 but got to his brain fade. &nbsp; What he says is that all of the image files he has in other folders, such as 'My Pictures' have not been affected, &nbsp; Its only the ones in download. &nbsp; I dont think he knows how to create new folders, hes just using the ones that
 are Libraries.</p>
<p>I will attach the screenshot of his screen. &nbsp;If &nbsp;you cant see enough, I can cut out the centre bit and enlarge it with paint Shop Pro. &nbsp;let me know. &nbsp; &nbsp;I only have the standard windows 7 extract all command that was always there. I did download free RAR
 extract FROG, but i only got that because i got some files that needed that to extract them. &nbsp;When those files came as email attachments, they had the RAR frog icon on them I think. &nbsp;The only clue might be that if you try and send &nbsp;attachments that are too
 big with gmail, they say they are too big but dont worry send them with Google drive, whatever that is. &nbsp;I never did that I just sent a second email. &nbsp;Sorry there is no more info i can give you right now. &nbsp; He knows there are other apps that can extract zipped
 files, I told him not to do anything yet. &nbsp;My friend has not seen any error messages. I noticed the numbered files dont seem big enough to be images. &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I look at his screenshot, those numbered files have the same name, but a number in brackets. &nbsp; like
 if you rename a lot of files with one name. &nbsp; Thanks again for your help. &nbsp;Kris<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba20d76d-44f3-4bad-9f8b-a954f3364ecc" /></p>

            <p>Looks like an attempt to rename the files was made while they were all highlighted.&nbsp; This is the result in a case like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can undo a "group rename" if you immediately click Undo (or press Ctrl+Z), but at this point you probably can do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point you can either download the files again, or rename them back to what they were.&nbsp; I'm going to assume they were all "jpg" files.&nbsp; So rename one of them to "something.jpg" and see if it turns back into a working picture file. If so, you can
 do it to the rest.</p>

            <p>Ive chatted to my friend on messenger and he says he didnt rename anything. Not intentionally anyway.</p>
<p>those weird files dont look big enough to be jpg's do they? &nbsp;anyway right now hes not doing anything, so ill wait a day or 2 and see if he will try and rename one with .jpg as the type and see what happenz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe when he did that command prompt instruction he mistyped, them who knows what he did.</p>
<p>so thanks a lot and ill keep you updated when something happenz.</p>

            <p>Heyy Shawn and LemP &nbsp; I got an answer on another web site called Stack Exchange super user, from a
</p>
<p>Dr Moishe Pippik &nbsp;and it said this:</p>
<p>No permanent harm was done. regsvr32 just tells Windows where a DLL lives, and you "ininstalled" the Zip Folder DLL. To reverse it, open a CMD prompt and change directory to the location of that DLL, e.g.<br />
<br />
cd C:\Windows\SysWOW64 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and press Enter. Then type &nbsp; &nbsp;regsvr32 zipfldr.dll &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and press Enter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see a confirmation that the DLL was registered. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490985.aspx for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>( looked at the link above and i did understand one or 2 things but got lost with most of it. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not told &nbsp;my friend to do this yet, I asked Dr Pippik if &nbsp;his instructions are exactly right, as he did say&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g, which may mean I have to know where the directory is that the DLL is. &nbsp;I dont know where it is, only what was typed into command prompt. &nbsp; Also i assume he meant UNinstall and not INinstall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post on here what happens if my friend renames one of the numbered files and saves it as a .jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for being so helpful &nbsp; Kris</p>

    <title>Ripping and burning music and videos on Groove - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathygreen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ripping and burning music and videos on Groove</h2>
                    <p>You can use Windows Media Player to rip music from a CD onto your hard drive, and to burn music from your hard drive onto a disk.&nbsp; Can you use Groove to do the same?&nbsp; If not, I really wish that Microsoft would add those features to Groove.&nbsp; I am more than
 a little reluctant to give up my trusty Windows Media Player unless I can do everything on Groove that I can already do on WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have Windows 10 now, but still have 7.</p>

</span></p><p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are looking for features of Windows Media Player on Groove Music. I will certainly help.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Microsoft Groove Music</strong> is brand new for Windows 10. It plays your music collection and lets you make and listen to playlists. Add your MP3s to OneDrive and you can use the Groove Music app to play your songs

 free.</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>The features of burning the music and videos are not available presently on <strong>
Groove Music</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your suggestions on Groove Music and recommend you to leave your findings, comments and feedback you hope to see using
<strong>feedback</strong> in Groove Music.</p>

            <p>In that case, I'd better hold onto my Windows Media Player if and when I make the upgrade from 7 to 10.&nbsp; I hope that since Microsoft has chosen to replace WMP with Groove, that it will put all the features into Groove that WMP presently has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks for your answer.</p>

</p><p>Also, would you please ask Microsoft to add the ability to play music that one has gotten through Groove on Real Player and Windows Media Player, as well?&nbsp; Not only on Groove, but on other forms of software, too.&nbsp; As things currently stand, one can play
 music acquired through Groove only on Groove.<br />
