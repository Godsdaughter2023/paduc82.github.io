    <title>Etron USB 3.0 drivers or default Windows 10 drivers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Etron USB 3.0 drivers or default Windows 10 drivers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been experiencing some problems with the Etron USB 3.0 drivers that came with my ASRock motherboard (990FX Fatal1ty Killer). I've experienced some computer freezes when I connect a USB peripheral be it a mouse or a joystick our my Windows Phone. Taking
 over with a friend who is more versed on this told me that I would be better off with the USB 3.0 drivers that came on board Windows 8.1. I am on the fence on this because the motherboard manufacturer recommends that I use the latest Etron drivers supplied
 in ASRock's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Etron has been kind of a problematic USB 3.0 corrupt and with problematic driver software on Windows by looking at some of the forums. Therefore I'd like to know if the default drivers for USB 3.0 support in Windows 8.1 are a better option
 for my particular case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance in this matter!</p>

<h2>            Vista BSOD STOP code 0x0000007B</h2>
                    <div>At the moment, according to the Vista recovery disk, it says i have 2 operating systems installed. I currently have 2 HDDs but as far as i can remember, Vista was only installed on one of them. On the recovery disk, the "Windows Vista Ultimate", shows
 that the last time it successfully booted was over a year ago, although I have the recovery disk inside the Windows Vista Ultimate box. The other operating system shown on the disk was just "Windows Vista", yet that has a last successful boot of a couple of
 days ago, so this is the first thing I'm unsure of.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The second is that Vista will not boot at all. When loading "Windows Vista" there is no BSOD yet it won't load and there is a black screen with only a visible mouse pointer. When booting the "Windows Vista Ultimate", i get a blue screen with the codes
 below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>STOP : 0x0000007B (0x80399BB0, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For both operating systems, i have tried the startup repair on the disk, but the message is that no errors were detected (cant remember the exact message). I have run chkdsk through the disk, but it froze when using chkdsk /r, and there were no errors
 mentioned when using chkdsk /f. System restore does nothing to help it. If possible, i would like to fix it without doing a clean install.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance and if needed I can supply any extra information</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. I have opened the PC and reconnected all the cables to the HDDs, pulled out the RAM and put it back in, and have done the same with all expansion cards, as I read that this could fix it.</div>

            Is AHCI enabled or disabled in the BIOS??<br />
<br />
You can get that stop error if you disable it during the install of windows, then you turn it back on after. You cant do that. Without it bringing up this 7b stop error<br />

<p>Is there anybody out there who could help me... I've been waiting for quiet sometime expecting an answer from anybody who has used this feature. I'm surprised that Dell studio 15 has many fans yet I see none to help me with the issue. I've been looking for
 answers via google but cant find any substantial answer to get the sim card to work in the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im sure there is someone out there who is waiting to help people like me? I did call Dell and they redirected me to call vodafone. Vodafone is not even aware that something like this really really exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably, the concept is new in India. I do not blame the vodafone guys.</p>

<p>Now days many systems are ready to use 3G tech. For that manufacturer need to place sim card tray and we have to put a "Mini PCMCI WWAN cards" like</p>
<p>1. Ericsson F3607gw <br />
2. Huawei EM770/770U/770W<br />
3. Qualcomm GOBI<br />
4. Huawei EM660</p>
<p>so check with dell which wwan card they have&nbsp;place or not.</p>
<p>Currently i am also serching for one of these card for my&nbsp; Lenovo Ideapad S10-3t.</p>
<p>Becouse they also place only sim card tray only. (I think like your's dell)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Family Safety no activity reported - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbodey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Family Safety no activity reported</h2>
                    Family Safety is correctly blocking unwanted web sites and applying time limits, but not reporting on activity via the FS web site, even though activity reporting is enabled. As I recall in earlier Windows versions there used to be event logs that could
 be reviewed but all I can see is&nbsp;Microsoft-Windows-ParentalControls/Operational which seems to report on downloads only. The scheduled tasks in&nbsp;\Microsoft\Windows\Shell -&nbsp;FamilySafetyMonitor and&nbsp;FamilySafetyRefresh appear to be running regularly, but no way
 to see if they are running successfully.

            Here we go again. Two responses from Microsoft on this. One states the obvious that we are in fact saying we can not get the report from. The second when run states "sorry this troubleshooter doesn't work with this version of Windows". On top of this I
 spent an hour and a half talking to tech support last night. Just to be told that the Windows 8.1 that I want to roll back to. Is only available through my tablet suppliers recovery disc that I now have to chase.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox one x usb hub and controller issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rustydawg37  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one x usb hub and controller issues</h2>
                    <p>I won an xbox one x from mountain dew and it arrived about a week or two ago. I love it but there have been some&nbsp;strange issues.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>My charging setup is 2 usb 3.0 powered hubs daisy chained and charging xbox one controllers, dual shock 3's and 4's while connected to the xbox. This has been my setup for some time without problem on my og xbox one, but on the x there has been some strange happenings.&nbsp; The lights on the usb hub reset and the xbox one x will turn on occasionally. Also the dual shocks seem to have the lights reset at the same time.&nbsp; Is there some info somewhere on the expected behavior of the usb ports? Im not sure if i should send the console in or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Second issue is that the controller that came with the system randomly loses connection.&nbsp; My old controller does not do this. All controllers updated. I definitely will queue up a service request for this but just wondering if this is a widespread issue

            <p>i should clarify, the hubs and controller charging works as expected when the console is on. There seems to be some type of polling on the ports or something when the console is off.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7&#47;XP Laptop cursor moves on its own when typing</h2>
                    I read through other similar post but my issue seems to be a little different. The user first started&nbsp;experiencing&nbsp;the issue with an old XP Pro 32bit laptop. She isn't using a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;keyboard or mouse. I even had her disable the touch pad while she was
 typing but the cursor would still move around randomly. She was next up for getting a new laptop so instead of wasting time troubleshooting an old laptop I just replaced. The new laptop is a Windows 7 Pro 64bit. Even with this new laptop she's having the same
 problem. This happens when she is typing an e-mail and it also happens when she is remoted into our terminal server working in an Access database. She even tries typing very slowly to make sure she just isn't hitting a key by mistake. It's very odd that this
 would occur on two different laptops running different versions of Windows.&nbsp;

<p><br />
I'll give this a shot but I'm doubting this will solve anything. Like I said this issue occured on two different laptops. A laptop that was bought<br />
in 2007 and was running WinXP Pro 32bit and a laptop I just bought last month running Win7 Pro 64bit.<br />

<h2>            Creating a startup Password</h2>
                    Hi, I'm having a really hard time finding out how to do this. I have an out of control brother that my parents want to start controlling and this is something that they want to do. I honestly am experienced with computers but not this much. I been told
 to do a BIOS password but that's not what I want, because all that does is set a password for the access of the setup. I want to be able to create a password so that as soon as the computer is turned on it is required. kind of like what libraries and schools
 have. I also been told that if I do this and "forget" the password the computer wont be usable any longer. That's fine I've already explained this to them and they want to go ahead with it. So please can someone help me figure out how to do this. I'm currently
 running on Windows Vista on a HP a6312p. Thanks in advance =).

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Make sure there are ADMIN Accounts (at least one of which is not used daily, only used to test and<br />
fix the others - it can have the same passwords at the main ADMIN - and there can be more than<br />
one of these) - then make a User Account for your brother and setup Parental Controls which will<br />
limit when he can log on and what he can do. Of course maker sure he does not know the ADMIN<br />
account passwords.<br />

<h2>            In App purchases.  What does this mean&#63;</h2>
                    When I download an App and I am told to get it at the Windows store, is the App free?&nbsp; Does downloading an App with "In App Purchasing" mean that I will be charged for the App in some way?&nbsp; I have never been told that I should give my credit crd number
 or Visa info. so I assumed that the App is free.&nbsp; <br />
Am I understanding this correctly?&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Intel HD graphic driver in Windows Server 2012</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, I downloaded Windows Server 2012 via Dreamspark yesterday and installed it on my desktop. But the system can't identify the Intel HD graphic 2000.When I trying to install the official driver for Windows 8 from Intel. A error window came out and
 told that "The system doesn't reach the requirements of&nbsp;installation."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody could help about this problem, please? I have waiting for Windows Server 2012 for a very long time and this problem made things stuck. I can't use my HD displayer at a very low resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

As I already stated, what I find&nbsp;funny&nbsp;is the fact that&nbsp;some people like to&nbsp;state&nbsp;things like,&nbsp;"they have&nbsp;been waiting for Windows Server 2012 for a long time"... Like it was the most important thing in the world and since they have been waiting so long - this
 makes it a fire-drill situation for the volunteers they are asking for assistance from.&nbsp; It's the exaggeration of the issue at hand that I find humorous.&nbsp; Always have, always will.&nbsp; People think if they drop a few names, mention a few things that make this
 situation 'important' to them - others will be more willing to help.&nbsp; Often, that is the case - human nature.</p>
<p>Back to the part that mattered...</p>
<p>"This software driver package will install the WHQL graphics driver for the Intel® HD Graphics 3000/2000 &amp; Intel® HD Graphics 4000/2500 for Windows 8* Release Preview."</p>
<p>Intel has drivers out for Windows Server 2012 for other devices, but obviously not for the one you are looking at.&nbsp; Just because they have one for Windows 8 doesn't mean it will work in Windows 2012.</p>
<p>Your issue is with Intel and what drivers they provide, not Microsoft (as I said already.)</p>
<p>The drivers you linked to are for the Release Preview (first off) of Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I were you, I would try any Windows Server 2008/2008 R2 drivers for the product in question...&nbsp; Although my cursory search shows that none exist for that chipset (likely because Windows Server is not a market Intel pushes for that chipset) - so then I
 would suggest trying the Windows 7 driver.&nbsp; Using a Windows 8 PreRelease driver is obviously NOT giving you the results you desire.</p>

            <p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those apps that you have added in the lock screen personalization will only notify you with the respective content&nbsp;of the app. We cannot actually see the app in the Lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not receiving notifications then It might be an issue with the user account. I suggest you to sign out from the user account and sign in again with the Microsoft Account and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the Spotlight picture, please refer to the post of Ramesh Srinivasan and check</p>

    <title>Speed Adjustment in Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Speed Adjustment in Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 and 14.08.117.0416 of Windows Live Movie Maker. &nbsp;In the past I have been able to adjust the speed of clips. &nbsp;I can no longer find this option in my Video Tools, any tabs, drop down menus, or anywhere on my tool ribbon. &nbsp;Is there an
 update or plug-in that I need to install or is this option simply no longer available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.&nbsp; First you need to look to the top on your screen and click on the “Tools” option.&nbsp; You will get a little drop down menu and the very last thing
 listed is something that says “Options”.&nbsp; Go ahead and click on that.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;You will now be in the menu for options and at the very top you will see three different tabs, this means there are three different sections of the “options” menu that you could be in.&nbsp; The different sections are “General”, “Advanced”, and “Compatibility”.&nbsp;
 You want to make sure you are in “Advanced” so you will want to click on the “Advanced” button.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Towards the top of the page you will see an area that says “Default Durations” and under there you will see where it says Picture Duration and Transition Duration, each of which has a number displayed to the right.&nbsp; You now have the option to change these
 number…increase them if you want your slides to last longer and decrease if you want to go quicker.&nbsp; There are little arrows pointing up and down just to the right of the number.&nbsp; Clicking on the arrow pointing up will increase the number and slide duration,
 while the downward arrow will decrease the duration.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;Once you have it set just right.&nbsp; Look to the bottom right corner and click on the “OK” button and you will have just successfully changed the duration of slides in your movie.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hello Antony, yes those updated did install correctly, but it seems to be those updated which are causing the problem. The first time the updates installed and the problem occurred, I did a system
 restore to before the install and everything worked fine. As soon as the updates installed again, problem returned. I spend several hours last night with online support, and they could not figure it out and moved it to tier two. They were supposed to have
 called me this AM but have not. Getting very frustrated. </span></p>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, I have recovery key to save in the my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>BUT I delete it when I reinstall windows 10, because I think it's a old recovery key in the Microsoft account so that I DELETE it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft be able to help me rollback the record in Microsoft account?</p>
<p>It's very important for me, It's 2T pictures for my memories.</p>

<p>Since you have deleted your recovery key and don't have a backup copy of it, your last option will be resetting your computer to its default factory settings. To do this, kindly follow the steps provided under the
<strong>Reset your PC</strong> section in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            problems with outgoing mail via Windows Mail in Vista</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many posts on here and tried many things, but nothing seems to work. I hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is relating to work email and every once in a while everyone's outgoing email gets blocked. It will start going through a little at a time sporadically until the issue finally resolves itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the error message:<br />
The message could not be sent. The authentication setting might not be correct for your outgoing e-mail [SMTP] server. For help solving this problem, go to Help, search for "Troubleshoot Windows Mail", and read the "I'm having problems sending e-mail" section.
 If you need help determining the proper server settings, please contact your e-mail service provider.<br />
<br />
The rejected e-mail address was '.................'. Subject 'test', Account: ' ................ (1)', Server: 'smtp-server.wi.rr.com', Protocol: SMTP, Server Response: '451 Outbound mail refused - 72.131.12.29 - See http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/support/topics/internet/email-setup.html
 [R0209002]', Port: 25, Secure(SSL): No, Server Error: 451, Error Number: 0x800CCC79</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can use two different servers through our time warner account. One is smtp-server.wi.rr.com and the other is smtp.biz.rr.com. We have a database program that we will send out mass emails in, and for that we use smtp.biz.rr.com. We switched from smtp-server.wi.rr.com
 when it started refusing to send out the emails. For all of the other individual email accounts we use the smtp-server.wi.rr.com. It seems it would make sense to just switch the servers for the other accounts, but with Vista Windows mail we are not able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we get the user name and password in for the account and try to send mail a sign on box comes up and asks the mail user to sign in again but at this point it will not accept the log on information and this is where we are stuck in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the smtp-server.wi.rr.com server error, we have tried a combination of everything. We have turned off firewalls also during the process of trying to send mail with both of the servers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one has answers and we simply can not go on like this. Please help.</p>

            <p>Today we had the problem again. Seems to be happening about once a month and can last anywhere from an hour to 24 hours with emails sitting in outboxes and slowly getting filtered through eventually, (like there is some kind of bottleneck?) And then all
 at once, it frees up. I had Time Warner look at my computer through remote assistance and there was no resolution. They have no answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to switch my server for my windows mail from the residential to the business, but I get to the end of the process and it will refuse to authenticate the password, although, we know it is the correct information and have used it in our database program
 with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea at all about what could be causing this?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In our organization we have a mix of Skype for Business and Lync users. Does this have any consequences for PSTN conferencing solution&nbsp;from Microsoft? Can a Lync user sign up for a PSTN conferencing license and use it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Mia,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>For the question “Can a Lync user sign up for a PSTN conferencing license and use it?”, the answer is yes, you can assign the PSTN conferencing license to the users with Lync client installed.</p>
<p>However, to ensure users schedule PSTN conferencing properly, I suggest you upgrade both the Outlook client and the Lync client to the latest version (Skype for Business 2016/Outlook 2016).</p>
<p>Here are the articles for your reference:</p>

<h2>            Computer locked</h2>
                    <p>i have Windows 10 on my Dell Inspron 620 and i have locked myself out. &nbsp;When i try to log in it says, “an administrator has restricted sign in. &nbsp;To sign in, make sure your device is connected to the internet, and have your administrator sign in first.” &nbsp;Well,I
 am the only person that uses it and I have administrative rights but I cannot get past this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought i would just reinstall Windows and that would be that. &nbsp;Nope, think again. &nbsp;It will not let me boot from a disk, which i have to admit is very impressive though keep in mind, i am clearly no genius. &nbsp;Can someone please help?<br />

            Hi, Trujack
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />	
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<h2>            Windows 10&#58;  How to specify a drive for the installation package&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to upgrade to W10 for my parents' computer through the assisted technology upgrade page. &nbsp;For some reason, the installer want to only download the upgrade package to the "D" drive (which is a small backup partition). &nbsp;The download always fails
 since the space is inadequate. &nbsp;The C drive has 200 GB of free space but I do not see a way to indicate to the webpage where I want the download to be placed (or to at least change the drive location of where the download should go). &nbsp;I cannot seem to find
 the answer in these user groups. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with changing the drive location for Windows 10 installation as your D drive doesn’t have the required space. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Devices with a 32 GB hard drive or older devices with full hard drives, might need additional storage space to complete the upgrade. If you don’t have&nbsp;sufficient space, try removing files or apps you no longer need or use Disk Cleanup
 to free up space.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">During the upgrade, you&nbsp;might be asked to free up space on your device or attach an external drive with sufficient space to continue with the upgrade. If you attach an external drive, make sure to keep it in a safe place after the
 upgrade in case you need it for recover options.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know a few information before we assist you:</span></p>
<p><span>Are you trying to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows Store or an installation disc?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and the model of your PC?</span></p>
