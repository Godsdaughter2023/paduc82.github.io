    <title>wma and wmv files no longer play in Windows Media Player&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bribrad  say:</h3>
<h2>            wma and wmv files no longer play in Windows Media Player&#63;</h2>
                    I can no longer play wma or wmv files in Windows Media Player 11.&nbsp;Other files play and these files play in other programs ( eg. Media Centre / VLC ) . Until recently they worked fine. It seems to be connected to User Accounts Controls as when I turn this
 off they play as normal, but I would prefer to have them turned on. How can I resolve this problem?

            I have not solved the problem. Standard user accounts will not play wmv or wma in Windows Media Player. The Administrator account will play wma files normally but will only play wmv with sound but no picture unless I install K lite codec pack or Vista
 codec pack with user account control tuned off. I am wondering if Media Player application files have been damaged ( when I click on wmp.dll in System32 it says module did not load/not found).Maybe installing K lite or some other program has permanently damaged
 WMP? I am unable to use System Restore as I have no restore points before this problem began.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It appears that the dll file called provider dll is not starting as expected and is causing this issue. This file might be installed with any recent software that you installed. It is possible that the file is conflicting with system tasks
 and causing this issue. I would suggest you to uninstall the application that you installed recently and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you make a note of product key details so that you can install it later on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer this link to boot the computer in safe mode:

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above steps didn’t help, then I would suggest you to restore the computer to an earlier date prior to this issue and check. Refer to the section ‘restore your PC to an earlier point in time’ in this article:</span></p>

<h2>            Trying to format my DELL XPS L502X without Windows 7 CD</h2>
                    I'm trying to format my DELL XPS L502X because whenever i start the laptop up, it goes into Startup recovery and for other reasons. So I planned to do a full system format. However, I realised that I haven't received a Windows 7 CD required to start the
 formatting. How can I format my Laptop and is there anyway to back up my data stored in the laptop?<br />

 files and fis them if they are different then they should be. I do not know for a fact it will change the images back though.</p>

            Apparently it is a bug, if you leave it to complete download &amp; install it should be fine. Stopping it will either just start the download again or try to download twice at the same time - 1 with a resume download &amp; another fresh download.
<br />You can offer feedback on this via windows key + F.
<br />Also make sure Windows is running the latest version &amp;/or cumulative updates.

            I've already paused and restarted the download multiple times, is it still alright if i unpause it now and let it download all the way? Because i don't want to suddenly be downloading like 5 copies of the game.

<h2>            Saved movie file different to edited movie</h2>
                    <p>So this has been something which has been winding me up for the last 6 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a movie which is a few clips trimmed and placed together, very simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm talking in the video so it's really important the timing of these trimmed clips is exact. It's exactly as I'd like it in the project file of movie maker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the problem arises when I save the file and it gets exported. In the resulting .mp4 the beginning is cut off and various other points which are clipped are changed, with certain parts running too long and other parts stopping abruptly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried saving and re-saving this through various different settings and playing round copying new clips in etc, but nothing's working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to upload this to YouTube and the standard it's at when it's saved is just awful. Anyone got any ideas why the exported file is different to the project video?</p>

            <p>Most often when I find that the preview within Movie Maker doesn't match the exact timing in the final movie, the issue is the source clips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what clip types you are using, but as a test, try converting your source file to .wmv format and using that format instead. Hopefully that should give you a preview and a final movie that are the same.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 shutting down on bootup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taras-dad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 shutting down on bootup</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem on my tablet with Windows 10 installed. Every time I try to boot into Windows I get a "shutting down" message as soon as Windows 10 starts to load. It continues to load with the "shutting down" message displayed until it gets to the
 login screen where it does indeed shut down. The only thing I can think that may have caused it is that I was in the process of upgrading drivers on my Dell Latitude 10 tablet when it started. I think either a driver was corrupted or something in the registry
 was damaged. My problem is that because it's a tablet I don't have the standard boot options (safe mode, repair, etc) available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'm also posting on the Dell site in hopes that there may be some assistance for this issue.)</p>

<h2>            All programs open Windows Media Player&#33; All icons look like WMP icons too...</h2>
                    Hello I work on computers and this is the first time I have ever seen a laptop that was upgraded to Windows 7 open nearly 90% of all programs to open Windows Media Player. I tried to remove the Windows Media player link file association but it doesn't
 work, I scanned for viruses, nothing found, I was able to do a temporary workaround of removing the windows media player feature which also has to remove media center and then I can open other programs again like word, solitaire, etc. I then tried to enable
 but majority of programs start to open Winodws media player and have all icons look like WMP icons..... I don't know why this is happening or how to fix.. Any help would be great. thx

            Not sure how to perform that? but I do have Norton and regularly update my virus definitions.&nbsp; I have similar issues happening when I am on safe mode as well.&nbsp; I have performed freeing disk space regularly as the memory seems to continue being drained:
 but according to Mcafee, the constancy of the debugger application is reason for the memory being used up.&nbsp;the Any suggestions.

<p>You could use a program (if you can get it started) call SpaceSniffer this shows you where your drive space is being used up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good malware scan is Trojan Remover (A&nbsp;Available&nbsp;at&nbsp;www.simplysup.com)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you checked RAM usage or used a program i.e. a memtest to check RAM usage</p>

<p>These are programs that you download and after you run them and post the results, we can analyse more.</p>
<p>SpaceSniffer will see where you drive space is being used up.</p>
<p>Trojan Remover is a good malware scanner and remover.</p>

<p>You can disable Dr.Watson, but the reason Dr.Watson is showing is because its a program debugger which helps you&nbsp;diagnose a program issues to you can fix them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can disable Dr.Watson first to see if you are happy with that way. Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/188296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/188296</a>&nbsp;to find out from Microsoft how to disable it.</p>

<p>As Mike Hall suggested, first locate the keyboard utility and look to change the key assignment there.</p>
<p>If that option is not available, you may wish to try changing the default program for opening music files. I don't believe that the keyboard music&nbsp;'hotkey' attempts to specifically open Windows Media Play, rather it opens the program assigned as the default
 for music.</p>
<p>So you'll need to get to the&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel's Default Programs&nbsp;</strong>applet. To access it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, then&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong> (midway up the right hand side)</li><li>Within the&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click on&nbsp;<strong>Programs</strong> (not the options, just the larger word&nbsp;<strong>Programs</strong>). (If you have your Control Panel&nbsp;set to show<strong>All Control Panel Items</strong>, then the Default&nbsp;Programs&nbsp;applet
 will already be visible and available directly)&nbsp;</li><li>The second group of options should be&nbsp;<strong>Default Programs</strong>. The two options here that should interest you are:<br />
<strong>Make a file type always open in a specific program</strong> and (more importantly)&nbsp;<strong>Set your default programs</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>You should find everything you need there.</p>

<p><em><strong>Ok when I was playing Skyrim on my&nbsp; white original 360 when I got hit by a flash of light aka frost from a dragon or glare from snow, picture would blank out and I mean totally blank and then brake up. I'd have to shut down to play again but

<p>I also played Skyrim on an original white 360 refurb that replaced my 360 bought in 2006. &nbsp;Flashes would sometimes cause my screen to go black for about 1 sec, followed by complete recovery and normal game play. It was only a problem if I happened to be
 in intense combat at the time. Never had to shut down though. &nbsp;So, there IS some problem with flashes, will be interesting to see what others say. &nbsp;If you transfer your Gamertag account from old 360 to new 360, I think you can transfer all your games, DLCs
 and saves. &nbsp;Otherwise, probably not. </p>

<p>IF your old Xbox 360 is out of warrenty and not working right &nbsp;TRY this</p>
<p>take it apart ( carefuly) give it a good clean with a vacume cleaner ( as you will note that vents are clocked with dust /dirt.)
</p>
<p>next , take out CD rom drive and break seals to clean inside, oil moving parts,cogs ect ( but dont get any on the drive bands).</p>
<p>( (LIGHT MACHINE oil only (as in electric razor oil) ) then just put back together, also buy a dvd lens cleaner ( £4, on amazon ) run it and hey presto no prob, s on mine now</p>

<p>Actually, you are better off using dielectric grease for lubrication as machine oil is a bit thin and gums up rather quickly with dust, but to each their own.</p>
<p>Getting the dust out is a must for all electronics but especially for the xbox with how hot they run when graphics intensive processes are running. If you don't feel like opening your xbox, you could also use compressed air on it while holding a vacuum to
 another vent. This will give you the push/pull needed to dislodge and carry out a good deal of the grime.</p>
<p>Also for the question above about moving a game... yes you can. Use a USB drive and you can copy/move your game saves and profile. If you go into the settings of the console you should see a spot for memory. This is the area you'll find your game which includes
 your game saves.</p>

<p>WHAT? &nbsp;That's ridiculous. &nbsp;If it's out of warranty, it's absolutely within your right to work on it if you wish and what facts do you have to back up that a person would be perma banned for this? lol &nbsp; &nbsp;It's basic maintenance of your console. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The only thing I would add to it is to watch a youtube video of someone doing it first and THEN do it, if you feel you need to. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t install Vista Service Pack 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> voxstellarum9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install Vista Service Pack 2</h2>
                    <p><span>Marilyn has helped me before with Windows Automatic Download problems...well, I'm back, Marilyn :(<br />
<br />
Vista Service Pack 2 (KB948465) did not install&nbsp;yesterday morning via my Windows Automatic Download.&nbsp; When the "failed" dialog box came up, the error code given was 80070490.&nbsp;(Since&nbsp;you helped me with my previous&nbsp;automatic download problem, everything has been
 just fine until this SP2 download.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I then tried a "manual" download via the Microsoft Download website - this also did not work.&nbsp; A link was provided directing me to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb947366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb947366</span></a>.&nbsp; It suggested downloading "System Update Readiness Tool for Vista (KB947821), which I did, ran it, then rebooted and tried Windows Automatic
 Download again.&nbsp; It still failed to install, with the same code (80070490) given.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
During all this, and reading various troubleshooting suggestions, I realized that I needed to disable my virus protection, spyware protection, etc.&nbsp; So I did that, then tried Windows Automatic Download again.&nbsp; Still it failed.&nbsp; Then I tried the manual download
 (I had saved the executable file to my "Download" folder).&nbsp; But it still did not work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Another troubleshooting place suggested turning off the antispyware/virus programs, rebooting, and opening in safe mode - which I did, then tried the downloaded executable file I'd previously saved&nbsp; to my "Download" folder.&nbsp; But it still didn't work.&nbsp; This
 time, the resulting dialog box gave me a tiny bit more information: "Installation was not successful.&nbsp; Element not found.&nbsp; Details (a link, which I clicked), and it then read: Error: ERROR_NOT_FOUND (0x80070490).<br />
<br />
So I've now exhausted what little expertise I have - have&nbsp;you a suggested what I should try next??<br />
<br />
Thank you!</span></p>

            To All Concerned:<br />
<br />
I have finally managed to get my problem solved...Vista SP2 in now installed!&nbsp; Someone in a different thread suggested rebooting, then doing a Vista repair installation from my Vista reinstallation disk.&nbsp; These were the instructions given:<br />
<br />
1. Close all applications, and then restart the computer.<br />
2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.<br />
3. In the Setup window, click <strong>Install Now.<br />
</strong>4. Click <strong>Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended).<br />
</strong>5. Type the CD key, if you are prompted to do this.<br />
6. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms.<br />
7. On the <strong>Which kind of installation do you want?</strong> screen, click <strong>
Upgrade</strong>.<br />
8. When the installation is complete, restart your computer, and then try to install the updates.<br />
<br />
Doing this did not affect any applications, files, or data currently on my computer.&nbsp; It was a VERY long process (I've been working on this all day), and once done, then you need to have Windows Automatic Update reinstall quite a few updates...which also took
 quite a while.&nbsp; And then the installation of SP2 takes quite a while - so be prepared to spend a significant chunk of time doing this.&nbsp; But it worked!!&nbsp; YEAH!!<br />
<br />
I hope this might be the answer to others struggling with this same problem.&nbsp; <br />

    <title>Problem Ejecting SD Cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken r goldman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Ejecting SD Cards</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Professional with Service Pack 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently, when I ejected an SD card, either by left clicking on it, or by using the Safe Eject function, the card and its information would disappear from Windows Explorer and all would be good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I have noticed that when I eject the card, the directory for it is still visible in Windows Explorer, even though I have been informed that it is safe to remove the card. &nbsp;This does not damage the content of the card, it is easily access, but,
 for some reason, the card will now not work in my Olympus camera until I reformat it in another camera. &nbsp;This only started to happen recently, in the past, everything worked as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few other data points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I have this problem using three different card readers, so I don't think it is a hardware problem with the card readers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;When I put these cards in my Mac laptop I can access them, properly eject them, and have them work in my Olympus camera</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;This is a relatively new problem that I did not have had before</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Thank you! Your model absolutely supports Win 10

<br />Here is the link to all your drivers for this particular model:

Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />I’d update your BIOS (link above) and then I’d update the video driver from this page. Their are several different graphics cards your model could have so, and they are all listed there. (Alternatively, Click start and type “Device Manager” - and select it from the list of results.
<br />
<br />Expand Display Adapters, then right-click on your video driver and select Update Driver. 
<br />
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software.)
<br />
<br />Once your video driver is updated, the video and sound should sync up.

<br />Let me know!

            Hi Nikola
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>Surface Pro Support is just awful. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james bm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Support is just awful.</h2>
                    <p>I have 4 Microsoft Surface Pro 4s. Judging by the warranty service I have received to date, they will be my last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a laptop dropped by an employee, no worries I thought, we've got the Microsoft Extended damage warranty. Went online, to find they had neglected to add it to the device, even though it was on order. I went through the infuriating AI app on the website
 which gave me all the useful links to things I found easily on google with 30 seconds of work. After finally typing in the right amount of nonsense to be offered to talk to a person I am told support is only available between 2pm and 5am in my locale. London,
 UK! Great, who would support this back water little village during their own business hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call the generic support number, go through 6 menu options to get to surface support and then have the joy of being on hold for 42 minutes. I am met with apologies and we will get this resolved etc etc... Great. They added the support to my laptop and
 opened the repair ticket. Printed off the labels sent off the laptop. I had to find a spare laptop for the user to use whilst his was being repaired. He gets a 6 year old Dell Latitude, it's slow, but it works. I find it hard to believe I will have a 6 year
 old surface pro knocking around in as many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward 2 weeks, a box arrives, and the website says device repaired. Awesome. Open it up to find the same laptop, dent and broken screen. Oh and a nice letter to inform me that the standard warranty does not cover dents. Obviously now I'm f'ing livid.
 I get straight back on the website, go to device repair, confirm the Accidental Damage Protection is still in date for the device. It is. Ok let me try again, I click on the options for support. The only options I have are to replace the pen or a cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go through the above 1 hour nonsense on the phone to get through to someone and they are very sorry. It's my fault for not specifying it was an ADP claim. So how do I do that? The repair was initiated by support. There is no where to specify it on my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well you send it to the exact same place and pay £45 excess. Right and they couldn't just contact me while they had my laptop and say... "You have sent back a laptop with a dent in it, we can see you have ADP, would you like to pay the £45 excess and we
 will send you a new one" No. Obviously not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I will be without a laptop for a month I ask? Oh no we can send you a new one in 2 days, and then you can send the old one back. Why isn't this just the norm? Oh because you have to pay for the new one, and then it gets contra credited when they receive
 the old one. Right. By this point I have given my last f. Pay the money, pay the charge. Just get my user back up and running. Stick the whole lot on my business card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no dedicated number to get through to support even if you pay the extra for the super support. Certainly not business level support and the website is totally infuriating. You really only miss things when they are gone, after a decade of being spoiled
 with Dell's pro support I am running back with open arms. I cannot wait to rotate this surface pro's out of my asset list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to replace a screen with Dell a couple of months ago. The new screen arrived next day and they took the old one away. No fuss, no charges, all done on an online chat that took about 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else relate to this business experience?</p>

<p>Hello and thank you. I'm afraid this didn't help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was actually provided an update to OS 10.13.5 when prompted. I tossed Skype For Business app, preferences, keychain login and then reinstalled Skype for business for MAC. What I'm experiencing is that Skype appears to work until I open Outlook and then
 Skype it freezes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts, it appears to be a conflict between these two applications?</p>

<h2>            Does Microsoft hate AMD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>what a mess! I can't get the Windows 10 Creators update 1709 to install on a brand new build. It also totally crashed a previous stable PC when installing a printer driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the security updates install fine, but when the creators update 1709 installs, it blue screens and I have to reload from scratch. I have disconnected all extraneous USB devices, made sure all drivers were installed, made user an administrator, activated
 windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This notion that you have to unplug all USB devices is stupid. I was using WiFi to install updates, switched to wired, still crashed. I'm down to a only a USB KB and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replaced the memory also, even though I'm not getting any hardware errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm installing on an AMD build. It's like Microsoft hates AMD all of a sudden. Even video drivers on previously stable PCs no longer work. What the heck is going on?</p>

<h2>            Mixed OneDrive and Desktop Folders</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 2. I keep all my personal files in a Micro SDXC to save space in the SSD which I use for programs. OneDrive was referenced to this memory card. I had to change the Micro SDXC for one of larger capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing that, I moved the OneDrive folder to the Desktop folder and now they are mixed together! Whatever I have in OneDrive shows in the desktop and also everything I had in the Desktop is stored in my OneDrive now. I changed the location of the OneDrive
 folder again, but now the desktop actually shows the image from that new OneDrive location. How can I revert this?</p>

<h2>            I Bought A Game and Is Asking Me to Pay Again After Purchase</h2>
                    So I bought the game Two Worlds II through Xbox Live. Proof: http://i41.tinypic.com/1pwfg9.jpg However, my Xbox froze and shut off so when I got back online, I went ahead and tried to redownload it, but it said I had to pay for the game. I shouldn't need
 to pay for a full game if I already purchased it once. I'm not asking for a refund but I would REALLY like to be able to play this game. Someone please help! Another Xbox Consumer, Marilush

            DirectX 6.1 will not work on systems using NT technology (Windows 7 is NT 6.1, if you like, and compatible with DirectX versions &gt; DX8). The trial version won't work on modern CPUs, too.&nbsp;"The current online puzzle demos will not run on Pentium III machines
 or higher. However, all puzzles in the retail version of Pandora's Box will run on Pentium III computers and above." (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/pandorasbox/downloads.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/games/pandorasbox/downloads.htm</a>)&nbsp;There's a
 patch allowing that but only for the retail version. I tried to run the trial in all compatibility settings, always with the same error: "Unable to create DirectDraw surface. Make sure that DirectX is installed, and then try again." To sum it up - try another
 puzzle game.
