            <p><strong>Option 1: System Restore.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This option will allow you to roll your PC back to a working restore point.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Any system changes made since that restore point will be
 lost.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the System Recovery screen, select&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System Restore</strong>. Your PC will restart and prepare the System Restore experience.</li><li>Choose an account name to continue and enter the last good password used on the PC.</li><li>In the System Restore window, click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;and select the&nbsp;<strong>Show more restore points</strong>&nbsp;check box.</li><li>If one is shown, select a restore point at or before the Webroot installation and follow the prompts to complete the system restore.</li><li>When returned to the sign-in screen, if you still can’t sign in, perform the same steps and select an earlier restore point until you are able to sign in.</li><li>Once signed in, we recommend you uninstall Webroot until Webroot has shipped an update to address this problem.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have any system restore points, you will need to do a system Refresh.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This will restore all Windows 10 operating system files, and also backup your files and folders.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Any programs installed
 will need to be reinstalled.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This process requires you provide the original Windows 10 media that came with your computer, as well as any media you used to install other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 2: System Refresh.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>This option will restore key system files.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It will uninstall any third- party applications, but won’t affect personal settings and files.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>From the System Recovery screen, select Refresh. You’ll see a screen that explains what actions will occur.</p>
<p>Your PC will restart and a refresh will occur. When this is completed, there will be a file saved on your desktop with a list of programs that were uninstalled.<span>&nbsp;</span>Don’t reinstall Webroot until an update to fix this problem is
 released, but feel free to reinstall any other programs on the list.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Sign in with the same password you used to start the refresh process.<span>&nbsp;</span>Once you’ve signed in, if you have changed your password online you’ll be prompted
 to enter that new password once Windows 10 fully loads.</p>

            I have never been able to get the dashboard to run - it always stops with "initial job pending." &nbsp;I read through the thread and have already done everything mentioned in it - still no luck. &nbsp;I contacted Seagate last week and someone named James said he
 tried to send me a file to download on my computer so that Seagate could have information it needed to fix this problem - the file never came through (meaning it never showed up in my inbox). &nbsp;I wrote back to James and never got a reply. &nbsp;

            <p>okay that file would be in your temp files upon installation of Seagate backup plus, if you have clean your temp files then it would no longer be there.</p>

<p>uninstall the dashboard backup you have now and reinstall the download from above, read the instructions, and then once downloaded go to the thread listed in my last reply, and do the instructions there on the reboot.... file.<br />
</p>
<p>It appears that you will have to get the dashboard running before the scheduled task will run.</p>

            Okay - let me just make sure I understand what to do:
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;Download the software from the link you provided</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Extract the zip files</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;Install the downloaded file and re-boot.</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;Before I launch the Dashboard, run %temp%</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----sort the folders according to time and open the latest folder</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----the folder name would be a combination of letters and numbers like in the product key or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registration key</div>
<div>6. Delete the file bootvalidator.prq&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let me know if the above is correct. &nbsp;Also, how do I open the file in the temp folder?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks, again!</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Save the file to your desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>uninstall the dashboard already on your machine that is not working</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>reboot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Try deleting the rebootvalidator.prq file from the temp folder</div>
<div><br />
<div>Steps:</div>
<div>1.Start the installation of dashboard</div>
<div><br />
<div>2.Type %temp% in the run window</div>
<div><br />
<div>3.Look for folder that gets created for the installation of seagate dashboard</div>
<div>----sort the folders according to time and open the latest folder</div>
<div>-----the folder name would be a combination of letters and numbers like in the product key or registration key</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Delete the file ebootvalidator.prq and the installation would start</div>
<div>------------------------------------------</div>
<div>you do not have to sort folders unless you want to you are looking for the dashboard .EXE file</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>to get to temp files</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>go to start, run, type in %temp% and press ok, this will open the temporary files located in Documents and settings for your user name.<br />

<div>9 pm over here and I am checking out for the night, will check back in tomorrow. :)</div>

            I did everything you said to do but no luck. &nbsp;The program runs in Task Manager and two items are listed in Scheduled Tasks but both never run and the Dashboard always says "initial job pending." &nbsp;Can you think of anything else that might be causing this
 problem?

            Hi Elizabeth,
<div><br />
<div>I went into Scheduled Tasks, chose "run" and clicked it - nothing happened. &nbsp;It didn't clear or re-set or start the process again. &nbsp;The program is definitely running - I just can't back up the files because the task never runs no matter how I set the backup
 plan. &nbsp;It's really frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes - that's where I went for support. &nbsp;The item is still under warranty and I'll try calling Seagate again tomorrow. &nbsp;UGH!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>

<h2>            Windows Backup</h2>
                    Previous to recent versions of Windows 10, the way to assure you could restore your computer in the case of a disaster was to have a full system image backup. It appears that part of Windows is going away. The new File History backup seems to just backup
 my data. What is the official Microsoft procedure for how to protect my computer against a complete loss such as a hard drive failure?

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />The information below I provide is thorough and verbose, but its the truth regarding Backup in Windows 10. and the alternatives you will need to consider. 
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
<br />

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in Settings &gt; Autosave.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller so they stay current if you need to reimage C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><blockquote>What is the official Microsoft procedure for how to protect my computer against a complete loss such as a hard drive failure?
</blockquote>
<p>The official Microsoft policy is to use a third-party image backup application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This policy was adopted with the release of the Fall Creators Update (v.1709) during the fall of 2017. This update deprecated (meaning 'abandoned') System Image Builder which, until that time, was the only Windows 10 utility that was supported for making
 image backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's official pronouncement is here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034825/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-fall-creators-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>where Microsoft states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>We recommend that users use full-disk backup solutions from other vendors</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, there is no shortage of excellent full-disk backup software from well-established developers. If you are interested in learning about full-disk backup software, which is also known as image software, image backup software and system image software,
 I'll be glad to help as will others in this group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Image backups have been a staple of computer users for many years, so there's nothing new about this. If interested I'll gladly explain.</p>

            The suggestion was close to what resolved our issue.&nbsp; We actually contacted Dell Premier Support.&nbsp; The technician did some uninstalls of audio drivers, reinstalled, some clean up work of suspicious apps (our McAfee seems to be weak). The headphones (non-bluetooth)
 seemed to be working.&nbsp; After a couple of hours work, he hung up.&nbsp; After the restart, the blue screen with "Windows did not seem to load properly..." came up&nbsp; I responded to the email follow up and the technician called back right away.&nbsp; He went through much
 of the same steps as before.&nbsp; We seem to be OK now: 2:30-6:30pm!&nbsp; The only issue left is that we still see the "A Conexant audio device could not be found. The application will now exit."&nbsp; It seems to not be an issue, but time will tell.&nbsp; I will keep Ruth
 Buruga's instructions handy!&nbsp; Thank you, Ruth.

            <p>Hi Furydeath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have downgraded multiple times, so it should work.&nbsp; Try going into system settings and typing in "downgrade."&nbsp; Then downgrade from W10 (Windows 10).&nbsp; If that does not work try to delete/uninstall your security system then try downgrading.&nbsp; The security
 system sometimes might prevent the Upgrade or even downgrade of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of internet security or system security do you have?</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>dogwoodforest1,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand language bar (</span><span>toolbar that appears on your desktop)</span><span>
 is not showing up, please correct if I have misunderstood you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Was it appearing before?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Check to see if you have hidden the language bar</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open Regional and Language Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region, and then clicking Regional and Language
 Options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change display language &gt; change key boards &gt; on text services and input language &gt; under
<strong>language bar </strong>tab </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you choose first or second radio button as to how you wanted Language bar displayed? 3rd radio button is to hide.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Floating On Desktop
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Docked in taskbar</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Hidden</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You may want to install windows vista service pack 2</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to obtain the latest Windows Vista service pack</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reference:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>The IME language bar disappears, and you cannot input non-English characters after you close an Excel chart on a computer that is running the Korean

for some reason I must have pressed some shortcut and that's enabled the transparent windows and the thumbnail preview on taskbar of opened windows. I don't want that. I want the default taskbar settings of a single unlabelled button with all open files/windows
 stacked up vertically and neatly on top&nbsp;of&nbsp;each other. In other words I hate&nbsp;Aero and the way the taskbar is previewing content. I like the neat vertical look.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help? Cannot find anywhere in the help how to disable this and restore default settings.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />
<br />
Andy&nbsp;

            Hello Andy De Rosa,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
There is no way of changing that feature, even with keys. Using Basic is the only way that was designed to perform that function. However, you are able to select the other themes that you like the backgrounds for and copy the images and modify the basic theme
 with those images as a slideshow background.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Right-click desktop &gt; click Personalize<br />
&nbsp;- Click Desktop Background &gt; right-click each image you want to save &gt; select Make a Copy (place the copy in a folder in your picture library&nbsp;that you want to use)<br />
<br />
Repeat for each image throughout each theme. Then select all the images to be contained within the background slideshow.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

<h2>            Internet connection limited, Windows 8</h2>
                    Internet connection
<div>I have new laptop with newest windows 8. I could connect with protected WiFi network at home. During connecting I had to give the password and it worked. Now I moved to students hall and there is open
 WiFi, but when I try to connect it shows limited access. Can open any webside<br />
<br />
But at the same time I can connect to this network with my smart phone. Although the network is open, after I connected with my phone I could only open one website where I had to give my code and password that I received in the office.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How do I connect to this WiFi on my laptop?</div>
I run troubleshooter, that doesn't help, I turned of my antyvirus, I try to update my drivers, but I don't have internet connection, I also tried writing many commands do cmd which I found online. &nbsp;None of this staff worked.

<h2>            Skype download page keeps opening after an abandoned install.</h2>
                    <p>I abandoned an install on skype as i forgot to uncheck the make bing and msn my default providers etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went on to install skype correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however any time i close a game (Sometimes a normal programme) this -&nbsp;https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/?intsrc=client-_-windows-_-7.40-_-abandoninstall - webpage opens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did an uninstall for skype to see if that'd sort it and then cancelled the install again. it opens TWO windows any time i close a specific type of programme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so it's linked to the abandoned install but i cant for the life of me figure out how on earth to stop it.</p>

<h2>            Combine 2 partitions of the same disk. Receive error&#58; &#34;There is not enough space on the disk&#40;s&#41; to complete this operation&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought and installed an SSD. I installed windows on it and afterwards formatted my drive C and D, which is partitions of Disk 0. After deleting drive D from "Disk Management" it became unallocated space and I thus tried to extend C with D. I receive
 the following error: "There is not enough space on the disk(s) to complete this operation". I also tried to create a new simple volume from the unallocated drive but I receive the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshot of how it looks:</p>

            Hi Kosievan
<br />
<br />Having looked at your original screenshot I see a couple of problems
<br />
<br />Your System is installed on the SSD, but your EFI partition is on the 1TB data drive
<br />
<br />That drive must have een connected when Windows was installed, which is not the way to do that, all drives except for the system drive must be disconnected during a Windows installation
<br />
<br />If that EFI partition was not on the HDD, I would suggest just formatting that drive, as you don't seem to have any data on that drive
<br />
<br />Honestly, If it was me I would re-install Windows again on the SSD and wipe the HDD. It will be a bit of work, but worth it to have a correct partition layout
<br />
<br />If you do decide to go ahead with an install, disconnect the data cable form the HDD during the installation . ..

            Hi Kosievan
<br />
<br />What is that 914MB partition, is that the Windows Recovery Partition?
<br />
<br />With that partition between C and the unallocated space, you cannot extend C into that . . .
<br />
<br />Windows is extremely limited in its partitioning capability
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download the free version of AOMEI Partition Assistant
<br />
<br />Using that you will be able to extend C into the unallocatedspace, it will automatically move that 914MB partition to the right

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD drive not working</h2>
                    I have a HP laptop with Windows 7. My CD/DVD drive isn't working. Tried troubleshooting but received message that the problem was fixed but still exists. I place the DVD in the drive, I can hear it running, and every once in a while it makes a clicking
 noise, but nothing happens.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Was this a native Windows 7 install (made for Windows 7)&nbsp;or was the system upgraded from<br />
another version of Windows.<br />
<br />
If System originally had another version of Windows did you run the Upgrade Advisor and<br />
check the Compatibility Center for the CD/DVD compatibilty (and other devices as needed).<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center <br />

<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<h3> dustyowens  say:</h3>
<h2>            What bluetooth keyboards work with Surface 1 or RT 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I have the Surface RT with updated to windows 8.1. I am on my second blue surface magnetic key board. I had to return the first one because a few buttons like the Enter key didn't work on it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway I have the blue surface keyboard cover and have to say I am not used to flat keys with no feedback touch wise kind of doesn't work for me. Is there a brand like Logitech of Bluetooth keyboard that can wireless work with the surface? Also will having
 a Bluetooth keyboard along with a&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;mouse cause any&nbsp;signal trouble?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have gone to a Windows Comparability website and the keyboards all have "limited activity" for everyone so its kind of hard to know what Bluetooth keyboard will work. And if Bluetooth keyboards are a no go, what about the usb wireless ones or USB corded
 keyboards?</div>
                </div>

            The one I would recommend and it also has the best performance is the Microsoft Wedge Keyboard. &nbsp;You can find it in the Microsoft online Store.
<div><br />
<div>In general, almost all Bluetooth keyboards will "function" to include those designed for iPads. &nbsp;They do not have good performance and I have two of them myself. &nbsp;The only one that did work good was Apple's aluminum Bluetooth keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Microsoft Wedge Keyboard has a hard rubber cover that when removed, turns the keyboard on and the cover is hinged in the middle so that you can fold and shape it into a stand for the tablet. &nbsp;When finished, you put the cover back on and it shuts off
 the keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>USB keyboards; all of them work. &nbsp;I have a dozen of those things and all of them worked to include one that has a touchpad similar to a laptop keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Wireless keyboards will also work and I have two of those and have tested them on my RT.</div>

            <p>So you're saying it's DEFINITELY/CONFIRMED <strong>A VIRUS </strong>WHICH WILL COMPROMISE YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU SHOULD BLOCK IT AND CLEAN BOOT. This virus/trojan has been signed by Microsoft's own servers, meaning that the security of the system has been compromised
 and the system should be wiped completely clean and the Surface machine returned to Microsoft for a refund or warranty service to force-wipe the SSD in order to ensure that it is no longer on the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've inferred most of that from the link you just posted, but since the Microsoft representative in that post doesn't know what it is, recommends a clean boot, and does not claim that the executable is even from Microsoft, it seems that's the only safe thing
 to assume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I came here because I woke up to the message this morning on my Surface Pro 4. Luckily I'm within the 30 day return period so I can just send it back. Or did you (Microsoft) want to provide some actual information on what the file is so we know what
 to do with it?</p>

    <title>need help restoring banned account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlwartman  say:</h3>
<h2>            need help restoring banned account</h2>
                    As quickly as i can sum it up, i quit gaming a few years ago, but had quite a bit of DLC attached to my xbox live account, so i gave the login info to my son so he could benefit from the content i had already paid for. He got my account perm banned from
 xbox live in 2016 for doing ignorant childish things. I didn't game anymore, so i didn't pursue it at all.<br />
<br />
Fast forward. I'm getting into sim racing on the pc and purchased forza motorsports ultimate edition. not thinking about it, i bought it through the microsoft store on the same account that is banned from xbox live. now i have paid quite a bit of money for
 a game i can't even launch. I need help getting the ban on my account removed, or i need to figure out how to contact a microsoft rep about canceling the office 365 subscription attached to this account and getting a refund for my purchase. please advise.<br />
<br />
Thank You,
                </div>

<p>Right, i already went to the enforcement part and the "appeal decision" option is a grey box with an x in it, which i assume is Microsoft's way of saying "i don't want to hear it". I was hoping there is another way to open a dialog over this because transferring
 a half dozen windows licenses and and an office subscription is alot to go through over a 3 year old ban.&nbsp;</p>

            When an account is permanently banned, all associated content (game licenses, subscriptions, etc.) is lost. So the answer to your question, unfortunately, is yes.

<p>
</p><p>pretty much where i am at. no appeal on the ban, no refund on the content purchase. long story behind that, but i bought it a year ago. my pc at the time didn't have enough free space to install it. just built a new dedicated sim racing pc and this was one
 of the first things i tried to install. I spoke with a rep on the phone who tried several different ways to find a workable solution and we just kept running into closed corporate doors. great support rep and i can understand why those doors would be close
 by default. just sucked for my particular situation is all.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i DID find a way to not lose access to the content however. I am able to login under the account that is banned on xbox live and install Forza 7 and the DLC/VIP packs to my pc. I then had to unlink my primary account from my windows account and launch the game.
 it would then give me the option to login under my unbanned account and play the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to resolve error &#34;Save Failed&#34; in DOA5LR on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    I bought and own original game disk DOA5LR on Xbox One. The internal HDD is only about 43% used. Playing Dead or Alive 5 Last Round I constantly ger recurring error "Save Failed" from various actions, such as updating Game or Controller Options, Advancing
 through Story Mode where no progress gets saved whenever I exit/quit. Game is supposed to save progress routinely and any and all user config edits. What is causing this and how do I fix it? No other storage memory device is attached. Yes I have much DLC on
 system purchased online from Marketplace. Any help is appreciated. I'm sure this must be a common problem. Thanks.

</p><p>Hello El Onzo0</p>
<p>
Apparently this is a glitch that has the game that after a certain amount of photos or videos captured from it does not allow you to save any more. Try to delete some of those photos or videos and tell us if the problem was solved.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you a greeting

<p>No difference and no resolution. I have only a dozen or so saved pics and a few fight videos. On brand new Xbox One S console I bought yesterday, only 2% of 1TB internal storage is used AFTER fresh FULL game install, all online updates completed, and all
 nearly 200 DLC content items downoaded again and newly installed. SAME ERROR persists and displays constantly between menu navigation, even when I DID NOT CHANGE EDIT anything. still get "SAVE FAILED" with CONFIRM button.</p>

<p>Hey there El Onzo0!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's weird. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you, I would go ahead and try the steps here on our site at “<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Xbox One game won’t start or freezes during gameplay</a>”. I know you
 said that it's giving you say "Save failed" and not really freezing but the steps on the page actually help with a variety of gameplay issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a shot and let us know if it helps with the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Media Center -- Stuttering&#47;Freezing Video During - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Media Center -- Stuttering&#47;Freezing Video During Internet TV Playback</h2>
                    I recently "clean" installed Windows 7 Home Premium Edition&nbsp;over XP MCE 2005.&nbsp; I am having severe problems with video stuttering and frequently freezing during playback of Internet TV titles, e.g., old episodes of Star Trek.&nbsp; Frequently results in loud&nbsp;squawk/screech
 during freeze.&nbsp; Sometimes sounds exactly like a CD does when it gets stuck&nbsp;on an imperfection and goes into a&nbsp;rapid&nbsp;loop.&nbsp; The irony is that I can play back the
<em>exact</em> same titles via Fancast and have no performance issues whatsoever.&nbsp; The stuttering/freezing occurs
<em>only</em> during playback&nbsp;via Internet TV in Media Center.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My system is:<br />
Intel D945PVS Motherboard -- two different bioses tried (newest, next newest).<br />
Pentium D 3.0 GHz processor<br />
3.0 GB RAM 667 MHz<br />
nVidia GeForce GT 220, 1 GB VRAM, connected via HDMI to display at 1080p (verified newest driver) (second video card tried -- first was nVidia 210, 512 GB VRAM)<br />
MB-based Intel Gigabit network adapter, hardwired and reports gigabit connection speed<br />
Three different sound options tried -- Creative&nbsp;Soundblaster X-Fi Elite Pro; MB Based IDT HD Codec; nVidia HD Audio, via video card/HDMI).<br />
<br />
I have updated all drivers and installed all Windows updates.&nbsp; I could really use some help.&nbsp; I've done everything I can think of short of a repair upgrade/reinstall of the OS.&nbsp; Thanks, in advance, for your assistance.

<p><span>Hi Jebjr,</span></p>
<p><span>a) Apart from installing the K-lite codec pack what else did the MS tech told you to perform on the system?</span></p>
<p><span>Update the drivers for the Video and Audio card and uninstall all third party codec pack and check whether the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a Hardware compatibility check on your computer either by using Upgrade Advisor or visiting the Microsoft website.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check the compatibility status of your software and Hardware devices</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1b544e90-7659-4bd9-9e51-2497c146af15&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1b544e90-7659-4bd9-9e51-2497c146af15&amp;displaylang=en</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run an SFC scan.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Start button</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the
<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong> option</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the
 administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press Enter</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>A message will appear stating that
<strong>'The system scan will begin'.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>10.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>11.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information check the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></p>

            Well, finally solved the issue.&nbsp; Turns out that the lower level nVidia graphics cards I tried (the 210 and GT220) couldn't handle Internet TV through Windows Media Center at the high resolution I was trying to use&nbsp;(1920x1080, in my case).&nbsp; I pulled a higher
 end graphics card from one of my other computers (an nVidia 9800GT) and Internet TV played without incident for a couple of hours.&nbsp; I don''t know where the dividing line is between inadequate and adequate in terms of GPU performance, but the GT220 (which I
 think is about equivalent to a 9400GT)&nbsp;did not work and the 9800GT did.<br />
<br />
So, if you're having a skipping/stuttering problem, either try a lower resolution or a more powerful card.
