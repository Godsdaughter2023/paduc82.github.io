    <title>After installing Bing Desktop on Windows 10, Windows Update isn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After installing Bing Desktop on Windows 10, Windows Update isn&#39;t working correctly</h2>
                    I installed Bing Desktop on my tablet PC because I liked the daily wallpapers, yet the wallpapers weren't rotating like they should. The wallpaper only changed after a restart. I checked Windows Update to see if there were any updates available to fix
 this, but then Windows Update wasn't working correctly. It would take a very long time to check for updates, and I would either be greeted by the error 0x800705b4 or it would take a very long time to find any updates. I really don't want to reset my tablet
 or uninstall Bing Desktop. I don't want to disable Microsoft Updates either. There was a fix that was said to be permanent, but would only work for one day for me. I would have to do that fix every day in order to install updates. Is there any way to fix these
 two problems? (With Bing Desktop and Windows Update?) Thanks. I'm running the latest version of Windows 10 (not insider).

Okay, so I uninstalled Bing Desktop and ran the Windows Update troubleshooter. The troubleshooter said my PC was fine, yet I'm still having the same problems. How can I fix this without resetting my PC? Hopefully the anniversary update will fix this...

    <title>Dark Souls &#40;Original&#41; vs. Dark Souls 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vix sundown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dark Souls &#40;Original&#41; vs. Dark Souls 2</h2>
                    
<p>What do you guys think about DS2 vs DS1?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So far I have mixed feelings about DS2. It's a fun game and I've put a lot of hours into it. The coop is easier to do, so I like that. But I can't help but notice a few things that irritate me compared to the greatness that is DS1:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1. DS2 is a LOT easier. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing a Zelda game rather than Dark Souls.</p>
<p>2. In DS1, the worlds linked together in an intricate way, like a puzzle. Activating new shortcuts was part of the fun. Little of that exists in DS2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. No gradual damage of weapons and equipment requiring repair at the bonfire. So no need to save souls.&nbsp;This hurts the "survival horror" element of the game.</p>
<p>4. Invasions are practically nonexistent. This takes 99% of the tension and fear out of the game.</p>
<p>5. The Blue Sentinel covenant is worthless.</p>
<p>6. Way too many secondary items that are next to useless.</p>
<p>7. The blacksmiths that do special weapon upgrades appear too late in the game to be of much use.</p>
<p>8. Sorcery has been nerfed way too much, making the Sorceror class too weak.</p>
<p>9. We've gone from having a little bit of story to having no story, so we don't even know why we are fighting or what our goal is.</p>
<p>10. Hardly any epic cut scenes.</p>
<p>11. Movement controls have been made oversensitive, which can really screw you up in the platforming sections.</p>
<p>12. No explanation given in the beginning of the&nbsp;game on how to level up, when it was clear and easy in DS1.</p>
<p>13. Can no longer&nbsp;easily&nbsp;see if an item you want to buy will increase your stats or not.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Does any of this bother anyone else? I still like the game alright, but I may pass on a DS3.</p>

<p>1. I feel its easier because of the summoning and despawning of enemies when you die. Horrible mechanic.</p>
<p>2.No need to link them if you can wrap everywhere.</p>
<p>3. Yeah I don't mind this but at the same time you collect so many extra souls you can constantly level up.</p>
<p>4. Yup in my 70+ hours of playing NOT ONE INVASION and I play mostly as a human.</p>
<p>5. PRAISE THE SUN!</p>
<p>6. Yup reminds me of demon's souls so many herbs you don't need or use I just end up selling them to Gavel.</p>
<p>7. I don't know if they're useless how will you upgrade to +10</p>
<p>8. Sorcery is pretty amazing still. You just need sacrifice stuff like health and ADP</p>
<p>9.The story was pretty vague in part one as well.</p>
<p>10. Agreed every boss had the same red eyed vision thing and not much happened in them</p>
<p>11. At first the jump roll annoyed me but as time went on it became very useful and much better than double B button jump in DS I.</p>
<p>12. If you've played demon's souls it would have been pretty evident if you didn't level up at the bonfire you may have to interact with someone.</p>
<p>13. Also adding crystal or magic doesn't appear in stats or adding sorcery stats to yourself to see what has been boosted does suck.</p>
<p>With that said I felt a sense of accomplishment when I beat a boss in DS I I just shrugged and moved in DS II don't know why. Also the boss music is really really low maybe its just me but I downloaded the OST for DS II and none of the songs are familiar
 or as epic as the boss themes in DS I.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback, Mega Man. I haven't played Demon's Souls. It sounds like they incorporated elements of both games into DS2.</p>
<p>I agree that jumping is one thing that is improved in the game. The b-button double tap to jump was always a bit clunky in the original game.</p>
<p>One thing I miss is the shield kick. I liked kicking down the enemy's shield. Maybe there's a way to do this in DS2 and I just don't know about it.
</p>
<p>One thing about DS2 that is good or bad, depending on how you look at it, is that the game is LONG. It seems to me to be a lot longer than DS1. I've put way more hours into DS2 than I ever put into the original, and I still haven't beaten it yet. There's
 a lot to explore, even if most of the treasures you find are usually pretty crappy.</p>

<p>They pulled some stuff from demon's souls like the over abundance of healing items you don't use, a couple of blacksmiths instead of like 8 in DS I, and having to interact with someone who later helps you on your quests to level you up with that said Demon's
 souls is a totally different game then dark souls.</p>

<p>I tend to agree VIX. I can't quite put my finger on it. I've beaten DS1 six ways 'till Sunday, yet after completing DS2, I never had the urge to go back. And I loved every second of DS2 and Demon's Soul. When I was done I was done. After beating DS1 for
 the first time, I couldn't wait to jump back in for NG+. DS1 is just one of those rare masterpieces that doesn't come around very often. Even games within the same series can't capture the same magic. I just think that DS1 was/is just THAT good. Especially
 to the people who "got" it.</p>

<p>Invasion frequency does go up once you hit NG+, although not by much unless you've done a lot of sinning. &nbsp;Then, you may find yourself constantly invaded by Blue Sentinels. &nbsp;Part of the problem is the way they instituted the Brotherhood of Blood. &nbsp;It's hard
 to gain cracked red eye orbs, and there's no method to simply invade except through those. &nbsp;Add to that how hard it is to rank up in the covenant and it's not very invasion friendly.</p>
<p>Like you guys/gals, I enjoy DS2, but it's just not DS1. &nbsp;DS1 had a special something that simply wasn't captured here.</p>
<p>I too dislike the fact that you can't see how your weapon stats increase with buffs. &nbsp;You also can't see how much health you actually have (you can see your max health, but not how many HP you currently have).</p>
<p>Another thing that bugs me is the crazy weapon tracking and the fact that enemies can start a swing in one direction and spin around mid-swing (even when using thrust weapons) and hit you when you are behind them. &nbsp;It makes no sense. &nbsp;But, if you try to
 roll then attack, you have to delay your attack or else you'll be aiming the wrong way (meaning it's almost useless in PvP). &nbsp;Or, try rolling then throwing a firebomb or something. &nbsp;You'll miss and continue to miss the throw, even if you're locked on, until
 you stop and re-align yourself.</p>
<p>Also, I find the ADP stat to be a bit ridiculous. &nbsp;I have a character that dual wields whips. &nbsp;Pressing LB does a 1-2 attack where I whip with the right hand followed by the left. &nbsp;People who have high ADP can roll into the attack and dodge both attacks
 with a single roll. &nbsp;Yes, you can dodge 2 attacks with one roll if your ADP is high enough. &nbsp;It makes no sense. &nbsp;It's worse than the flip ring, especially since you can be up to 70% of your weight load and still have a crazy amount of I-frames.</p>

<p>1. Dark Souls 2 isn't easier. You're just better, more experienced. If you hadn't played DS1 you'd think Dark Souls 2 was hard as sh*t. Although I think the tutorial for DS1 was better. Throws you into a boss fight without warning.</p>
<p>2. Yeah DS1 linked a lot of the world together, but a lot of the time you had no idea that link was there. There was so much places like the Painted World and getting back to the Asylum that was a secret and impossible to know of on your own.</p>
<p>Majula is the link.</p>
<p>3. Yeah there is no need to repair weapons at bonfires anymore, but on DS1 you could use the same weapon for days. The durability of weapons is so much lower on DS2. I can't make it to from the first bonfire to the boss fight in an area with out having to
 swap weapons. Having a weapon break during a boss fight is pretty horrifying.</p>
<p>4. I keep hearing that but I myself get invaded a lot.</p>
<p>On NG only people on NG are able to invade, and they need to have the same soul memory as you. That being said I still got invaded a lot on NG. But I like this feature. Getting invaded by people on DS1 that were over experienced and had OP weapons really
 killed my first playthrough. </p>
<p>Now NG+ I get invaded all the time. (Also being human has nothing to do with being invaded anymore)</p>
<p>5. PRAISE THE SUN!</p>
<p>6. I agree, but that was also existed in DS1. More so in DS2 though.</p>
<p>7. Iron Keep is still pretty early on. So it isn't really that far in..</p>
<p>8. Lol nooooo its not. Sorcery is still the most powerful class. Especially with the herbs to regain spells.</p>
<p>9. What? Dark Souls had a story but I found I had to read between the lines just to get a glimpse at the story. Dark Souls 2 has a story but I feel they are in the same boat, you've got to look for the story.</p>
<p>10. I don't recall very many epic cut scenes in DS1. I don't care for cut scenes anyways. Watch them all once, otherwise SKIPPPP!</p>
<p>11. At first they were, yes, but I got use to them real quick. Also I do miss kicking too. You can push the shield to the side on DS2.. but its not the same.</p>
<p>12. Yeah I was lost for a while on how to level up. I just didn't see her standing by the cliff.</p>
<p>13. Agreed.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>If you hadn't even beaten DS2 I don't think you should be reviewing it already. NG+ is a whole new experience and totally worth it. -Time to start NG++</p>
<p>DS2 is longer and with a lot more bosses. But most of the bosses are optional. And I don't really like that.</p>
<p>I don't like the fact that many weapons, and even bosses are recycled and reused.</p>
<p>I do like that there are bonfires after boss fights on DS2. Too many times on DS1 I would kill a boss and have to go all the way back to a bonfire just to make sure I got to keep the souls I just earned.</p>
<p>I will be getting the next Dark Souls but only if its further down the road. I don't like yearly releases.</p>

<p>Well I've invested 60 hours into the game. I think that qualifies me to have a few opinions about it :)</p>
<p>At this point I just want to be done. I've got the King's ring and beat the two throne guardians or whatever they are called (at the castle). I really just want to finish this thing and be through to tell you the truth. It looks like there's about 3 areas
 I haven't discovered yet. I'm a little annoyed trying to figure out where to go next. May have to look at a walkthrough or something. All this backtracking to try to find doors is getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>I'll start by respoding to your list, maybe I'll add something of my own in the end...</p>
<p>1. It was harder for me to get into DaS2 than it was with DaS1 since I really had no idea where to go and the Estus flask doses were so limited. The bosses, however, were far easier. I remember how I struggled with O&amp;S and Gwyn kept killing me and BoC made
 me fall to my death over and over again etc. In DaS2 it didn't take me more than 3 attempts at any boss, with help or not. I even killed a lot of them first try with no guides.</p>
<p>2. "In DS1, the worlds linked together in an intricate way, like a puzzle. Activating new shortcuts was part of the fun. Little of that exists in DS2." This and the fact that it was so simple to tell where to go next.</p>
<p>3. "No gradual damage of weapons and equipment requiring repair at the bonfire. So no need to save souls. This hurts the "survival horror" element of the game." I missed the repairing. Oh, and the items break down way too fast now. You know that miracle
 user you can fight in Majula? My 2handed broke down during the fight and fighting her was all I did after "resetting" my gear.</p>
<p>4. "Invasions are practically nonexistent. This takes 99% of the tension and fear out of the game." Man I'm glad it didn't turn out to be like they threatened it would be! Forced PvP is so not something I want and I stayed hollow 99% of the time in DaS1
 because of it.</p>
<p>5. "The Blue Sentinel covenant is worthless."</p>
<p>6. "Way too many secondary items that are next to useless." My inventory is sooooooooooooooo full of them lol</p>
<p>7. "The blacksmiths that do special weapon upgrades appear too late in the game to be of much use." Even the standard upgrades are stupid since at first the shards are so limited. At least Andre sold infinite shards from the beginning so you could easily
 upgrade your stuff to +5.</p>
<p>8. "Sorcery has been nerfed way too much, making the Sorceror class too weak." Yeah, it's all about miracles and pyromancies, and those things are so op.
</p>
<p>9. "We've gone from having a little bit of story to having no story, so we don't even know why we are fighting or what our goal is." True that. And what exactly happened in the end? I mean, in DaS1 you know you either let the dark come or you delay it. Now
 I kinda missed the outcome. Why did I go through all the trouble, exactly?</p>
<p>10. "Hardly any epic cut scenes." Haha, I miss the cut scene starting O&amp;S fight. You just knew you were doomed. The way Artorias showed up? And Manus? The sad cutscene you have when you encounter Sif after the DLC? Yeah... I can't remember any cut scenes
 from DaS2.</p>
<p>11. "Movement controls have been made oversensitive, which can really screw you up in the platforming sections." I didn't notice this. I do, however, miss the double-B for back step as I now back step sooooo often.</p>
<p>12. "No explanation given in the beginning of the game on how to level up, when it was clear and easy in DS1." Had no problems with it due to DeS.</p>
<p>13. "Can no longer easily see if an item you want to buy will increase your stats or not." I don't know about this, but I do miss the DaS1 inventory in general. It just was so clear to me, stats and all that. Now I find myself using the help to see what
 the numbers indicate :(</p>
<p>I think in DaS1 in just was easier to follow the game. Now it was like I went to area A, killed boss 1, went to area B, killed boss 2, went to area E, not able to do it, went to area D, struggled with the area and boss 4, went to area C, killed boss 3 and
 wondered why I didn't go to the area immediately after 2 to begin with.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts... Some of my criticisms of DS2 were kind of trivial. But overall, I'm just kind of disappointed with it. It's not a bad game by any means. I'd call it an "above average" game. But it's just not as fun to me as DS1 was.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; And I'm glad you guys say I'm almost to the end of this game! It's really wearing me out. If you like games that take a long time to finish, then I guess you sure get your money's worth with DS2. But I just want it to be over already. I don't even care
 about finding treasures or leveling up anymore. Definitely feeling some "RPG fatigue"!</p>

    <title>Destiny Crashes when I try and go to Venus - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Destiny Crashes when I try and go to Venus</h2>
                    
<p>So Im just trying to see if anyone else has had this issue. I downloaded Destiny Tuesday night, on Xbox One on a digital copy. The game worked fine, I played for a few hours all was good. I turned off the console, went about my day, and then I started up
 my console turned on the game, and the game said "verifying content" and it went from 0% to 100% in about 5 mins, and then it freezes and says Beagle Error, so I looked up the Beagle error and it says to delete and re install the game. So I did, and I was
 able to play for about an hr and then it did it again, it crashed and made me go back to Xbox home screen. then when i started up the game, it said "verifying content, and error beagle. Then I re-installed it again, played for a little and got to Venus the
 first mission, and every time at the exact same spot it crashes the game. I can play through all earth and moon missions but when I try and continue the story on Venus it crashes and makes me re-install the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically I would like a fix from Bungie or a refund from Microsoft so i can get the disc copy of the game and do it that way instead.</p>

<p>I've been having the exact same problem for days. I can access Venus multiplayer maps, but starting "A Stranger's Call" gives me the error. I have the digital copy on xbox 360. Would like to see a fix.</p>
<p>Btw, you don't have to re-install the game when it crashes. Just clear your hard-drive cache.</p>

<p>Yeah it freezes and makes me go back and reinstall but if I only have to clear my cashe that would shorten up the time, but I still cant go passed that mission on the Xbox One, I did however download my profile onto my 360 which has destiny and I started
 playing on there, I was able to get past all the venus mission on my 360. Im going to go back and see if I can do some other mission on my one now</p>

<p>Oh I feel all your pain, but I believe I have figured out how to fix the beagle error (no thanks to bungie or microsoft). I've completed all the Venus missions now (previously I was getting the same issue on the 1st Venus mission).</p>
<p>When you download the game content to install, it's about 15GB, however there is also a smaller 'update' that needs to be installed of size around 15MB (I think from memory). The timing of when each of these components is installed is VERY important.</p>
<p>The key here is not to 'open' destiny until the game has installed at 100%, do NOT open destiny after about 2% (when xbox1 tells you it is ready) as when you open the game, you'll be forced to install the update at that time (when less than 100% of destiny
 installation progress). I think there's some issue applying the update before the game has been installed.</p>
<p>Therefore here is your happy path;</p>
<p>1. Delete installation of Destiny</p>
<p>2. Install Destiny; DO NOT OPEN THE GAME BEFORE FULLY INSTALLED AT 100%. Stay on the xbox1 menu.</p>
<p>3. Open destiny once the game has fully installed, you'll be prompted for the smaller update.</p>
<p>4. Enjoy visiting Venus!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App - &#34;Other Accounts&#34; won&#39;t sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisbews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App - &#34;Other Accounts&#34; won&#39;t sync</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way of getting the Windows 10 Mail app to synchronise "Other - POP/IMAP" accounts where the account user name and email address are not the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of my own domain accounts and my hosts set up means that the username on each account is not the email address (so the mail&nbsp;account&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; would have the username &lt;myaccount.com_someone&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 app just doesn't seem to be able to handle this - apart from the fact that there are no options to go to manual set-up until there have been three failed attempts after entering basic details (email address and password) when you are given
 access to 'Advanced' options - there are not enough fields in the app to enter the correct details - it assumes that a username and email address are the same, so the account gets set up as the username not the email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 8/8.1 app, Windows Phone and Outlook can all be set up to handle this - why not the 10 app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix/work round?</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp; - thanks for replying and the link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The domain is mine and I have a number of mailboxes that won't sync because the app can't accept that a username is sometimes not an email address - it assumes that the username is also my email address which it isn't so this prevents me from sending because
 effectively when it tries to connect to the smtp server it's not giving the server what it wants and can't because there isn't an option to enter all the credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To simplify, with my (or any) outlook.com account the username is also the email address associated with the account (e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) - the app has no problems with that. Unfortunately that's not what I have here as I have a username that is
 different to my email address - the app simply can't handle this and uses the username and then has nowhere to put the email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response though.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to check with the game's developers/suppor and also ask in their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>Hey pizza,</p>
<p>These forums are generally xbox support related - the best place to post this query (and to get the quickest hopeful solution) is the GFWL/PC forums.
</p>
<p>You should see a link at the top with a drop down arrow next to it that says PC Games.

<h2>            Background colour of applications, under Windows 10 I haven&#39;t been able to find this function</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Background colour of applications&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous versions of windows I was able to select the colour (grey - easier on the eyes) for the background of applications such as excel, word and explorer. This isn't the background picture I am talking about on the desktop, nor changing the theme or
 colours in each program. This was everything; from pop up messages from Windows to the applications aforementioned, all done through one function. This option allowed you to change menu bar colours, text box colours and everything in between.
</p>
<p>Under Windows 10 I haven't been able to find this function. In another post I saw someone had outlined that this feature was missing; is this really the case and if so is there a work around?

<p><span>Meanwhile, you can try these methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode and perform Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files
 and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the link below to learn how to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: If the issue doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, then proceed to Clean Boot steps given in the link below.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp; Here is the link for your reference to perform clean boot.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Please go through step 3 of the Kb to keep the computer
 in normal startup after fixing the issue</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Improve the system’s performance</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link to learn how to optimize the hard disk to improve performance.</span></p>

<p>It you have used Live TV or netflix/Lovefilm/youtube/Blu-ray/DVD at all then HDCP will have turned on! Currently theres a bug that will not turn it off again without power cycling the console (Basically turn in off by holding the power button on the front
 for a few sec's) Once done it should work fine until you use a HDCP protected App again</p>

<p>Hello DocSwish,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, I want to make sure, are you talking about the Power button on the front of the console or the Guide/Home Xbox button on the top part of the controller? I&nbsp;only know of two things that the Power button on the front of the console can do, turn it On and turn it Off. Indeed, one of the reasons Microsoft changed the Power button on the One S to a physical push button was because people were accidentally touching the capacitive button on the Xbox One and turning it Off. If you are referring to the&nbsp;Guide/Home Xbox button, you are right. You should be able to tap the button to get to the Home page/menu. Also, press and hold to turn On the Xbox, and press and hold to select "Turn console off" or "Turn controller off". I regret to say that the error code you gave us is not listed on the "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup?code=87b20c08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error &amp; Status Code Search</a>" page. But, after doing some checking I discovered that it may ha
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard reset</a>. Also, it might&nbsp;be worth trying to disconnect and reconnect (pairing)&nbsp;the controller, see "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-disconnects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Wireless Controller disconnects or can't connect</a>".&nbsp;I would be curious if you see the same issue with the controller connected via a USB port.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Good luck and good gaming,</p>

<p>Howdy. As stated in the other thread, could you provide a screen shot or a video of what is going on. That will help us better understand the issue. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey there Primenay!<br /><br />I took a look at that video. At the times you point out, it's just the change in size from the smaller menu to the larger menu. Does it affect the functionality of your dashboard?<br /><br />Let us know! ^_^</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Yes I am having this problem too. I have a Xbox 360 black elite which is was bought used but works fine every other way. I get the screen tearing on my dashboard when I pop up my small Xbox windows especially when it goes from big to small or small to big.
 I have a full HD 1080p monitor running the display of the console so I want to. Know why it does that. It's so annoying the console works so good then there's just that lil tearing that's really ticking me off. Is it just a console display frame rate issue
 or a dashboard menu error?</p>

<h2>            Computer resets after shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Today I woke up my computer (I'm running Windows 10) and logged in as normal. The login took way longer than it usually does and it said "Preparing windows" towards the end of the process. When I l got in, I found my desktop reset to the default Windows
 10 screensaver and 75% of everything on my desktop gone. I checked to see if the programs were still there but they were gone. I am now left with a few Microsoft programs and some of my old stuff. I doubt it is possible to get it back, but I was wondering
 if there was a way to prevent this from happening again.&nbsp;</p>

            I dont know how this happened, but I shutdown the computer to come back to most of my stuff back. Some of the stuff is still gone or is outdated(Example: My screensaver changed to an old one), but that is fine. I am going to buy a backup hard drive thing
 to keep any other crashes away, but I think it is fixed :). Thank you for trying to help!

            <p><em>Okie-dokie</em>. Good luck going forward!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip =&gt;&nbsp;You might wanna see what happens after you download/run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong>&nbsp;[1] (followed by a reboot) and then&nbsp;the
<strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong> [2] (followed by another reboot).</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Fact: Norton and McAfee applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</li></ul>

<h2>            Slow browsing on all browsers except Edge</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased a Dell xps 13, and did a reset on it when I purchased. (it was bought from somebody, second hand so wanted to be cautious). Running windows 10 with latest updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to browse on any browser except Edge, web pages take a long time to load, and sometimes just time out. I have tried Chrome, Opera and Firefox too, but having the same slow browsing issue across all of them. Firefox seemed to be a little quicker
 than the others, but I'm a lot time Chrome user and so don't want to have to start using a different browser across all my devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge works fine, but I use an Android phone and tablet and have always used Chrome so am accustomed to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my ancient Dell xps 12, chrome works just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting and reinstalling chrome but it hasn't made any difference, it's still very slow to load pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything has been updated and double checked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is i7, 16gb, 512gb ssd. Also, I have replaced the network card with an Intel 9260, but it had made no difference. The original Killer 1535 card did the same thing, and I thought changing it might help, but didn't make any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied those updates and also any others that were available. I have been checking for updates every day since i purchased the laptop. Unfortunately, the updates didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also just ran the cmd commands and restarted as you suggested and it looked like it had worked for a few minutes, but then I tried to navigate to different websites and it is still slow. It loaded the bbc webpage very quickly, but then I tried to
 navigate to speedtest.net, and it took a long time again, and the same with www.sky.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to navigate to www.tesla.com and it took a long time too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, unfortunately that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else we could try?</p>

    <title>Microsoft service agreement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peteredwards_066  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft service agreement</h2>
                    Just had the email from MS re the service agreement. What they don't clearly state is what they support free and what do I have to pay for. For example a recent&nbsp; windows update trashed my PC and I contacted MS support to resolve this, they said I would
 have to pay! It was MS's fault, I finally got them to resolve it by uninstalling the update without paying. Surely if it's MS's fault I should not have to pay. Just had another Windows update - in the next few days I shall see what damage it's done to my PC.
 BTW why don't the auto updates tell me what they have done and why? after all it's MY pc not microsoft's.

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you contact Microsoft Support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every Windows product has a lifecycle, and it begins when a product is released and ends when it is no longer supported. Knowing key dates in this life cycle helps you make informed decisions about when to update, upgrade or make changes to your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should always install the latest feature update, before your current version reached end of service, to remain supported by Microsoft through monthly quality updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 automatically downloads and install updates to make sure your device is secure and up to date. This means you receive the latest fixes and security updates, helping your device run efficiently and stay protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/assistedsupportproducts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a> should contain the information that you are looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h3> mafjo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Directx 11 question</h2>
                    My laptop has an nVidia Quadro 880M graphics &nbsp;card. Lately I've been having some issues with display drivers crashing etc. After updating all drivers, the problem remained. After some (useless) troubleshooting I realized that my laptop has Directx 11 installed
 on it, while an nVidia Quadro 880M only supports Directx 10.1 accroding to its produt page. Could this be causing the performance issues, and if so, how can I roll back to Directx 10.1?

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>I ran the SFC tool......no errors</p>
<p>I ran the DISM tool.......no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, my SB is running really nicely......it's just that report in the reliability monitor that concerned me.</p>
<p>It appears that my system is clean and&nbsp;without corruptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshot of my reliability monitor....you'll notice 2 occasions where the windows hardware error occurred.</p>

</p><p>Can you send us a screenshot of the information about the Windows Hardware error under 'Critical events'? Did you install any apps lately? Also, what information do you see when you click 'Check for a solution'?<br />

Keep us posted.</p>

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>Here's the screenshot of the information about the Windows Hardware error</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0d41e72-552a-47c7-8775-a2234a84da6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0d41e72-552a-47c7-8775-a2234a84da6a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot after 'Checking for a solution'</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8885f9e7-48aa-4455-861e-3aceb5c2ef3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8885f9e7-48aa-4455-861e-3aceb5c2ef3d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The only new apps I have installed recently (~10 days ago), is WD Smartware.....(backup software from Western Digital).</p>
<p>
</p><p>.........................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an addition, I just thought I'd send you this......a look back over the last month shows several of these 'Hardware errors'</p>
<p>This one is from 24th November....(So this event was occurring long before the WD Smartware was installed).</p>
<p>

            <p>
</p><p>Since you found out that there are no errors after using SFC and DISM method, the system's integrity remained intact. Also, based from the screenshot you provided, it is best that you ignore the 'rogue' report you mentioned earlier.</p>
