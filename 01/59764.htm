<p>Here's what I would do if I were in your position:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Look for my computer's owner's manual - sometimes called a user guide. That explains all the features your computer has. I would look through the manual to see if it mentions anything about a backlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Lookup my model number on Lenovo's website - to do that, type the full name (<span>Lenovo Flex 4-1330) into the address bar of any web browser and then press the Enter key. Look for a search result that comes from Lenovo's
 website. That should include a complete description of the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here's what I found when I tried this:&nbsp;</span></p>
<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-flex-series/IdeaPad-Flex-4-11-inch/p/88IP8FX0737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Lenovo Flex 4-1330</a>
<p>
</p><p>3- Contact Lenovo product support and ask them if my computer has a backlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you're on the web page described in step #2, look for a link for product support. Fortunately, Lenovo makes this easy: There's a green 'chat' button in the lower right corner. Also, on the top of the page there's a link that says Contact. Click on
 that and you'll see another link to click on that says 24/7 CHAT NOW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4- (My personal favorite:) I would ask my question in <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/English-Community/ct-p/Community-EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lenovo's own community forum</a>! You'll be able to talk to other folks who have the very same computer as you. One of them is sure to know whether the computer has a backlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not, these are the same steps that we in this community use to answer questions like yours, because this is a community forum for Windows 10. We aren't Lenovo experts.</p>

    <title>CLISD errors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CLISD errors</h2>
                    So for a while now my games and other applications have been crashing unexpectedly on a brand new pc I just built. It kept turning up faulting application paths. I figured out it was my RAM being incompatible with my motherboard, and I just replaced the
 RAM with compatible ones yesterday. Now it keeps turning up CLISD permission errors and whatnot. I performed an SFC scan and a DISM scan, neither turned up corruption when before it always did. What is the issue here? Any idea on how to fix this?

            Okay, That are called DCOM errors and are harmless.

<br />
<br />These 10016 events are recorded when Microsoft components tries to access DCOM components without the required permissions. In this case, this is expected and by design.
<br />
<br />
<br />So you need not to take any actions. Everything is okay.

    <title>PES 2014 - Pro Evolution Soccer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> o carano o  say:</h3>
<h2>            PES 2014 - Pro Evolution Soccer</h2>
                    
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi43.tinypic.com%2ft8b6o9.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<p><strong>True Ball Tech:</strong> For the first time in a football simulation, PES 2014 centres everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are what set certain players apart from others.
 The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. You'll be able to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed barycentric physics determining the weight shift
 of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player’s body will automatically shape to receive it. This means total control in angling a pass, and TrueBall Tech adds more freedom with full 360-degree, two-footed control.</p>
<p>-</p>



<p><strong>Motion Animation Stability System (M.A.S.S.):</strong> The physical combat between players is a vital part of any match, and the new M.A.S.S. component simulates the bodily contact between multiple players within bespoke animations that segue seamlessly
 into each other. Rather than a series of preset animations that occur under specific circumstances, M.A.S.S. acts instantly to any situation, with the reaction of a fouled player entirely dependent on the direction and force with which they are tackled. Dependent
 on factors such as their size and power, players will stumble but instantly recover if clipped, barge others off the ball, and use their stature to block players from possession. Similarly, PES 2014 now has more styles of tackle, as opposed to basic foot in
 or sliding types. Tackling ties in with the TrueBall physics making 50-50 fights and tussles for possession more realistic in PES 2014.</p>
<p>-</p>



<p><strong>Heart: </strong>Defining what makes football so engrossing is difficult. It isn’t a technical thing, but more an emotional hook. Matches can be imposing for visiting teams, as home support barracks the opposition, and acts as the infamous ‘twelfth
 man’ by cheering their side on. PES 2014’s ‘Heart aims to recreate the effects of team support, both on an individual player basis and across the entire team. Player's mental attributes will come to the fore, adversely affecting performance when they have
 a poor game, though teammates will rally round to support him.</p>
<p>-</p>



<p><strong>PES ID:</strong> PES 2013 set a new bar for realism, with its inclusion of the Player ID system. For the first time, players could instantly recognise a player by their faithfully recreated running and play styles. The way a player ran, moved and
 spread the ball about would be identical to that of their real-life counterpart, and PES 2013 featured 50 players that utilised the system. For PES 2014, that number will be greatly expanded, with twice as many stars featuring bespoke animations and AI.</p>
<p>-</p>



<p><strong>Team Play:</strong> Via the new game’s innovative Combination Play users can set up a variety of different tactics in key areas of the pitch using three or more players. These players will make very different off-the-ball runs to exploit holes in
 the defence or midfield, using the flanks, curved runs, or overlapping play to make themselves available. These moves can be preset to key areas of the field, allowing users to exploit defensive weaknesses beforehand.</p>
<p>-</p>


<p><strong>The Core:</strong> PES Productions have undertaken several years of consultation with PES and football fans to reproduce key elements of the series and implement a wide range of additional improvements.</p>
<p>-</p>


<p>PES 2014 is also set to raise the bar visually according to Konami, with the weave of kits, facial movement and new animation processes all being applied to bolster the game's visual fidelity. Free kicks and penalties are also
 undergoing "radical change", while from a&nbsp; licensing perspective, PES 2014 will now include the recently-signed Asia Champions League, while retaining the UEFA Champions League license.</p>



<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi39.tinypic.com%2fkdstja.png" /></p>


<p>The goal of PES 2014 is to capture the true essence of football. To accomplish this, we have created a new game engine to innovate and transform gameplay. We have been developing this new engine over the course of the last few years.
 We call the system - centred around the new engine - fluidity. The name is derived from our analysis of total football which is characterised by fluid constant switching of positions - it was inspiring.
<br />
<br />
Originally based on the Fox Engine, this new engine was created exclusively for this football game. The new images that we'll create are much higher quality than have ever been seen before in a sports game.
<br />
<br />
Utilizing many new elements, our new engine is able to achieve a whole new approach to the game. The six elements of the new engine are: TrueBall Tech, M.A.S.S, PES ID, Team Play, Heart and The Core.
<br />
<br />
With TrueBall Tech, you can control the ball in any direction - this even includes while it's in the air. We have also added the concept of barycentre; this allows the users to control the barycentre of players and the ball seperately making you feel that you're
 actually playing football. The result is a more instinctive style of play. <br />
<br />
M.A.S.S stands for Motion Animation Stability System. It simulates the physics of body contact within bespoke animations that flow seamlessly within play. We weren't looking to just add flashy moves, we wanted to bring real play and tactics to the game. When
 we achieved that through gameplay, the result is that PES now truly feels like a competitive match - just like the real thing.
<br />
<br />
The purpose of the Heart aspect is to capture the essence of playing both at home and away. To properly create that experience, we implemented team morale and player motivation levels. So, as you play and do well, your entire team will be influenced by home
 and away environments. This will, in turn, affect each players' personal motivation, and as a result, affect players' abilities.
<br />
<br />
Our game has a long history which can make it very difficult to think outside the box. Our new engine has been the key to breaking new ground. Of course, our older versions have had many great elements to them but we've been limited to previous engines. This
 time, we've changed direction and focussed on the total package - including user experience, player controls and more.
<br />
<br />
We are planning many more features. We will announce these updates in the near future. Please stay tuned.
<br />
<br />
The new engine will impress users with an ever-revolving gameplay experience and make scoring more enjoyable. Ultimately, we really want users to enjoy this new evolution of PES 2014.</p>

<p>Sweet it is looking good so far, might be time to invest in another footy game finally.
<br />
<br />
Anything in particular about the new features catching your eye Carano?. Sounds like a lot of effort has been made to create better animations and that can only be good. I always preferred the playability of PES ever since the old ISS days, but graphically
 it has always been lagging behind a bit.<br />
<br />
Any news on the scoring system?, placing the ball where you want it in the goal etc?. I remember on an older version you used the 8 directions of the pad to place the ball in whichever corner of the net you liked, I really hope to see something like that system
 make a return. granted that might be going all the way back to ISS though my memory is a little rusty. &nbsp;It was a cracking system though and it is still sorely missed by me.<br />

<p>There's several videos from E3 scattered around YouTube, despite the people controlling them not being able to pass properly (they're using manual passing) you can clearly see the improved animations and the fluidity.<br />

<p>@Grey: &nbsp;Nothing in particular, just the overall improvements with the new engine and the 6 main features they're pushing! :D I'm not too excited for the 11v11 online as most people seem to be, as I'm primarily a Player v COM player, because you know the
 AI isn't gonna quit on you. :P I'm excited to see the snow back and how the kit's will get dirty in the rain/mud.<br />

<p>The 8 direction thing must be from ISS, as I don't really remember it, lol, though yeah, you can 'aim' in the general vicinity that you're trying to place your shots.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the 'Heart' works too. It's about time home teams got an advantage and away teams felt nervy, so the way the entire atmosphere of the crowd gets on players back and affects their performance should be great, especially as
 players face's now show emotion.</p>

I've never been the biggest football game fan but years back I use to love the PES titles. I know a few of my friends have said more or less what you have but as I said to them, what's to say they haven't brought back the glory days with this new title?</p>

            technically, since Pakistan is not supported you can't play online or access xbox live and buy games on the store.

                    My surface 4 type keyboard's "I" key broke off. I could not replace it myself however, I had a warrantee on it. I requested for repair order however it asks me to (I think) send it to Microsoft. It says I requested for a standard exchange. Where do I send
 it too?

<h3> odd ramos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 search doesn&#8217;t find text strings</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>I’m not able to find any text strings starting not from the beginning of word in filename or in file content using Windows 7 search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows 7 search configuration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img513/2569/t62p.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img35/7959/rig0.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img13/5161/ernf.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s say I’m searching for a documents containing word “content”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m able to find those documents when searching for “content”, “conte”, “con” (as long as the string includes the beginning of the word).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"content"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img96/8672/pb5u.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"con"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img189/5499/7iof.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if I search for “ontent”, “tent” or any other combination that doesn’t include the beginning of the word, Windows search won't find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img30/1686/xpx3.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried other indexing/searching software such as Copernic Desktop search, Google desktop search.</p>
<p>Those programs also weren’t able to find part of the word starting from the middle of the word. For instance, it finds “conte”, but doesn’t find “onte”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finds “conte”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img842/1579/25t7.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn’t find “onte”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img607/2189/mpvd.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the same problem using Copernic desktop search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I use non-indexing content search software such as Agent Ransack or FileSeek, I get the same results when searching for “conte” or “onte”:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“conte”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img33/1480/bk0f.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“onte”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://imageshack.us/a/img89/9194/m2dw.png</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do all pre-indexing content search applications (Windows search, Google desktop, Copernic desktop search) fail to search for a string inside the words?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do non-indexing applications find text strings wherever they are:&nbsp; in the beginning, middle or end of the word?</p>
<p>I’ve tried wildcards and other constructions with no luck.</p>
<p>*onte</p>
<p>*onte*</p>
<p>“onte”</p>
<p>content:onte</p>
<p>content:*onte*</p>
<p>content:~*onte*</p>
<p>All these searched doesn’t find the word “content”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make Windows search find strings from any part of words?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>You can make use of the special characters that Windows 7 Search interprets as "search anywhere", as in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>content:~=onte</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted more information about such special characters here:</p>

            It should work, so that's odd.&nbsp; The ability to search&nbsp;by specifying the content&nbsp;property&nbsp;is otherwise doable regardless of what is indexed, anyhow, or would be if it operating as it should.&nbsp; What happens if you apply your search to a&nbsp;folder that is not
 indexed?

            <p>I’ve found that if I index files, then Windows search would search for a text string only in beginning of the words, that is if I search for ball or ~~ball it won’t find text files containing the words “football”, “basketball” etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I don’t index files, and use non-indexed Windows 7 search, and search for ~~ball (~~ before ball is a must) then it would find text files containing the words “football”, “basketball” etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So indexed and non-indexed Windows 7 search act in a different way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test it please. Do you experience the same?</p>

            <p>Wow, I have tested and found the same problem that&nbsp;you did.&nbsp; I never noticed this weird deficiency before.&nbsp; But then, I disabled indexing entirely some time ago when I had decided that the way I want to use the computer did not require it, and so I have
 succesfully searched file contents that way&nbsp;since then, except for just now when I turned the indexing back on to do the testing.&nbsp; (Disabling indexing entirely has the effect of&nbsp;preventing searching within the Libary directories by the way, but since I don't
 use them, it is not of importance to me.)&nbsp; Here are my notes on turning off the indexing, in case it is of use or interest to anyone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>How to turn off Windows 7 Search indexing:</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Windows 7 Search still works without indexing (except in Libraries windows).<span>&nbsp;
</span>To turn indexing off, click the Start button, Control Panel, Administrative tools, Services, scroll down to find Windows Search in the window that appears and doubleclick it, and click the Stop button.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Indexing is made inactive for all user accounts.<span>&nbsp; </span>To stop indexing from starting again, click the down-arrow button by “Startup type:”, click Disabled, and click the OK button.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(To turn indexing back on, change “Startup type:” to Automatic, then click the Apply, Start, and OK buttons.)<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Start menu Search box will then give results limited to programs and Control Panel items (any new programs installed will be searchable regardless of the indexing being off); no document files of any kind show up.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Searching in windows’ Search boxes behaves as before, but any changes that you might have done in Indexing Options will no longer be effective.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, the “Arrange by” feature in the Libraries windows will no longer work.</font></font></span></p>

            unfortunately Microsoft has been totally unresponsive to the many, many complaints about the new "search" since we went to Win 7 and now I hear it's worse in Win 8.&nbsp; Why can't we get a menu driven - drop down search engine as simple as XP?&nbsp; By making the
 "Operating system" more "Intuitive" it has made such simple things, which were once easy, now extremely obscure!&nbsp; I keep XP on one of my network computers just to search the drives on my Win 7 machines!&nbsp; By the way, it works fine with shared drives!&nbsp; I must
 have read ten or more threads on this problem but no one really cares at Microsoft or some simple download would have been provided long ago.&nbsp; I understand that the "file structure" is no longer DOS but that's not and answer to all the users having problems
 with SEARCH, sorry to say.

            I miss the old good Win XP search too. It worked just fine and I loved the interface.
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, there are some free alternatives to Win 7 and Win 8 searches.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Application best suitable for file name search (for a regular search to find a particular file with specific file name) is Search Everything. Search Everything is totally free and it's amazingly fast. Try that out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Application best suitable for non-indexed file content search is File Locator Lite (former Agent Ransack). File Locator Lite searches inside .pdf, .mobi, .chm, doc, docx., txt etc., but doesn’t search in .EPUB. File Locator Lite is also totally free and
 is easy to use.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I think, non of these software will search in the network drives.</div>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; The point is that this should be part of the Windows interface experience.&nbsp; Why would Microsoft just leave us to figure it out?&nbsp; Why don't they care about the customers?&nbsp; The issue is so old and ongoing as a problem and no one has been tasked to
 address it.&nbsp; If they want to continue their market dominant position they must respond or Windows as an operating system will be history.&nbsp; There are many competitors ready to eat their lunch.&nbsp; This is simple and a small example of their hubrus.&nbsp; Fix this and
 address the many other user complaints or it's over.&nbsp; I think its too much X-Box, Office,&nbsp;Enterprise Etc.&nbsp; They've lost their focus.&nbsp; Sad, TOO BIG to care.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks but the XP machine still searches all the network and Win7 drives on my extensive system - for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft DOS 3.5 worked well now we will see...</p>

<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />

 /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001&nbsp;and pasting it after the Command prompt should address that. I will try that next.</span>

<p>Hi Douglas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I just replied to Andre, none of the specific fixes you recommended worked. That said, both of you provided me with guidance that enabled me to find a fix that DOES appear to have worked. Without your guidance, I never would have found this on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot and check the issue.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

            <p>The problem is that now I can't access windows correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always a blue screen that told me a necessary device is missing to start windows, with the error code 0xc0000225.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think an error occurred during the repair of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I can only access the console by using a USB with the Windows 8.1 Media on it.</p>

    <title>Not enough RAM&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brittanycamara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not enough RAM&#63;</h2>
                    I had a problem on my computer so I used my System recovery disc and everything now is working perfectly fine. However, when I inserted my Avid Pro Tools disc it said I don't have enough RAM and that 1GB is what's needed. I've had this computer for a long
 time and it actually does have 3GB of RAM. When I checked to see how much ram I have in my control panel it shows 3046 MB. Which is 3GB is it not? Anyhow, how do I fix this?! Help would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks

            Yes, I've had it for over a year. When I insert the disc, and click to open it, a pop up then comes up right away saying not enough RAM. Where is this install/setup file?

            <p>It'll be on the CD.&nbsp; It sounds like it is auto-playing a program from the CD when you insert it.&nbsp; Instead, open Start and go to "Computer", and then right-click the CD drive and choose "Open" from there to see the files that are on the CD.&nbsp; There will almost
 always be a "setup.exe" file (or something very similar) that you can run.&nbsp; I'd try running it directly first (just double-click it), but if it still refuses to install, the troubleshoot compatibility is a good thing to try.</p>

            <p>That's really weird.&nbsp; Is it perhaps that it's complaining that their isn't enough RAM currently available?&nbsp; If you were to close every running process (even right-click/exit every icon down by the clock) to clear up available memory, would the program install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just off the top of my head, you mentioned you just reinstalled -- the error message about RAM might be erroneous and caused by something else. Perhaps you need to get Service Pack 2 installed for example. That's just a guess, but since it was working
 previously, and you just fresh installed, there seems like there shouldn't be a reason it won't work again.</p>

            <p>A 32 bit signed value is -2 gig to + 2 gig. You have two much memory and the maths ain't working (3 gig can't be stored in a 32 bit signed value). The CPU uses unsigned values to control itself (0 to 4 gig), but programming languages tend to use signed.</p>

            I am continually forced to do updates that fail, I have a laptop as a backup that runs Linux and am seriously considering changing my Computer's OS. Why don't you look at Linux Mint and see how an update should be handled.&nbsp;

<h2>            Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 lag, black screen</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having quite a few issues with the multi-player.&nbsp; For the past week and a half, the game has been lagging and now just today, i have been getting a black screen when im supposed to be in a game lobby, like when a game ends, and then when theres
 a full room, it stays on balancing teams for like a minute, when there are balanced teams, then for some reason its kicking the host, (when they did not want to leave), then the room resets, picks a new host then the game starts. Weird right? Its happening
 to many people, all the people on my friends list are&nbsp; haveing the same issue as well. I had a full party today and whenever we had to back out to our party room, the host leaves first as usual, except whats happening now is they , or me if im the host,&nbsp; backs
 out, the screen turns black then puts me back in our lobby, in which while thats going on it says im the only one in the party and that i have 11 people but&nbsp; i can hear all my friends as if they were in the party already and on their screen it says waiting
 for the party leader and that they are not connected to the room yet cause their waiting for the leader?! But im in the lobby! I dont know, its really frusterating i have high speed turbo through time warner cable, my connection is fine! instead of playing
 through my router, i plugged straight in to the modem, and reset it. And its happening to all the people i have played with to day on xbox, i called x box and they said it seemed to be the servers for activision, they gave me a phone number to call and all
 i get is a computer, and to get support u have go to their website and put your questions through them. I also did some research on this and it seems like alot of PC users were having this same problem over 6 months ago!&nbsp; So if&nbsp; anyone else been having this
 same issue, please post your comments! Mabye an activision person will eventually fix the problem with their servers. thanks</p>

<p>The lag is likely just the internet being the internet, it happens to everyone at some point regardless of how good your connection is. Sorting the black screen issue is something for Infinity Ward to do as they made the game whereas Activision just sell
 it and take all the resultant flak. </p>

<p>its just lag or people leaving the game , try restarting your internet and if you have strict or moderate nat , then no one can help also , balancing teams probabley means that 4 people joined as a party then 2 groups of 3 joined so that means 4 on a team
 and 6 on the other , not fair so it waits</p>

<p><br />
<strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><b><br />
</b>You are required to perform a clean boot to find the program that is causing this and then disable or remove it. If computer boots successfully in safe mode then set the computer to start with clean startup from safe mode.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see
<br />
if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several
<br />
tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
</strong><br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />

                    Hello. In iTunes, I insert a musical CD, starts to read it but gives no results. I did some diagnostics and it says there is no Audio CD inserted, but I know there is one, so I tried other CDs to see if it did the same thing, but all other CDs work just
 fine. It also does not appear in My Computer. What seems to be the problem ?

            <p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the CD is not getting detected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens when you open the CD/DVD drive from&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;explorer? Are you able to view the drive?
</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the CD/DVD drive? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may run the Fixit provided and check. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Forza Motorsport 7 black screen issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza Motorsport 7 black screen issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello, a noob here (as far as fixing things go), for the last number of weeks since I updated windows to 1903, I have had countless issues with Windows Store games. Most notably, FM7... I'll be in detail here</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time I downloaded, it did not even load into the intro. It stuck in an infinitely long black loading screen, windowed mode. I tried going Full screen with Alt+Enter, no result. I searched online, and found that maybe resetting the app could work. After
 reset, I had to download again as the store said "Something happened to this app" (don't remember the exact words, something along those lines)... After redownloading a 100 gigabytes again, it worked twice. Then I redownloaded Forza Horizon 4 which, like FM7
 had the same problem as the store page said.... I played Forza Horizon 4 for the day, and downloaded FM6 free (I love the Forza franchise, and it is a good way for PC players to increase their XBOX Live gamerscore)... Funnily enough, FM6 ran into the same
 black screen loading issue as FM7 earlier... And then I got worried about FM7 having the same issue, and when I opened, FM7 too had the same black screen issue... FH4 has been the most stable as of now, even though I have to redownload the entire game after
 every monthly update... And about the two Motorsport games, God knows who can help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read online that resetting windows helps as it reinstalls the OS... I have done that, thinking my Forza games would stay unaffected as I play using a Samsung T5 SSD. After reset, Windows store started redownloading the entire games... FH4 and FM7... It's
 not like Steam which can identify the existing game files and save you a lot of hassle...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>C'mon Microsoft, not everyone has access to superfast internet, I have the one of the fastest plan here of 24 Mb/s. And Windows Store does not even download most of the time. I am a teenager who lives in a higher altitude region, and I feel devastated after
 purchasing ultimate editions of both games, FH4 and FM7... FH4 works for the most part, but now I'm redownloading the same 100 GB of FM7, and I don't even know if it is gonna work again... I love racing games, and Forza is best IMO, but I feel Microsoft really
 needs to fix this. I feel cheated, waiting 20+ hours to download again and again. Since June, FM7 3x = 300 GB</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FH4&nbsp; 4x = 292 GB</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and, FM6 once = 21 GB</p>
<p>Cumulatively, I spent days downloading 613 GB of the same games&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S... I don't know if it is the windows update that has been causing this issue or the external drive I am using (Samsung T5 500 GB). I had a better experience with 1809 but I can't revert, it has been more than 10 days, and I have deleted previous version
 to save space on my boot drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bearing all the whining. Please help, I shall be eternally grateful :)</p>

<p>Hi Ankush,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. We understand the game will not launch at all for you. We recommend first to completely power off the PC. Once it is back up then make sure the PC is
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/search?query=update%20Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
completely up to date</a>. Once that is done then try and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reinstall the game</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, I have a couple of noob questions here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I play in a laptop and yes, I have completely powered it off. But do you mean to perform a hard reset? (by removing the battery and some other steps I don't remember specifically)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Do I reinstall on my external drive as earlier or should I select one of my internal hard drives? I had a brief live chat with an agent and he stated it could be a problem with the particular Samsung T5 I'm using. I have FH4 reinstalled now, and that's
 working fine btw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be grateful for your reply :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ankush,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would completely shut it down from start menu and select shut down. No need to remove battery and unplug it. As for the install, try installing it to the internal drive first. If it is then successful, you can then move it to an external HD. Awesome that
 FH4 is working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
