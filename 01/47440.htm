    <title>Media Player 12 stuck on calculating when trying to sync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media Player 12 stuck on calculating when trying to sync</h2>
                    I have tried to start a sync partnership with my android device in windows media player. The number of times I tried to setup&nbsp;the&nbsp;sync media player keeps saying calculating and I can't finish the sync by clicking the "Finish" button. Windows media player
 continues to play music in the background so media player hasn't actually hung.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I unplugged&nbsp;the&nbsp;device I wanted to sync to and I can still see the partnership on the left pane when the device was unplugged. So I have tried to setup the sync details when the device was also unplugged and it still gets stuck on calculating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I am under the impression it is not due to the device itself.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But the folder I have in my media library is a&nbsp;mapped&nbsp;network drive that is cached locally. I have tried with the&nbsp;network&nbsp;drive connected as well as when I was away from the&nbsp;network&nbsp;and it still gets stuck on the calculating part. The music plays back
 fine in media player both when on the&nbsp;network&nbsp;and when away from the&nbsp;network.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried removing the mapped drive and remapping it. Also deleting the cached files and syncing the files again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't seem to find other reports of this problem.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I switch off spell-check in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a weird Problem, but can't find the solution&nbsp;- maybe you can help:</p>
<p>When typing in Microsoft Edge in Windows 10, Windows underlines words in red&nbsp;and automatically corrects them. I tried to switch it off in Setting &gt; Devices &gt; Typing and even through the registry. Sadly Windows ignores that settings completely, even after
 restarting etc.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have no idea anymore - and it is pretty annoying.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue persists in the Microsoft Edge, please try to reset the Edge and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please know that resetting the Microsoft edge will remove your bookmarks and History. Follow the instruction provided below and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Navigate to the location:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Delete everything in this folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Type Windows Powershell in search box.
</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right click on Windows Powershell and select Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>e. Copy and paste the following command.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" –Verbose}</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Reset Edge Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Edge Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Edge Settings feature. Resetting Edge isn't reversible, and all previous settings are deleted.</span></p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much - I followed your steps and it all worked. Although I had to restart the PC, otherwise it wouldn't let me install the package due to a IOError.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly this didn't solve my issue. Edge (actually Windows 10 in general) is still spell-checking.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you maybe have other ideas?</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 controller works but light not showing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 controller works but light not showing</h2>
                    I have an Xbox 360 wireless controller connected to my PC using the microsoft receiver or whatever it's called. I have been using this for the past 2 years or so and it works fine. Now, all of a sudden, the light doesn't stay on on my controller. It works
 fine, and games recognise it perfectly, but once I turn it on and it is connected showing that it is player 1, the light vanishes. With a wired controller, the light stays on. Is there a way to fix this as I know it doesn't matter but it is kind of annoying.
 I've looked and I can't find this issue anywhere else online.

<h2>            Computer display loses connection and computer reboots.</h2>
                    <p>I am on windows 10&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5073daaa-5098-4508-95db-a6590d5e521d" />&nbsp;and I am having the problems in the title, sometimes after my computer turns back on it will crash again
 with a BSOD and say Bad pool (something something). I was looking in my event viewer and found these errors:</p>
<p>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. &nbsp;The bugcheck was: 0x000000c2 (0x0000000000000007, 0x0000000000001254, 0x000000000416000a, 0xffffe00082ef23f0). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 081715-14031-01.</p>
<p>
</p><p>an error saying the latest computer restart was unexpected and (just before this error)</p>
<p>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />
{D63B10C5-BB46-4990-A94F-E40B9D520160}<br />
&nbsp;and APPID&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;to the user NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE SID (S-1-5-19) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also this error, not sure if its related:</p>
<p>The Net.Tcp Listener Adapter service depends on the Net.Tcp Port Sharing Service service which failed to start because of the following error:&nbsp;<br />
The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently set a wrong partition as the active partition and had to fix it using a partition tool from a DVD. I will reset BIOS to default but I don't think that will work. My friend says he had the same problem (I don't know if he had the same errors) and
 it was due to an "outdated graphics card". Any help would be appreciated and just ask if you need more info!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got another BSOD:</p>
<p>Kernel security check failure</p>
<p>And the Net.Tcp error happened again along with a bunch of task manager warnings like this:</p>
<p>Task Scheduler service found a misconfiguration in the NT TASK\Microsoft\Windows\Media Center\ehDRMInit definition. Additional Data: Error Value: %SystemRoot%\ehome\ehPrivJob.exe.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that means nothing. If a software application is not supported on an operating system, it will eventually fail to work properly, if it works at all. It's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows does not provide support for software applications. Only the application's developer can do that. Windows can make it possible for an unsupported application to
<em>install</em> on Windows 10, but after that it's up to the software developer.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 AMD drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> black darter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 AMD drivers</h2>
                    I have an hp Pavilion 64bit laptop which is nearly 5 years old and have recently upgraded to Windows 10. Can anyone, including Microsoft tell me when an AMD driver - or equivalent - will be available for my laptop? On the advice of a local technician I
 am 'making do' with the Windows 8 driver at the moment but it is far from satisfactory. I understand that this is a problem for Microsoft rather than hp who are not at present planning to upgrade drivers for this machine.

            <p>Hi Zigzag</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the graphics driver. I keep getting message that no driver is installed for Windows 10. Certainly my photo images are not as clear as they used to be and I suspect this may be the cause. Beyond that I'm hopelessly lost because I don't know enough about
 these things.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You may be more knowledgeable than me so can I come back to what I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My technician was unable to find the driver he was looking for and after enquiring via the web found that there wasn't one and that the only 'nearest' driver was one for Windows 8 so he has used this.</p>

</p><p>My concern is that I get this message every time I turn on my laptop - 'No AMD Graphics driver is installed or the driver is not working properly. Please install the AMD driver appropriate for your AMD hardware'</p>

</p><p>Beyond that I am unable to give you any more info so if that isn't enough I think we'll call it a day.</p>

            <p>Hi again&nbsp;Zigzag and thanks for trying to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume that the driver is the AMD Mobility Radeon HD5000 series and I've uninstalled it and it has been re-installed by Microsoft. I still get the same message as advised on September 1st.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also noticed that when I look under properties it says 'Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems (Code 43).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me any further, please? Or, am I working on the wrong item?</p>
<p>
</p><p>GordonW&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I've also realised that listed under device manager is ATI Mobility&nbsp;Radeon HD4200 series and under properties it says 'no drivers are installed for this device'. Is there a connection?&nbsp;</p>

<p>to ZigZag3143, </p>
<p>I have the same issues as Gordon.&nbsp; I was creating DOS trees and programming, probably before you were born.&nbsp; HOWEVER, I just installed Windows 10 and I also got a message that my AMD drivers are missing.&nbsp; My screen in about 50% of its former size with 3-4
 inches of black screen to either side of the active page, resulting in a loss of approx. 1/3 of my photos.&nbsp; I can only see the middle portion.&nbsp; My screen appears pale.&nbsp; Please do not ask me to be more specific, as I am not the Windows IT PRO -- you are, correct?&nbsp;
 How do we reinstall the AMD drivers which Windows 10 says are missing?&nbsp; (They were working just fine this morning with Windows 8)</p>

</p><blockquote>I have the same message coming up every time.....Install the AMD graphic driver
</blockquote>
<p>After installing the free Win10 upgrade from Win7 on my HP Pavilion, I started searching for resolution to the Graphic Driver Update popup issue since I never received any Microsoft updates for the graphics drivers.&nbsp; Due to past spam from "free" sites offering
 Driver Updates, after reading this community thread, I found this section on the AMD site (paste link in browser) and follow the instructions for your system to update your drivers without cost or annoying spam:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/legacy?product=legacy3&amp;os=Windows%2010%20-%2064
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for less tech savvy users like myself, you can download the auto-detect tool (release date 5/18/17) to find all drivers needed for your operating system Win 7, 8.1, 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/auto-detect-tool&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to update my laptop and no longer have the graphics driver issues.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 wallpaper sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kh55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 wallpaper sharing</h2>
                    <p>Something that works some times&nbsp; and doesn't work other times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two Windows 10 computers on the same workgroup and signed&nbsp; into&nbsp; the same Microsoft account and operating through the same router and sharing the same Internet account. All Windows 10 sync settings are turned on for both computers and network discovery is
 turned on for both computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when the wallpaper background is changed on one computer, that background also changes on both computers. However, at other times when the identical action is taken, the change of wallpaper on one computer will have no effect on the other.&nbsp; There's
 no apparent explanation of why this does happen or does not happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a problem. Rather, it's an unexplained mystery.</p>

            <p>this is a little confusing, I understood your first response, makes sense the settings are synchronised occasionally (?) but your last post makes me question my thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I have theme set to synchronise, and I change the desktop background on my pc&nbsp; (to a picture of my choice, not slideshow), I thought, that eventually it would appear on my tablet (which is does).</p>
<p>
</p><p>now if by chance I get the timing right the synchronisation would appear to be instantaneous, but other times I would have to wait for it to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this wrong? does it make any sense?</p>

            <p>Picture-based synchronization is done on a lazy basis.&nbsp; It should generally appear on the secondary computer.&nbsp; However, the theme is a number of moving parts, so it's possible that a moving part on system 2 gets in the way of applying system 1 to system
 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Creator's Update improves some of the cross-system roaming logic here.&nbsp; One good way to "kick" roaming is to go to the Themes page and settings.</p>

<h2>            Search Filters&#58; How can I see them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do a specific filtered search in Windows Explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a few web pages that say that I should see some search filter options when I click in the search box but on my PC no filter options appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Does anyone know why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I write "date:" in the search box then the date search filter drops down but I've read that simply clicking in the search box drops the filter options down.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> By the way, what I would like to search for are all files but not folders that were created between a pair of dates. Is that possible?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting back&nbsp;in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>&nbsp;In&nbsp;the Windows key + E window, you can type for example *.doc to search for all the files which has .doc file type. However at the top&nbsp; you have a date modified button and when you click the down arrow you are presented with some preset options you can
 select from.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Next to that you would also find additional options like kind, size and other properties. you may want to click on those additional options and explorer to check if that helps.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Windows uses the index to perform very fast searches of the most common files on your computer which &nbsp;also become better in Windows 10.</p>
<div>Lets refer the below steps and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Open a Folder and type a file you wanted to search.<br />
2.&nbsp;In the file ribbon on Top select Search Tools.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select Date Modified and select the list of drop down as per your selection.<br />
4.&nbsp;for more advance search, select advance options and </div>
<div>make changes as per your drive priority.</div>

    <title>high cpu usage. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> comphelpme12  say:</h3>
<h2>            high cpu usage.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am running hp, &nbsp;windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today&nbsp; computer running very slowly. 80-100% cpu usage, nothing obvious in task manager, only open program was windows live, and i shut that down. Nothing else has usage higher than 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not open events log intially,since
 computer running so slowly, finally got it open in safe mode.&nbsp; There are several errors which seem to relate to my repeated&nbsp;attempts to boot up today.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major thing i noticed is a few days ago i got multiple ( &gt;50)&nbsp;events "s-channel" 36887.I ran a
 full scan with Kaspersky internet 2011, no issues. On reboot, still high cpu usage, computer slow. Error messages on startup "Application has generated exception cannot be handled, Process ID Oxd2c (3356) thread ID 0xc50 (3152) Also, computer says its no longer
 seeing firewall, (Kaspersky is runnning)&nbsp;and I have received error messages about snap- ins ( could not complete), and MMC not working. Help</p>
<p>One more note which may or may not be related. I previously was getting high cpu usage traced back to SMManager errors. This computer is set up for satellite hookup. It was apparently pinging every host (verizon etc) &nbsp;trying to connect. I was able to disable
 this, but not remove it from my startup menu. this doesn't appear to be the same problem here, but any tips on how to remove from my startup menu, since I am worried this may be causing problems also?</p>

    <title>good wireless signal but weird internet connectivity&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leia_h  say:</h3>
<h2>            good wireless signal but weird internet connectivity&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hello! i've had the sony vaio e series laptop for a few years now running on a router from the company that provided internet, cable tv, and the phone, but 3 days ago we switched companies and got rid of the tv and phone services because we all use cell
 phones. we installed a linksys router and everything was working perfectly until a few hours later, the internet connection became really really slow, and then it wouldnt even load! the pages said "no internet access" or "cannot display page" but the wireless
 signal was always pretty high and it says "internet access". theres no exclamation mark over the bars either. then the internet starts working a few minutes later, then stop working again. the wireless signal sometimes drops to 3 bars, or it stays at 4 or
 5, but the internet still wouldnt work? the router is on the opposite side of the house so everyone thinks its a distance problem, but i moved my laptop to right in front of the router and the same thing happens. they still think its a distance problem or
 a problem with my computer but my cell phone does this too when i use wifi? and it's only my computer and phone. everyone else's work fine, and our 2 tablets work fine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>should i try resetting the router? i'd really rather not factory reset my computer though, because im almost positive its not actually the laptop? it was working fine the morning a man from the cable company came to install stuff and take care of the old
 router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, any ideas why it would work for a few hours, then stop for about 10 minutes at a time? sometimes it would load a website, but the pictures wouldnt show?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i checked the network status and it says the IPv4 has internet access but the IPv6 doesnt? i looked through some forums and made sure the "obtain IPv4/6 address automatically" and the "obtain dns address automatically" were checked (they were).</p>
<p>
</p><p>annnnnnnd, one last thing. we used our current router before (internet was fine then) and when we installed it again a few days ago, we made the network name the same as it was the last time. my laptop connected to it but it didnt ask for the password (maybe
 it thought it was the same too?). i checked the security tab under properties and entered the new password anyways, because we had a different password before. could this be related to the problem? im really not good with this tech stuff so any help is appreciated!</p>

<div><strong>This document pertains to HP and Compaq PCs using a
<br />
wireless network (a router) with Windows 7.</strong></div>
</li></ul>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The following sections provide detailed troubleshooting steps.
<br />
Use the steps in the first section to solve most problems with a wireless <br />
network and Internet connection. If the steps in that section do not resolve the <br />
issue, go to the section that matches the network problem the computer is <br />
experiencing.</div>

Troubleshooting a wireless network in Windows <br />

</span></div>
<div>
<div>Follow these steps to solve most problems with a wireless <br />
network and Internet connection. Test the connection after performing each step. <br />
If the problem is not fixed, continue to the next step.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Step 1: Turning on wireless using the wireless keyboard key or button <br />
(notebooks only)
</span></div>
<div>
<div>Most notebooks have a wireless keyboard key, switch, or a button
<br />
on the case that turns the wireless network device on or off. In some cases, the <br />
wireless keyboard key or button might be inadvertantly disabled by an accidental <br />
press. The wireless button or switch is usually found as one of the F keys on <br />
the keyboard or as an illuminated button above the keyboard.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 1: Example of a wireless keyboard <br />
key (yours may be different)</strong></div>
<div>An indicator light () glows blue when the Bluetooth
<br />
or WiFi communication devices are turned on. If the computer has both Bluetooth <br />
and WiFi and one of them is turned off or the device is disabled, the light <br />
glows amber. The indicator light does not glow at all when power to the device <br />
is turned off. Use the HP Wireless Assistant software to enable or disable the <br />
individual wireless functions.</div>
<div><span><br />
Step 2: Resetting power to the network router and cable or DSL modem in <br />
Windows 7
</span>
<div>When a computer establishes a connection with a router or with
<br />
the Internet, it uses several IP addresses to manage the communication. If the <br />
electrical power to the computer, the router, or the Internet service is <br />
interrupted momentarily, the IP address might change and disrupt the <br />
connections. The indicator lights on the equipment might indicate that a <br />
connection exists, but the IP addresses might not be correct. To re-estabish the <br />
correct IP addresses, reset the power as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Completely shut down the computer. Click <strong>Start
<br />
</strong>, and
<br />
then click <strong>Shut Down</strong> .</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 2: Shutting down the <br />
computer</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Unplug the power to the wireless router and to the <br />
cable or DSL modem.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 3: Unplugging the power cord from <br />
the back of a router</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Wait at least 30 seconds before continuing.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Reconnect the power to the modem and allow it to <br />
re-establish a connection to the ISP. If the modem has indicator lights, wait <br />
until the lights indicate a connection.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If using a separate wireless router, reconnect the <br />
power to the router and allow it to re-establish the connections to the modem <br />
and other components.</div>
</li><li>
<div>After the modem and router have finished making <br />
connections, turn on the computer.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Click the <strong>Network Connection</strong> icon in the
<br />
notification area and click <strong>Connect</strong> next to the name of the wireless
<br />
network.</div>
<div>If the network name is not displayed, click the <br />
<strong>Refresh </strong>button to scan for wireless
<br />
network signals.</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 3: Use Windows 7 diagnostic and troubleshooting tools for your network <br />
connection
</span>
<div>Windows 7 includes a network diagnostic tool and a network <br />
troubleshooter. Both tools help to identify network problems and provide <br />
possible solutions. Follow these steps to troubleshoot your network:</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Run Windows Network Diagnostics in Windows <br />
7
</span></div>
<div>
<div>Windows 7 monitors the network and Internet connections. If it
<br />
detects a problem, Windows 7 displays a <span>no connection</span> or <br />
<span>limited connection</span> message, and prompts you for permission to <br />
diagnose the problem. Click <strong>OK</strong> to allow Windows 7 to diagnose the problem
<br />
and restore the connection.</div>
<div>To run the diagnostic tool manually, use one of the following
<br />
options:</div>
<div><br />
<ul>
<div>
<li>
<div>No error message is displayed, but there is no <br />
Internet connection:</div>
<div>Right-click the <strong>Network Connection</strong> icon
in the <br />
notification area, and then click <strong>Troubleshoot problems</strong> . Windows Network
<br />
Diagnostics checks for problems.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 4: Troubleshoot <br />
problems</strong></div>
</li></div>
<div>
<li>
<div>The Network Connection icon is missing in the <br />
notification area:</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start </strong>, and then type
<span>network and sharing</span> in the Search box. Click <strong>Network and
<br />
Sharing Center</strong> in the results.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 5: Opening the Network and Sharing <br />
Center from the Start menu</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>In the Network and Sharing Center, click the <br />
yellow exclamation symbol or the red X
in the Network status
<br />
area to run Windows Network Diagnostics.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 6: Network status</strong></div>
</li></ol>
</li></div>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Use the Windows 7 Network and Internet <br />
Troubleshooter
</span></div>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<div>The Network and Internet Troubleshooter <br />
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 4: Manually connect to the wireless network in Windows 7
</span>
<div>A common problem with a lost connection or poor network <br />
connectivity is accidental connection to the wrong network. It is possible to <br />
connect to a network that does not actually exist. For instance, an interruption <br />
in the power to a router or a modem, or a momentary loss of signal from the ISP. <br />
These types of problems can be resolved by disconnecting from the network router <br />
and manually re-establishing a new connection.</div>
<div>Use the following steps to disconnect from a wireless network,
<br />
and then search for, and manually re-connect to the desired wireless network. </div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start </strong>, and then type
<span>network and sharing</span> in the Search box. Click <strong>Network and
<br />
Sharing Center</strong> in the results.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 10: Opening the Network and Sharing <br />
Center from the Start menu</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>In the Network and Sharing Center window, click <br />
<strong>Set up a new connection or network</strong> . </div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 11: Set up a new connection or <br />
network</strong></div>
<div>
<div><span>NOTE:</span><strong>Do not</strong> click <strong>Connect
<br />
to a network</strong> . If the problem is an incorrect password or key index, this
<br />
option reconnects with the wrong information.</div>
</li><li>
<div>In the <strong>Choose a connection option</strong> <br />
window, select <strong>Manually connect to a wireless network</strong> , and click
<br />
<strong>Next</strong> .</div>
<div>

</span></div>
<div>
<div>Most notebooks have a wireless keyboard key, switch, or a button
<br />
on the case that turns the wireless network device on or off. In some cases, the <br />
wireless keyboard key or button might be inadvertantly disabled by an accidental <br />
press. The wireless button or switch is usually found as one of the F keys on <br />
the keyboard or as an illuminated button above the keyboard.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 15: Example of a wireless keyboard <br />

<div>An indicator light () glows blue when the Bluetooth
<br />
or WiFi communication devices are turned on. If the computer has both Bluetooth <br />
and WiFi and one of them is turned off or the device is disabled, the light <br />
glows amber. The indicator light does not glow at all when power to the device <br />
is turned off. Use the HP Wireless Assistant software when you want to enable <br />
only one of the two wireless functions (Wireless LAN or <br />
Bluetooth).</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Turn on the wireless network device using HP Wireless Assistant in Windows <br />
7
</span></div>
<div>
<div>Wireless devices can be turned on and off using the HP Wireless
<br />
Assistant. This tool is designed to control the wireless LAN and Bluetooth <br />
devices individually. The wireless LAN can be turned on while the Bluetooth is <br />
turned off, or vice versa.</div>
<div>The action of the HP Wireless Assistant control is independent
<br />
of the wireless device power switch. It is possible for the wireless device LED <br />
to glow blue because power is being sent to the device, although the device is <br />
turned off. By default, the HP Wireless Assistant is configured to display a <br />
wireless icon, either On (), or Off () in the Windows notification
<br />
area. However, the computer can be set to not display in the icons in the <br />
notification area.</div>
<div>HP recommends that the HP Wireless Assistant be configured to
<br />
display the icons as follows.</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start</strong>, enter
<span>wireless assistant</span> into the search field, and then select <br />
<strong>HP Wireless Assistant</strong> from the list.</div>
<div>If HP Wireless Assistant is not installed, <br />

(), and the
<br />
network connection icon ().</div>
<div>
<div><span>NOTE:</span>If the HP Wireless Assistant is not <br />
installed, it is available in the Network drivers section of the 
Support <br />
&amp; Drivers page on hp.com.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Turn on the wireless network device using Windows Mobility Center in Windows <br />
7
</span></div>
<div>
<div>If you do not have HP Wireless Assistant installed on your <br />
computer and you do not want to install it, you can use the Windows Mobility <br />
Center to turn wireless devices on and off. Windows Mobility Center allows all <br />
wireless devices to be turned on or off at the same time—wireless LAN and <br />
Bluetooth devices cannot be turned off individually, as they can when using HP <br />
Wireless Assistant.</div>
<div>The action of the Windows Mobility Center control is independent
<br />
of the wireless device power switch. It is possible for the wireless device LED <br />
to glow blue because power is being sent to the device, although the device is <br />
turned off.</div>
<div>To verify the status of the installed wireless devices, follow
<br />
the steps below.</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start</strong>, enter
<span>mobility</span> into the search field, and then select <strong>Windows
<br />

</li><li>
<div>On the Windows Mobility Center window, this <br />
graphic shows the Wireless Network is <strong>Wireless off</strong> . Click <strong>
Turn <br />
wireless on</strong> to turn on the device.</div>
<div>Your wireless network device(s) are now turned on <br />
via Windows Mobility Center.</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 3: Make sure the wireless network connection and network adapters are <br />
enabled in Windows 7
</span>
<div>If the wireless network connection or network adapters are <br />
disabled, the computer cannot connect to the network. Follow the steps in both <br />
of the following sections to check the status of the network connection and <br />
adapters.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Make sure the network connection is enabled in Network and Sharing Center <br />
(Windows 7)
</span></div>
<div>
<div>A disabled network connection prevents the computer from <br />
connecting to the network. Follow these steps to check the status of the <br />
wireless network connection:</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start </strong>, and then type
<span>network and sharing</span> in the Search box. Click <strong>Network and
<br />

system startup.</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 4: Minimize interference and move the computer closer to the router <br />
when troubleshooting network connections
</span>
<div>A wireless network router has a limited broadcast range. The <br />
further the computer is from the router, the weaker the broadcast signal. Solid <br />
objects, such as walls, metal furniture, and electrical appliances might <br />
interfere with the signal and decrease the usable range. </div>
<div>For testing purposes, move the computer closer to the router and
<br />
minimize interference from electrical devices. If testing the connection with <br />
the computer near to the router proves that the wireless connection is working, <br />
you can move the computer to determine the range of the connection. To extend <br />
the usable range of the wireless network router, consider purchasing a different <br />
antenna from the router manufacturer, or use a signal repeater.</div>
<div>If the test fails with the computer and the router in the same
<br />
room, continue to the next step to force the device to re-establish all <br />
connection values.</div>
<div><span><br />
Step 5: Make sure that the computer is connected to the right network when <br />
troubleshooting network connections
</span>
<div>When the computer detects a wireless network, if it has been <br />
connected to that network in the past, it tries to re-establish the connection. <br />
However, the connection might not be to the correct network. </div>
<div>To determine what network the computer is connected to and to
<br />
select the network you want, do the following: </div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click the <strong>Network Connection</strong> icon in the
<br />
notification area see if any wireless networks are connected. </div>
<div>If the computer is connected to an incorrect <br />
network, click the name of the network, then click <strong>Disconnect</strong> . Click the
<br />
name of the correct network, then click <strong>Connect</strong> .</div>
<div>Once the computer is connected to the correct <br />
network, check for Internet access. If the computer does not have Internet <br />
access or has limited access, go to 
Connect the computer directly to the network router <br />
using an Ethernet cable .</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 6: Connecting the computer directly to the network router using an <br />
Ethernet cable in Windows 7
</span>
<div>Connect the computer directly to the network router using an <br />
Ethernet cable to determine if a wireless connection problem lies with the <br />
router settings or with the wireless signal. It is not necessary to turn off the <br />
computer's wireless network device during the testing.</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Move the computer closer to the router (if needed) <br />
and connect an Ethernet cable from one of the available ports on the router to <br />
the network port on the computer.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Right-click the <strong>Network Connection</strong> icon
in the <br />
notification area, and select <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> .</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select <strong>Change adapter settings</strong> .</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Figure 21: Change adapter <br />
settings</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Check the status of the <strong>Local Area <br />
Connection</strong> . </div>
</li><li>
<div>If the wired network, or the wireless network, is <br />
<strong>Disabled</strong> , right-click the connection, and click <strong>Enable</strong> . It might
<br />
take a few seconds for the connection to become enabled. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Click the <strong>Back </strong>button to return to the Network and
<br />
Sharing Center.</div>
<div><br />
<ul>
<div>
<li>
<div>If the Network and Sharing Center window shows <br />
connections from the computer to the network router, and from the router to the <br />
cable or DSL modem, click the <strong>Internet </strong>icon to open a Web browser and
<br />
view a page on the Web. The router is configured.</div>
</li></div>
<div>
<li>
<div>If the Network and Sharing Center window shows <br />
connections from the computer to the network router, but not from the router to <br />
the Internet, the router might not be configured correctly. See 
Reset and reconfigure the router <br />
.</div>
</li></div>
<div>
<li>
<div>If the network router cannot connect to the <br />
Internet, and you have installed programs that required making changes to the <br />
firewall settings, refer to router manufacturer Help files for information on <br />
restoring the router to the factory default conditions. </div>
</li></div>
</ul>
</li><li>
<div>After you have verified the direct wired connection <br />
to the Internet, turn on the power to the wireless device, disconnect the <br />
Ethernet cable from the computer, and manually setup a new connection to the <br />
wireless network (see Manually connect
<br />
to the wireless network ).</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 7: Reset and reconfigure the router to fix connection <br />
problems
</span>
<div>If you have installed a new router or made changes to the router
<br />
settings while trying to fix connection problems, reset the router to its <br />
factory settings, then run the manufacturer set up program to configure the <br />
router. </div>
<div>Use the following steps as a general guideline, but see the User
<br />
Guide for the router for model specific information.</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Enter the default IP addresses for the router into <br />
the URL address field on the browser. The following list provides default IP <br />
addresses for several routers.</div>
<div><br />
<ul>
<div>
<li>
<div><strong>3Com</strong> : <br />
http://192.168.1.1</div>
</li></div>
<div>
<li>
<div><strong>D-Link</strong> : <br />

</li></div>
<div>
<li>
<div><strong>Netgear</strong> : <br />
http://192.168.0.1</div>
</li></div>
</ul>
<div>
<div><span>NOTE:</span> These IP addresses are provided for <br />
informational purposes only.</div>
</li><li>
<div>When the home page for the router displays, you <br />
might need to type a password to perform configuration tasks. See the User Guide <br />
for model specific information.</div>
<div>
<div><span>NOTE:</span>Most manufacturers allow you to reset the
<br />
router to a default factory condition and then open router configuration <br />
screens.</div>
</li><li>
<div>When you have administrator access to the router, <br />
change the router's default name, sometimes called an SSID, to a name that is <br />
different from other routers in your area.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Set up wireless encryption (WEP) or Wi-Fi Protected <br />
Access (WPA), to prevent other computers from connecting to your home <br />
network.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Enter a network access password, sometimes called a <br />
passphrase. Make sure to pick a password that is easy to remember, such as a <br />
phone number that you dial often or a phrase that is <br />
familiar.</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 8: Check the router manufacturer's Web site for firmware <br />
updates
</span>
<div>When troubleshooting a wireless network, check your router <br />
manufacturer's Web site for updates. Outdated firmware can prevent the router <br />
from accessing the Internet or certain Web pages. </div>
<div><span><br />
Step 9: Installing updated WLAN driver and BIOS to update the wireless <br />
network connection
</span>
<div>If no network connection icon is displayed within 15 to 30 <br />
seconds after enabling the wireless network, or if a Windows <span>Device not <br />
Found</span> error message displays, the software driver might be missing or <br />
corrupt. To fix this, download and install the latest drivers and BIOS from the <br />
HP Web site.</div>
<div>To get the updated wireless LAN adapter drivers and latest <br />
version of the BIOS for your computer, go to the 
HP <br />
Drivers and Downloads page and search for updated drivers. You must know the <br />
exact model number or product number for your computer. Be sure to select the <br />
correct operating system. </div>
<div>If the wireless adapter you are using was purchased separately,
<br />
consult the manufacturer's Web site for the latest software.</div>
<div>
<div><span>NOTE:</span>If the computer cannot connect to the <br />
Internet, use another computer to download the files to an external storage <br />
device. Install the updated drivers from external storage device. </div>
<div><span><br />
Step 10: Performing a Microsoft System Restore
</span>
<div>If the computer was able to connect to the wireless network in
<br />
the past, but now cannot connect, perform a 
Microsoft <br />
System Restore . </div>
<div>If you have completed all the steps and still cannot connect to
<br />
the wireless network, contact HP for support.</div>

<div>
<div>Complete the following steps to resolve slow or dropped wireless
<br />
connections:</div>
<div><span><br />
Step 1: Manually connecting to the wireless network in Windows 7
</span>
<div>A common problem with a lost connection or poor network <br />
connectivity, is accidental connection to the wrong network. It is possible to <br />
connect to a network that does not actually exist. For instance, an interruption <br />
in the power to a router or a modem, or a momentary loss of signal from the ISP. <br />
These types of problems can be resolved by disconnecting from the network router <br />
and manually re-establishing a new connection.</div>
<div>Use the following steps to disconnect from a wireless network,
<br />
and then search for, and manually re-connect to the desired wireless network. </div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start </strong>, and then type
<span>network and sharing</span> in the Search box. Click <strong>Network and
<br />
Sharing Center</strong> in the results.</div>

notification area, click the name of the new network, and then click <br />
<strong>Connect</strong> .</div>
</li></ol>
<div><span><br />
Step 2: Moving the computer closer to the router to strengthen the broadcast <br />
signal
</span>
<div>A wireless network router has a limited broadcast range. The <br />
further the computer is from the router, the weaker the broadcast signal. Solid <br />
objects, such as walls, metal furniture, and electrical appliances might <br />
interfere with the signal and decrease the usable range. </div>
<div>For testing purposes, move the computer closer to the router and
<br />
minimize interference from electrical devices. If testing the connection with <br />
the computer near to the router proves that the wireless connection is working, <br />
you can move the computer to determine the range of the connection. To extend <br />
the usable range of the wireless network router, consider purchasing a different <br />
antenna from the router manufacturer, or use a signal repeater.</div>
<div>If the test fails with the computer and the router in the same
<br />
room, continue to the next step to force the device to re-establish all <br />
connection values.</div>
<div><span><br />
Step 3: Adjusting Windows 7 wireless connection performance <br />
settings
</span>
<div>Watching streaming video over a wireless connection takes <br />
significant processing power. The video can skip (drop frames) when other <br />
software programs are active. Close any open software programs and try viewing <br />
again. </div>
<div>For even better performance, prevent unwanted software programs
<br />
from opening with Windows and adjust Windows 7 performance settings. For more <br />
helpful tips on how you can increase performance, see 
Increasing <br />
System Performance Without Adding Memory in Windows 7 . </div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Selecting a high performance Power Plan for the battery (Notebook computers <br />
only)
</span></div>
<div>
<div>If your wireless connection suddenly stops working when your <br />
notebook is operating on battery power, you may want to disable some of the <br />
power saver settings. </div>
<div>Notebooks use power settings to balance performance and battery
<br />
life for users. If the power option is set to lower power setting to maximize <br />
battery life, it will reduce power to the network adapter. You should set the <br />
Power Output settings to 100% (maximum performance) for both battery power and <br />
when plugged into the AC power adapter. Follow the steps below to verify the <br />
correct settings:</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start</strong>, enter
<span>power</span> into the search field, and then select <strong>Power <br />
Options</strong> from the list.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select the <strong>recommended</strong> High Performance or
<br />
Balanced power plan.</div>
</li></ol>
<div>Close the Device Manager, restart the notebook PC and attempt to
<br />
reconnect to the wireless network.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
Disabling wireless device power management options (Notebook computers <br />
only)
</span></div>
<div>
<div>Most wireless devices can be configured to turn off power to <br />
reduce the power drain on the battery. This is usually not a problem when the <br />
notebook is connected to an AC power adapter. However, when operating on battery <br />
power, the adapter can be turned off to save power. To disable this power <br />
setting, do the following steps.</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click <strong>Start</strong>, enter
<span>device</span> into the search field, and then select <strong>Device
<br />
Manager</strong> from the list.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Double-click <strong>Network Adapters</strong> to expand the
<br />
list, right-click the wireless (WiFi) adapter in the list, and then select <br />
<strong>Properties</strong> .</div>
</li><li>
<div>On the properties window for the adapter, select <br />
the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab, and then de-select the <strong>Allow the computer to
<br />
turn off this device to save power</strong> option.</div>
</li></ol>
<div>Close the Device Manager, restart the notebook PC, and attempt
<br />

            <p>Best bet it to delete anything you have downloaded for the game, restart your console, and your internet. And if possible connect an Ethernet cable to your console.</p>

<h2>            Games bought digitally.</h2>
                    
<p>I currently have an xbox 360 but will be getting an xbox one soon. Am i able to bring over/redownload/etc the games i bought on the xbox dashboard [Left 4Dead, PvZ Garden Warfare and such] when i get my xbox one or are those game pretty much just a waste
 of money i spent cuz i cant bring them over as well.</p>

<p>Im asking in the terms of now [which i dont think i can but figured id ask regardless] and later [Aka when backwards compatability comes out] will i then be able to transfer the games over or what?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>Currently, no. Even with the current phase of backwards compatibility, those games are not backwards compatible yet. So you would need to purchase the Xbox One version if you want to play them. As far as in the future, it depends on whether or not the games
 are made backwards compatible.</p>

<p>I would suggest never,ever buy any digital down load. If Xbox live goes down as it is right now, you will not be able to play any game you have bought through a digital down load. same goes for apps. Much better to just get the retail version.</p>

<h2>            Can I change the username in windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I first installed my windows 7, I put only my name (something like John) as the username but now I want to change the username to be ny name and surname (like John Bieber). I have successfuly changed the new user account in control panel. But some problems
 still bother me. When I installed some program or open system information, the programs always show only my name (without my surname) in registered username or system information and I can't correct it. I tried to look at the registry and found that in the
 HKEY_Current_user\software\microsoft\active setup\installed components\{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}\username shows only my name. So I changed it but it always turns back to be the same.</p>
<p>Can you tell me how to change the username?</p>

            I'm not quite sure I understand your question. You've been trying to create a system image on an HP envy 17t series laptop running Windows 7, and you've tried to use both the Windows Backup utility and Macrium Reflect, but neither has worked? Could you
 provide more detail on what you're trying to accomplish, and why those two software packages aren't working for you?<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Type Cover not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathryndawkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Type Cover not working</h2>
                    <p>I know this question has been asked a lot already, but so far I have not seen a "resolution" response by a Microsoft team member.</p>
<p>My type cover stopped working about 3 weeks ago, and I believe it coincided with an update.&nbsp; I have tried all of the suggested "fixes" and none of them have worked.&nbsp; This is not a hardware issue, as I have tested my type cover on another device and it works,
 and tried another type cover on my device which didn't work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the following fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart PC</li><li>Detach and clean type cover ports</li><li>Reinstall the type cover driver -- This one <strong>not possible</strong> as type cover filter device doesn't appear in "keyboards" in device manager</li><li>Force shut down and restart</li><li>Reset PC (keeping personal files)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I've also tried to install the driver device manually using the Microsoft Windows Installer Package .msi file.</li><li>I've detached and reattached the cover multiple times consecutively</li><li>I've disabled and re-enabled the type cover in UTEI </li><li>I've uninstalled and updated the firmware "surface embedded controller firmware", "surface system aggregator", "surface UEFI"</li><li>I've run the troubleshooter for "hardware and device" and "keyboard"</li><li>I've run the Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</li><li>About a million other small tweaks that I can't think of now</li></ul>
<p>I have also looked at the system driver state and it varies since I did the reset, but the Surface Type Cover is always stopped (see pic below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Version 1803, OS build 17134.706, update KB4346084.</p>
<p>

            <div>There is no amount of troubleshooting that has helped others with this issue</div>
<div>(and sadly there are lots of others with this problem). Your only real option is</div>
<div>to exchange, which currently is $450 US out of warranty. If you are outside the</div>
<div>US, contact support</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers.</a></div>
<div>If you are in Australia, there is a Microsoft Store in Sydney. If you are near</div>
<div>Sydney, you could go there and see if they will negotiate an upgraded exchange</div>
<div>to the newer Surface Pro 2017 (refurbished) or even a SP6 refurb. They only</div>
<div>replace with refurbs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you don't want to spend the money for a refurb, consider something like</div>
<div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MoKo-Microsoft-Wireless-Keyboard-Trackpad/dp/B017TU3DVQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/MoKo-Microsoft-Wireless-Keyboard-Trackpad/dp/B017TU3DVQ</a></div>
<div>which works on Bluetooth instead of using the proprietary Surface Connector.</div>
<div>Amazon has a good return policy if this doesn't suit your needs. It may be</div>
<div>better than not having a working type cover. </div>

<p>Hi Barb,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I am on the other side of the country to Sydney, so that's not an option for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why the onus is on me to spend even more money on an issue that is Microsoft's fault, particularly when this computer cost me over AU$2000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've considered the wireless keyboard option but again that doesn't seem right to me. I would still need to travel with the type cover to keep my screen protected plus lug around another keyboard that I don't want to have to pay more money for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this is not your fault (obviously) but surely there has to be a solution offered by Microsoft free of charge, particularly seeing as so many people are affected. Are they really not going to do anything?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            While that would be really helpful, it really has to do with other countries laws and whatnot. I don't know if its impossible, but definitely not easy. :)

            I think Microsoft would love to be able to do that, but they have to abide by each country/regions laws, currency &amp; taxes, which is why there is different stores for each country.

Purchase and play
<div>
<p><strong>What happens if my billing address doesn't match my console's locale? </strong>
</p>
<p>In that case, you will not be able to purchase content. You must have a valid billing address and payment option that matches your console locale.
</p>
<p>For example, if you are in France and set your console location to France, you will see French Store information. However, if your billing address is in Germany, you will not be able to purchase content because you must have a valid payment option connected
 to a French billing address. </p>

                    <p><i>Help with Windows XP Media Center re-install</i></p>
<p>I have dell demenision with Windows XP Media Rollout 2. I belive in the past I have updated SP3 to the machine. As the PC was getting slow after 4 years, yesterday I tried to re-install Windows while keeping the data and programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made the mistakes of booting to the wrong cd. I used Windows XP Professional sp2 not the media center dvd. The install appeared to go fine until it asked for the authentication code. Which the cert code on the dell case did not work. At that point the
 install stopped and I could not reset. I powered off then on, and then booted to the correct Media Center dvd to continue the install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the install 2 errors poped up "ngen.exe entry point not fount" and ".NET Framework initialization error". Install continued. Never asked for Authentication code. Install appears to have never finished. Now it automatically reboots several times. Some
 time it get blue death screen and says "dumping physical memory".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to reinstall a 3rd time and get same errors and process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have backed up all data and email to an external drive, but I do not want to do a clean in stall because of all the programs that are on the c drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC does boot into safe mode and safe mode with networking just fine. Thought I found a fix to re-install .NET 1.1 but I cannot in either safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas to fix the install problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to back up the programs on the external drive, do a clean install of xp, then re-install the programs on the c drive without the program cds? Is it possible to create another partition on th c drive which will run xp then leave the programs
 on the current partition?</p>
