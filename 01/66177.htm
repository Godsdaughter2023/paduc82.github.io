<h2>            Activating Cortana from Surface Pen</h2>
                    <p>So before the Windows 10 Update yesterday I was able to activate cortana from long pressing the pen and make voice commands. After the update I long press and Cortana pops up but doesn't respond to my voice. I can however say the "Hey Cortana" and it hears
 me and responds. I was online with support they seemed to have uninstalled stuff and re-installed things, sorry I'm not too specific I'm a newb. They finally had me do a restart to factory conditions and said that if &nbsp;that doesn't work exchange it. It still
 doesn't work. This is my second one already the first was a nightmare all sorts of issues. I really don't want to go through the exchange process but I will one more time if I need to. Just hoping if someone has a fix out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andy</p>

                    <p>SO my cat walked over my keyboard and mess with the desktop icons somehow? They all lined up real small at the left of the screen and i can't move any of them from the line up and when i try to adjust the size the bottom most icons just scroll past the physical

</p>

<p>It's quite possible. First, copy the entire store folder from your old machine to the same spot on the new one. By default, the store folder is this one:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\</span>{user}<span style="font-weight: bold">\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</span></p>
<p>where {user} is the name of the Windows user account concerned. Note that {user} may not be the same on the new machine, depending on the name you gave it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then download the Windows Essentials 2012 full installer from the wayback machine. There are two English versions; if one doesn't install, try the other one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Universal English: </span></span></p>

<h2>            Multiple monitor issues after Creators update</h2>
                    I have two monitors connected to my PC, an Acer XB270HU as my primary and a BenQ XL2420TX as the secondary monitor. After the creators update, when I boot my computer the BenQ will get stuck at a low resolution and I will often have to restart multiple
 times before it decides to run at its standard resolution of 1920x1080. Also, the monitor is stuck at 60hz and will no longer allow me the option of running it at 120hz like its supposed to. Both monitors are connected by displayport to my Geforce GTX 980
 TI and were working fine before the update.

<p>Hi Gerrys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may have been issues with the Creators Update installation you are running on the devices. To further determine why you are facing the problem, kindly answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you install the Creators Update on the computer?</li><li>Do you get any error messages when you start the PC while the secondary monitor is connected?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest updating your drivers on the computer now that you are running the Creators Update. Doing this will ensure that all software are not conflicting with each other. You can read about updating Windows by opening
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will also give us more information about the ongoing problem if you run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. This tool will scan for possible errors and apply corrections to resolve them. Go through the steps below to run the recommended tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>On the left panel, click on <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>and allow the troubleshooter to run.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you see changes after performing the suggestions above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            The creators update happened automatically. Window popped up saying I needed to restart my computer to install updates. I restarted, and everything seemed to update without any issues, no error messages or anything came up and I have not seen any error
 messages when starting the PC with both monitors connected. I ran the troubleshooter and it told me that the troubleshooter could not identify the problem. Windows update tells me that my device is up to date.

<p>I still don't trust Windows Updates with my graphics drivers, and this may be why my very similar system</p>
<p>ASUS 27" GSync (Displayport) w/ BenQ XL2420z&nbsp; (DVI ) &amp; GTX980 does not have any problems ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you tried installing your Nvidia driver manually with a download from Nvidia ?</p>
<p>If not, note&nbsp; that you will also need to block Windows updates from installing the Nvidia driver by using the</p>
<p>Show/hide tool in the article below.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to temporarily prevent a Windows or driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp; will also need to uninstall the driver using either DDU or Driver Fusion. If you uninstall via Programs and Features</p>
<p>Windows will pop in a driver from it's hidden driver cache when you reboot after uninstalling.</p>
<p>My Win10 wants to sneak in the first Nvidia driver that was installed when I did the Win7&gt;10 upgrade.</p>
<p>(Run the Show/hide tool after uninstalling, but before rebooting. Stay on line while running show/hide, but for</p>
<p>extra protection go off line before rebooting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Well almost no problems. Even though the BenQ is secondary, when I boot into Windows, even with</p>
<p>it disabled and switched off, the post screen and BIOS want to display on the BenQ rather than the ASUS.</p>
<p>I don't use the second screen much, so if I want to do something in BIOS (switch to Win7 mostly) I have to
</p>
<p>enable the BenQ when it is connected to the GTX980 (Maybe DVI takes precedence over Displayport while</p>
<p>booting into Windows ?).</p>
<p>I tend to keep the BenQ on my Intel HD graphics except when using Nvidia 3D Vision now though, so it's</p>
<p>not a problem.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; I do find the refresh rate <em>sometimes</em> gets set down to 60Hz on the main monitor when I enable the</p>
<p>secondary when using the Intel HD . Possibly because the Intel HD is limited to 60Hz, so this tends to happen</p>
<p>when I enable both (but also 'randomly' ), but there is no problem setting the main monitor back to 144Hz when this happens or&nbsp; setting either monitor back to 120/144Hz when both are on the Nvidia gpu.</p>
<p>This behaviour is not new to 1703 or even Win10 though. </p>
<p>
</p><p>btw -&nbsp; Personally, while I've not had a problem with the three version updates since my Win10 upgrade</p>
<p>(I did do the upgrade twice though), these big updates overwrite too much, and are too large to trust fully,</p>
<p>and Windows Updates is the least safe method of doing the big version updates.</p>
<p>The safest way to deal with these updates&nbsp; is to make a clone of your Win10 to an external HDD before the update, and as these&nbsp; updates are well advertised, plan ahead and use the
<em>Media Creation Tool </em>or&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>Windows Update Assistant</em> to&nbsp; install the update at a time that suits you.</p>

            I tried uninstalling all of the video drivers, turned off automatic updates, ran display driver uninstaller in safe mode, manually reinstalled the latest drivers. Still having the same issue.<br />
<br />
Also, my bitdefender anti-virus stopped working with the new update. I uninstalled bitdefender and decided to just use windows defender, but I cannot get real-time protection to turn on because windows still thinks I am using a third party anti-virus. Spend
 all night googling and going through every possible solution I could find to make sure bitdefender was completely uninstalled, but windows still thinks I am using third party antivirus software and won't let me enable defender.<br />
<br />
This update sucks.

<p>You may need to make use of a third-party software removal tool to get rid of all traces of the antivirus. Once registry subkeys and system configurations created by the software have been removed, you'll be able to switch on Defender. This may even help
 in resolving the initial concern we've been working on.</p>

<p>I have essentially the same problem, the creators update happened over the weekend while I was away. This evening (Monday) when I sat at my computer, I had nothing showing on my main monitor. I turned on my big screen monitor and that's where my display
 is now showing. I attempted to get my dual monitor back trying two different 22 inch monitors and I still get nothing on these smaller monitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference that I can determine is that my big screen Vizio 47" TV\Monitor is HDMI and my smaller monitors are DVI\VGA, I'm using DVI. My video card is a 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 with driver version 22.21.13.8205 dated 05/01/2017. I'll continue
 to research and try different things in the hopes to find a resolution.</p>

            I just downloaded the most recent NVIDIA drivers (382.33-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql) with a 05/22/2017 release and installed it, I once again have dual monitor. the driver now is&nbsp;22.21.13.8233. Updating to the most recent video drivers worked
 for me.

<p>The issue appears to be with the generic monitor.inf file no longer supporting TV's

</p><p>I have an Nvidia GTX980 and have tried DP HDMI and DVI ports. The driver is current and I have tried older drivers also.

<p>Regarding the post below, I spent over 30 hours working this problem with tier3 Microsoft support with their paid Assure plan over a period of 4 weeks. They assured me at each step it had to be a driver problem.&nbsp; They had me personally contact five driver
 vendors related to my HP ENVY laptop, including HP.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Each vendor informed me it was bad code in the Creators Update, that I was not the only one with the problem, and after checking that I did have all the latest drivers installed, said that my only hope was that the problem would be solved in a future Microsoft
 WIN10 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time, Microsoft support, through their Assure Program, said the other vendors were failing to provide compatible drivers. At one point, one technician said my only solution was to buy a new monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, exactly a month after the Creators update, the monthly update to it was released and my problem was instantly solved.&nbsp; I have not had the problem since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a long debriefing with Microsoft it seemed clear that their Tech teams are disconnected from their developer teams, unable to pass on that the problem was a known one that would be fixed in the next update. I might not have liked hearing that I would
 have to wait a month for a fix, but it would have saved me scores of hours attempting to fix what could only be fixed by Microsoft's developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given my experience, my recommendation is to ensure that you have the fall creators update installed AND ALL UPDATES TO IT. If you still have the problem after that, and you are confident your relevant drivers are current, I am at a loss to provide other
 advice beyond investing the time to further engage Microsoft Tier 3 or higher support, news that is likely distressing to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes. Open each program and look for options to stop it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netbooks are low powered devices, often equipped with 1gb RAM as standard. Look to increasing RAM to 2gb. It helps greatly..

<p>There you will find some checkboxes for each program which will be started.</p>

                    <p>My windows keeps asking me to enter a code, it was designed for it to send me a new code to my Yahoo account but that one has been closed. I changed it to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and I am not getting anything at all. The system said that I would get it
 by October 30th and that is a long time, can you expedite the receipt of the code?&nbsp;

<div>The User Profile folders are protected systems folders and cannot be </div>

<div>Microsoft's NT-based operating systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Renaming a user account will not rename the previously existing</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You need to create a new User account with the desired name, and</div>

    <title>Intellitype causes windows to open without focus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pkstokes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intellitype causes windows to open without focus</h2>
                    
<p>When I use the "Web/Home" ; "Search" or "Mail" keys on my Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard, the application window opens in the background without having focus. &nbsp;But it's a bit more erratic than that...</p>
<p>With the keys set to their defaults:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Web/Home - Start web browser (open Chrome, which is my default browser) ...in the background</li><li>Search - Opens search pane ...in the foreground with focus </li><li>Mail - Starts Microsoft Office Outlook ...in the background without no focus </li></ul>
<div>The other buttons (Back, Forward, volume, play/pause, calculator) all work properly in all circumstances.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>But</strong> - if 'Search' is assigned to another program (eg: Bible reading prog), then the application window opens in the background.</div>
<div><strong>Also</strong> - if I access these programs from the Start menu, then they do open in the foreground with focus.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">System</span>&nbsp;(relevant bits?)</div>
<div>Windows 7 Professional (32 bit)</div>
<div>Intellitype 8.0.225 (have also tried with version 7, and get same results)</div>
<div>Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>NB - Windows 7 was clean-installed three weeks ago. &nbsp;Previously I was using XP Pro, and the keyboard worked absolutely normally.</div>

<p>Steps taken, and symptoms encountered:-</p>
<p>Removed both Intellitype and also Intellipoint as instructed, then rebooted the PC.</p>
<p>Tested the keyboard buttons using only the inbuilt Win7 default driver (which recognizes the keyboard model, but does not allow buttons to be customized). And I made sure several other windows were open, and that one of them had focus before pressing the
 "Web/Home" key:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome opened in the foreground with focus. :) </li></ul>
<div>Installed Intellitype 8.0.225, and tested the "Web/Home" key in the same manner:-</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Chrome opened behind the other windows :( </li></ul>

            <p>Hi Bong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you have experienced might due to<span>&nbsp;incompatible drivers. </span>
<span>You may try to update your drivers first and see if it makes any difference. See this Wiki article:

<p>I did something else too, I did login to my MS account- using the recovery options. I tried to change the "primary alias" by changing it to one of the valid email IDs I had given. However, it said that- you have renamed this account once- you cannot do it
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets hope for the best. I will post a reply after 24 hours.</p>

    <title>Media Center Problem - No TV Signal then Service Unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newdeity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center Problem - No TV Signal then Service Unavailable</h2>
                    <p>I use WMC to record programs (it's not attached to a tv). Frequently programs will not record. The WMC history will say, "NOT RECORDED: NO TV SIGNAL". If a program starts recording it always records completely and without problems. The error happens only
 at the start of a recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem lies in the amount of time the IR blaster takes to change channels. After changing channels with WMC, it takes about 11 seconds for the channel to appear on the WMC window. At about 5 seconds the WMC window always displays No TV Signal.
 Then its a race. If the "Service Unavailable" error appears for more then a second the recording fails. If the TV picture appears first, it records fine.&nbsp; Even if it fails with the "Service Unavailable" error you can go the the guide a couple seconds later,
 choose record and it records fine. I'm hoping there might be a registry setting that could make WMC wait 15-20 seconds before calling "Service Unavailable". Or perhaps a way to entirely prevent the "Service Unavailable" error check from running and force it
 to record anyway? Any other ideas?</p>
<p>

<p>Hauppauge HD PVR (only one tuner) connected to a Dish Network VIP211K box</p>
<p>Hauppauge software and drivers are up to date. Windows 7 is up to date.</p>
<p>For the past few years I had been successfully using WinTV because I couldn't get WMC to read my Dish channels. I recently re-installed Windows 7 and Media Center finally recognized the Dish channels. I would hate to go back to the barebones WinTV. But if
 WMC stays unreliable, I'll have to.<br />

    <title>sound problem in brand new asus ROG strix hero 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            sound problem in brand new asus ROG strix hero 2</h2>
                    <p>So, there appears to be a problem with my computer. The volume would automatically and randomly change from low to high. This has nothing to do with the volume slider. It stays the same. However, the actual volume keeps on changing. I first experienced this
 while watching YouTube videos and thought it was just a glitch with YouTube, but after experiencing this on multiple players I realized it had something to do with the computer. This problem only started to occur when I got Windows 10, so I'm assuming that
 it's a problem with the Windows 10. Does anyone have any more information about this, and does anyone know how to fix it? I'm getting really tired of this ..&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: my english is not good, so i just found the same question that explain my problem, but i didnt find the anwser until now.. plsee for people who try to help, stop spam... we dont need read ur commend over and over again..&nbsp; microsoft cant help us.. they
 just give us forum like this, but sometimes nothing happen.. my laptop is asus rog strix hero II, brand new one. plse help</p>

            Hello, I'm Bradford, an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I'll try to help you with the sound issue you're experiencing. Even though your laptop is brand new it only includes the device drivers included at the time it was put together. I just looked and Asus released an updated Sound Driver for your model Dec 25th, 2018. 
<br />
<br />Please review the disclaimer below and this link on Asus.com should allow you to download the latest driver. 
<br />
<br />Origin: <a href="https://www.asus.com/tw/Laptops/ROG-Strix-Hero-II/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/tw/Laptops/ROG-Strix-Hero-...</a>

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/GamingNB/GL504GS/Audio_Realtek_AVO_W10_64_V6018544.zip?_ga=2.100256664.782525241.1549959367-1175331487.1544276069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/GamingNB/GL5...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have downloaded the file please follow the instructions the driver says to do. 
<br />
<br />If you get an error message that says something like "Current Driver is Newer than install driver" please continue installing it. 
<br />
<br />After the install is done, please restart your Asus ROG, and test the sound by watching the same YouTube video again.
<br />
<br />If that does not solve the problem then you might need to update your device's BIOS. Please see the support manuals located here for steps on how to update the Bios:

<br />
<br />The latest BIOS for your model was released on Jan 17, 2019 and its link is here, however, please follow all of the precautions and steps Asus says to do when updating your BIOS: 
<br />

<br /> 
<br />I hope one of these two solutions will let you enjoy your music and YouTube videos soon!
