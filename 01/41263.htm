            From search type troubleshoot.
<br />Select to run the Hardware and Devices and see if it can find it.
<br />
<br />I want to Clevos site and doesn't look like they have drivers for Windows 10.
<br />You may need to contact Clevo and find out from their support if they carry drivers for Windows 10.
<br />If not you will need to go back to Windows 7.
<br />Sorry, not all vendors support Windows 10.
<br />Let me know if you need further help.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd  nstall Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Linx 8 tablet update to windows 10 1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyw_50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linx 8 tablet update to windows 10 1709</h2>
                    <p>Grateful for any help with the following, </p>
<p>I have a Linx 8 tablet with 32gb SSD and 1GB Ram running windows 10 1607 and I really like it but it is desperate to upgrade to windows 10 1709 (constantly trying to update) unfortunately near the end of the update at re-boot a&nbsp; blue screen states;
<br />
"There isn’t enough memory available to create a ramdisk device. Error code: 0xc0000017".
<br />
I have tried the BCDEDIT command to clear any bad memory but this doesn't seem to make any difference.<br />
Linx haven't really helped although they offered to send a USB stick to roll back to windows 8. so my questions are:<br />
1: Can I stick with windows 10 1607 and will microsoft carry on with extended support (critical security updates)?<br />
2: do I need to roll back to windows 8 to get extended support?<br />
3: is there any way to free up enough memory to get the ramdisk to work (BCDEDIT didn't work) and update to 1709.<br />

            Hi Andy,
<br />
<br />Here you can find out about extended support for each Windows 10 build here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/...</a>
<br />
<br />According to the same lifecycle fact sheet, Windows 8/8.1 is good until 2023 for extended support. To me, it makes more sense to go to 8.1 than Windows 10 1607, since it has a shorter lifespan.
<br />
<br />Also, unfortunately there is not much you can do to free up the RAM for a ramdisk. The 1 GB of memory already in the tablet is soldered on and is not serviceable, and it is already restricting enough.
<br />
<br />Try going back to Windows 8.1 and see how well it works from here on out. Good luck.

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
Some of the reasons why you're unable to create HomeGroup on your Windows 10 PC are the following:<br />
<br />
• Date and time might be incorrect.<br />
• You might have a Windows operating system that restricts your homegroup use.<br />
• You might not be connected to a network, or you might not be connected to the right network.<br />
<br />
As an initial troubleshooting, we suggest running the HomeGroup troubleshooter to diagnose and repair common homegroup&nbsp; issues by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key+ X</strong> key, Select <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>, Click <strong>View </strong><strong>All</strong>.<br />
3. Click <strong>Homegroup </strong>and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
Update us with the result.<br />

<p>HUH, did you stop sharing all files and devices on all PC's&nbsp;on home network in Homegroup first. If you follow the instructions precisely, I can not see how it would not work. This would include disconnecting your cell phones from internet. I have done this
 on so many PC's and it has worked 100% of the time.</p>

<strong>2.</strong> Though there is no clear indication Eset could be involved so I would fully uninstall it and use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus.<br />

<br />
<strong>3.</strong> This seems to be a fairly new computer so I would check with AsusTek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. &nbsp;<br />

<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly (see memory test methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>Be sure you have sufficient disk space on the Windows drive - Run Disk CleanUp<br />
and then run Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
Type in Cortana's Search box -disk cleanup<br />
<br />
File Explorer - C: (Or Windows drive letter) - Properties - Tools - Error Checking -<br />
Check (run it even if it says it does not need it).<br />
<br />
<strong>6. </strong>Use ALL the other methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>7.</strong> If needed run DriverVerifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see DriverVerifier<br />
methods below).<br />

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>

Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>Broadcom WiFi incompatible with Windows 10 Oct 2018 &#40;1809&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Broadcom WiFi incompatible with Windows 10 Oct 2018 &#40;1809&#41; &#40;BCM94352HMB&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am having a serious issue with wifi connectivity and the latest beta test (Windows 10 October Update 1809) that was pushed out last week. Before this update, my wifi card would lose wifi connectivity about 2-3 times a week, this is not a distance issue
 because I am within 15 feet of the router and when this disconnect issue occurs, if I open up my wireless connections menu, absolutely 0 wifi ssid's show up in the list. There are typically around 8-10 around my house and 20+ at my work so there is no way
 this is correct. My network connections will continue to show 0 available wireless connections available until I right click on my wireless network adapter and disable it, and then re-enable it, causing all the wireless access points to show up again and connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with this latest October update, this is happening every 10-20 minutes, pretty much making wireless access with my laptop impossible. My wireless card is a Broadcom&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">BCM94352HMB and laptop is a Lenovo
 y510p. I believe that Windows 10 is once again pushing incorrect drivers out with the latest update for broadcom wifi pci-e cards.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver I have currently installed shows 7.35.295.2 Provider: Broadcom Driver Date: 7/20/2015</p>

<p>There isn't any. Leveno never sold a laptop with this broadcom chipset, it was upgraded because the original card didn't support 5ghz AC wifi . The latest driver for this chipset on broadcom shows 6.34.223.5 which is a beta driver for windows 10. This is
 why I am bothered that every time i try to uninstall the device driver, windows 10 automatically upgrades the driver to&nbsp;<span>7.35.295.2 and I'm not even sure what pcie card that is for.</span></p>

            Can you download and install the older driver?
<br />Before you do that though Go to file explorer and to c:\windows\softwaredistrubution\download and empty that folder.  So it does not try and reinstall the drivers again.

            Unfortunately this didn't change the reinstallation process. I deleted the contents of the c:\windows\softwaredistrubution\download, uninstalled the device in device manager, scanned for hardware changes, pcie wifi card shows up, driver automatically installs
 which is&nbsp;<span>7.35.295.2. If i try to manually update the driver, it displays "you currently have the newest driver for this device" or something simliar to that.</span>

<p>
</p><p>System requirements</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 on your PC or tablet, here’s what it takes.</p>
<p>Latest OS:&nbsp; Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 8.1, see the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1</span></a>

<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What are some of the new improvements in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customizable Start experience.</li><li>Refreshed icons and graphics</li><li>Integration with Microsoft's digital assistant - Cortana, can be used for finding and retrieving information on the Internet and your PC, such as files. You can also use it to control applications such as the Music Player and prepare an email message or
 track a package. </li><li>Task View for managing applications using multiple desktops.</li><li>Modern apps can now be windowed and behave just like desktop apps.</li><li>Notification Center for centralized management of notifications and quick access to PC settings.</li><li>Universal applications that work not only on your Windows 10 PC, but also your mobile phone running Windows 10 and also XBOX One.</li><li>XBOX App for Streaming of live games to a PC or Tablet</li><li>Touch optimized Office applications (Word, Excel, Outlook, OneNote and PowerPoint). Providing the power of Office on devices with touch support. Users can edit, prepare documents, spreadsheets and presentations with full document fidelity regardless of
 device. </li><li>Continuum Mode - if you own a 2 in 1 form factor that works both as a laptop and tablet, you can easily let Windows 10 decide the best environment for you. Once detached into Tablet mode for instance, you can work in a more touch optimized user interface.
 Users will also be able to remotely use Windows 10 Mobile apps on their Windows PCs.</li><li>Microsoft Edge&nbsp;- Windows 10 will include a next generation web browser called Edge that support advances in Windows 10 such as Cortana for finding information on the web, Annotation, PDF support, superior reading experience.</li><li>Music and playlist integration in OneDrive.</li><li>Unified messaging using Skype Integration</li><li>Windows Hello and Passport for personalized authentication without the use of passwords.
</li><li>Device Guard for protecting devices against malicious applications.</li><li>Support for media formats such as FLAC and MKV</li></ul>
<p><strong>Which features will be removed when I upgrade from a previous version of Windows?</strong></p>
<p>Feature deprecation section </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, or Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center and you install Windows 10, Windows Media Center will be removed.</li><li>Watching DVDs requires separate playback software</li><li>Windows 7 desktop gadgets will be removed as part of installing Windows 10.</li><li>Windows 10 Home users will have updates from Windows Update automatically available.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

    <title>Taskbar Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jedirock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar Bug</h2>
                    Found a small bug in the highlighting of applications on the taskbar. Tested with Windows Explorer, haven't tested any others. Always reproducible on my machine.<br />
<br />
Open two windows. Show the previews by mousing over the icon. Mouse over one of the windows, and hover over the close button. Once the window comes to the front, close it using the close button on the preview, then move your mouse off the preview so that the
 preview will close soon. The highlight stays on the icon no matter where you move the mouse, until you focus another window or mouse over a taskbar icon again.

    <title>Why is Microsoft trying to charge me again for age verification&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcmonroe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Microsoft trying to charge me again for age verification&#63;</h2>
                    
<div><span>I have already ready spent about 6 hours with xbox live support then they sent me to windows live account&nbsp; support who sent me to windows live support who sent me back to here.&nbsp; The following are copies
 of the emails and post from earlier attempts to get resolution:<br />
</span></div>
<div>MM asked on Microsoft Live Support<br />

</div>
Why does Microsoft want to charge me to do another adult verification?
<div>
<p>I have a family account set up under xbox-live, where I have my three children each with their own sub-account (under my own adult account) with the corresponding windows-live accounts, as required by xbox-live.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This account has been open and active for just about a year. I completed the adult verification process when the accounts were set up and up until yesterday there has been no problems with their access and use of xbox-live and windows-live. Yesterday,
 when I or my children go in to access xbox-live or windows-live there is a message that says that the accounts must be verified to make sure that there is an adult that is giving them access…<span>&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p>I do not have an issue with verifying that I am an adult and that I am my children’s parent and am granting permission to access and use xbox-live and windows-live services.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, what I do object to is that part of the process states that if I do not allow windows-live (or whichever Microsoft entity it is) to charge my credit card another $0.50.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I called xbox-live support and they said that there is nothing that they can do because under the xbox-live terms of service there must be an active windows live account, so I have to comply with whatever windows live says or whatever charges windows-live
 chooses to impose to use it.<span>&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p>I have looked at these forums and Microsoft’s to answers and statements in reference inquiries regarding the imposition of the required charge to a credit card as part of the adult verification process.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Microsoft states in numerous locations that under COPPA it is required to charge a fee to a credit card for age verification.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I have just read the COPPA and Microsoft’s statement that it is required to charge a fee to a credit card for age verification is not exactly true.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The COPPA states that operators may institute a number of different methods for age verification.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in COPPA that "requires" Microsoft (or any operator) to place a charge on a credit card to verify adulthood.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To cite directly from the COPPA:</p>
<p><b>§ 312.5 Parental consent.</b></p>
<p>(a) <i>General requirements. </i>(1) An operator is required to obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information from children, including consent to any material change in the collection, use, and/or
 disclosure practices to which the parent has previously consented. (2) An operator must give the parent the option to consent to the collection and use of the child’s personal information without consenting to disclosure of his or her personal information
 to third parties.</p>
<p>(b) <i>Mechanisms for verifiable parental consent. </i>(1) An operator must make reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent, taking into consideration available technology. Any method to obtain verifiable parental consent must be reasonably
 calculated, in light of available technology, to ensure that the person providing consent is the child’s parent. (2) Methods to obtain verifiable parental consent that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph include: providing a consent form to be signed
 by the parent and returned to the operator by postal mail or facsimile; requiring a parent to use a credit card in connection with a transaction; having a parent call a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained personnel; using a digital certificate that
 uses public key technology; and using e-mail accompanied by a PIN or password obtained through one of the verification methods listed in this paragraph.”</p>

<p>The COPPA clearly gives Microsoft the option of doing any of the above methods.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, they appear to be choosing to only use one of them.<span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>I would not be making an issue of this if I did not already complete the age verification process for my children’s accounts (or else Microsoft has been in violation of the COPPA for almost a year now) and know that there are other ways that windows
<span>&nbsp;</span>I would not be making an issue of this if I did not already complete the age verification process for my children’s accounts (or else Microsoft has been in violation of the COPPA for almost a year now) and know that there are other ways that windows
 live can verify that I am an adult without charging my credit card.<span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>&nbsp; <br />
<span>&nbsp; <br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I have gone through the age verification process previously, I have completed transactions with my credit card on my account since the time I set up my children’s accounts and maintain my adult email with a password protection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These acts have and continue to satisfy Microsoft’s duties to ensure adult verification as required by the statute and make Microsoft’s decision to force me to make an additional credit card transaction is unnecessary under the COPPA.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft’s decision to disable my children’s accounts, knowing full well that will (or would be likely to) cause my children, my wife and I great frustration and mental anguish and time, until I pay them additional, and not required, fees to use a service
 which I have paid for and am in compliance with the terms of use of, feels like (and may actually be) extortion, and is at the least a violation of their own terms of service which state that there will not be additional charges for service during the term
 of the service previously paid for, no matter how nominal that fee may be.<span>&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Please let me know how I can have my children's accounts made useable again without having to submit additional costs or fees.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please understand that as long as this continues it is causing my family extreme aggravation and mental anguish; but, I should not have to submit to paying additional fees when I am in compliance with the terms of use and Microsoft has no duty to require
 additional verification under the COCCA.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We appreciate the time and efforts you have spent in explaining your concern. However, this is not part of our support boundary. We will need you to contact the support team of Xbox Live regarding that matter. They are the appropriate

<p>I find your response to be predictable, although very disappointing, as it now closes the circle of passing the buck.&nbsp; As I stated I have already spoken to several xbox live representatives and the last one made it very clear that they are either unable
 or unwilling to resolve this issue.&nbsp; She indicated that the issues was with windows live, as they (you) are the ones that do the age verification.&nbsp; This appears to be true as the verification process directs me to a windows live site not a xbox live site.&nbsp;
 She directed me to the windows live account site to submit my questions, which I did.&nbsp; The following is their responses. (italics added)</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;why must i submit to being charged when i attempt to verify my sons xboxlivefamly account. &nbsp;you have already verified that i am an adult under my account under m*****@*******.com and I have previously made purchases with my credit card on my account. &nbsp;the
 user agreement states that i must provide information such as an alternate email address or phone number for account proofs but it does not say that you have the right to charge me. &nbsp;I have already paid for the use of the xboxlivefamily account and under the
 terms of use can not be charged again until the expiration of the contacted time period. &nbsp;I feel that I am being extorted by microsoft to either pay these fees which are not in the terms of use or loose access to the services which I have already paid for.
 &nbsp;Please let me know how I can comply with your verification process without being forced to pay additional funds to use the services I have already paid for.</i><br />
</p>


<p>As you can see I first contacted xbox live, who directed me to windows live account support who directed me to you and now you are directing me back to xbox live.&nbsp; Where does this circle end?<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who can actually answer my question or provide support?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am not having problems setting up my children's accounts, it is that Microsoft is now demanding more money for me to use the services I have already paid for claiming I need to do age verification that i have already done.&nbsp; Surely there is someone at one
 of these companies that can resolve this issue.&nbsp; Or is it that none of you are either able or willing to do so?</p>

<p>well two things there is no 50cent charge</p>
<p>what it would be is verification charges to prove the creditcard is valid</p>
<p>there is no charges</p>
<p>those verification charges are held by your bank to verify the billing company</p>
<p>legal threats will only get your thread locked</p>

<p>Well it would help if you read the date of the post this was answered awhile ago</p>
<p>First it is verification charges ask your bank what happens with them </p>
<p>It'd not a charge at all your bank sends and holds dummy charges</p>
<p>Ask them they will tell you just that</p>
<p>Don't listen to everything you hear on the net</p>

<p>My son has also been asked to verify his account by an adult through Xbox.com. on trying to logon and confirm that I am actually an adult I also was directed to verify my credit card for 50 cents that goes to charity.
</p>
<p>I also object to this after paying £34 for the Xbox live account and going to the trouble of setting up an adult account to control my son's child account - why after only 2 months am I required to verify I'm an adult.
</p>
<p>This happened last weekend also and on logging a call with the support line they tell me it's happening to lots of people. Yeah - that makes me feel much better!!!*#! I have a frustrated child unable to use a service I have paid dearly for. An incredibly
 poor show from a company that makes billions. </p>

<p>You don't verify that your an adult on the website for one</p>
<p>That has to be done on the console</p>
<p>Ask if your bank what verification charges are they will set you straight it is temporary charges which your bank holds</p>
<p>Ask your bank even</p>
<p>As long as the transaction goes thru the bank holds it and refunds it it never leaves your account as an adult you shokuld know this</p>
<p>Lord instead of listening to the net talk to your bank if you don't know what basic banking is</p>
<p>The only reason why you'd be login Ong into the website is for adult email verification</p>
<p>Promote my account is only on the console</p>
<p>And even then you can only do it when the account turns 18</p>
<p>Not when you decide to</p>

<p>For those of you dumb enough to think asking your bank if an Xbox "charge" is actualy going to be charged to your account, wake up! &nbsp;The bank doesnt answer for other companies charges. And, if you ask Microsoft, they will confirm that it is in fact a charge.

<p>I too have this problem. My daughter is almost 15. Yet they are asking me to verify this. I said fine I am her father and she is 14 her DOB is 1/8/99. The COPPA clearly states it is required to verify for children under 13 and this is the most common form
 of verification, meaning there are other ways, like looking at the account I have had for 8 years. My son who is 12 sits in his room playing while im talking to the rep has never been verified. Yet the rep whines to me about being compliant to this new special
 law named the COPPA. Whats wrong with common sense? It is truly gone. Then the rep keeps telling me its not MS that's charging me (implying its the federal government or some other government entity).&nbsp;I ask the rep is he has ever read the policy she just referred
 me to because clearly she has not or doesn't understand it.&nbsp;Am I unable to make my own donations with my own money? I cannot even check my daughter MS account because it won't let me without verification and the charge. She asks me did I put the right date
 of birth? I say I suppose I could have been wrong but I cant check it without the charge to afterwhich view her account (which i refuse). Then the rep tells me they won't charge me if she is over 13. Really? Why then can't I continue without paying the charge
 for a person who is clearly older than the age of 13. Why can't someone listen and manually verifiy? This is completely illegal and gouging. Wouldn't refer me to her supervisor. I am seriously considering returning my ONE which was supposed to be for Christmas
 and getting a PS4.</p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t windows boot from my SSD&#63; Why doesn&#39;t system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fractalbase23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t windows boot from my SSD&#63;  Why doesn&#39;t system repair recognize my Windows installation on my SSD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My home-built desktop has seveal HDs, and about 6 months ago I added an SSD, installed Windows 7 on it, and have been using that as my primary OS.&nbsp; I therefore cleaned up the old Windows 7 installations on other drives.&nbsp; My oldest HD has developed several
 physical errors on it, so while Windows still recognizes it, access is slow on that drive and many files are not accessible.&nbsp; The problem is that I want to replace this drive, however this is the drive that my desktop boots from.&nbsp; If I remove the drive from
 my desktop, Windows will not boot.&nbsp; I've tried several different BIOS settings regarding HD boot priority, but nothing works.&nbsp; The problem gets worse where when I run Windows system repair, my Windows 7 installation on my SSD isn't listed in the list of valid
 Windows installations.&nbsp; When I click next and run generic startup repair and reboot my computer, Windows will still not boot from the SSD.&nbsp; One thing that is mentioned is in system repair is the option to load drivers so that system repair recognizes my SSD.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately, the Samsung website does not have such drivers, and their FAQ says to consult the help of the OS manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One workaround, which I may have to do (if there is no solution to booting from the SSD), is to install Windows on another HD, and configure the boot options on that drive to boot the Windows installation on the SSD.&nbsp; But I don't want to have to do that
 if I don't have to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

            <p>I've resolved the issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the steps that I took:</p>
<p>1. remove bad hard drive that computer previously booted from</p>
<p>2. install Windows (as a workaround)&nbsp;on a hard drive (other than SSD) that I want to keep in my desktop</p>
<p>3. install Easy BCD (free) on the new 'workaround'&nbsp;Windows installation, and add a boot option for the Windows installation on my SSD</p>
<p>4. run system repair --&gt; this time it recognized my SSD Windows installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I verified that the boot options were fixed and ported to my SSD by removing the drive that had the 'workaround' Windows installation and attempting to boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p><span>Hello Jenn517,</span></p>
<p><span>It clearly appears that the CD from which you are trying to install is defective. Before you contact the vendor, I suggest that copy the installation files to your computers(hard
 disk ) and<span>&nbsp; </span>try to install it from there. If it still fails with the Cyclic Redundancy error, you will have to contact the vendor.</span></p>

<h2>            Lock Screen Image Does Not Display as Login Screen</h2>
                    <p>I have my "lock screen" set to a picture I have chosen. I have turned on "Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen". When I lock, the lock screen picture I have chosen is displayed. However, when I log out and latter log in again, some other
 picture is displayed; one of the "default" pictures, not the custom picture I have selected as my lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make the lock screen and sign on screen picture the same - I have already selected "Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen" and it does not work.</p>

<p>This question concerns the background image for the sign-in screen. The sign-in screen definitely "knows" the user's preferences and options. For instance, it "knows" the user picture that is displayed in the circle above the user name on the sign in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "settings-&gt;personalization-&gt;lock screen" there is an option to browse for a background picture. Under that is the option to "Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen". By sliding this to ON (which I have done) the lock-screen background
 is supposed to be displayed as the background on the sign-in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works on other accounts I have on the same computer. But it does not work for this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that I can do in addition to what I have done to get it to start working?</p>

<p>If you log out (your profile is not loaded) then it will always show a default picture, not your preferred one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't gather this info until you supply&nbsp; your password to unlock your registry info (which loads your preferences) and they get applied to the environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows sort of "fudges" this a little, because now even after a reboot or shutdown, it will load your profile in the background (using your credentials) so that your profile is logged in before you even manually type your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to turn this preloading off, you can go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt;&nbsp; Sign in options, and turn off the "use my credentials to finish.." checkbox.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn, Sorry I still don't get it. I have three accounts on my machine. Two have custom pictures for the "lock screen" and one has a selected picture for the "lock screen". All three of them have&nbsp;<span>"Show lock screen background picture on
 the sign-in screen" set to the ON position.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sign out from one account (or power up) I can select from the three accounts by choosing one from the list displayed in the lower left hand corner. When I chose the account with the built in picture selected, the screen dissolves to the selected lock
 screen picture which becomes the background of the sign-in screen for that account. When I select one of the two accounts with a custom picture selected as the lock-screen, that picture is displayed as the sign-in screen. When I select the OTHER account with
 a custom picture selected as the lock-screen, rather than dissolving to the lock-screen picture it dissolves to one of the built in pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does the one account behave differently from the others? Is there anything that will fix it?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 firewall will not turn on</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems with my firewall in windows 8.&nbsp; I can't download any apps from the windows store as long as it is turned off, but when I try to turn it on I get an error message.&nbsp; I did some research and ran down all the rabbit holes but every solution
 ends with a new error message.&nbsp; When I try to turn on the firewall I get error 0x8007042c.&nbsp; When I try to turn it on manually through services I get error 1068.&nbsp; When I try to turn on the service that windows firewall requires in order to run I get error 0x80320026.&nbsp;
 I ran into a dead end there because that error does not seem to exist anywhere google could find it.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi MAK340,<br />
<br />
May I know which Skype for Business Mac version are you using?<br />
<br />
Are you using built-in camera or have attach one such as a USB webcam?<br />
<br />
Try to uninstall the device drivers <em>(e.g. Graphic/Video driver)</em> and then reinstall them to check this issue.<br />
<br />
You may try to troubleshoot this issue via using different Mac (<em>e.g. any non-problematic colleague Mac)</em> or another webcam to determine whether it is a specific client or device side issue.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />There is no way to do that, but here is a way to download older builds. 
<br />
<br />from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803, 1709, 1703, 1607 etc
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />

<h2>            Switch users leads to lock screen that I can&#39;t escape</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone had this...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a newly acquired HP Envy 17-j184na running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have two users setup on it; one for work and one for personal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the start screen and try to switch &nbsp;from one user to the other, I get the lock screen but no prompt for the password. &nbsp;Thereafter any single key press (or mouse click) causes the circle of dots to go round for about 30 seconds and I remain
 at the lock screen. &nbsp;At that point I can only escape with a hard reboot. &nbsp;My work-around is that I have to sign out of one user before I can get a lock screen that behaves in the correct way. But this is far from ideal, and may be hiding a more serious problem
 waiting to pounce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched (a lot) for this problem, but it is starting to look unique. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any clues? Please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers,</p>
<p>Gray</p>

            <p><span>Hello Gray,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Usually when we try to switch to the other user account and if the other user account does not have a password, then will automatically sign in to that user account. However in this issue, it seems that there might user account corruption, display
 driver corruption or third party application conflicts. <span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you using Microsoft Account?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using Microsoft Account, then you may try running the </span>

 problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the above troubleshooter doesn’t help, then try method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Download &amp; install the latest display card’s driver and check if it fixes the issue.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the <strong>steps to install the latest display driver</strong> after downloading them from the manufacturer’s website:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong><span>Make sure that you have downloaded the latest driver before uninstalling the current version.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> +<strong> X</strong> key, task list will come up and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Device Manger window will be open.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Locate the <strong>Display adapter</strong> icon and <strong>expand it</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. <strong>Right click </strong>on <strong>display driver</strong> icon and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the current version of the driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Open the download folder which contains the setup file of the latest driver that you have downloaded.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. <strong>Double click on the setup file</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions to

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 3.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </strong>
<strong>Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. </strong>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span> If the issue does not persists in safe mode then perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></span></p>

<p>Yeah, thanks Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is windows 8 we're talking about here. &nbsp;I've had previous experience of multiple users on that OS and I don't think I've
<em>ever</em> had to ctl+alt+del from the lock screen (which I presume to be the screen that comes up on Windows Key+L, and the same one presented on "switch user" except that the password field will be shown for the user to whom you wish to switch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was doing my damnedest to get my terminology right if for no other reason than to parry the disparaging remarks sometimes made by the small minded grabbing at their one chance of some form of superiority. I thought I must have been pretty warm when I put
 "windows 8 lock screen" into Google images and saw an endless array of the exact same screens that I'm talking about. I was further bolstered by the myriad of Microsoft support pages that uniformly use the term &nbsp;"lock screen" in a context precisely identical
 to my own, within the strict confines of windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what <em>is</em> that screen called then, FMI?</p>
<p>

            <blockquote>
<p>So what <em>is</em> that screen called then, FMI?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is called the Lock screen but it is called that because when it is implemented as a Lock screen you need to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to start using its UI.&nbsp; (E.g. not just a screen that looks like a Lock screen that you can dismiss with any arbitrary manual
 procedure.)&nbsp; It can be enabled that way using&nbsp; Netplwiz.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, does pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete give you any different result?&nbsp; What if you actually enabled the real Lock Screen with Netplwiz?&nbsp; Any difference then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But maybe the problem is not the Lock screen which seems to go away as designed but the next screen, the Login screen?&nbsp; E.g. something to consider for that case would be whether you have customized your Login screen with such things as Live tiles for certain
 apps (Lock screen apps slide show?&nbsp; Surely they mean Login screen apps?&nbsp; Who would want some of their personal details such as latest E-mails being shown on a general Lock Screen?)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues in the Event log?&nbsp; Otherwise you might consider a trace.&nbsp; ProcMon has Boot Logging but I don't know if it could capture stuff as early as this.&nbsp; Supposedly&nbsp; WPRUI is good for that.</p>

            <p>Hi Rendell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the taskbar color in Windows 10, follow the instructions mentioned in one of the two given below methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Right-click</strong> on desktop and then click Personalize option to Personalization section of Settings app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the left-pane, click <strong>Colors</strong> to see various settings on the right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On the right-side, turn on the option labelled <strong>
Show color on Start, taskbar, and action center</strong>. Make sure that the first option labelled
<strong>Automatically pick an accent color from my background</strong> is turned <strong>
off</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, under Choose your accent color, click on a tile to select and set it as the color for your taskbar, Start menu and action center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 2 of 2</em></strong></p>
Change the taskbar color to match desktop background
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Personalization section of Settings app. To do so,
<strong>right-click</strong> on desktop and then click <strong>Personalize</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the left-side, click <strong>Colors</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, on the right-side, turn on the following options:</p>
<p><strong>#</strong> Automatically pick an accent color from my background</p>
<p><strong>#</strong> Show color on Start, taskbar, and action center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As of now, there is no software around to set different colors for Start menu and taskbar in Windows 10. We will update this article if and when a developer comes with a software to set separate colors for taskbar and Start menu in
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you are unable to change your default taskbar color in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 vwifibus unsigned &#58; wireless networking impossible</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I apologize for my English language.</p>
<p>I have a problem with Wireless access. A few days ago, an update occured and it seems&nbsp; that it's the moment I got this problem.</p>
<p>I have an Atheros Wireless component. When I look the driver détails, I see&nbsp;2 drivers : atw10x.sys and vwifibus.sys.</p>
<p>The first one is OK but vwifibus.sys is "unsigned" (but Copyright Microsoft!!!).</p>
<p>vwifibus.sys is version "10.0.14393.0 (rs 1_release.160715-1616)"</p>
<p>I tried another Wireless access card on a USB port : same problem.</p>
<p>I tried this USB Wireless adpator on another PC : on the second PC vwifibus.sys is "signed" and I can use it. No problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reboot the PC with the option disable drivers signature and it's OK but It is not permanent. I have tried re-install drivers, same problem (but I think that vwifibus is never re-installed)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I repair vwifibus? It seems to be a Windows system file.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

            <p>Hello Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your concern with wireless connection, we suggest you run the <strong>
System File Checker tool</strong>. Please follow the steps <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative solution, if you can connect to the internet via wired connection, you can also use the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DISM or System Update Readiness tool</a>.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done what you suggest (sfc tool) but no problem. Before that I have run adwcleaner.</p>
<p>I know that I can connect internet using a wired connection but it's easier to use a WiFi access.</p>
<p>And I can also use WiFi access card but I need to reboot with option "don't use drivers signature verification" . This is not a solution for the user (it's not myself). It's&nbsp;not easy : you need to boot, then "shutdown -r - o" and then use the option "don't
 use drivers signature verification" and you need to do that every time you power off the laptop!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know DISM. I'm going to study that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

My DVD/CD drive isnt working correctly, but when i got to the device manager it says "it's working properly". When i put a CD/DVD in it doesnt run the autoplay or anthing. I got to "Start" then "computer" and it is listed there, but when i click on it it say
 "Applicatoin not found". I can right click on it and bring up the autoplay from there, which shows me it does read, but i tried installing world of warcraft but it wouldnt run an installer, and i tried watching a DVD but it wont&nbsp;show on windows media player,&nbsp;but
 it will show up on another program.&nbsp;(On autoplay the only option it gives me it to open it in a folder which doesnt help when you watch a DVD or try to install a game)</span></p>

            Hello Sunsetter,<br />
<br />
Before you try Debbie's great advice, it appears you have a dvd icon in the My Computer window. Try unistalling the optical drive in the device manager then reboot computer to let windows reinstall it. Check it again, if it still has the problem then uninstall
 any third party burning software before deleting your filters. You can reinstall your burning software after your done. Make it a great day.

<h2>            Netflix not loading</h2>
                    
<p>I use Netflix on a 360. The past week, the app started to take longer to load but for the past 2 days it's not loading at all. It starts but gets stuck on the load page. I tried deleting and re downloading it but no improvement. I tried restarting my network.
 I checked my Netflix account and it's fine, it works on my IPad and windows phone Just not on the Xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas and suggestions welcome !</p>

<p>Same for me, also tried the public dns servers but it won't work. It stays on the loading screen and after 10 min the nw-1-19 error appears. I also tried resetting my xbox, network reset, deleting and reinstalling. Nothing would work. please help me. The
 helpdesk from nor Xbox, netflix and my network provider could help me</p>

<p>I noticed that I am not the only one dealing with this , I have been trying for the past 3 days and no luck. It is funny how things work really good for a about a year and boom big problems. I have four xbox and no Netflix working on any of them. But I can
 get on my smart tv, my computers no problem. Talked to xbox people they said it was Netflix, talked to Netflix, &nbsp;Netflix said it was my internet provider. Talked to my internet Provider. They said not us your internet is great. So what I am supposed to do
 now. &nbsp;We pay for this and nothing is getting resolved. I just I am just going to sit and shake my head. &nbsp;Crazy.

<p>Same problem here. &nbsp;Three weeks ago, I noticed that Netflix was dropping repeatedly in the middle of movies and I was having to reconnect repeatedly. &nbsp;Finally, last weekend, it stopped loading on start-up altogether, and ultimately I get the Code nw-1-19.
 &nbsp;I've been surfing all the support forums today and trying the various remedies, including the manual DNS settings (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.), but nothing works. &nbsp;Very frustrating. &nbsp;Can somebody help?</p>
