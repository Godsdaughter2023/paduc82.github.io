            Hi Deacon,
<br />
<br />System Volume Information, is not meant to be human editable, you can seriously brick your system . . .
<br />
<br />Amongst other things System Volume Information contains your System Restore Points . . .
<br />
<br />To reduce the size of System Volume information:
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - System
<br />
<br />On the left click Advanced System Settings
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click on the System Protection Tab
<br />
<br />Select your C Drive and click Configure
<br />
<br />Using the slider on the second dialog, move the space used to something manageable like 8 - 10GB
<br />
<br />Save that setting
<br />
<br />Restart your PC and the System Volume Information folder should have drastically reduced in size . . .       
        </p>

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<h2>            Original product key not working. Code 0xC004F050. Completelty locked out of PC.</h2>
                    My computer updated itself 2 days ago and on the following day I started it up and got a message "An unauthorized change was made to windows" and it asks for me to re-enter my product key, I have done this many times but I get a message box stating Invalid
 product key, the following failure occurred while trying to use the product key: code: 0xC004F050 Description: The Software Licensing Service reported that the product key is invalid.<br />
<br />
This cannot be true as I bought my PC from Australias largest reputable computer retailer and activated the PC using this product key when I purchased it, it is a genuine Microsoft product key sticker on the back of the PC. I also did a product key search with
 Microsoft and was told by the site that the original product key is invalid but it accepted it 22 months prior.<br />
<br />
Please help, I need the information on this PC and it has thousands of dollars of softwear on it.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am running Windows Vista.

<strong>SO MUCH FOR MICROSOFT TECH SUPPORT AND TOSHIBA TECH SUPPORT.</strong> I should have just thrown it on a fire to start with and gone out and bought a MAC. I have another thread on this site in a diferent section but it does not show up in my threads

<h2>            How do I untangle&#47;Seperate two Microsoft accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When my son was under 18 he had a child account that was connected to my own Microsoft account.&nbsp; When he turned 18 I thought I had unlinked them and he had his own separate Microsoft account.&nbsp; This has not happened.&nbsp; We've been able to get along ok, but
 I am sick and tired of getting his notifications when he has purchased something from the XBox store, or one of us changes a password the other one has it changed as well.&nbsp; We have two different email accounts and those (fortunately) stay apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the final straw arrived when his name shows up when I turn on my computer - which he does NOT use.&nbsp; I have no idea what he has done and where (nor does he) for this to have happened.&nbsp; I am sick and tired of sharing my Microsoft account with him.&nbsp; He's
 22 and this just can't carry on.&nbsp; And I don't want to be told that one or both of us has to close our accounts and start new ones, though I suppose if that is the only way to sort out this mess we will have to go that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have investigated several times but I have not found a solution that fits my circumstances or the instructions simply don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone, please help. I'm so sick and tired of this situation.&nbsp; I want my account back, I don't want to see what my son is spending his money on, I am definitely sick and tired of not being able to change passwords and/or keep my password as we seem to be
 sharing that and the account.&nbsp; I don't play his games, he doesn't play&nbsp; mine. Why on earth this happened in the first place totally confuses me, but it has happened and now I want it sorted out before I do the unthinkable and close both of our accounts and
 he looses all the things he has purchased via the Microsoft store.</p>

<p>Hi folks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a somewhat similar issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Daughter (11) uses her mothers (my ex) microsoft account to sign into various games like minecraft on her ipad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I bought an xbox for christmas a couple of years ago (it was for the kids i swear) and not having a microsoft account of my own, we signed in using my ex’s account so the kids could get playing asap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are very amicable between us so she doesn’t mind us using the account to which i have full access, but its still her main email and onedrive account and I would just prefer if we had seperate accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, if i join “her” microsoft family as an adult with my own microsoft email and then delete her from it, will all of our purchases remain within that family with me as the new main account holder/adult?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>This didn't work.&nbsp; When I go to family view I am the only one showing up, though with my son's name instead of mine.&nbsp; And when I check the account information I get my email address, but his name and birth date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that somewhere along the way our accounts have got tied together and I have no idea how to untangle them.</p>

<p>Hi Mommamacnz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry to hear you are still having issues. I would like to understand how these notifications are coming through and where you saw your sons name appeared on your computer. Lets see if we can pinpoint where the crossover is occuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your son also recieve notifications of purchased goods or just you?</p>

<p>How exactly did you add your son's account to your adult account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you add your son's email as a sign in alias, or did you add his account as a separate account to your Family at
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the son's account doesn't show up under the family page, it seems that you made the mistake of adding your son's email as a sign in alias.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meaning that you and your son are using the SAME Microsoft Account, but use different user names to sign into that same account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what services you and your son use and if you or your son use a third party e-mail provider or Microsoft's Outlook, you will lose data or emails if you untangle the accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So could you please describe in a bit more detail how you set up your and your son's account? For privacy reasons, do NOT provide your real email addresses, but to help you, we would need to know if you are using Microsoft services (i.e. emails ending in
 live.com, hotmail.com or outlook.com) or if you or your son are using third party email providers (like Gmail, Yahoo, your own personal domain or whatever).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if you are using OneDrive or other cloud services that require a Microsoft Account like Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, if there are a lot of purchases made with the account, and who "owns" these purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe with these details we can try to come up with a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no idea how my son's account got added to mine as an adult account.&nbsp; Maybe it was that we accidentally added his email as an alias.&nbsp; This happened several years ago, which is why I can't remember what we did.&nbsp; It might have been during the process
 to unlink him as a child and when that didn't quite go as it should have we may have then added his email (and date of birth) to my account as another alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a yahoo email account and he has a gmail one (I also have a gmail one but I think that is only as a back up for signing in if there is a problem with my yahoo one.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of us use Outlook.&nbsp; He has an Xbox live account.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I don't, but I could be wrong about the Xbox account as I do use the Xbox on occasion and have my own player/gamer name there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Skype, OneDrive and Microsoft Office 2013.&nbsp; He doesn't use any of those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he pays for something from the Xbox store I get the invoice, but with his name and email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is enough information, but I will happily answer more questions to the best of my abilities if that helps figure out what we did and how we can get the account sorted out so that we both have our own seperate accounts without either of us loosing
 information (or in his case, things he has paid for).</p>

<p>Okay, that might get complicated, and BEFORE you contact the Support as per XBF Nestor S's advice, be aware that usually a Microsoft Account that gets removed as a sign in alias will be deleted, if you do it yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the Support has more "powerful" tools to separate your two accounts, but I'd suggest that you download a backup of your OneDrive Account, and take a note of your Skype Account's contacts beforehand (maybe even contact them to tell them you
 might have to change Skype accounts), just to be on the safe side, and you can use that backup to recover everything if it gets deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably easier for the Support to remove your account from the whole mess, and let you start over by giving you your Microsoft Office subscription to your "new/separate" account, and then you restore your files on OneDrive again from your backup, if
 needed, and add your contacts to a new Skype account, in the worst case scenario that one account has to be "deleted".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you both use third party emails, you emails will be safe.</p>

<h2>            Mouse keeps freezing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a Logitech G400 mouse and like the title says it keeps freezing constantly.</p>
<p>I have tried fixing the problem on my own (as stated bellow), contacting the Logitech support, which wasn't really helpful since they told me to do all the things i initially did on my own, and even contacting Gigabyte (the Mobo manufacturer) who basically
 said "not our problem", so this is my last and only hope (second to buying a new mouse, which i don't want to do since i love my G400).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem (more detail) : mouse keeps freezing constantly, weather i am just surfing the web or am in a game, makes no difference.The freezes happen frequently, from starting Windows, and occur a couple of times within a minute. (it's really irritating).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i have tried : </p>
<p>- Bought a new SSD and full/clean install of Win8.1 64bit (previous was Windows 7 64bit).</p>
<p>- Installed all of the proprietary drives and software.</p>
<p>- Tried other mice on my Pc (3 worked, 1 had identical issues).</p>
<p>- Tried my mouse on another pc [Windows 7 32bit]&nbsp; (no issues)</p>
<p>- Tried my mouse on my pc but different OS [ i have dual boot, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS , and the mouse works perfectly]</p>
<p>- Installing/re-insatlling/deleting the Logitech official software for the mouse [no difference, still froze]</p>
<p>- Updating Bios of my mobo [again, no difference]</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs :</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 64bit</p>
<p>Gigabyte z97x-Sli (Mobo).</p>
<p>Intel i5</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following to see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + X and click "Device Manager".</li><li>Expand the tree to "Universal Serial Bus controllers" at the bottom.</li><li>Right click every controller with the word "Hub" in it and click "Properties".</li><li>Click the Power Management tab and remove the checkmark from: "<em>Allow computer to turn off this device to save power</em>".
</li><li>Click OK.</li></ol>
<p>If that doesn't help, follow it up with these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + X and click "Power Options".</li><li>To the right of whichever power plan you have enabled, click the link to "Change plan settings".</li><li>Click the link to "Change advanced power settings".</li><li>In the next menu expand "USB Settings" ---&gt; "USB selective suspend" and change "Plugged in" to
<em>Disabled</em>.</li><li>Click Apply/OK.</li></ol>
<p>Disabling "USB selective suspend" prevents the computer from suspending the USB hub driver which has been known to interfere with the mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on please. </p>

<br />

<p>Paint is located in -</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\mspaint.exe <br />
<br />
If you can't locate paint in All Programs&nbsp;- Start - Accessories<br />
<br />
Go to Control Panel - Programs and Features&nbsp;-&nbsp;Install Paint&nbsp;and you will probably need your<br />
Windows 7 installation DVD.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Print to PDF Rotation Issue</h2>
                    I've got a collection of PNGs that I want to combine into a PDF file.&nbsp; Windows makes this very easy to do just by selecting all of them and hitting the appropriate print button.&nbsp; Except that the resulting pdf has everything rotated 90 degrees to the left,
 like it's forced into a landscape from a portrait.&nbsp; Is there anyway to keep it from rotating?

    <title>Windows 7 Reboot loop - Safe mode doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjamin dudley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Reboot loop - Safe mode doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    We are having some major problems with several of our computers. <br />
<br />
Two different models running Windows 7: HP dc5100 and HP dx2250<br />
<br />
They turn on, reach the "Starting Windows" splash screen, go blank and immediately restart in an endless loop.<br />
<br />
I have tried Safe Mode with no luck. It stops at "CLASSPNP.SYS" and then restarts once again into the endless loop.<br />
<br />
I have also tried a startup repair with the Windows 7 DVD. It is unable to do a startup repair and comes up with this error message:<br />
<br />
Problem Event Name: StartupRepairOffline<br />
Problem Signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385<br />
Problem Signature 02: 6.1.7600.16385<br />
Problem Signature 03: Unknown<br />
Problem Signature 04: 21201148<br />
Problem Signature 05: External Media<br />
Problem Signature 06: 5<br />
Problem Signature 07: 0x6b<br />
OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />
Locale: 1033<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also seen a BSOD come up at random times right after the Windows splash screen that says "PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED 0x0000006B (0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)." That's if i can read it fast enough before it reboots!<br />
<br />
<br />
If ANYONE has some suggestions, please let me know! We have several computers at various locations all having the same problem! The last thing I want to do is reload all of these computers after meticulously backing up files from the hard drives!<br />
<br />
ALSO: All of these were done with a clean install. No upgrades. Windows 7 was installed on here over a month ago with no problems until today. No additional hardware installed.<br />
<br />

            Hi.<br />
<br />
This is a workaround that works for us:<br />
<br />
<p>1. delete bootcat.cashe from C:\windows\system32\codeintegrity\. on broken pc.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the file is 384 bytes when broken , is 2,344,056 when OK. is beeing recreated when booting.</p>
<p>2. copy from a ok pc c:\windows\system32\catroot\{F750E6C3-38EE-11D1-85E5-00C04FC295EE}\ to broken pc.</p>
<p>3. restart.</p>
<br />
I can`t say this is 100%, but for us with the same hardware it seems to work find.<br />
We have not been able to find out the roor course.<br />

<p><span>This is a Microsoft file linked with monitoring time. Can you please provide a copy of the error report from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>Have a look in the System and Application logs in Event Viewer for Errors and Warnings and post copies here. Don't post any from than more than
 48 hours ago. </span></p>
<p><span>You can access Event Viewer by selecting Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, and Event Viewer. When researching the meaning of the error,
 information regarding Event ID, Source and Description are important. </span></p>
<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. You will see a button resembling two
 pages. Click the button and close Event Viewer. This places a copy of the report into your Clipboard. Paste into the body your message. Make sure that this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>

<p><span>You have given us a general indication of the nature of the problem but specific error reports make finding a solution so much easier.</span></p>
<p><span>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what it says; the exact
 text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error next occurs by following the procedure described below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down the Stop Error code
 and related information properly. Right click on the My Computer icon on the Desktop and select Properties, Advanced, Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart on system failure
 after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows Advanced Options
 Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the option - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly the right
 time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</span></p>

            <span>Hi
<span>Barkeo</span>,<br />
<br />
Please check your default program to make sure that this is not causing this issue:<br />
<br />
1. Start , Default Programs - Associate a file type or protocol with a program<br />
2. Scroll down to .htm and html<br />
3. Make sure .htm and .html are set to your browser (Internet Explorer or Firefox, etc.)<br />
4. If not, click on one of the lines, then click on Change Program...<br />
5. Select the proper program <br />
<br />
<span>Thanks,<br />

            Chester A. thank you for replying, I have had problems when I try to answer you, there must me a problem with the site at times.&nbsp; I tried your solutions and did step 1, but at step 2, where do I find .htm and .html, are they to be in the list that comes
 up with step l?&nbsp; I did find Windows Live Mail in the list and clicked on it and went to change programs and there were 2 listed there and one was Outlook Express, it was highlighted, the other one was Windows live mail so I clicked on it and it became highlighted.&nbsp;
 I went to my email and tried a link in an email and the same message came up.&nbsp; I went back to Default Programs and went to change programs and Outlook was highlighted again and not Windows Live Mail.<br />

For better understanding of your concern, please provide us the exact steps that you did in following Windows Live Chester A.'s instructions. Also I'd like to clarify that you'll need to find .htm and .html on the list that will appear after clicking

            Hi <span>Barkeo</span>,<br />
<br />
To address your concern, I suggest that you <span>
do a clean removal of Windows Live Mail to resolve this issue. Unlike regular uninstall and re-install, clean removal deletes and all the registry keys associated with Windows Live Mail. You can refer to this solution article for the steps on how to do it:<br />

</span></a><span><br />
After doing the clean removal, download and install the latest version of Windows Live Mail, please&nbsp;refer to the link below<br />

            I finally got around to uninstalling windows Live essentials, I tried it first by just uninstalling the Live Mail and that didn't work, so I uninstalled the whole program and reinstalled it.&nbsp; It still doesn't work, I still get the same message as above
 when I click on the "help" button, but when I try to open a link in an email, I get this message.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Address is not valid<br />
Most likely causes:<br />
&nbsp; 1 there might be an error in the address<br />
&nbsp; 2 If you clicked on a link, it may be out of date<br />
<br />
What you can try:<br />
&nbsp; 1 Retype the address<br />
&nbsp; 2 go back to the previous page.<br />
<br />
The link is still good because I was able to open it in my Windstream email account.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<h2>            System opening multiple programs</h2>
                    Please help as this problem is getting worse. Every now and then my computer would make that annoying whirring sound like its loading and of late, it is continually doing that but it doesn't stop making that sound. Its almost like there is a lot of background
 programs being used. So when I open Task manager certain programs will now all of a sudden show in parentheses multiple programs open even though I only opened the one. Chrome is known to do that but of late it does it with any browser, or FaceBook Gameroom
 and there will be a number like 6 or 7 in parentheses next to the program name in Task Manager. The point being is it will usually show the memory being used with all these is way higher and I am not sure if that is causing this. But the nonstop sound of the
 whirring is driving me crazy, and I need to figure out why out of the blue it shows multiple programs running on their own. I have also done full antimalware scans and use Defender and havent caught any viruses. How can I fi

<p>The sounds you hear are likely the hard drive.&nbsp; All hard drives fail, typically there's a 20% failure rate of drive that are 4 years old (meaning 1 out of 5 drives will break and die within 4 years).&nbsp; That's why it's always critical that you have a backup
 of your important files somewhere else, so that when that day comes you can get a new hard drive without losing all your important stuff.&nbsp; Drives that spin or are inside laptops that get moved tend to die younger because they spin at 7200 RPMs and are subject
 to a lot of torque and G-forces when you move the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a backup, I'd do that first, before trying anything else.&nbsp; Even if the problem isn't severe now, running a virus scan or any other drive scan that makes the drive work hard for a long time could put it over the edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that it is normal to see programs use multiple processes like that.&nbsp; Google Chrome (for just one example) does this so that even if one tab of a website crashes, it won't crash all your other tabs because they are running separately.</p>

<p>It's not usually normal for a new computer to make those sounds, so that's why I'm worried the drive could be impending a soon failure.&nbsp; I just don't want you to lose your important files if it really does die.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Google and Firefox (and others) have recently made changes that make it show extra copies of the program in Task Manager.&nbsp; Microsoft has also done this in recent system updates (and more work along the same lines is planned).&nbsp; Mostly for the same reason
 (reliability and resilience, as well as security sandboxing: every instance you see is isolated so a security flaw won't let an attacker get to the other running copies).&nbsp; So the extra copies themselves aren't&nbsp;<em>necessarily</em> a cause for alarm.&nbsp; Although
 that doesn't mean they aren't either.&nbsp; It alone just isn't definitive enough to say on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>But -- no programs should be starting by themselves.&nbsp; That would be a cause for a little concern.&nbsp; I'd try some general things I outlined under&nbsp;<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/fix-sluggish-slow-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Simple Fixes for a Slow PC</a><span>
 , or try Microsoft's official instructions for a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong> in <strong>Windows</strong></a> and see if that helps alleviate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also note that after the twice-yearly full updates (like 1709 or 1803 coming up), your CPU and disk may be very heavily utilized for many hours as it finishes background work. Usually it resolves itself overnight, just set your power options so it doesn't
 go to sleep mode, which would pause the work.</p>

            I may have made that unclear. Nothing is loading up by itself but for example if I open Gameroom for Facebook it will now show 4 copies in my task manager and this literally just started happening today

<p>I'm not familiar with gameroom for facebook -- is that a program itself, or just part of facebook accessed via your web browser?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I mentioned a web browser will show an entry in task manager for each tab, it's not exactly precisely one-to-one ratio.&nbsp; Some browsers group a few tabs to each process, and others (like Chrome) also run an extra process for every plugin/extension
 that's active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So like right now I only have 1 tab open in Edge, but there's 8 processes that "belong to Edge" showing in task manager.&nbsp; But that's totally normal.&nbsp; For example:</p>

            ok that part makes sense and does look a bit like mine. FYI Gameroom is the program that is used when playing any games on Facebook, like an arcade program.

            Hey Cool.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.

<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Avast has always been notoriously problematic with Windows. You can try using the removal tool to delete it completely, then try reinstall it if you wish to keep using it. But, I would just switch to the already built in Windows Defender which includes Antivirus, Firewall, Ransomware protection, SmartScreen FIlter, Network Security and additional features.

                    <p>I have an ongoing issue with Business and Personal Dropbox links being included in the Windows explorer (This PC) .</p>
<p>

<p>Microsoft&nbsp;support say its Dropbox doing things to my registry, which sounds more like the truth.</p>

<p>Appreciate these updates, Andy. Editing the registry files means that you have to force Windows to remove/alter a certain setting in a software. Since you've mentioned that you already tried those kinds of workarounds, I can say that the issue is with the
 developer. I've come across a thread that gives out registry edits on how to remove this from your navigation pane in File Explorer. Here's the
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/modify-navigation-pane/924267a3-60e8-47f3-9376-f40ccaf9b308">thread</a></strong>. If you want, you use another cloud service, like OneDrive,
 which you have control over. Here's a <strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-GB/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to install/reinstall OneDrive for Windows and here's a

<p>Hope. Never heard of it. Not a computer guy at all. I was just trying to free up some hard drive space and came across this folder and realized it is one the biggest folders on my computer and I have no idea what it is or does. I'm guessing from its name
 and the site you referred me to that it's some kind of internal mapping device for Windows, but it's all Greek to me!</p>

            Its some kind of mapping program, or routing program from what little I glanced at. &nbsp; For an Architect or Engineers, Manufacturing, Construction. &nbsp;&nbsp; Its not the typical windows program. &nbsp; You pick up this computer used ? &nbsp; Might uninstall it if you dont
 need it. &nbsp; But I would guess its a very pricey program if you actually had the need to use it.&nbsp; Not talking about $200, it appears worthy of ten times the cost of windows.

<p>Wow, that's wild. No, I bought this Lenova new just a few months ago, though all the data on it came from my old Dell. I wonder how that program snuck in there. I will uninstall it! It's huge! Have no need whatever for that kind of thing. I was afraid it
 was something essential to Windows. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>No. But it is odd that while the GSDB 10-11 folder says it takes up 13 gigs and contains 100 files, when I expand the folder, it shows only 20 or so files that only take up a few megs. Very weird.</p>

    <title>Connect to a Wi-Fi network using Command Prompt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> satyajitmishra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect to a Wi-Fi network using Command Prompt</h2>
                    &gt; I have a perfectly working Wi-Fi USB Adapter with latest driver installed. I can connect to any Wi-Fi network using the Windows GUI i.e. clicking on "Network" icon on the "Task Bar" &amp; selecting a Wi-Fi network.<br />
<br />
&gt; But I want to connect to a Wi-Fi network using the "Command Prompt". I have tried almost all the "netsh wlan" commands while running the Command Prompt with Administrative Privilege.<br />
<br />
&gt; So here is a scenario, I have 3 available Wi-Fi networks (SSIDs) &amp; i want to connect to only one of them. None of these Wi-Fi networks have never been saved or connected to before my PC ever. So my assumption is that there are no Saved Profiles.<br />
<br />
&gt; FYI; I know the SSID, Password, MAC Address etc of each &amp; every one of these available Wi-Fi networks as they are all my own.<br />

            <p>Thank you so much for replying to quick. Any way after entering "<em>netsh wlan export hostednetworkprofile</em>", I got this output, "Profile to connect to the hosted network is saved successfully in file "TestWiFi.xml".". Then using the "<em>netsh wlan
 connect TestWiFi</em>" connected me to the desired Wi-Fi netowrk with this output, "Connection request was completed successfully.".</p>
<p>But I also found that simply connecting to a Wi-Fi netowrk creates a profile, so even if I skip the&nbsp;"<em>netsh wlan export hostednetworkprofile</em>", I can simply connect to the saved Wi-Fi network by using the "<em>netsh wlan connect TestWiFi</em>" command
 or "netsh wlan connect ssid=TestWiFi name=TestWiFi" or "netsh wlan connect name=TestWiFi".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But can anyone please tell me how to connect to a Wi-Fi network which was never connected to a PC using command prompt. I have the SSID &amp; password, so how can I connect to this network via command prompt? ​​​​​​​</p>

            If you have a SSID with space, please use "" to specify the name i.e. if your SSID is Home WiFi, type netsh wlan connect "Home WiFi" or&nbsp;netsh wlan connect name="Home WiFi"

            <p>Hi Satyajit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no available command in the command prompt yet that lets users connect to a wireless network they haven't connected before. For now, you can only connect to the wireless network via command prompt if the network profile is already registered in
 the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the <strong>Windows Feedback</strong> app so that you can make a suggestion to add the command that will let users connect to a wireless network they haven't connected before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions, please reply to this thread.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            5X7&#34; photo choice no longer available in Windows Photo Gallery Print box</h2>
                    I have been using Windows Photo Gallery in Windows 7 for ffour years. However, recently when I get the Print screen I do not see the choice for a 5X7" print. I only see the choices for 8X10, 4X6 and wallet size prints. How can I get the 5X7" choice back?
