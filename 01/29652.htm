    <title>Preparing your desktop problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendan-infovista  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preparing your desktop problem</h2>
                    
<p>Once out of 2, when i logon in Windows Vista i get the Preparing your dektop message, and Windows creates a new temporary profile. If i reboot and retry to log on, i get my old "normal" profile (not the temporary one). That means that my profile was neither
 deleted nor corrupted</p>
<p>The event viewer always indicate the same error:</p>
<p><strong>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</strong></p>
<p>That onll occurs if another user is also logged on. The usual situation is: another user log on loally using his profile, leaves his session running. I arrive, change user and try to log in using my profile, and once out of 2, it fails with te Preparing
 your desktop error and the above mentionned messag in the event viewer.</p>
<p>So i assume one process running in the other user's session is locking a file that is necessary to Windows for loading my profile, but which process ? and which file is locked ?</p>
<p>Besides, is there a way to tell Windows NOT to create a temporary prrofile if it can't open the normal profile ?</p>

<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troublehooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in
 time <strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box
 to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore with
 no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;logon or startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial
 of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:
</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free
 OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options
 (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp; If the problem goes away then
 it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If
 the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a> (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt
 to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a>.&nbsp; If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, the user profiles may be corrupt.
<span>To fix this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should
 still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version,
 then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Windows Update Error 8024200D - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed donofrio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error 8024200D</h2>
                    I recently built my own desktop with windows 7 x64, I have been getting an update error code of 8024200D while trying to run windows update. I've run KB947821-v33-x64 various times and tried renaming the software distribution folder in my windows directory.
 Also sfc /scannow doesn't find any corrupted files. When i run the windows update diagnostic tool it returns and error code of 0x800F081F. It also says "crytographic service components are not registered", but i doubt that is important. Do i need to reinstall
 windows? And also what error logs should i post?

            <p>Hello Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;appreciate your efforts in trying to fix this problem and will&nbsp;assist you on the same. We would like to know the following information in order for us to assist you better:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What happens when you&nbsp;run KB947821-v33-x64&nbsp;(system update readiness tool/ CheckSUR)? Did it run successfully?
</li></ol>
<p>If you receive Windows Update error 800F081F, it means that Windows Update or Microsoft Update cannot determine the cryptographic service provider, or a file Windows Update requires (named
<span>catalog store</span>) is corrupted. The System Update Readiness Tool can correct some conditions that cause this error. But as you&nbsp;have already&nbsp;tried CheckSUR and if the CheckSUR tool encounters problems while running, it records them in a file called
 CheckSUR.log, located in your Windows folder, under Logs\CBS\.&nbsp; On a default installation of Windows, this will be
<span>C:\Windows\Logs\CBS</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to fix errors found in the CheckSUR.log&nbsp;follow the suggestions in&nbsp;the&nbsp;article provided below, the article only applies to following version of Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Enterprise</li><li>Windows 7 Professional</li><li>Windows 7 Ultimate</li></ul>

            I ended up fixing the problem myself last night. I read on another post that putting in my windows professional disc and selecting upgrade windows can help fix the error code that that update diagnostic was returning. So i ran the upgrade and it hung on
 the very last step, and after that I couldn't get either operating system (it created a second one) to run. My computer is only a couple days old at this point and I don't really have anything on it yet, so I plugged my hard drive into my dad's computer and
 completely erased it and started over. The fresh install fixed everything, not just this problem (I was having others elsewhere). Also for completion's sake I had been having the update issues from the very first time I ran windows update. I don't have a CheckSUR
 log, but when I ran the update readiness tool it would run without issue. The only cause I can think of for the problems might have been when I installed windows for the very first time it failed, and I shut my computer and restarted

<h2>            Microsoft Store &#38; Windows Update - Error 0x80048504</h2>
                    <p>In both the Microsoft Store and Windows Update I recieve error 0x80048504 for when I attemp to login or download updates and check for updates. These have been going of for about a month. I recently tried other fixes for the Windows Update as described on
 other answers.microsoft.com threads, including uninstalling previous updates and clearing version information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The only remaining Windows Updates are:<br />
- Update for Microsoft Windows (KB4049011)<br />
- Update for Microsoft Windows (KB4022405)</p>
<p>- Security Update for Adobe Flash Player (KB4022730)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can not uninstall these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this problem and be able to, once again, sign in to my microsoft account through windows 10 and download important security updates?</p>

HOW TO FIX WIN10 STORE APP / METRO / UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS – WINDOWS STORE RESET
2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/ 
..0. Restart the computer
  1. Win Store Trouble Shooter
  2. Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
  3. Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
  4. Reg hack for Connection errors
  5. Re-Register the Store
Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble shooter-for-windows-apps 
Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
Run as Admin.
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

******************************************
****************************
RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select "Run as Administrator" option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

<h2>            Importing KML into Windows 8.1 Maps prrogram.</h2>
                    <p>I have exported my locations from Google Maps to import them into Microsoft Maps program</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see how to do that to www.bing.com\maps but it won't sync to my Nokia or Surface Maps program</p>
<p>
</p><p>'I know that Windows 8 Maps app will sync with the Maps program on my Lumina so I looked around both applications (phone and computer) but cannot find a way to import the KML file or bulk import so I can have all my favorites on my Microsoft products.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I browsed to the .kml file and tried to open it - hoping that Windows would know what to do with it, but alas, that failed too</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I do this? There HAS to be a way to bulk transfer favorites&nbsp;into Maps!! There really has to be!</p>

            <p>Hi Simard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there's no way to import locations into the Windows 8.1 Maps app through KML files or other bulk mechanisms. We understand that it is important to you to have a way to get all your locations into the app in&nbsp;a quick&nbsp;way so that they can be available
 everywhere so I'll&nbsp;pass this feedback to the team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also submit this or other new features requests in the feature suggestion forum:

            <p>Dear Program Administrator,</p>
<p>please please PLEASE!!!!!!! encourage Microsoft to develop a way to import GPX files into the Maps app for use offline that can connect to a GPS. Out here in the world there are a bunch of us desperate for something to use offline since Streets and Trips
 was discontinued.</p>

    <title>Showing the Game Bar in tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Showing the Game Bar in tablet mode</h2>
                    <p>So it looks like there's no way to show the Game Bar when in Tablet Mode, ie without a keyboard or gamepad plugged in. Personally I like to play Hearthstone, which only requires the touchscreen, and I would like to display the game bar in order to record
 clips and screenshots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annoyingly, this is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply adding a Game Bar button to the action center would solve this. But does anyone else have any suggestions on how to solve this? Perhaps there's a method I'm not aware of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried VoiceAttack but it's horribly unreliable on Windows 10, at least on my Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have gone through several forums in search of a solution to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using the BITS troubleshooter, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I also tried to manually stop the windows update service using:</p>
<p>Elevated CMD</p>
<p>net stop wuauserv</p>
<p>CD %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution</p>
<p>ren Download Download.old</p>
<p>net start wuauserv</p>
<p>net stop bits</p>
<p>Net start bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across one forum post, where the user suggested to delete the content of C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the content and restart, the apps started installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any files that can't be deleted, try deleting the rest of the content through Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            How to let sfc.exe replace damaged files in dll cache when presario v3000 doesn&#39;t see xp pro cd&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>SFC.EXE /SCANNOW keeps asking me to put my xp pro disk in so it can copy files to the dll cache.&nbsp; When I put the&nbsp;disk in the cd drive,&nbsp;it says something to the effect of "you must have used the wrong disk or the disk is corrupt" and everything stops there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My cd/dvd drive has not shown up in win explorer or device manager for about&nbsp;2 months now.&nbsp; I've done every every every thing, including deleting upper and lower filters 2 weeks ago&nbsp;(I deleted the wrong registrey key and just now got my desktop back!).&nbsp;
 I don't think sp3 caused the cd drive to disappear, as I've been running it for a long long time now and the disappearing cd drive is fairly recent.</p>
<p>My question is: How can I get the necessary dll files into my dll cache if my cd drive doesn't work?&nbsp; Maybe corrupted dll files are what's causing the&nbsp;cd drive to disappear.&nbsp; I tried copy system32 files to a flash drive but sfc will only look for a cd drive.</p>
<p>Thanks so much...</p>

<p>First, run Mats cd fix first to see if it will resolve your issue with your rom devive.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116</a></p>
<p>A description of sfc/ scannow from MS;</p>
<p><em>"System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder
 (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators
 group to run System File Checker."</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747</a></em></p>
<p>When you&nbsp; receive the error you have inserted the wrong disc it could be the disc has the wrong service pack or, it could be the system is looking for the wrong drive.</p>
<p>Click start &gt; run &gt; type regedit &gt; click ok.</p>
<p>Navigate to: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup</strong> . Click on "setup" folder to expand the contents into the right pane. Scroll down the list in the right pane and locate "SourcePath". Make sure the source path
 is set to the rom device's drive letter.<br />
<br />
If the source path is set correctly I would then suspect the disc contains a service pack different than that which is installed on the computer. There is a solution to that as well.</p>
<p>Click on the link below and download Service Pack 3 for IT Techs. Save the file. Once the download is complete download and install Winrar trial version from the second link below. After Winrar has installed right click on the Service pack 3 file and choose
 "Extract here" using Winrar. When the extract window opens type C:\ into the file path location for the file to be extracted to. This will place the i386 folder at the root of C drive. Next, revert back to the instructions above for the source path and change
 the source path to C:\. Now run sfc /scannow again.</p>

<p><span>Hi Steve Farwell,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>As a first step let’s try to boot the computer
 in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists in Safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts<span>Windows</span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers

<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persist
 in Safe mode, perform a Clean boot</span><span>to check if there is any third party application which is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the
 issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in clean boot i.e. disable non Microsoft services.</span></p>
<p><span>The purpose of disabling non Microsoft services is to check if any of these services is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps given in the link below to boot the computer in clean boot state:</span></p>

<p><span><br />
<strong>Note: Reset the computer to start as usual</strong></span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password
 or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. <br />
b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. <br />
c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>I would suggest you to</span><span>scan the computer for error.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow this step to do the same:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start<br />
2. Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD-&gt;Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
3. At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that
 sector if any data available on that might be lost</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Check a drive for errors</span></span></span></p>

            I don't think you can click something in Excel to do this. You can use a LAN scanner (Google for various programs or look on your favorite downloads site). Or, depending on how many computers you have, you can just ping the computer name from a command
 prompt and you'll get back its IP address. Then you can enter the information into an Excel spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
Or, again depending on how many computers you're talking about, you could just give them static IPs and be done with it.

<br />He will have to select the country code from drop down in the dialler. This is mandatory even if you are in Australia. (Australia is selected by default in your case as your profile must be having Australian address). Hence, it doesn't matter which part of the world he is in. Country code is must.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h3> matijajankovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installation from USB won&#39;t start up</h2>
                    <p>So I've just finished building my PC and everything is up and running. I have the new Windows 10 OS install from the USB which i got from the local shops. When i turn on my PC, i enter into the BIOS settings and change the boot options so that it boots from
 the USB first. I even try overriding the boot and making it boot from the USB. It then starts to do something with a dash in the top left corner, and then the dash quickly flickers from that position to another position on my monitor a few times, and then
 just returns to BIOS. I can't even see the windows logo or anything. My computer is recognising the usb with the windows 10 on it but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an ASUS h170 pro gaming motherboard. Any help with this issue would be much appreciated. Post a response if you need any more details regarding my build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: This is a brand new PC that i just built, so it's a clean install and i have had no previous OS on the system.</p>

<p>2) And what is the name of your flash drive that's shown in BIOS? I mean something like [UEFI] + bla-bla-bla?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the option isn't disabled, then just try to disable it (i guess it's probably an advanced mode, well, or not) and boot from your flash drive that's now should be named as in the second paragraph.</p>

    <title>strange problem&#58; sound interruptions during voice calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kostasladopoulos  say:</h3>
<h2>            strange problem&#58; sound interruptions during voice calls</h2>
                    <p>ok here is my strange problem. I changed ISP a while ago (Italy, Tiscali) and I noticed that I have problems with my Skype Calls. The other side hears me perfectly, but I listen to the sound with interruptions, like if some words are cut.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me point out that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The sound, as in terms of quality, is not bad. It is just with interruptions</p>
<p>- I checked with other computers and a tablet too, same result (with Skype test call).</p>
<p>- all mics, headphones, speakers working at 100%</p>
<p>- I checked while connected to another WiFi, <strong>I had no issues</strong>. -&gt;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">so it seemes that is not a computer or app problem but a connection one</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My internet connection does not seem to have other issues, it is pretty fast, download and streaming, all good</p>
<p>- I checked with both WiFi and Ethernet cable - same problem</p>
<p>- I turned off the Firewall from the modem ( VMG8823-B50B Zyxel ) - same problem</p>
<p>- uPnP already checked</p>
<p>- modem restarted - same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I just called a normal cel. phone, same problem, I hear the sound with "gaps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Help, I'm pretty lost...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

            <p>You can try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the lock screen, press and hold down the shift key then click on power then restart while holding down the shift key until the restart begins. This should&nbsp;restart you to the Windows RE (repair environment). Select startup repair and follow the instructions,
 hopefully this will work for this issue. If not try starting up in safe mode then make the changes in MSCONFIG.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Take a look at the Wireless management it might be that there is an auto connection already there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/vista/wireless_manager.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.ezlan.net/vista/wireless_manager.jpg&nbsp;</a> (Control Panel, Network and Sharing Center. Upper left side click on Manage Wireless networks.</p>
<p>If you change some thing and you want to redo it, delete the entry.<br />
<br />
Since your Wireless is not any more in the preferred list, it will prompt for the password. Put the current password, and hopefully it will connect.<br />
<br />
If the password does not work log to the Router with a cable and redo the password.</p>

    <title>can&#39;t buy music from windows store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jy31415  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t buy music from windows store</h2>
                    <p>When I try to buy music from the Windows store, a prompt appears to enter my password. I enter my password. The prompt closes. Another prompt opens saying "Give it another try. Something went wrong." along with an error code: "SVC-Service-QueryOrder 8rPPimwQAkqCArh5.57.2"</p>
<p>However, I can buy music from another computer, also running Windows 10, so I did, and that worked fine.</p>
<p>However, in Groove Music app (on the first, problematic computer), if I try to download the music I bought on the working computer, I get a "Download Error". If I try to play without downloading, it gives the error "Can't play. Please try again. If the problem
 continues, visit www.xbox.com/support to check for guidance." This also has an error code: "0xc00d11cd (0xc00d36ee)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter, which did not work.</p>
<p>sfc /scannow did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>dism /cleanup-image also did not find any&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also could not find any errors in the event viewer that correlate with errors in either Windows Store or Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 build 10586.318, Windows store version 11602.1.26.0, Groove version 3.6.1513.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Christopher, your product key is not tied to your SSD, your system will have a digital licence generated from mainly your motherboard and stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers. A change of hard drive does not void that digital licence . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Very Important:
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>I had done all that and was getting an Activation error. So I just ran the trouble shooter and it is telling me I installed Pro and I had Home before. So...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I long into Microsoft.com I see 3 devices : my laptop ( Win10 Home&nbsp; ), desktop with new SSD (Win 10 Pro) , and another desktop( Win 10 Pro ) which I don't have.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I updated my rig for VR and bought a new motherboard. I'm assuming I had an OEM vers on Win10 Home that came with MB and I just installed that instead of transferring prod key. So I guess, this second desktop is the old MB. When I saw the
 Win Pro version on this device, I wrongly assumed it was the dead SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to transfer prod key from old MB to new MB ? I'd rather have the pro version and not have to re-install Win10 Hone again after I just got all my drivers, apps, etc. downloaded and working again.</p>

            Hi Christopher, yes you can transfer your product key - but will need to contact Microsoft support to get help with that:
