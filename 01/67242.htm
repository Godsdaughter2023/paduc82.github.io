<h2>            Windows 10 refresh removed Microsoft Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Computer froze and a window popped up saying to refresh Windows 10. When I did this it removed Microsoft Office 2013. How do I get it back on my computer without purchasing a new version?</p>

            Hi, DanSutton
<br />
<br />This is a possible solution: you just have to search for the Office applications that interest you -like Word or Excel- in the Start menu and then anchor them to the taskbar or to the desktop start screen with the right button.       
        </p>

            If you bought Office 2013, not a subscription:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-downlo...</a>
<br />Scroll down
<br />     Enter the 25-character product key that came with your product purchase in the field below. This product requires a valid product activation key for download.
<br />    After the product key is verified, select a product language from the menu.
<br />    Click a download link to begin the download.
<br />
<br />
<br />OPTION 2:
<br />
<br />If you bought Office 2013 as part of a subscription such as Office 365:
<br />
<br /> Step 1: Sign in to My Office Account to begin installing Office 2013
<br />
<br />    Go to My Office Account (<a href="https://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/myaccount</a>). If you're not already signed in with the Microsoft account associated with your copy of Office do that now. If you're signed in with a different account, sign out of that and then sign in again with the correct Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />
<br />    In the Install Information section, select Install. This begins the process to install the 32-bit version of Office on your PC using the language you selected when you redeemed the product.
<br />
<br />    If you'd like to install the 64-bit version instead, choose Additional install options &gt; Office (64-bit), and then select Install. If you're not sure which version you should install, see Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office.
<br />    
<br />
<br />Step 2: Install and activate Office
<br />
<br />    Depending on your browser, click Run (in Edge or Internet Explorer), Setup (in Chrome), or Save File (in Firefox).
<br />
<br />    When you see "You're good to go", choose All done.
<br />
<br />
<br />    Start using an Office application right away by opening any app such as Word or Excel. In most cases, Office is activated once you start an application and after you click Accept to agree to the Microsoft Office License Agreement.
<br />
<br />
<br />    Office might activate automatically when you open an app, such as Word, for the first time.

    <title>Update with Win10 ISO file failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> testrat19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update with Win10 ISO file failed</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the Win 10 ISO file to try and complete the update. Current is 1607 Build 14393.2007<br />
Error window:&nbsp; We couldnt install. Windows 10 was put back.<br />
0x8007042b - 0x4000d<br />
The installation failed in the second_boot phase with an error during Migrate_Data operation</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The automatic update has been trying and trying to update. But fails. It would download, do its reboot thing several times installing, I dont think i saw any errors, but soon as it booted back to the desktop, it would start it all over again.&nbsp; For now to
 STOP the automatic UPDATE, I bring up TASK MANAGER and find the WINDOWS 10 UPDATE and END TASK.&nbsp; That stops it for the time being.&nbsp; Till it trys start again later in the day.<br />
I also tried the file: wu170509.diagcab - Troubleshooting thing. I think it fixed some things. But didnt help.<br />
I read on other posts to download the .ISO file manually and do the update, so, i had hoped that would work.... But didnt.<br />
.</p>
<p>I think that is everything I have tried.. </p>
<p>So... now what...? </p>
<p>You guys on here seem to do very well in helping everyone.&nbsp; I thank you for that..
</p>
<p>And i did try to read other posts and figure this out myself.&nbsp; Oh well.. I tried.

            You have one of a few options to consider here:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Backup and perform a clean install - you have exhausted everything thats reasonably possible. Sometimes, your system has some unknown underlying issue that creates a blocker for upgrades. Save yourself: time, frustration and just perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Yes, its a chore, but this man made stuff and it ain't perfect and it will never be. 
<br />
<br />Its better for you to have your data and go through the annoying convenience of reinstalling apps and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Backup:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />	Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Don't bother with the upgrade.
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives. 
<br />
<br />How to block it:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: upgrade to another release such as Windows 10 1703 
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If they fail then I would hide Fall Creators Update Version 1709 update until it matures, using the Hide Updates tool here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try manually upgrading with the Version 1703 ISO available from here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Click the ISO to mount it, right click Setup to Run as Admin.
<br />
<br />If it will install you can then try the Version 1709 ISO again, but your PC may not be able to handle it and you may need to maintain the last working version until you can try the next one.
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />They are also supposed to see this in telemetry gathered during the failures.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Email addresses can be spoofed, so that is no certain way to find out if it is legit or not.</p>
<p>If you open the email and read the contents you would see it is very innocuous and that the links point to Microsoft.

<h2>            Cheated off a gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>Hi i posted this before but was told to post here so here it goes&nbsp;I would like to share a bad experience I had with xbox, So a while ago 3 years ago back in 2011 when gamertag recycling was present I was exicted like everyone else, but little did I know
 I really did not even have a chance to get a tag So basically I was waiting for a certain tag to recycle since 2008, it was an original xbox account and when it did recycle i could not make it, why could i not make it you ask? because an employee actually
 put a reserve on this tag and could not let a loyal fan get this tag, I can provide proof if you would just look up the tag as this was actually done by major nelson, it is completely unfair that a director of xbox would do this type of thing, and yes I know
 for a 100 percent fact it is major nelson who owns this valuable tag that i have been waiting years to get only to be shut down because i dont have enough power and I guess being a loyal fan is not enough I tried to contact him via twitter i sent him alot
 of tweets, not only did he not reply to these tweets and I did not mind that its actually that he DELETED my tweets when I asked him about it, So what I'm looking for is a little bit a compensation like a recycled gamertag and yes i know the higher department
 definitely can provide this and all im asking for is please since what ive been through for this since it actually made me quit xbox as it is totally not fair for someone to manipulate the system like that, the worst part is he doesnt even use the tag since
 he recovered it, just basically got it just to have it instead of letting someone else having a shot at it, enforcement team please help me out as this is really my only hope left.</p>

<p>Hello there <strong>Adapted,</strong> There is no way to request a forced name change. The enforcement team will only investigate your account if someone has filed a complaint on your account and they will only give a forced change if your gamertag violates
 the code of conduct. Even if they did issue a forced change, they would give you a randomly generated tag.</p>
<p><strong>You would not be able to choose your new tag without paying.</strong></p>

<p>Hello there again<strong> Adapted</strong>, I understand what you are saying but I doubt you can do anything about this, You can always<strong> file a complaint via your console</strong> &amp; it will be
<strong>investigated by the enforcement team</strong>. The only way to report someone is using the
<strong>tools on your console</strong>. That`s really it,</p>
<p>You may have <strong>"Pictures"</strong> or <strong>"Videos"</strong>&nbsp;but there Ussless on the Xbox.com Forums because there not "Offical" from the Microsoft Xbox Service, You could have tampered or edited the videos/pictures so your "Evidence" means nothing,
 As previously stated, There`s nothing you can do about this, You could always call Support,&nbsp;<span>Please reach out to them by visiting this page&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><span>&nbsp;You can always check out the&nbsp;</span><strong>International

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>You can always head your way to

<p><span>I wish you all the very best <strong>Adapted, </strong>Good Luck.</span></p>

<p>Thanks but I already tried and let me make sure you know what i mean back in 2011 an employee by the name of major nelson recycled a tag for himself that i was waiting years for, the gamertag became available but he had already attached it to his email so
 i couldnt claim it, the gamertag is "Halo" and yes he does own the tag i know for a 100 percent fact honestly what kind of service is this from microsoft? I appreciate your help but I cannot believe a multi-billion dollar company puts employees over fans so
 much, I waited for the tag for years just to be claimed by an employee who used his power to claim it before anyone else, trust me if you were in my shoes you would be mad too.</p>

<p>First, how do you know that he wasn't waiting for it as well and just got to it before you did? Also, there could be several reasons why you could not get that tag. It is entirely possible that it was claimed for a developer, or even just claimed to put
 it out of circulation. Just because major nelson owns the tag, does not prove that he used his position to get it.

<p>I don't dobut it as he probaly did do it because I knew a similar situation that happened with one of my friends, pretty pathetic if you ask me that they would stoop so low and i can see the tag is inactive so he got it just to sit on it, just because he
 has the tag he wanted doesnt mean that us fans do, microsoft should be ashamed of themselves of how double standard their system is.</p>

<p>Yeah totally the employee reserved it fair and square before everyone else. You know, its just a coincidence that almost all reset ogs, at least the best ones, are all employees, lol its pretty funny how delusional people are as they do not see that the
 best tags "original" ones are employees, coincidence? as they are not even apart of the launch team and are somewhat new accounts fix your &nbsp;system microsoft</p>

            If you have a specific file name post the file name so we can verify it is a DX file or if it is
<br />
something else causing the crash.<br />
Did you have an error message before attempting to update DX that led you to trying to update ?<br />
If so, which game generated the error ?<br />
<br />
There are two options for updating or fixing DX -<br />
The DirectX Web Installer will add files where there may be missing files (Win7 installs with<br />
a couple of missing DX files) -<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download details: DirectX End-User Runtime</a>
<br />
<br />
When there is a specific file name for a possibly corrupt file you can delete the original from
<br />
System 32 and SysWOW64 ( on 64 bit Win7 ) and when you run the Web Installer it will
<br />
replace them.<br />
<br />
The full DX redist (June 2010) is the best option when there are corrupt files and there is<br />
no specific file name, as this will overwrite all the existing DX files.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If you have problems running either of these options try booting into Safe Mode and installing
<br />
from there. Safe Mode is most commonly accessed by taping the F8 key before Windows boots.<br />

            Yes, I'd tried the DXwebsetup way the first time apparently. I tried the second one you suggested with the Directx redist but I don't know the exact location to extract files<br />
<br />
<b>C:\Windows\System32\directx\websetup&nbsp;<br />
</b><br />
was my best guess, after extracting would I run the installer again?<br />
<br />
The DXError.log repeats this for every install attempt I've done, the most recent being&nbsp;<br />
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>[01/05/13 13:21:51] module: DXWSetup(Mar 30 2011), file: dxwsetup.cpp, line: 229, function: CDXWSetup::InitInstallEngine</b></div>

<div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; CDXWSetup::InitInstallEngine() failed.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>the other file, Directx.log contains pages and I don't know exactly what I'm looking for.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sorry for any mistakes on my part I'm not very tech savvy, again any assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>

            Unfortunately System32 was not the best place to extract to, but as long as it was extracted to<br />
a sub folder rather than spread throughout the main folder or one of the original sub-folders<br />
&nbsp;you should be OK.&nbsp; <br />
If you have the DirectX Web Installer in System 32 I would suggest moving that folder to another<br />
location outside the Windows folder.&nbsp; You can move it anywhere you like as it does not actually
<br />
install and has no file path or registry keys with a file path.<br />
The Windows folder is best left alone as much as possible.<br />
<br />
A new folder on the desktop is good place to extract the DX redist&nbsp; to.<br />
These are&nbsp; only the&nbsp; 'setup' files, and can be deleted after you run the&nbsp; DXSETUP.exe &nbsp; inside that&nbsp; folder.<br />
- You can keep the&nbsp; file you downloaded wherever you keep your backups for later use
<br />
( not done much these days I suppose, but we have restrictive download limits on budget broadband plans here in OZ ) .<br />
<br />
The following is a list of the Direct X .dll's you will have when the files are up to date.<br />
Go to the Windows / System 32 folder, (and SysWOW64 if you have 64bit).&nbsp; <br />
They are in alphabetical order and will start with d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43 . Then d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43 &amp; finally d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.<br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11 these come before the D3Dcompilers - 33&gt;43.<br />
There are also four&nbsp; XInput.dlls .<br />
There are more DX files, but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's<br />
<br />
80T</span> on another thread.<br />
Go to <span style="font-style: italic">Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or Off</span> , and if you have disabled<br />
"Games" re-enable them by checking the tick box.]<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really know what those error reports relate to, but you could try a couple of other<br />
troubleshooting options. In addition to installing from Safe Mode there is Clean Boot.<br />
This is useful for troubleshooting potential conflicts -<br />

<h2>            My Pictures won&#39;t open a photo saying it is too large.</h2>
                    &nbsp;Why won't My Pictures open a photo, saying it is too large, when My Pictures will open other photos that I have downloaded from my camera, which are larger than this photo? I get this message: The image is too large(Too many bytes). It is 4.75Mb photo
 but I have many photos larger than this that I downloaded from my camera, that My Pictures will open. Is it because it is from another site? Why would that be a problem when the size of the photo is actually smaller than many photos that I downloaded from
 my camera that My Pictures will open?

==========================================<br />
OK...you are running Win XP and are trying to open a photo<br />
that is in your My Pictures folder? Have you tried opening the<br />
photo in an image editor? <br />
<br />
You could even try MS Paint....Start / Programs / Accessories / Paint...<br />
<br />
Please post the exact error message.<br />
<br />
Could you post a link to the site where you downloaded the photo?<br />

            Yes I'm trying to open a photo that is in My Pictures folder. When I right click on the photo and choose Preview it will open and I can view it. But when I go to the bottom of the photo and try to choose the next to the last button on the far right, which
 says, Closes this program and opens the image for editing, it will close the program but then in the new window there is no photo but the same message I get when I try to right click on the image and choose Open, the message is--The image is too large(Too
 many bytes). Even though the image is smaller than many of my images that I downloaded from my camera. The site where I got this image is:http://www.dpreview.com/gallery/nikond300s_samples/&nbsp; I went to Paint like you suggested but I have never used this program
 and I don't even know how to get an image to paint in order to try to edit it. Thanks and I look forward to what you have to say.

 which says, Closes this program and opens the image for editing, it will close the program but then in the new window there is no photo but the same message I get when I try to right click on the image and choose Open, the message is--The image is too large(Too
 many bytes). Even though the image is smaller than many of my images that I downloaded from my camera. The site where I got this image is:http://www.dpreview.com/gallery/nikond300s_samples/&nbsp; I went to Paint like you suggested but I have never used this program
 and I don't even know how to get an image to paint in order to try to edit it. Thanks and I look forward to what you have to say.</blockquote>
OK...when you are in WP&amp;F Viewer and go to..."Closes this <br />

is MS Paint. If it is not opening...I have no idea how to fix it.<br />
<br />
To import a photo into Paint...open&nbsp;Paint and go to...File/Open...<br />
browse to the image you wish to open.<br />

            When I normally go to my pictures ,open a folder and then click on a photo, it opens up automatically in Microsoft Photo Editor and I can do editing there. When I click on this particular photo, that I downloaded from another site, Microsoft Photo Editor
 opens but I get the message, The Image is too Large(Too many bytes) and the photo doesn't open up there. I was able to get the photo to open up on Paint but I can't do the things to it that I want to do there. I wanted to sharpen it and you can't do that in
 Paint but you can in Photo Editor. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to understand why a photo that is smaller than other photos I have in My Pictures is seen by Microsoft Photo Editor as too large and will not open when larger photos will open up in Microsoft Photo Editor.

=======================================<br />
Microsoft Photo Editor is an older program that has<br />
been replaced with Microsoft Picture Manager. <br />
<br />
File size in megabytes is not the problem...the pixel<br />
dimensions of the photo you gave me the link for are<br />
4288x2848...if the pixel dimensions were reduced to<br />
a size more like 2730x1827 I think you could open<br />
it in Photo Editor.<br />
<br />
If you need a resizer...the free PowerToy ImageResizer <br />
might be worth a try (I use it all the time)<br />
<br />
Go to the following link and download and install:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
ImageResizer.exe<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx</a><br />
(will not&nbsp;run on Vista)<br />
<br />
Then you can open any folder that contains <br />
images and you will have an option to resize. <br />
Just right click the selected image files and <br />
choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You <br />
can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in <br />
the folder with your originals. <br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and <br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.<br />
<br />

            I just replaced my PC and loaded my old software and data files on the new PC.&nbsp; I'm having the same problem as described here.&nbsp; I used to be able to open any of my pictures in MS Photo Editor and now I can't open certain JPG's.&nbsp; I thought it might have
 been the object size, but I could open larger files and I get "Error Reading File" on some smaller ones.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I found a consistent pattern in the "Dimension" of the picture.&nbsp; I can't open files that are 3456 x 2304 but I can open files that are 2304 X 3456.&nbsp; I can open any file so long as the first Dimension is 2304 or less.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;rotate one of the 3456 x 2304 photos
 that I can't open so it's 2304 x 3456 I can open it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So what's causing the problem is the first number in the&nbsp;picture's&nbsp;"Dimension".&nbsp; MS Photo Editor&nbsp;must have some limitation now that it didn't have before I&nbsp;reloaded my software.&nbsp; I'm going to search for updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

====================================<br />
Good luck on finding updates.<br />
<br />
IMHO...your best option would be to resize the photos or <br />
move to a photo editor / viewer that can handle&nbsp;the pixel <br />
dimensions of your photos.

            Paint does nothing to convert any image to JPEG. I had even downloaded a free program - which also did nothing. There are many photos/images on Pinterest that I want to open or use as a cover photo - but it says - too large or not JPEG or a few others
 which I don't remember....SUCH A PAIN.&nbsp;

However when I came back I found it had automatically stopped installing at about the 70 odd percent mark.</p><p>So I tried again. And yet again it did the same thing.</p><p>I tried looking up similar problems with solutions, but they still didn't work.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please,&nbsp;may someone help me solve this issue.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t Refresh&#47;Reset my windows 8.1 laptop</h2>
                    I have tried to refresh my <strong>windows 8.1</strong> laptop but i keep getting this error message "<strong>the media inserted is not valid</strong>". I also tried to reset my laptop but i got the same error message. If this helps, i
<strong>bought windows 8 and upgraded to windows 8.1 through the store</strong> and i only have a
<strong>windows 8 product key</strong>. The reason as to why i want to refresh/reset my laptop is that my laptop keeps shutting down unexpectedly (not a over-heating problem by the way) and i was hoping that refreshing/resetting it would help.

            <p>On an 8.1 updated system, you need the 8.1 system files for a Refresh to work.&nbsp; Since you don't have those and had not previously made a Custom Refresh image, you may be able to use Restore to back up to whenever the Restore point was created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Reset, which would take you back to Windows 8, if you system was set up to do so.&nbsp; But it sounds like this is not an original OEM Windows 8 install, so you won't have a Factory image to Reset with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had made a System Image Backup from a time when the system was working normally, you could use that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems you are looking at a reinstall.</p>

            Hi Autumn, Greg is here (an Independent advisor).
<br />
<br />The option to select multiple folders and turn them into albums within the Photos application is currently unavailable.
<br />I can recommend that you refer to the article on &gt; See all your photos to get information on Photos application &gt; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22877/windows-10-photos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22877/...</a>
<br />You might want to post feed back in the Feedback Hub to tell Microsoft about your problem and help to improve Windows experience &gt; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402156...</a>

            Hi Autumn
<br />
<br />The Photos App does not contain photos, it is just a view of folders on your PC
<br />
<br />You do not need to move those folders of photos, you just need to add those folders to the source of the Photos App, so it knows those folders are on your PC
<br />
<br />In the Photos App, click the 3 dots at the top right, and choose Settings
<br />
<br />In the Sources section, click the 'Add a folder' option
<br />
<br />If all those folders have a parent folder, just add that folder, otherwise, add each folder to the list of folders that the Photos App looks at . . .

            hi Autumn,
<br />the photos app does not store your photos, it looks in certain folders for pictures.
<br />you don't need to move your phots, you only need to tell the phot app to look at the folder the photos are currently in
<br />
<br />open photos app, near the top is a menu (collection, albums etc) select folders
<br />click add a folder
<br />click the "add another folder" link
<br />navigate to the folder that your photos are in and click select folder.
<br />
<br />your photos will then be available in the photos app

            <p>Hi every xbox live account is associated with a microsoft account. So even your xbox one account where all your progress and games are saved has a microsoft account. It is probably a different one than the one you keep trying to sign into. Try requesting your microsoft account infromation using your email. You will probably get two different responses, use the one you are not familar with to log into your xbox one's account and use that in the future. Hope this helps!</p>

            If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically. Also send the feedback to Windows development team so that this can be prioritized for fixing in subsequent patches,
<br />
<br />A. I would recommend that you submit this request as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub
<br />
<br />Windows Key+F
<br />Submit your feedback
<br />
<br />B. To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. What is the Exact Error code you are receiving when you try to buy content? What are you trying to buy, and&nbsp;on what console are you attempting to make this purchase? Have you tried making this purchase from

<div>Hi DLee88,</div>
<div><br />
<div>May I know which Office 365 subscription plan are you using? Please provide us with the detailed information about this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skype for Business online doesn’t come with Microsoft Office 365 Home/Personal subscription but it has included consumer Skype. See
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Compare Microsoft Office 365 products</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>However, starting from October 1, 2018, Skype for Business online is no longer included in Microsoft Office 365 Business for new customers that have fewer than 500 seats. They will be onboarded to Microsoft Teams and will not have access to Skype for Business
 Online.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Office 365 Business Tenants that are already using Skype for Business online will be able to continue to do this (including provisioning new users) until they complete their transition to Microsoft Teams.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For detailed information, please refer to the article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4465277/microsoft-teams-now-the-primary-client-for-meetings-and-calling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Teams is now the primary client for meetings and calling in Office 365</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>Shyamal</div>

            The child settings are associated with your email account which is why they showed up on your new computer when you logged in using the same email. 
<br />
<br />As a "child" you don't have the right to get out of the family group.  
<br />You are going to have to get your "parent" to go into family safety and remove you from the family group.

<p>Hi Sher,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of them and the problem keep disappearing and appearing again for like 2-3 days.</p>
<p>I tried to use the network troubleshooter and the problem seems to be&nbsp; an ip configuration problem. It says "Local Area Network Connection" doesn't have a valid IP configuration. I searched for solutions and tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- To update network driver</p>
<p>- Restarting router/pc (many times)</p>
<p>- And a lot of others solutions but still problem is there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do anymore. Thanks for replying btw.</p>

    <title>No Results Found For&#58; asf codec missing in wmp 12 &#40;this - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Results Found For&#58; asf codec missing in wmp 12 &#40;this forum&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer&nbsp;is a clean install of Windows 7 x64&nbsp;built with an Intel DG45ID&nbsp;motherboard&nbsp;(compatible with Windows 7).&nbsp; I have had problems with sound stuttering when playing&nbsp;AVCHD movie files (sony video camera files with ".m2ts" file extension). This problem
 occurs whether I have Intel's High Definition sound driver&nbsp;installed or the default Windows 7 driver installed.</p>
<p>To test my basic windows setup I went to: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992</a>&nbsp;which explains Windows Media formats (.asf, .wma, .wmv, .wm).&nbsp; I downloaded test files and when I tried to play "wmt.asf" which should be played by Windows Media Player 12 (installed by installing Windows 7) I get
 an error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Windows Media Player&nbsp;cannot play, burn, rip, or sync the file because a required audio codec is not installed on your computer."</p>
<p>Based on the Microsoft support link above, it is my understanding that the required codec is installed by installing Windows 7.&nbsp; So my question is, "How do I get WMP 12's&nbsp;missing codecs and resolve these issues?"</p>
<p>To eliminate all other issues, I built a new TEST computer last night with Intel's DH55HC motherboard,&nbsp;an i5-660 processor and 4 GB of RAM. I will install Windows 7 x64 (with Intel drivers and all Windows 7 updates, but no other software) and see if I get
 the same results. If I do, then my conclusion is that Windows 7 does not load the required codec.</p>

<p>KB 316992 has not been updated since May 2008, so it does not contain information on Windows Media Player 12.</p>
<p><strong>Test1:</strong>&nbsp; I installed Windows 7 and Intel drivers (needed LAN driver to access Internet) on the new&nbsp;TEST computer.&nbsp; I played a number of media files that all worked without problems:&nbsp; mp3, rmi, mid, wma, wav, wmv, mpg, and&nbsp;m2ts&nbsp;&nbsp; AVCHD video
 (m2ts file extension) played without audio stutter and the audio and video were also in sync.&nbsp; I tired playing a sample asf file that I downloaded from the Internet and it also played without any problems.&nbsp; I went back to KB316992 and tried downloading and
 playing the sample file "wmt.asf", which resulted in the same error message reported earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong>&nbsp; 1. Files were corrupted on the original computer when I installed Nero 8 Essentials and then uninstalled Nero to install a newer version, Nero&nbsp;9 Reloaded (this was the only software installed that is media related).&nbsp; I don't
 know which&nbsp;Nero Software&nbsp;caused the corruption, but Nero 8 Essentials may not be compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; Product information on "Nero 9 Reloaded" indicates Windows 7 compatability.</p>
<p>2. The sample asf file at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992</span></a>&nbsp;does not work in Windows Media Player 12 and should be fixed or replaced when KB 316992 is updated to
 include Windows Media Player 12 (or whatever action Microsoft&nbsp;decides is&nbsp;appropriate).</p>

    <title>Personalization of Windows Lock Screen on Windows 8.1 RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernieh58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Personalization of Windows Lock Screen on Windows 8.1 RT</h2>
                    <p>I love my Surface RT's lock screen slideshow functionality, and actually use my old Surface just for this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've found, though, is that it is too repetitive in terms of displaying the same photos over and over again, even if I choose My Pictures as the folder to use; there are around 60K photos in the various subfolders. Seems to me that each time I start
 up the slideshow, it displays pretty much the same photos,, in the same pattern, every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around this, I manually change the folder used for the slideshow each day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to set things up so that the slideshow will automatically cycle through a different folder each day? I'd prefer it to cycle in a defined order (e.g. by folder name), not randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a limit to the number of files in a folder that the slideshow can present? I've limited the number of files in each of my photo folders to ~500 because of my suspicions here.</p>
<p>

            <p>That's the <u>project</u> file.&nbsp; You open it up in Windows Live Movie Maker from the

 Maker.</p>
<p>But you are right, it is not a movie file.&nbsp; It is just the list of clips, photos and music to be used, instructions on their order, the transitions and the effects you want to apply, titles you want added etc.</p>
<p>In order to create a <u>movie</u>, you must choose that option explicitly.&nbsp; From the
<strong>File </strong>menu, choose <strong>Save Movie...</strong>&nbsp;then save to your computer.&nbsp; The resulting file will be a .wmv file that you can play elsewhere (Windows Media Player, upload to YouTube, etc.)</p>

    <title>Having a horrible experience with XBox One repair process - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knobby foot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having a horrible experience with XBox One repair process</h2>
                    
<p><strong>I am having a horrible experience with the Xbox One repair process.</strong></p>
<p>My Xbox failed on 2/15/15. It wouldn't power on. I followed the steps on the Xbox website to troubleshoot and determined that it was a console issue and my Xbox One would have to be sent in for repair. I followed the steps on the website and opted to pay
 the 20-something dollars which was to include expedited shipping and a free box and packaging at Fedex. I submitted the request, grabbed my Xbox One and headed for my local Fedex store. I get to the store and they told me that the order won't appear in their
 system for 24 hours. I don't remember reading anything about that delay on the xbox website during the process of submitting my repair order. I go home frustrated that I've wasted a trip to Fedex and will need to go back the next day.</p>
<p>I wait the 24 hours and go back to Fedex the next day. Fedex sees the order in the system, but says it only includes the shipping, not the box or packing materials. I tell them that I paid extra to cover the box and packing materials too. They tell me that
 I'll need to contact Microsoft about that. They also tell me that they've had this problem before with other customers. So this is another wasted trip to Fedex.</p>
<p>I drive home and contact Microsoft. The customer care rep tells me that the order shows in their system as expedited and including the box and packaging. The Fedex person must be confused. I tell the customer care rep that Fedex mentioned that this has been
 a problem for other xbox returns previously. The care rep tells me everything looks ok in their system.</p>
<p>I go back to Fedex the next day. They lookup the order in their system. Not only does it still not reflect that box and packaging are covered, it now lists the shipping as ground, not the expedited shipping I paid for. I politely ask the Fedex agent if they
 are certain, because this is sounding to me like they might not know what they are doing. They call over another agent to double check and he confirms the same. So now two agents are saying the order info from Microsoft isn't right. I can see from their name
 tags that one is an assistant manager and both have worked for Fedex for more than five years. This doesn't seem like its a matter of them not knowing what they're doing. One of the two agents is a gamer and decides to help me out. They give me the box and
 packaging even though the system doesn't show that Microsoft paid for it like they were supposed to have done. They also switch the shipping back to expedited as opposed to the ground status. I thank them both for their help and suggest that they have their
 IT folks followup with Microsoft. Something is wrong. I leave Fedex glad that my Xbox one is finally on its way to be repaired.</p>
<p>Microsoft care reps had told me it would take about 14 days for a repair, so I periodically check the website for status. One day I notice a status of "repaired". I was a bit surprised because I never received an email or other notification from Microsoft
 letting me that the console had been repaired and was on its way back to me. I only found it because I looked. I think "great, I'll have my xbox one back soon".</p>
<p>Over the next several days, I continue to check status on the Microsoft website and to check the tracking number privided on the Fedex website. I see the package move from Laredo, TX to Ft Worth, TX and then nothing.</p>
<p>On 3/5, I contacted Microsoft care again because the package didnt appear to be moving. The Fedex site wasnt showing any scans since the package arrived in Ft Worth on the 2nd. At this point, I'm concerned because in my experience when you dont see movement
 on the tracking website, it often means your package is lost. The Microsoft care rep listens to my story and checks my account. He suggests I contact Fedex. I correct him that this is a Microsoft shipping issue and that he should contact Fedex. He gets supervisor
 approval to do that and contacts Fedex on my behalf. I wait on hold. He comes back to me, tells me Fedex apologizes that the tracking isnt being updated, but that I will get the package on 3/6 as expected.</p>
<p>On 3/6 (today) I check the tracking status on Fedex website again, and its still not updated. I decide to call Fedex myself since Microsoft Care hasnt been very effective so far. Fedex says the tracking isnt being updated because the package is traveling
 by truck. They also tell me that the truck has been delayed and I wont be getting the package today on 3/6. The microsoft care rep didnt mention either of these things yesterday, so Im wondering if he really called Fedex. I think if he had he would have known
 this and told me. I'm disappointed but tell myself that shipping delays happen sometimes. But then I realize that I paid for expedited shipping. Why is my xbox being driven cross country on a truck?</p>
<p>So here I am, waiting for my (hopefully) repaired Xbox One with no idea if or when it will arrive. I paid for additional services (expedited shipping, box, packaging) which I haven't received. I am not calling customer care again because they don't seem
 to be able to actually do anything other than look up my order. I'm writing this post in the hopes that someone within Miicrosoft with some ability to help will read it.. I've owned a Xbox, 2 Xbox 360s, and now a Xbox One and have never been so disappointed
 as I am right now. If I could go back in time to the day I bought my Xbox One, I'd buy a PS4 instead.</p>
<p><strong>What I think should happen next</strong></p>
<p>1)Someone within Microsoft Care who is empowered enough to be able to help should contact me.
</p>
<p>2) Microsoft should contact Fedex and find out where my package is and when I will receive it. Then let me know.</p>
<p>3) Refund the money I paid for box, packaging, and expedited shipping. You have not delivered on what I paid for.</p>
<p>4) Stop offering a paid option for expedited shipping, box, and packaging. It's not right to charge for something you can't deliver</p>
<p>5) Revamp your communication processes for repairs. Update your website to tell customers to wait 24 hours after submitting a repair order before taking their console to Fedex. Send email notifications to customers once consoles have been repaired. When
 their package ships, email the tracking number so customers know when their repaired console will arrive. These are basic things, that I'm shocked and disappointed Microsoft does not do.</p>
<p>6) Start offering cross-ship again for returns. This was common practice with Xbox360 returns and should be reinstated for XboxOne if your repair process is going to be so horrible.
</p>
<p>7) Look into your problems with Fedex. Based on my conversation with the Fedex employees and a quick search on Reddit, I am definitely not not the only one who has experienced this problem. I think there may be a some kind of system issue regarding how order
 info is passed along between Microsoft and Fedex. If not, one of your two companies is messing this up.</p>
<p><strong>Closing<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry if this post sounds like I'm whining. I understand stuff happens. Electronics sometimes fail. Shipping is sometimes delayed. But overall I still feel mistreated by Microsoft. There's been a lack of basic communication/notification, and I paid additional
 money for services I'm not receiving.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this kind of problem? Is there anything else you recommend I do?

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;Knobby Foot!<br /><br />I am truly sorry to hear about the negative repair experience! I can definitely understand how frustrating that could be. &nbsp;Since your console is in transit the best way to find out an updated status on your repair shipment would be by checking with FedEx. If you would like to inquire about a refund on repair services, you will need to reach out to phone support for further assistance.<br /><br /> We certainly do appreciate your feedback and suggestions. In order to make sure that your ideas for future improvements get seen by the right folks, I recommend making a post on our&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Feedback</a>&nbsp;page. If you see that someone has posted an idea similar to yours, feel free to vote for it. Once again I am sincerely sorry to hear about the repair issue and any inconveniences this may have caused. I hope that you receive your console back swiftly so that you can get back

    <title>Xbox freezes for about 3 seconds at random during play - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox freezes for about 3 seconds at random during play</h2>
                    
<p>So I been having a few problems and I am wondering if anyone else has had them.</p>
<p>I usually play **** and when I revive people constantly (which reminds me, play your kit FFS drop ammo and health every chance you get. Fill the map with them!).</p>
<p>So when I look down to revive someone 1/2 of my screen shows the body, the other 1/2 doesn't. It acts like 2 versions of the ground, left side body is there, right side it's not. I can turn my head and it follows with the effect.</p>
<p>So I asked everyone I knew if they witnessed that, they said no. So I deleted the cache and all BF3 items except my profile. I re-installed it to the HDD, downloaded the updates, install the HD pack, etc.</p>
<p>So since then now my console freezes for about 3 seconds at random, multiple times during a game. At this time, my wireless headset also disconnects. It's like the xbox stops all wireless connections. I stop moving during those freezes. I can absolutely
 assure you it's not lag, I have my connection wired too.</p>
<p>What's weird is that the wireless headset disconnects during every freeze. Now my wireless headset always disconnects at random, sometimes multiple times in 5 minutes and I am only 5 feet away from it. It's not enclosed at all and it's horizontal. It's not
 even warm to the touch on top, warm in the back. Not hot at all.</p>
<p>My guess is my xbox is dying. It was made Oct 08, 60gb hdd. I haven't played any other games since it started, so I don't know if it's a BF3 problem or not. I have played hulu and netfix and no freezes occur.</p>
<p>My xbox will completely freeze, requiring me pulling the plug, when I hit the dashboard button when I start BF3 and it's barely loading. It used to freeze for a second but not completely.</p>

<p>The first is a glitch, I have it to. (half and half problem) </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The second, well, it seems you've now corrupted your files you've re-downloaded. All I can say is... do it again.</p>

<p>I have seen both. &nbsp;The second is what I experience most. &nbsp; What I have noticed is that the game starts before the map is done loading. &nbsp; I will freeze then a building appears then I am able to move again</p>

<p>Actually, it's been happening on Dead Island. Reach, Minecraft. I deleted everything, used a usb stick to rule on my hdd. So I was thinking it was my hardware. However, last night my brother in law's console started to do the freezing. My friends in another
 state is also experiencing the same thing with their elite. I'm not sure if they had it happen in other games too. So far the slim my brother in law has only did it once.</p>
<p>But I got a message by someone who read my post and is experiencing the same thing.</p>
<p>I can safely rule out it's not the copy of BF3. What I'm experiencing is happening on other games. It's not the HDD either and not internet related, it happens during local games. So maybe it's not hardware at all and some bug in the last dashboard update
 we received a while back. It seems to be affecting my white 60gb, slim 250gb, old elite.</p>

<p>Have you had your wireless headset on every time the freezing occurs? I read somewhere that it's a syncing problem between the 360 and the wireless headset. Every time it happens to me, I'm using the headset and the headset will cut out and come back when
 the gameplay resumes. I haven't had the chance yet to experiment using only my wired headset, but I'm going to try that out tonight. I'll let you know if I have any success. These 3 second freezes are driving me crazy!!</p>

<p>I am also getting the 3 second or so freezes during multiplayer. The game will literally freeze for a few seconds, my wireless headset will cut out, I will then hear my friends talk through the speakers on my stereo, and then the game will unfreeze and I
 will hear my mic will start working again.</p>
<p>However, I have always had issues with my mic cutting randomly with all games and just party chat then work again, and I have tried different wireless headsets and it still does the same thing. It's almost like my mic desyncs for a moment then resyncs.</p>
<p>VERY Annoying.</p>
