    <title>Achievements appear in the wrong language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zman717  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievements appear in the wrong language</h2>
                    
<p>I'm an American stationed in South Korea, playing the American version of my games on an American Xbox One. But when I started playing Halo: MCC my achievements (in the achievement app and in the game itself) are in Korean. Achievement notifications still
 respect system language. The customer service rep insightfully informed me that this is because I'm located in Korea. Clever. However, we are given the option to set our language in the system settings, and I thought this was a global setting, not to be overridden
 by physical location. I'm pretty sure this isn't the way it's supposed to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done some Googling around and found other users with the same problem. Several users reported the issue for Titanfall, and nobody had the problem with more than one game. In a live chat with a Microsoft CSR, they referred me to a recent incident and
 said that they were unable to resolve the issue. CSR also didn't admit that the problem is not intended functionality. He told me that I should leave a forum post and also a suggestion in the User Voice section, claiming that they are monitored by engineers
 in order to implement feature requests and bug fixes.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, some one in the exact same situation as your posted this issue, to which I responded here:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/t/1865083.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1865083.aspx</a> </p>
<p>It's pretty much exactly as you've said, the achievement language is picked up from your region's IP, so maybe it will rectify once you're back in America?
</p>
<p>As the Xbox rep said, you can post your feedback at the link or support someone with the same idea:

<p>So, I'm having the same issue. Got the exact same run around from MS customer support. I've played plenty of other games while here in Korea. All of my achievements are in english EXCEPT for the MCC. I ran my box through a dedicated VPN with an American
 IP address and the achievement still popped in Korean. This is kind of ridiculous as it's NA Xbox, NA Language Setting, NA (not korean) copy of the game.

<p>Yeah, it definitely is a weird one, but I don't think you'll get a fix like clearing cache and re-downloading profile to fix, as I understand from reading all the threads, this is only something the engineers can add to a future update.</p>
<p>Post at the user voice link, I'd guarantee there is already a suggestion about this though, but you can still vote for that suggestion.</p>

<p>I have the same problem in Hong Kong except English is one of the supported languages here so it should be able to be English as well as Chinese. &nbsp;For me, Halo MCC and Forza Horizon 2 are both in Chinese despite all my language settings being English. &nbsp;All
 other achievements are in English. &nbsp;I have hope this is fixable though as after the June or July update, all my Titanfall achievements went from English to Chinese. &nbsp;After the September update they changed back to English. &nbsp;This means it IS fixable, but it
 seems to be game specific.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it was a TITANFALL patch or the September update that fixed the language mismatch for titanfall achievements because it didn't play for a while. &nbsp;I noticed it was fixed shortly after the September xbox system update though. &nbsp;But honestly
 it could have been either. &nbsp;It does seem to be game specific though as all my games have english achievemnets except Halo MCC and Forza horizon 2 which are in Chinese. &nbsp;There are a few other Wierd language mismatches though. &nbsp;The title of Rayman legends in
 the achievement screen is in Chinese but the actual achievements are in English, the challenges for max curse of brotherhood are in Chinese but the achievemnets are in English. &nbsp;It's all very irritating, because I'm sure it would be easy to fix. &nbsp;I guess there
 just aren't enough people affected to make Microsoft see it as a priority.</p>

<h2>            Newest Windows 8.1 Update Causing Black Screen on Startup</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hello, so this morning I got the latest update for my windows 8.1 machine, and now it is getting a black screen during startup. It does the
 acer startup screen with the logo, and then proceeds to get stuck on a black screen. I can get into the recovery menu but when I tried to enter safe mode, it got hung up trying to log in (infinitely loading). I have also already tried refreshing, and a hard
 reset. Please help!</span>

            <p>I am also experiencing the black screen problem for the past two days. &nbsp;When turning on my ASUS laptop, I get the ASUS screen with rotating dots and then a blank black screen. &nbsp;My only option is to turn off the laptop with the power button. &nbsp;There are no
 hardware devices attached, no chance to anything from within Windows, no results from refresh or reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a recovery USB drive when I upgraded from W8 to 8.1 but I doesn't help.</p>
<p>1. Refresh your PC doesn't refresh the PC. &nbsp;It takes a few HOURS (for a 500GB hard drive) and then says "There was a problem refreshing your PC. &nbsp;No changes were made."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Reset your PC doesn't fix the problem either, hanging at 98% for over 8 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. My Advanced Options does not give stArtup Options to get to Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I setup W8.1 to create restore points back when I upgraded almost a year ago, but System Restore says that none have been created. &nbsp;WTH??</p>

            <p>Hello Loony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run check disk from Windows recovery environment to check and fix any bad sectors in the hard drive which may be causing the issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these instructions to get to the Windows recovery environment. You may need to connect
</p>
<p>a keyboard to complete the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>• If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>",
 do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the Windows recovery environment, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>command prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check disk may take some time to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important Notes: <br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may create Windows 8.1 installation media using the following article:<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />

</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

<p>I am very confused now.&nbsp; I am able to boot into the Windows Recovery Environment using the USB flash drive that I created right after upgrading to 8.1, but it just goes in an endless loop within the recovery environment and doesn't get me into Windows.&nbsp;
 I ran "Startup Repair" last night, and it took several hours to run and then give me the message that it could not repair anything.&nbsp; I went into the command prompt, and it will not let me run chkdsk on anything.&nbsp; It switched to the c: (where Windows is supposed
 to be located on this computer), and it says it can't run chkdsk because the drive is in use and must be unmounted first (asking if I want to unmount it).&nbsp; I did not unmount it and exited since I did not know what that would do.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8 came preinstalled with no disks, and the 8.1 upgrade was through the Windows Store, so no installation media.&nbsp; I created a recovery drive after the upgrade, but now that recovery drive doesn't do the job???&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I turned off the computer, removed the USB flash drive and tried to start the computer, and now after the startup repair, all it does is boot into the UEFI Firmware Utility.&nbsp;
<em>I exited without making any changes,</em> but noted that there is only one boot option (Windows Boot Manager).&nbsp; Repeatedly powering off the laptop with the power button finally got me to a blue screen saying I need to access the repair tools with an error
 of 0xc0000185. It says to press ESC to get to the UEFI Firmware Utility, which brings me right back to where I am now.&nbsp;
<strong>It did not do this before Startup Repair failed, so what did it do, and how to I get back to the Repair Environment??</strong>&nbsp; I can't even run chkdsk on the hard drive.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ran chkdsk on the recovery USB, and it found "\temp\CNet updates\asc-setup.exe first allocation unit is not valid.&nbsp; The entry will be truncated."&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>"Bad links in lost chain at cluster 1070022 corrected."<br />
</p>
<p>"Windows has made corrections to the file system"<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, this is unrelated to the bootmgr.efi file or anything to do with booting.&nbsp; Why would that prevent the USB recovery drive from doing its job?&nbsp; I can't even get into Safe Mode.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned that check disk does not run and startup repair also does not work, I would suggest you to use following steps to
<strong>repair or rebuild boot configuration data(BCD)</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. If you are able to access command prompt in Windows recovery environment, please type the following commands one by one in the command prompt and press Enter after each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BOOTREC /FIXMBR</strong><br />
<strong>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT</strong><br />
<strong>BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b. You may receive a message about successful execution of the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>WTH???&nbsp; I went to the Microsoft site to burn an installation disc of 8.1 and made a DVD with the ISO and also a USB, and I am able to get to a command prompt, but it is on the X: drive instead of the C: drive.&nbsp; I switched to the C: drive and executed those
 commands and got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Successfully scanned Windows installations.</p>
<p>Total identified Windows installations: 0</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How in the world does it find 0 installations of the OS that came preinstalled on this laptop???&nbsp; How does a laptop completely lose an OS overnight (while off?!?!?) that was preinstalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm ready to completely reinstall the OS, and hedging my bets, I called ASUS since ASUS did not provide an installation disc or product key with the computer; when I called them they said that the installation disc I burned should work "if it is a legitimate
 copy of Windows 8.1" (burned it from Microsoft, so yes) and that the product key is "embedded in the motherboard."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even using the DVD that I burned from MS, I am unable to get to Safe Mode.&nbsp; Am I really at the stage of having to completely reinstall the OS?

<p>Did what he suggested.&nbsp; Still says no OS found.&nbsp; I even did some other things in the thread and still no OS found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running chkdsk again now that I've change some things, but I forgot to put the /r parameter, so it won't fix anything this time around, but it has already given me some errors:</p>

            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

    <title>Battery Life &#43; Sleep Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dholmes77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery Life &#43; Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased the new Surface Book i7, converting from the Apple Life. Previously I had a couple of Mac Book Pros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the features I was excited about was the advertised battery life of 12-16 hours. However, as soon as open the unit after a full charge and start using outlook, excel and web browser, it states that it has only 3 - 4 hours of batter life. How do I
 reconcile this to the advertised 12 - 16?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, after having the laptop stored in a case (i.e. closed and I assume in sleep mode) I open it up and the batter is dead.. Why is that? WIth my Macbook Pro's they would go into whatever hibernation mode, etc., and it would come out with little
 to not battery used..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried chatting with a support person, but could tell that was going to take 8 hours to get anywhere and shut that down. Also I ordered surface book from the Microsoft store within 4 hours of its announcement. Web-site indicated it would ship on release
 date. We waited three weeks. Talked to two support people one who said it would for sure ship in on a certain date in December... Became frustrated, order it from Best Buy, came before I even got a ship notification from Microsoft... Cancelled micrsoft order....
 By comparison, Apple would always give you a ship date that was accurate and could update you on the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit if extra venting, but MS seems to have a LONG way to go if it really wants to compete in the consumer products area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on the battery life issue would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, dholmes77</p>

            <p>Your battery life definitely seems like it is a problem. &nbsp;Have you tried looking at Task Manager to see what's running at the time? &nbsp;It will tell you if there is something that is keeping the processor busy all of the time. &nbsp;You can access it by pressing
 CTRL-SHIFT-ESC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing to consider is your screen brightness. &nbsp;It has a significant impact on battery life, so keep it as low as you are able to while on battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sleep/hibernate problems have been ongoing since the original SB was delivered. &nbsp;It seems that some people have no problems with sleep/hibernate, while others seem to have nothing but problems. &nbsp;I'm in the latter group where my SB still doesn't sleep/hibernate
 reliably. &nbsp;After too many months of this, I have returned to a MacBook Pro and have had no further issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have all updates installed and then verify that they installed successfully. &nbsp;This will give you the best chance of having a good experience.</p>

<h2>            xxcopy with umc doesn&#39;t work on Windows 7, but does on windows xp ... any ideas&#63;</h2>
                    We can run&nbsp; the XXCOPY command with UNCs (\\computer\share\ name) for the source and/or destination on WinXP, but get errors when we try them on Win7. Anyone have any ideas as to what the problem might be on Win7? We run them both in administrator cmd
 windows (aka dos box).&nbsp; The command:&nbsp; <br />

<br />
works fine on WinXP,&nbsp; but gives error "Invalid destination directory (\\NAS-01\Common\)" on Win7.<br />
<br />
The command:&nbsp; <br />

<br />
works fine on WinXP, but gives error "Invalid source directory (\\NAS-02\bu\Gecko\History\)" on Wiin7<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue what is causing these errors on Win7 (SP3) but not on Win XP (SP1) ?&nbsp; The version of XXCOPY is 3.11.5 on both systems, but I also tried version 3.11.6 on Win7 with the same result.<br />

            Found the answer(s) on the XXCOPY Yahoo forum from a nice gentleman named Bonno.<br />
<br />
Disabling homegroup solved most of the problems ... and using the NETUSE command solved the rest.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can tell me why these work? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />

Bonno wrote:&nbsp; "If a Windows7 machine is in a homegroup I have notice some weird stuff for which<br />

I have been able to get things working sometimes with just a simple:<br />

<h2>            win 10 video thumbnails don&#39;t show</h2>
                    I have a windows 10 laptop which does show the video thumbnails, but my new windows 10 desktop does not. I've tried all the solutions that show up in searches. I've tried file explorer setting on both a folder and system level. I upgrade to win 10 pro
 (my laptop runs 10 pro) to see if that worked, but it didn't. I tried the user policy editor setting on viewing icons not thumbnails, but that didn't work. What else is there?

            FYI-I finally found the solution. I ran across reference to some people not being able to see thumbnails for some file types, such as FLV, so as an experiment I rendered a video to .wmv and it showed up in Explorer as a thumbnail. I also found a reference
 to the file type associations. Checking on the associations showed that .mpg files go to Media player, but .wmv files go to Movies and TV, so I changed .mpg files to Movies &amp; TV and tried to play it. The player came up and said I didn't have the right codec,
 but I could download one from the Microsoft store. Once that was installed the thumbnails appeared as before.

<h2>            Failed to properly assess the disk</h2>
                    So while rating my computer with win7 x64 rtm edition, I got this error at the end.<br />
<br />
Any one knows how to fix this?<br />
<br />
By the way, i don't want to reinstall my system for many big software (like VS2008) also needs reinstall.<br />
<br />
Thanks

    <title>Windows 8 Windows not responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morepie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Windows not responding</h2>
                    First off, I was using my computer when suddenly, the computer screen froze. Nothing responded when i click on each icon and Ctrl+alt+delete didn't work at all. So i force shutdown my computer. Now, whenever i boot up my computer and sign into my user,
 it would just freeze and take 10 minutes to load the start screen, if i was lucky. Usually, it would just be stuck frozen until i force shutdown the computer. If it worked, the desktop screen would take even longer to load. Then everything I would do wouldn't
 even work, even though i click on the icons. Then it would become frozen. If I don't force close the computer, it would soon restart on its own and start the whole frozen cycle all over again. I prefer not to do a system recovery because I have important documents
 and programs i need inside. I would also might see a message saying that Windows has encountered an Error and list the problem as Memory_Management<br />

<strong>Viewer</strong>. <br />
b) This will bring up the <strong>Event Viewer box</strong>. Click to open the event viewer.
<br />
c) In the left pane, expand out <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Logs</strong>. <br />
d) Click on <strong>Application</strong> <strong>log</strong>. Highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down. Most of your event will be Information. You may see
<strong>Yellow Warnings </strong>or <strong>Red Errors.</strong> If you see a red error, you can double click on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document.</p>

<h2>            Service info unavailable.</h2>
                    
<p>So I get on and set up my wireless network and it connects and says everything's good. Well I look and it says my NAT is open so that's good but below that it says "service info is unavailable" but I don't think live is down cause it just connected and everything
 was good and I accidentally turned it off because of the stupid touch screen button. Now I'm *** and it won't connect. I tested the network and multi-player connection both say they are fine, but when I go to detailed status it says I need Internet connection.
 This seems to be the problem people were having back in 2014 and I've tried clearing the cache hard resetting and unplugging my router etc.... has anybody figured out a fix to this yet.</p>

 etc.) I know it's not my internet because I'm on my phone using my wifi to type this out.

            I could run Sudoku just fine so that means the connection to XBox and the Sudoku gamer service are operational. I suspect that the service that supplies the data to the app is down hence the option to play offline. If that is true, then it is a matter
 of waiting until the Mahjong service is up again.

    <title>New Skype layout - what do these things &#40;icons, placement&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barrybgp  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype layout - what do these things &#40;icons, placement&#41; mean&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My question is about the contact's avatar and its placement all around the interface.&nbsp; In the image below, you can see the contact's avatar appears at the lower right corner of the chat box (red arrow #1).&nbsp; Normally when the avatar appears here, it means
 the contact has seen something I've sent (like a read receipt).&nbsp; But in this image you can see I have sent nothing, yet the contact's avatar has popped-up there to indicate what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, the green dot (indicating the contact is online) has a white hole in it (red arrow #2).&nbsp; What's the meaning of this?&nbsp; Is the contact online or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4772ccb-cf86-49bf-9301-11201e5da809?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4772ccb-cf86-49bf-9301-11201e5da809?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then when I start chatting with this contact, her avatar stays on top of my messages (below, red arrow #3).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6d3ac6c-212c-4d36-80f0-b04b7a5101f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6d3ac6c-212c-4d36-80f0-b04b7a5101f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I looked at another contact, whom I had chatted with, his avatar appears BELOW the message I've just sent!&nbsp; (below, red arrow #4)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4968cd45-5980-46aa-b0c9-3ba6a33d6066?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4968cd45-5980-46aa-b0c9-3ba6a33d6066?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does the contact's avatar sometimes appear on the right <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
above</span> my message, sometimes <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">below</span> my message, and sometimes it appears without me sending any message at all??</p>

<p>How wonderful everyone feels spending time figuring out these childish screens. May be ask a 5 year old, they may get it, we tend to THINK too much about productivity...</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/796773f2-24e7-4b22-a8e1-3b43667ec15c" title="BarryBGP">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me try and explain the icons, #1 icon is indicating the read receipt. If no messages has been sent to the contact, their avatar would start at the bottom. #2 icon is what we call "Recently active" , this means that the contact you are chatting with hasn't
 been active for more than&nbsp;3 minutes. It will change to the "Away" status if the contact is inactive for more than an hour. #3 icon is the read receipt, as aforementioned, the contact haven't read yet your messages so her avatar would be on the top of the messages
 you sent. #4 icon means that the contact has read the message you sent. </p>

<p>speaking on this Mister Fitzer so if I buy a xbox from a retailor it break I take it back to said retailor they fix it ;it gets &nbsp;error code with this new update and we are told that Support wont help cause a 3rd party fixed it? &nbsp;But the people Who fixed
 it was the retalior i bought it from not some guy down the street yet there a 3rd unauthorized party? yes i got this boxed it was used seal unbroken from Game Source they been here for years the dvd drive went out on it it was not under warrenty anymore i
 told game source they said no problem bring it in will fix it right up so they did free of charge no problems for years after but now i'm not allowed to use xbox live because i let the retail chain i got the defaulty xbox from fix it like they asked? I know
 what you gonna say but i fig i'd just throw that out there. Remeber just because it Legal for microsoft to do this dosent make it right Heck it's LEGAL to marry your first cousin in Alabama but that dont make it right!</p>

<p>Depending on when the console was bought, exchanging it with the retailer for another new console would be the preferred method. If the retailer won''t honor an exchange, then having an authorized repair is recommended for staying in accordance with the
 ToU.</p>

<h2>            Calendar events created but not appearing in Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create Calendar events for 2016. As of today Oct6, any event I create with a date after Mar21 briefly appears in the Calendar and then disappears. The event has been created because I can see it from my Google Calendar but it is not displayed
 in the Windows 10 Calendar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find no setting which limits how far ahead events are displayed and anyway, 167 days would seem an odd value to set! My calendar does display holidays and birthdays correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try again in a couple of days to see whether I can see events for say Mar22 or Mar23.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a few others have reported something like this but the issue was never answered.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</div>
<div><br />
We understand that the Calendar events disappear from the Calendar apps.</div>
<div><br />
This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows app files or settings. Try the following methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If the issue still persist, I would suggest that you remove the&nbsp;Google account, add it again&nbsp;to&nbsp;the calendar app and check if it works.</p>
<p>

            <p>Ran the troubleshooter - no issues found. Removed and re-added my Google account - same issue&nbsp;as before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days on from originally&nbsp;reporting this issue, I can now see events in&nbsp;my calendar&nbsp;dated up to Mar23, nothing afterwards, except (I just noticed) repeating calendar events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems Calendar is hiding (or can't see) events &gt; 167 days into the future.</p>

    <title>Windows 10, Cortana Weather in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10, Cortana Weather in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community, I had this issue and I found solutions that I would like to share with you. On Windows 10, Cortana gives you temperature in Fahrenheit without checking your Regional Settings or Location. A quick solution is to ask:
<em><strong>What’s the weather like in Celsius?</strong></em> or just <em><strong>Weather in Celsius?
</strong></em>or <em><strong>Weather in Kelvin?&nbsp;</strong></em>Real solution is to configure it: Start
<strong>Cortana -&gt; Notebook -&gt; Weather -&gt; Units</strong> - Set Celsius. Below are images of settings and the result. Enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Thanks for this tip. Incidentally, before I could select a unit the first time, I had to first "Add"&nbsp;one from
<strong>Cortana &gt; Notebook &gt; Weather &gt; Units</strong>. Once I did, the Units setting appears as you've illustrated.<br />
<br />
Although "adding" a unit was required,&nbsp;the behavior was really just a toggle between Celsius/Fahrenheit, which is how it subsequently appears. I'd say the "Add"&nbsp;bit&nbsp;was just a waste of code.</div>

            I changed it to Celcius, but I still get results in Farenheit. I am confused...

            <p>Thanks for your remedies. In the event it still won't give either today temp in Celsius, or give tomorrows forecast. The MS Weather APp works fine, but not in Cortana. Tried turning the Cortana weather component off but it doesn't help. It still gives a
 today weather in Cortana. Still wrong.. Very annoying hey?</p>

<p>No, cortan opens a browser and use bing to search for that instead. Cortan is very very stupid. Instead of just admitting that it does not understand like siri does, it opens a browser every time it does not understand.</p>

            Hi JDJones89 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall

<br />
<br />Please report back me the results so that I can advise further steps if your problem is not solved.

<h2>            Fast startup not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently updated to Windows 10 version 1803 (17134.81), and I've noticed something about the bootup time of my PC.</p>
<p>It takes minutes before I can able to type into login screen, and I looked on my Task Manager &gt; Performance (CPU) that the Up time resets everytime I turned on my PC. Fast startup option is enabled on the Control Panel but it seems that it does not work.</p>

<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you don't see any difference....
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac#comment-658339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

<p>I already resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried DISM and System File Checker commands in Command Prompts but no corrupted files detected. The problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did is to disable the Hibernate option through Command Prompt:&nbsp;<strong>powercfg.exe -h off</strong>, so that the hiberfil.sys will be deleted automatically in the C: drive. After the file was deleted, I tried to enable again the Hibernate option to
 re-create the hiberfil.sys file, but fast startup still doesn't work. I'm almost losing options to fix the problems and then when I try the Boot-time defrag offered by IObit's Smart Defrag for the first time, it fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the hiberfil.sys file is corrupted and needs to be re-created.</p>

    <title>Upgrade issue from Windows XP to Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhijitchoudhury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade issue from Windows XP to Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently tried upgrading my Dell laptop from Windows XP to Windows 8 and accordingly downloaded the upgrade assistant which checked my system and then asked me to placed the order for the upgrade. I then bought the updgrade license and the upgrade assistant
 then installed the Windows 8 Operating System after downloading,copying the files and installing the&nbsp;OS it then re-booted my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my laptop re-started it then came with an error that </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.</p>
<p>2. Choose your language settings, and then clikc "Next".</p>
<p>3. Click "Repair your computer".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Status: 0xc0000260</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Info: This operating system uses the Physical Address Extension feature to support systems with more than 4GB of RAM. You'll need to use a PC with a compatible processor to run the operating system."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then re-strated the laptop using the Windows upgrade DVD which I dowloaded from your site but I still get the same error message.</p>
<p>My question is if my laptop is not compatible to upgrade Windows 8 OS the upgrade assistant which checked my laptop should have have informed me that I cannot download and install Windows 8 rather it allowed me to buy the upgrade software and now the license
 is of no use to me. If I need to upgrade my latop to install Windows 8 I would rathr buy a new laptop with Windows 8 license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please refund me the money which I bought for the upgrade software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>Abhijit</p>

            So you downloaded and ran the upgrade assistant which checks your PC for compatibility?
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>and more information about the CPU Requirements:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>It is quite possible that your PC does meet the requirements. &nbsp;But due to a limitation put on your specific model by the manufacturer, that you cant install Windows 8. &nbsp;This is not something that Windows can determine as it requires the user to check their
 BIOS, which cant be done within Windows or by Windows, to make sure that PAE, NX and SSE2 are enabled for the CPU.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So you will have to check your BIOS yourself to make sure that those items are enabled. &nbsp;Again something that the Upgrade Assistant CANT do. &nbsp;The BIOS loads before Windows and Windows has no access to it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can request a refund, but before you state that this is a Microsoft problem cause they didnt inform you fullly first, I would check your BIOS to make sure that your C Manufacturer didnt hamper your laptop by disabling these features of your CPU first.
 &nbsp;That is something that is out of Microsoft's control and they cant be held accountable for something Dell did.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Request your refund:</div>

<h2>            Nausea and migraine from looking at the surface pro Screen after 10 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this with his surface pro. I tried 2 of them and both have this issue. I cannot stare more than couple of minutes at the screen before motion sickness sets in.</p>
<p>I do not have this issue with my thinkpad or Dell xps2720.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be the PWM of the backlight ?</p>
<p>I did have this issue with a macbook a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you all.</p>

            <p>As far as I know, nobody has mentioned that particular problem.&nbsp; The Pro has been out for a little over two years now and nobody has mentioned that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could have a problem with the background picture in relation to the icons.&nbsp; Some pictures give a sense of depth that could cause something like that.&nbsp; That was an issue with the iPhone 5 series when they came out with iOS 7.&nbsp; Apple turned to the 'flat'
 look like what Microsoft did and have a background that has a 3D depth perspective to it.&nbsp; That caused some people to get nausea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That plus a smaller screen compared to your other computers could be what is causing that.&nbsp; Try changing the background picture to something else.</p>

            <p>Thanks James,</p>
<p>Will try that, Also on my phones which all have crisper screens, i dont have this issue.</p>
<p>It might be that I am sensitive to the surface pro particular refresh rate of the backlight. &nbsp;this has been discussed thoroughly here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1677617?start=0&amp;tstart=0</p>
<p>

            <p>By any chance, do you have a problem with the color red?&nbsp; Also the refresh rate on the tablets are 60 cycles and other computers it is 75 or 80.&nbsp; In the past, did you ever have a problem watching TV that had the old CRT picture tube or computer monitors
 that had the CRT type display?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did, you&nbsp;need to see a doctor!&nbsp; That is not a joke!!!!</p>

            <p>I had my eyes checked about 4 month ago. But yes during CRT times I did have issues other did not have (only high quality refresh rate monitors were fine) &nbsp;I have slight (0.5 and 0.25) hypermetropia and astigmatism.</p>
<p>It could be the ultra sharp font on the surface in addition to the flicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested it today, after increasing brightness to max, the problems are much less. flicker goes away.</p>
<p>I increased text to 200% on desktop. I wish I could increase the size in the metro interface.</p>

            <p>You can try sunglasses which may offset some of the issues.&nbsp; An optometrist may be able to help out by prescribing glasses with a special coating.&nbsp; It is the same type of coating used in rifle scopes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer and TV screens that have a refresh rate of 60 cycles is the same as 60 frames per second and human eyes also have the same refresh rate (60 frames per second).&nbsp; If you have a regular desktop monitor or TV that are LCD are mostly now 75 to 85 fps
 which eliminates that.&nbsp; Tablet computers of all types generally use 60 fps because of their capabilities and some people have a problem with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you, I would not recommend a tablet.&nbsp; The screen is just too small and the refresh rate could be the cause of your problem.&nbsp; You can ask your doctor about that, that person is the only one qualified to give you a real answer on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you stick with a laptop, you should have no problem.&nbsp; They may be bulkier to lug around but in the long run, probably better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend a machine with a screen size of no less than 15.6".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you can try sunglasses and see if you have any improvement.&nbsp; As for the screen resolution, the modifications that you can do don't work on these tablets.&nbsp; They are supposed to but don't.&nbsp; Microsoft did something with the video sub-system on these tablets
 where they don't function in the same manner as a regular PC does.&nbsp; Here on the forum, people have had issues in executing programs that should have had no problem but the system won't run them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the screen refresh rate, that cannot be changed.</p>

<p>While it does make sense that smaller screen&nbsp;add&nbsp;strain on my eyes. I do not have this problem on ipad 2 or mini or Samsung s4. My Lcd monitor is a 60 Hz.</p>

            <p>Well, if you have experience with screens smaller than the tablet and they are running at 60 Hz, then the issue will probably be the combination of background picture and the flat style of the tiles.&nbsp; For some reason, you are focused on those with that small
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Retina displays on the newer iPads are pretty good.&nbsp; I have the iPod 5 and the iPad Air and with iOS 7, looks like Microsoft sneaked a crew into Apple and they put something in the water because the system is "flat".&nbsp; The background, however, is what
 they call "Parallex" (I think that is how you spell it) that has a 3D effect.&nbsp; That was causing issues with some people on the iPhones.</p>

            <p>It seems you were right.</p>
<p>It was a combination of the screen size, ultra fin resolution screen, scaling , reflective coating and the parallax effect of the metro interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test1: tested different tables in the shop, I get no issue with tablets that have resolution 720p and less
</p>
<p>anything higher start making me dizzy. ( while the text is clearer I have to focus more).</p>
<p>On a phone the effect is different be cause the size is much smaller and the font smoothing is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test2: Used the table to watch a movie, no problem whatsoever, that eliminates the refresh rate issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test3: raised the resolution to 13**by 7** and in the desktop environment it was fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to keep it and limit usage of the metro interface until the size of text can be further bumped.</p>
<p>+ going to&nbsp;go get my eyes checked&nbsp;and will get back at doing some eye exercises for a slight&nbsp;lazy eye.</p>
<p>

            You can go to Microsoft's online store and get the HDMI video adapter and hook it up to a TV or monitor and use it like a desktop.&nbsp; A bigger screen will be a little better.<br />

<h2>            Dual monitor Problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    I have two monitors. After I upgraded to windows 10 initially there was no problem. The second day (today when I write this) When I opened my pc the first thing I noticed was that my dual background was gone. I tried to change it but whenever I selected
 the Dual monitor theme it didn't work and it used just one image. I tried to select the background individually for each monitor but it didn't work because only monitor 2 apeared. Later that day when I plugged in my graphical tablet my cursor movements were
 odd so I checked the settings. Altough there was only one monitor selected (monitor 2) the active surface had both monitors selected. When I was selecting the smaller monitor (monitor 1) it had no problem detecting it corectly. When I selected the second monitor
 again had the same problem it was selecting both monitors. I tried to unplug the monitor and the tablet but no diference. Also resterted the computer and the same problem. When I connected the tablet again I had the same probl
