    <title>Windows won&#39;t let go of empty folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bilglas1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows won&#39;t let go of empty folder</h2>
                    <p>Something in Windows has bugged me for as far back as I can remember. Example: Folder on Desktop with some JPGs in it. Open the photos in Photoshop, edit them, resave. CLOSE Photoshop. But when I try to MOVE that folder off the Desktop, I can't — "The action
 can't be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program." Well, no it ISN'T. Even if I'm able to MOVE the photos into a different folder somewhere, I can't delete the EMPTY folder that's still on the Desktop ... until after I reboot.
 (There are no hidden or system files in that folder; I checked.) Is this "just the way it is"? And if it IS just the way it is, why can't Windows at least tell me WHICH program isn't letting go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't exclusive to photos. It could be an edited DOC file, after closing Word. Whatever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the only person who ever uses this computer, and I've got Administrator privileges throughout ... as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I found a thread similar to this regarding Windows 7. Best solution there involved a complex Command Prompt hack. Maybe that would ALSO work with Win 10, too ... but it just amazes me that this would even be necessary! Shouldn't be that difficult.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grateful for anyone's thoughts..... thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Bilglas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It is possible that after closing a program it might take a longer due to other program is conflicting. I suggest you to go to the task manager after closing the program and check which program are the conflicting with the issue.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>
task manager. </strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the program and try <strong>end task</strong> the other program.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This issue also might occur due to the improper maintenance. I suggest you to run maintenance troubleshooter and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Click on <strong>Security and maintenance</strong>, Under <strong>
Maintenance</strong> click on <strong>start Maintenance.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in safe mode and perform clean boot.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also visit the below link on how to boot in safe mode. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer with only basic service and functionality. If an existing problem doesn’t reappear when you start windows in safe mode,
 you can eliminate the defaults settings and basic device drivers as possible cause</span></p>

            <p>None of those made any difference, but thanks. Method 1 ... tasks HAD ended, so that wasn't the problem. Method 2 ... system does an auto-maintenance every 24 hours, so that wasn't the problem. And, since the problem I've described gets "unstuck" when I
 reboot normally, rebooting in Safe Mode won't prove anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation I describe has essentially been the way Windows has been, as long as I can remember ... Windows 7, Vista, NT, 2000, 95 ... I'm just surprised that it's STILL a problem in Win10. But it is.........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, though.</p>

            <p>Thank you. You said that a clean boot would help me determine what program(s) were causing the problem. But even a REGULAR boot makes the problem go away. So whether I do a regular boot or a clean boot, once Windows is open again, the problem is ALREADY
 gone, so the process by which I determine what program is causing the problem won't be necessary, because the problem is already gone. At least, that's what seems logical to me......</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, I won't be able to try this until it happens again. When it DOES happen again, I'll give the clean boot a try, just to see if it tells me something unexpected. Worth a try......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of logic: If that folder contains two JPG files, for example, and if I open those two files in Photoshop, let's say, and then I CLOSE Photoshop ... &nbsp;make sure (in Task Manager) that it really IS closed ... and make sure that folder isn't open in
 File Explorer, somewhere ..... then what program COULD be causing the problem OTHER than Photoshop? Anyway, this is just a rhetorical question. Next time this happens, I'll give your suggestion a try, and maybe the answer will become evident.</p>
<p>

            <p>I think I have a fix for this</p>
<p>Go to Windows Explorer. Under "View" on the Ribbon, "Options" then "View" Then either turn On or Off&nbsp; "Launch folder windows in a seperate process" depending which is set at originally. I hope this fixes you problem as it has for me.</p>

            <p>Hi jq85,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. As per the description provided the firewalls rules that were pre-defined is missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps and check:</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>: Run SFC scan on the computer to make sure system files are intact:</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></b></a><b><span>
</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Try to&nbsp;restore Windows Firewall default settings using the command prompt in Administrator mode.&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, type <strong>cmd.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Right click on <strong>cmd </strong>and select "Run as administrator".</span></p>
<p><span>( If this method prompts to enter the administrator password, enter the password and then click ok.)</span></p>
<p>c. Type this command in the command prompt and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh firewall reset</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. If you have further questions feel free to reply and we would be glad to assist.</span></p>

            I clicked 'Me too' thinking it would add me as having the same problem, but I think it interpreted me as saying my problem is solved. &nbsp;It isn't.
<div><br />
<div>Been through all the above and got exactly the same as jq85.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Error message importing from a working W7 PC is "Policy import failed. &nbsp;Error: Access is denied &nbsp;Code: 5"</div>

            <p>Having the same issue in my pc (Windows 7 x64).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I found so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- Open "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security" window.</p>
<p>1.1- Select "Inbound Rules" on the left.</p>
<p>1.2- Select "New Rule..." action on the right.</p>
<p>1.3- In the "New Inbound Rule Wizard", the Predefined option is grey out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- Select "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on Local Computer".</p>
<p>2.1- Select "Restore Default Policy" on the right.</p>
<p>2,2- "Could not restore the default policy. Error : 3".</p>
<p>2.3- Found nothing in the events logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3- Select "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on Local Computer".</p>
<p>3.1- Select "Import Policy" on the right.</p>
<p>3.2- Opening a .wfw file from a working windows 7 pc.</p>
<p>3.3- "Policy import failed. Error : Access is denied. Code : 5".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- Cleaned pc with different tools:</p>
<p>4.1- Cleaned pc with "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware".</p>
<p>4.2- Cleaned pc with "Combofix".</p>
<p>4.3- Cleaned pc with "Eset Online Scanner".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5- When restarting the pc, the icon for "Microsoft Security Essential" in not showed in the icon tray.</p>
<p>5.1- "Startup" tab of "Msconfig" is showing the following command "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client\msseces.exe" -hide -runkey". Need to start it in startup menu to make it appeared in process list and icon tray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6- Looked permissions in regedit but found nothing unsual for keys containing "Firewall".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7- Compared all the "Services" with another Windows 7 pc. No difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8- Also look the local group policy (gpedit.msc) for this policy: "<span>Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\</span><br />
<span>System Cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" = Disabled. Found this in another thread. But not working for me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>9- Also tried this command (running as administrator) without success: "C:\Windows\system32&gt;netsh advfirewall reset".</span></p>
<p><span>9.1- Returned error: "An unrecoverable Windows Firewall error (0x3) occurred."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>10-&nbsp;Created a new admin user and tried to turn on network discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;No luck.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>11-&nbsp;The only way I'm able to turn on network discovery is to turn off Windows Firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once done, Network discovery is turned on&nbsp;automatically.&nbsp; Also just one&nbsp;inbound rule is automatically added: "Core&nbsp;Networking - Teredo (ICMPv6-In).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>12- Also used the "System File Checker" command "sfc /scannow"&nbsp;to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reported that some system files were corrupted.&nbsp; It said that it was unable to repair some of those files and to check c:\windows\logs\CBS\CBS.log
 for details.&nbsp; When I look into that file, there is a bunch of very long technical-looking messages, and no clear indication of just which files were repaired successfully and which files were not repaired.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>13- All "Windows Updates" are installed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>14- Also done a "System Restore" but the older "Restore Point" was after I encountered this problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>15-&nbsp;Done a clean boot.&nbsp; Did nothing.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>16- Exported the "</span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\SharedAccess" registries from a working Windows 7 then imported on the failing Windows 7 =<span>&nbsp;</span><b>&nbsp;PARTLY SUCCESSFUL!</b>&nbsp;Now able to communicate with other computers
 on the local network. &nbsp;The "Homegroup" is working normally. &nbsp;Network discovery is activated. &nbsp;Firewall is ON. &nbsp;But... there's still issues not fixed. &nbsp;Points 2 and 3 above are still there. &nbsp;Sounds like some permissions not set as it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Perfect Robert!&nbsp;Many thanks.<br />
<br />
This worked on my W8 Enterprise.<br />
<br />
But, I don't understand what caused the registry fault after many months of correct work.
<br />
Any idea about it?<br />

Does this key exist in your system?
<div><br />
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\SharedAccess\Defaults\FirewallPolicy\FirewallRules</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's where the default rules are stored. If this key is missing you get the symptoms as in (2)</div>

    <title>Saving Desktop Shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saving Desktop Shortcuts</h2>
                    How do you save these before converting from Vista to Win 7? Can I place these all in one folder and drag to Documents?
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Another thing to consider, is that if you are doing a clean install, you will have to re-intall your programs so you may need new shortcuts anyway because the new installations may install in different paths than the old installations did in Vista (in effect,
 the shortcuts may not work and that also applies to the system shortcuts which you shouldn't include but if you do, make sure you know which are the new and which are the old when you delete the duplicates because I don't think the old ones will work correctly).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, if you still want to do it, you can create a folder in Documents called "Old Desktop" then go to your desktop and click on the icon in the upper left corner holding down the Shift Key and still holding down the shift key click on the icon in
 the lower right hand corner and that should select all the icons at once.&nbsp; Then right click and click on Copy.&nbsp; Then go to the folder you made in Documents and click on an open space and right click and click paste and all the shortcuts and files and folders
 and whatever was there will be moved to that new folder.&nbsp; Then if/when you need to backup your system (probably a good idea even if just doing an upgrade just to be on the safe side), backing up Documents will also backup this folder.</p>
<p>Also, what Ken said is correct - if you do it as an upgrade the data, programs, and settings will be preserved and this won't be necessary as your current desktop will still be there after&nbsp;the upgrade (though some icons may not work because of compatibility
 or other issues - but for the most part it will work fine and you will be able to delete that folder in Documents if you bothered).&nbsp; Keep in mind we're talking about an Official Upgrade (the mere fact that you are going from Vista to Windows7 doesn't always
 mean it is an official upgrade - there are some situations where a clean install is required because of the versions involved).&nbsp; But you should know soon enough as it will either present you with an active upgrade button or it will have no button or the button
 will be greyed out and inactive meaning it can't be done that way.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Yes, if you do a clean installation, saving the shortcuts is no help.<br />
You will also have to reinstall all your programs, and generate new<br />
shortcuts for them.</p>
<p>"Several hundred"? That's an enormous number of shortcuts. Why so<br />
many?</p>

            Hello Kqmaverick,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the reason that you cannot view this stream is because Windows Media Player 11 no longer supports the Microsoft Media Server (MMS) protocol.&nbsp; I have linked the KB article below for your review.<br />

    <title>&#91;Windows 10&#93; Sometimes After I Boot, OS Will Not Advance Past - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mictwofour  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Windows 10&#93; Sometimes After I Boot, OS Will Not Advance Past The User Log In Screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so here's what I'm dealing with. This just started happening recently, like two days ago recently. Never had this problem previously, not once. Here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I boot up my laptop -- I get to the Windows 10 'Start Up' Page (whatever you want to call it) where you see your User Name and can type in your Password or Pin, to log on to Windows. Once I type in my Pin, the loading circle just keeps going around in
 circles and after about 15-20 seconds roughly, it takes me back to the Windows 10 'Start Up' page! At first, I thought maybe I accidentally hit the wrong number in my pin, so I try again --- same result. Back to the Windows 10 'Start Up' Page! Even though
 I have been able to find my way back on to the computer, I have no solution for this because it almost just comes down to luck to when it lets me advance to my desktop?!?! I've tried many different methods; I've unplugged all USB, Ethernet, Power cords. I've
 restarted multiple times, I've Shut down multiple times, I've held in 'Shift' and clicked restart -- to try to boot it in Safe Mode [that didn't even work]. Like I said, it seems like whenever it lets me on it's just complete luck, because I'm not doing anything
 to push it to let me through. I have no IDEA why it started doing this and/or how to fix this issue, but I want it fixed! I shouldn't have to play the Game of Thrones [you win or you die lol] with my Laptop just to be able to log in and use the computer! Please
 let me know how to fix it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have noticed since playing these games with the computer is; When it says 'Welcome' underneath my User Name after I type in my PIN, it always advances to the desktop. When it doesn't say 'Welcome' underneath my User Name after I type in my PIN,
 it always goes right back to the same Windows 10 'Start Up' Screen I was just at. Don't know why, not sure if it might help, but I thought I'd throw it in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. Please hit me up with a solution. I'm very frustrated having to tell myself when I boot my computer, "Well I might be able to get on now but who knows maybe not -- we will see shortly if it lets me through."
 A question I shouldn't have to ask myself!</p>

<p>
</p><p>To assist you better with your concern, we just have few questions for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since you already tried to boot in safe mode and it didn't work, do you have a recovery drive? If yes, can you try to boot from the recovery drive?</li><li>Were there any changes that happen on the device before the concern started?</li></ul>

            <p>@Justin Emb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey buddy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a recovery disc or USB, for some reason when I bought the laptop it didn't come with any recovery discs. Even though they gave me my serial number to register, but no disc. I'm not sure if Windows 10 has recovery stored in the OS itself or
 what.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to boot into the Safe Mode if you could tell me that'd be great. I have held down 'Shift' and clicked Restart (Bottom right corner of 'start up' screen) and it takes me to a blue "recovery" screen which says 'Choose an option':</p>
<p>--- Continue (Exit and Continue to Windows 10)</p>
<p>--- Use a Device (Use a USB drive, network connection, or Windows recovery DVD)</p>
<p>--- Troubleshoot (Reset your PC or see advanced options)</p>
<p>--- Turn off your PC</p>
<p>——————————————————</p>
<p>I have clicked on Troubleshoot and the options are Reset This PC, Recovery Tool, Advanced Options.</p>
<p>When I tried Recovery it warned me about having to format the HD. I don't want to reinstall Windows or anything, I don't want to lose any files.</p>
<p>Ive also clicked Advanced Options and Start Up Repair but after Diagnostics it doesn't seem to repair anything.</p>
<p>The other options under Advanced Options are:</p>
<p>System Restore, System Image Recovery, Startup Repair, Command Prompt, UEFI Firmware Settings, Startup Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attend college and I have A LOT of important information I need and projects for my coding class that I need to keep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as if anything happen before this started, this might be partially my fault. I'm not sure if the two connect at all but I downloaded a safe malware-free program called JetClean it's similar to CCleaner but got better reviews. Anyways when I cleansed
 my computer I didn't notice until after that one of the boxes in the program that was clicked was Registry. And it said after it fixed like 1100 different things in the Registry. Again, I'm not sure if that directly correlates to this problem, but it might.</p>
<p>Any help at all would be much appreciated!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

</p><p>About 30 minutes after I posted that reply to @Justin Emb. my Laptop finally let me log in and pushed me to the normal desktop (wallpaper and icons). Again, not sure why it all of the sudden let me through - doesn't make any sense. But this time it took
 the longest yet to do so, around 25-30 minutes. In that time period, I restarted the computer multiples times, I shut it down multiple times, I unplugged the USB Mouse and Keyboard, Power Outlet Cable, Ethernet Cable, Everything multiple times and it still
 wasn't letting me log in. I tried some of those options I shared with you earlier...still nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I restarted the computer once again. Once it took me to the 'Start Up' Screen like it's suppose to do, I typed in my PIN and boom I saw the "Welcome" message underneath the User Name. When I see that "Welcome" message I instantly get a huge smile
 on my face because I know once I see that, it's going to let me log in and through so I can use my computer. But my points is; I did nothing special. I just did the same exact thing I did the multiple times in the previous 20 minutes! So I have NO IDEA what
 is going on. I just know that it is EXTREMELY frustrating. I mean what if this happens and I can't use my computer for like an hour and I have something I need to work on ASAP or something that is due later that day?!?!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to get this fixed. And I want to get it fixed without having to delete any of my files. This should not be happening. I'm thinking it has something to do with the Registry, but how would you fix the Registry for something like this? That's
 past the current knowledge I hold in my brain right now. PLEASE HELP ME FIX THIS! ANYONE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

    <title>Windows installer doesn&#39;t work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows installer doesn&#39;t work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm having a bit of a weird issue. I've installed windows 10 on a few computers before and have never run into this until now. I recently bought an ssd to boot my OS from, but running the install media usb doesn't seem to work right. I only used windows
 10's install media tool. I should also mention I only have a keyboard, mouse, monitor and the install usb plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the usb (twice now), then shut my pc off, removed the existing hdd, then plugged in the ssd and the usb with the install tool on it. I boot into setup, make sure the drive is all unallocated space, and then hit new. I let it create the necessary
 partitions and then click next. I've also tried just clicking next with a totally blank ssd.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setup tool runs normally, prompts a restart which is when I remove the install usb, if I don't remove the usb then it loops back to the installer again. When I remove the usb and then restart though, my pc prompts me to insert boot media into the drive
 and press any key. It doesnt seem to actually install the necessary files to download and install windows 10. No matter what I do, after the install media tool finishes and causes a restart I cannot continue with the installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know it isn't a problem with another component because plugging in the original hard drive works fine. I've also plugged both drives in and scanned for errors on the ssd to no avail. I checked and there are files
 being installed on the ssd. It seems to work normally otherwise so I dont think it's a bad drive either.</p>

            Hi Helleg.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Trigger the media only using the BIOS Boot menu key, not by setting a flash stick to boot first in BIOS/UEFI Setup.  Also for UEFI the Windows Boot Manager must remain set to boot first (or hard drive for Legacy BIOS, or if WBM is not present yet) and the media must be booted as a UEFI device only.
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>Hey Greg, appreciate the quick response. I followed the instructions to that guide. I have no peripherals besides a keyboard, mouse, monitor and the ssd. I cleaned the drive again. Fast boot is disabled, the SATA controller is set to AHCI and uefi is on.
 I&nbsp; have tried setting the uefi device to boot first, as well as manually running it through the boot manager. I've done the same with the ssd after installing windows. The same issue still occurs. After the install finishes, I unplug the usb and restart as
 instructed. Theres no usb so it tries to boot from the next device in line, the ssd, which gives me a black screen that says "please insert proper boot device, or insert boot media into selected device and press a key".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this issue in the past when accidentally booting from the empty drive instead of the installer, but then all I had to do was run the usb through the boot menu, run the installer once and it ran fine, restarted and proceeded to continue setting
 up windows. But with this ssd, no matter how many times I've run the installer, it will recognize the ssd just not boot from it. The install program finishes without any errors, I can select it via the boot manager so the ssd should theoretically be bootable
 but the PC can't find the appropriate files on the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weirdest part to me is that I can plug in my existing hdd, boot windows as normal and go into the ssd in file manager, and see the files that the installer put on the ssd. But yet it isnt being recognized as a bootable device.</p>

            The problem is that WIndows Boot Manager is apparently not appearing which must be always set first to boot on UEFI installs. If it isn't present before install, it should get invoked during install. Can you find it in the Boot Priority order or add it
 manually? Consult your Motherboard manual - or Support if it's within a year of purchase.
<br />
<br />
UEFI Setup settings must be UEFI enabled, CSM disabled, Secure and Fast Boot disabled until after install if necessary, Windows Boot Manager always first in Boot Priority.
<br />
<br />
What is the UEFI firmware version installed now? Check for newer on Motherboard support downloads page.
<br />
<br />
If nothing else works change from UEFI to Legacy or CSM, boot as plain Flash stick (difference illustrated below), keep SSD set first in priority.
<br />
But this is not as secure and not using UEFI is like turning off all odern features in a car.
<br />
<br />
The problem could be the SSD. We do see bad ones. You can test it with the bootable diagnostics from it's maker:

<p>The boot manager works fine. When I have the uefi installer plugged in, I can go into the boot manager and set it to run first, and also force it to run. CSM and fast boot are both disabled during install, though disabling CSM makes the ssd unavailable so
 I have to enable it after running the installer so I can then select the ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did check the uefi firmware and it's out of date. I'll update and see if that fixes anything. Maybe the system can't detect that the installation files are on the ssd because of out of date firmware? I dont think it's a bad drive as I've tested it and
 the drive seems okay. I scanned it for errors and nothing came up, and I can use it as a storage device just fine, but trying to boot from it still doesn't work. Everything seems to be in order until I actually try to boot from the ssd after installing, which
 is when the system says there is no bootable media on it.</p>

            So there is a WIndows Boot Manager listed first in your Boot Priority order tab?  I had thought you said it has SSD first.  
<br />
<br />You said the SSD is not detected when you disable CSM unless you enable it another way.  How is that?  
<br />
<br />Can you update your UEFI firmware without having WIndows installed?
<br />
<br />You can try installing on another drive, or move the SSD to another PC to install to it alone, then move it back.  Windows 10 is remarkably adaptive to new hardware without needing adaptive restore.  If it will start it will swap out all drivers requiring several restarts.

<p>I must have misspoke, my apologies. I really appreciate how patient you've been. I've been troubleshooting this all day and I'm getting quite tired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway the ssd was originally listed first in the boot priority order. Next it had set the install device, finally the uefi one. I made the uefi install device first in the boot priority order so that the ssd is second. Just to be sure I go through the boot
 manager and force it to boot the uefi drive. It will boot the install drive and I can begin installing windows. I go through the setup, skipping the product key, accepting the terms and selecting custom install. I format the drive so it's totally unallocated
 space and press next. Then let the installer copy the necessary files to the ssd, install the updates and everything, and finish up. When it prompts me to reboot I disconnect the usb so it doesnt loop back. Since I shouldn't need the usb after it finishes
 running, it's easier to unplug it than force the ssd to boot. then it restarts and it should theoretically begin the process of installing windows on the ssd.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will try to boot from the ssd first now because the usb drive isnt connected, but then it says that it cant find any bootable media. But there were files transferred to the ssd and you can see them. Space is taken up on the ssd but it won't boot. I tried
 disabling CSM but then the ssd disappears from the boot priority order tab and my only choice is to boot into the uefi installer again. If I want to see the ssd I have to reenable CSM. I didnt mean that I was able to access the ssd with CSM disabled, and trying
 to boot with only the ssd prompts me to enable CSM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can update the bios via asus ez flash and am doing so now, I'll let you know if that fixes the issue. My next test is to switch out all the other hardware and test booting from that rig instead of this one. If that doesnt work I'll also try going through
 the install usb again on that rig, reformatting the ssd again, and run the setup, and then see if it begins setting up windows after the restart at the end or if it still doesnt detect any bootable media from it.</p>

<p>That is kind of what I was thinking was the issue. It seems like the installer finishes running and installs except the files needed to actually boot are missing from the installation. Have tried startup repair and this didn't work. Any suggestions for getting
 the boot files on to the ssd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean the installer runs fine so youd think that it would be properly installing the boot files and that the boot configuration data would all be okay, but I'll try anything you can suggest. I havent verified that the necessary files to boot from the ssd
 are there, just that the installer appears to have put windows files on it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me like your Windows 10 is not getting installed to the SSD as UEFI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The boot manager you mention is not the boot device for a uefi machine...</p>
<p>It simply selects a one time boot device... You do want to select your Flash Drive as a "UEFI USB Device" though... Not just a "USB Device"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Boot Device to boot the machine from the SSD will be "WindowsBootManager"...</p>
<p>You will not even select a specific drive... The boot files will be located on a small 100MB "EFI" partition on the SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that your Installation media was not created properly to install as UEFI...</p>
<p>That can happen sometimes... Especially if created on a different machine..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try downloading a ISO instead of creating a flash drive with the Create Media Tool, and then burn the ISO to the flash drive with a free tool called RUFUS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It must be specifically created for "GPT" and UEFI Bios, as well as being FAT32 file format..</p>
<p>If any of these are not correct, it can be a problem..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what your RUFUS screen should look like... The USB drive and Image name will be different, but the settings are what you need...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Be sure to delete everything on the SSD and select the unallocated space as Windows 10 will need to create 4 partitions... You could create a data partition on the end of the SSD, but leave the OS partition unallocated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your flash drive is detected properly as a UEFI Installation, your SSD should be properly "Initialized" as a "GPT" type drive, and the needed partitions created automatically...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not need to mess with any of your Bios settings if your machine is already set up for UEFI Bios...
</p>

<p>That's possible but I don't think it's the issue. I checked what is on the new ssd after running the installer, and along with the windows files there is an efi partition as well. Though it is 300mb not 100. Could the media creation tool (the uefi device
 not the normal one) be creating a legacy version even still? Although trying to boot using compatibility mode still doesnt work so I dont think that's it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i may not have understood what was meant by the windows boot manager. I have been talking about the uefi boot priority order, and the option to one-time boot a device. I cannot find "windows boot manager" even after installing windows. Trying to
 go into uefi mode with f2 and selecting a boot device does not show windows boot manager. It only shows the ssd I just installed windows on. But selecting to boot the ssd still tells me there is no boot media installed, even though there is an efi partition
 there. If I plug in my hdd and the ssd I can see both and choose to boot from either, but i still do not see windows boot manager anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have wiped the drive. I plug the usb in and have 2 selectable options, booting the usb or the uefi usb. I choose the uefi one, and let it start. I install windows, it creates the needed partitions (I have verified they are there), the recovery, efi and
 primary partition. It installs the necessary files and stuff, then prompts me to restart. I do so and then I am told there is no bootable media on my ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the primary partition is set as active, and confirmed that it is formatted as GPT and not MBS. I have created the boot drive from this rig using my old hdd that still has windows on it, as well as on another pc I have. Neither worked.
 I have messed with the CSM and boot settings, reset them and everything in between. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installer program itself runs fine. Or appears to. I can install windows on the ssd over and over again and it says it completes successfully. The issue is that after properly installing windows, the ssd still isnt recognized as a bootable device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I havent done that has been suggested so far is burning an iso instead. I used rufus to burn an iso onto the flash drive instead of using the windows media creation tool. Running this instead of the media tool now. Hopefully that works.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft 1.13 Snapshot Freezing on game start</h2>
                    <p>I've seen other posts about MC being on Windows forums, so i feel this is appropriate to post here.</p>
<p>When I try and start my minecraft 1.13 Snapshot18w45a the game just freezes on the loading screen with the mojang logo. Vanilla minecraft 1.13 works fine, and the snapshot was just working earlier today. I've already heard about discord causing issues and
 I've uninstalled it, but the issue still persists.</p>

                    <p>I'm running Widows 8 Pro on a Lenovo K410.&nbsp; I've got full administrator privileges.&nbsp; I can't open either gpedit.msc or secpol.msc through the command prompt.&nbsp; All that appears is an error box that says that the system can't find either command.&nbsp; I REALLY

            &nbsp;Hi Keith C.,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<div>From your description I understand that you are unable to open gpedit or secpol from command prompt.</div>
<div><br />
Let’s start with some questions.<br />
1. How are you trying to open gpedit or secpol from command prompt?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
As a workaround you can try these steps and check.</div>
<div><br />
a. Press Windows key + X.<br />
b. Now click run and type” gpedit.msc” and hit enter.<br />
c. This will open local group policy editor.<br />
d. Similarly you can try the same steps for opening local security policy instead of typing gpedit.msc type secpol.msc.</div>
<div><br />
You can also open local group policy editor and local security policy by following these steps.<br />
a. Press Windows key + W.<br />
b. Now click search and select settings now type edit group policy and hit enter.<br />
c. Similarly you can open local security policy by follow the same steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps.</div>
<div><br />
Do get back to us and let me know the status of the issue or if you need further information regarding Windows.</div>

            ShuiabKhan,
<div><br />
<div>Neither of those options works. Trying to run either "secpol.msc" or "gpedit.msc" returns a notification that windows cannot find the program. Similarly, a search in the start page search dialogue box yields no results for gpedit, secpol, or "edit group
 policy." Is there any other way of finding secpol, or is it impossible to configure password policies and the like on windows 8?</div>

            I've been struggling with the same thing, and at this point, I don't think it's "malware" - I think that many of these preloaded systems are actually "Hollow-Ware" - basically, versions of Windows that have been gutted so that they work just *barely* enough
 for you to do a few things, but force you to "pay twice", in essence, if you want to have a fully-functional version of Windows on your system.<br />
<br />
I personally find it fraudulent on the part of the manufacturers - they lead people to *believe* that they are purchasing a fully-functioning system, when the fact is that they'll have to purchase a *real* co[py of Windows to do anything beyond the absolute
 basics.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I don't know whether the "Hollow-Ware" ((the old term used to be "cripple-ware", but that might have changed)) can be patched using the Win8.1Beta ISO and a bootable flash drive.&nbsp; But I do feel 99.9999% certain that we customers are left holding the proverbial
 bag in this matter...<br />

<h2>            Win 10 Ver 1809 How to start Device Manager running as Admin&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last week my machine "upgraded" to Ver 1809 Build 17763.379.</p>
<p>Today I tried to run device manager as admin to make some system changes.&nbsp; I can't</p>
<p>In past I could search for it in Start menu, right click and select Run As Admin. That option is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked, and the Run As Admin option is still avaiable for the "Run" dialog. So the option is not completely lost. It just appears they have "improved" Device Manager and moved the option some where else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues where I have to look?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>oops, I must have been seeing things, the Run as Admin option is no longer showing for the Run dialog also ... &lt;Sigh&gt;</p>
<p>

            Hi Rohn, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />You could try opening Device Manager from the Command Prompt as administrator. Here are the steps:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and search for Command Prompt.
<br />- Right click it and choose "Run as administrator"
<br />- When command prompt appears, type the following:
<br />
<br />devmgmt.msc
<br />
<br />- Then press Enter, and Device Manager should appear as an administrator, since you were using command prompt as administrator.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<h3> sam8988378  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana is possessed, how to make it go away&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Almost any mouse gesture makes Cortana send out a tone, then either maximize to take up 1/4 of my screen on the left side, or the smaller 1/8 Cortana presence. &nbsp;Cortana responds to the louder commercials on the television, and went off to connect me to the
 Duluth Trading Company! It isn't even that loud, but the speakers are good. &nbsp;I don't see how Cortana can be considered helpful when I constantly have to X it down (but never off. &nbsp;Even killing it through task manager only lasts a few seconds), in order to
 see my screen. &nbsp;Even when I use Cortana to look something up, there's no difference between typing my query in a browser and typing it in Cortana, except that I can set the browser to filter if need be. &nbsp;If anything, using Cortana is adding an extra step to
 search (it doesn't respond accurately to verbal requests to search), and who needs that? &nbsp;I already have to deal with Cortana distracting me when I use the touch pad. &nbsp;This is an ADHD nightmare, adding a constant distraction to the already prone to being distracted.
 &nbsp;I spent an hour trying to kill Cortana today, walked away in frustration from something important yesterday because Cortana was just too annoying. Is there anyway to turn Cortana off? &nbsp;I figured I should ask before I go into into Program Files and start deleting.
 &nbsp;If it isn't necessary for the functioning of the computer it should be made optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there any way to turn off/disable/kill Cortana?</p>

            Wow, there are over 21 pages of people unhappy with Cortana. &nbsp;You would think this would make MS motivate to fix it, or at least make it optional.

            Ha ha ha, MSFT motivated to fix! You must be joking. MSFT never fix anything they just come out with more 'features' no one wants or needs in a pathetic attempt mask just how rubbish W10 is. Try 'asking' Cortana to 'Go to Sleep' or 'Stop listening to our
 conversations' or 'Stop spying on me'. the responses&nbsp;are hilarious.

<p>Unfortunately, this is something that Microsoft makes intentionally difficult.&nbsp; I don't know if you can remove the icons only; however you can remove the entire app:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1) Click start menu, start typing "powershell"<br />
2) Right click on "Windows Powershell" and select "Run as Administrator"<br />
3) If Windows asks for permission; click Yes.<br />
4) At the prompt that appears, type:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get-AppxPackage -Name *soundrecorder* | Remove-AppxPackage<br />
5) Hit enter.&nbsp; You should get a green notification bar at the top of the window with progress and/or success messages.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You can uninstall other built-in apps in the same way.&nbsp; For example *calculator*, *people*, *xboxapp*.</p>

2. On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, tap or click <strong>Internet options</strong>. If you don't see the

3. In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> window, tap or click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.

<br />
<em>Note Select the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> check box if you also want to remove browsing history, search providers, Accelerators, home pages, Tracking Protection, and ActiveX Filtering data.</em><br />
<br />
5. When Internet Explorer finishes applying the default settings, tap or click <strong>

6. Exit and then start Internet Explorer. </span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disclaimer: Please note that resetting Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed

</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try booting the computer in safe mode with networking and check if the proxy setting gets enabled automatically again. Follow the steps below to boot in safe mode.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + I to open settings.</p>
<p>2. Click "update and security".</p>
<p>3. Click "recovery" on the left pane.</p>
<p>4. Under advanced startup, click "restart now"</p>
<p>5. In the Windows recovery environment, click troubleshoot &gt; advanced options &gt; startup settings and restart</p>
<p>6. <span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When it restarts, you should see a number of options.&nbsp; Press 5 or F5 for
<strong>Safe Mode with networking.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue does not persist in safe mode, I would suggest you to place your computer in clean boot state.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>When my computer goes to sleep, my external mouse stops working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            When my computer goes to sleep, my external mouse stops working.</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba laptop running Win 7 pro '64bit'. I prefer a mouse over touchpad so I use one from my old computer. It is a Microsoft mouse. After some adjustments to settings, it works just fine. Also, not long ago I rec'd an MS notice that MS had updated
 my mouse driver. MS even thanked me for using an MS mouse. It works, EXCEPT for this. When the computer goes into or is put into sleep mode, more than half the time the mouse is no longer functional when the computer is restarted.&nbsp; (The arrow shows but won't
 move. ) I have to unplug the mouse at the USB port &amp; then plug it in again to get it back. What is causing the mouse to disconnect? How do I fix it? And WHY (given that this is supposed to be an entirely predictable computer, is the behaviour inconsistent?&nbsp;

            Nice try but no dice. I reached Device Manager via Control panel and found these interesting things I did not know about, so thank you for that. However, the "Allow the computer to turn off this Device [the optical MS mouse] to save power." was NOT checked,
 so that was not the problem. The box that said "Allow this device to wake up the computer" was checked, but the often dead mouse was often unable to do this. Problem not solved. Any more ideas?

<p><span>1. What is the make and model of the mouse?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Set your computer in

<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists then I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the mouse driver from your computer

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>f. Select driver and then click
<span>Uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span>g. Follow the prompts to continue to uninstall the Driver.
</span></p>
<p><span>h.
<span>Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also check for an updated driver from the manufacturer and install the latest version.</span></p>

            <p>As I said above, it is a Microsoft mouse. I no longer have the box, but it just says Microsoft. Also, as I said before, after using the mouse for a short time, I received an update notice from Microsoft saying something like: "Thank you for using a Microsoft
 mouse; your mouse driver has been updated.&nbsp;This was within the last month .∙. an out-of-date driver is not likely the culprit. I appreciate your answer but I am reluctant to go through the above procedure at this time.
</p>
<p>Additional information: Under Mouse in Control panel it says it is a Microsoft USB wheel mouse -optical Intellipart.&nbsp;It seems to go "off" after being in hibernate/sleep if, for example, a browser is open. If the only process running a minor game of solitaire,
 the mouse usually stays "attached". Perhaps it is more prone to disconnecting when more progs are running.
</p>
<p>The problem is irritating but not major. What concerns me more is that I have, as yet, no explanation for the unpredictability. Do you know why this happens? Any signs of instability in a computer are a bit alarming.</p>

            I might also add that I am now having the same small problem with the same mouse on a newer computer running Win8.1 64bit. IN this computer, I cannot find any power settings for the mouse.&nbsp; It is clear the driver is up to date, because it only recently
 installed itself when I plugged it into this newer computer, so I see little point in repeating driver update procedure. Any other ideas?

<h2>            Loud Buzzing From Xbox 360 Slim&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I've been playing Red Dead Redemption on my Slim. I noticed a very loud buzzing noise, is there something wrong with my system? This sound occurs as soon as the game is launched. I've had it since 2012 so it wouldnt surprise me if it was screwed,
 then again the buzz could have just been something that's always been there but I haven't noticed since I dont often play games on disc.</p>

<p>Its most likely issue with one of the fans. Does it sound like its coming from the console itself or does it sound like its coming from the power brick, if your model of 360 has a power brick?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its the console, try Gamestop or a local hobby electronics store (a trusted retailer) they can look at it or&nbsp; clean it up for you (because it could be dust.) If its the power brick, either one of the places above should have spare power bricks for sale.
 Other than that there really isn't much you can do because they don't offer servicing for the Xbox 360 anymore. I wouldn't recommend looking at it yourself (warranties and user agreements) but if you have to make sure you watch a tutorial on YouTube

            It doesnt sound like one of the fans, it just sounds like a disc being read but it's much noisier than I at least remember, however I haven't played a disc based game on the system in probably over a year so I could be wrong. I'll try another game disc
 and see if it could simply be something that occurs with Red Dead

            Nah it's not overheating, or at least that isnt what causes it because it happens as soon as I start the game after the system being off for hours.

            Alright, it seems to only occur with Red Dead, I assume because it can be quite taxing on the system? Anyway, thanks for the help! I feel kinda dumb that I didnt try that first. I bet simply installing the game would cause it to stop.

<p>Its either the fan or some sort of other power problem. If its the disc slot though, there could be some dust up in there or something like screw is lose and its hitting something. It sucks because support for the 360 is virtually non-existent. Take it to

            That is an issue caused by your disc drive having difficulty to read portions of the disc. Think of sending the console for repairs or consider updating with a next gen console.&nbsp;

            I had this same issue with my 360 slim when I would play Skyrim. It was only that game. It never had any adverse affect on the system, but I would definitely get some can air and blow out the console if it's been awhile.&nbsp;

            Programs must be installed to work. Nothing in the Windows.old&nbsp;folder is installed on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If YouCam is compatible with Windows 7, install it.

<h2>            Some system taskbar icons have no color.</h2>
                    Upon installation of Windows 7 some of my system taskbar icons are colorless. In Windows Vista for example the battery icon in the taskbar would show a green level to indicate battery life. Another example is the network connection icon would display green
 bars to show the strength of the signal.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the color back in these icons?

The System Icons being white are by design. However, as Renjith- IT Specialist mentioned, there are third party program that can change that aspect.<br />

                    I can't seem to find a way to uninstall sysinternals suite,&nbsp; any help would be apreciated<br />
I have looked in my uninstall menu and sysinternals is not listed<br />
I am running a dell insperion 530 with vista home pro<br />
Most annoying is upon installing sysinternals suite I have a menu displayed on the desktop which I cannot eradicate.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sysinternals are standalones. What does is the Desktop labeled as? Right Click Properties
<br />
and on Shortcut Tab what is the program Target and Startin? If you put all the Sysinternals<br />
in a folder by themselves you can just delete the folder (be sure nothing important is in it).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
