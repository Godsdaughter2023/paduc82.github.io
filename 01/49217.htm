    <title>Windows 8.1 Event Log -Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Event Log -Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to find where it is documented that Windows 8.1 Professional has the following known bug with regards to saving / reviewing saved Security logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have setup a Windows 8.1 Professional standalone system. I have configured the system to track security changes via the event viewer Security Logs. The security logs display correctly when I review them in active mode. However once I save the logs to the
 system and then go back to review those saved logs, the logs only shown with the information symbol (Circle with the !), the key and lock icons are not being displayed. According to a Microsoft tech this is a known issue with Windows 8 and there are no plans
 to correct the bug. I would like to see the documentation that talks about this issue. Can someone point me to the Microsoft KB article or provide me any links that describe these issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Robert&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Internal Floppy Disc drive will not communicate with computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internal Floppy Disc drive will not communicate with computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've discovered some old floppy disks and I'd like to try to get whatever data I can off them. I was recently able to salvage an old Floppy Disk reader/writer drive from one of my older computers. Its connections are internal; so I connected the bus cable
 and another 4-pin cable (I think it's for power.) I enabled floppy disc reading in the BIOS and when I go to the Device Manager, a device called "Standard floppy disk controller" appeared. The only problem is that I cannot find the drive anywhere in the File
 Explorer. The drive's light doesn't even turn on. I think the problem is that I have the incorrect driver installed. If I try to update the device's software automatically, it keeps the same generic driver. If I browse the computer for software, pick from
 a list of all drivers on the computer, uncheck Show compatible hardware, the only driver that is listed is "Standard floppy disk controller." I've been searching online for a solution, but I can't find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is running Windows Vista Home Basic&nbsp;<strong>32-bit.</strong> I've tried some drivers I found online but they didn't work, an error popped up that said "Make sure this driver is 32-bit compatible." So please, if you could, make sure that your
 solution works with 32-bit :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Floppy Disk drive's model is Samsung SFD-321B. It is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> a USB drive. I can upload pictures of the drive's connections if anyone needs them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>What is the model for the computer or motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be the motherboard does not have the power need or connection for this floppy drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, than it might be driver issue like you mentioned. You could try booting live Linux from CD or USB to see if it can recognized it. This would rule out the driver issue.</p>

<p>make no difference,either its connected proper,and it'll work,or an adapter is required.IBM gave up on floppy</p>

<p>After fiddling around with the cables, I was able to get the drive to power on and the bottom of it is spinning around when a drive is inserted. :) The Floppy Disk Drive (A:) appears in My Computer, but when I try to access it while there is a floppy disk
 inserted, it says "Please insert a disk into Floppy Disk Drive (A:)." Maybe the floppy disks are empty, or maybe the drive is bad. Hopefully neither.</p>

            I fiddled with the cables again... I guess I just plugged in the 32 wire cable upside down on both the drive and the MB. It's working like a charm now. Thank you for all the help!

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you get any error messages while installing the game?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get this error while trying to start the game?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the Operating System installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MechWarrior 3 does not seem to be compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Refer the below mentioned links.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>For Windows Vista:&nbsp;</span></strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=mechwarrior%203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, check if there are any patches\updates available for this game to run on Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If not, I would suggest you to uninstall the game completely from the computer and install it back again in the compatibility mode.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now install the game back again in Windows 95 or 98 compatibility mode as the game is compatible with these versions of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Right
 click</span></strong><span> on the&nbsp;<strong>setup file</strong> and select<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Windows
 95 or 98</strong>. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Now
 right click the setup file, select&nbsp; <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> and follow the normal installation procedure.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>If it's under the network icon then it's mapped.</p>
<p>Since the system will not let you create a folder, you lack appropriate access rights, which explains the "empty" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several ways to set up file sharing and I do not know which method you use. On my machines I do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create identical accounts &amp; passwords on each machine, including the host computer.</li><li>On the host, create one or several folders that you wish to share.</li><li>Create shares for these folders.</li><li>Set the share permissions to "Full control for everyone".</li><li>Set the NTFS permissions to "Full control" for the accounts to which you wish to grant access.</li></ul>
<p>When I do this then I have no problem accessing the shares across the network.</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">This is going to be a long description so please bear with me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I am having an issue where my desktop computer has begun randomly crashing and restarting. It happens when I move in and out of
 a graphically intensive program, like a video game (ex. alt tabbing out of league and back in again). The computer just shuts off, similar to a power outage (the computer is on a battery backup that is fully functional), and restarts itself like nothing happened.
 No blue screen, no error code, no nothing. After checking event viewer all it shows is a
<strong>critical kernel-power error event 41 task 63</strong>, which as you know can mean almost anything.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">This started happening only a couple of days ago, perhaps on July 30th. I have rebuilt my computer since then with a new motherboard,
 cpu, and powersupply, and it is still occurring. I have made sure all of my drivers and motherboard bios are up to date. I have reinstalled windows using a fresh install. Nothing works.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">From reading online forums, some people say it usually means you need to update your audio drivers, which I have done twice to
 no avail.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I honestly have no idea what else to do at this point so I figured I'd talk with you guys to see if you might know whats up.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Here are my current system specs:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">i7 8700k</span><br />

 and voltages are fine for all components, malware and virus scans showed nothing (remember the issue is persisting through a fresh install of windows 10). From my testing it seems like it's 100% a software problem, especially since my computer had been running
 fine for over a year until just recently.</span><br />
<br />

            Hi Chris, 
<br />
<br />I would suggest running the following software to see if there are any blue screen records in event viewer that could provide insight to the underlying problem: <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view....</a>
<br />
<br />Once installed, you will be able to see if it picks up any blue screens, as well as their corresponding fault. 
<br />
<br />Feel free to reply back with a screenshot of the results. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<p>This is an issue with MS's recent updates.&nbsp; I have the exact same issues.&nbsp; Tried doing a fresh install (needed one anyway), and pc is still doing it with most recent updates.&nbsp; It also started around July time.&nbsp; I'm not sure what update it was but between
 the most recent one and the spring creators update, they released something that screwed up many peoples systems.&nbsp; They have an article on tomshardware of the same thing.&nbsp; Mine are the exact same issues.&nbsp; No problems with basic computer tasks, but god forbid
 I turn on a game, randomly at any point, it'll shut off my computer and restart it (exact same issue as a power outage).&nbsp; Of course event manager shows that error 41 and no actual errors given though for why it happened.&nbsp; Temps are well within safe range.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<p>i7-7700k (AIO liquid cooler)</p>
<p>32GB ram</p>
<p>SSD's <br />
MSI GTX 1080</p>
<p>Gigabyte gaming 5 mobo</p>
<p>They were working fine prior, but as mentioned this has been brought up in multiple areas.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with hardware on our end, but an update Microsoft released that unfortunately negatively impacted us.&nbsp;

<p>Sorry for the late reply.&nbsp; The issue has persisted, UNTIL today, when it did one final crash.&nbsp; This time however, the computer did not automatically restart.&nbsp; I attempted to manually start the computer, to no avail.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, I THINK that it turned out
 to be my EVGA 980ti the whole time, and it had just been slowly failing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have since removed the card, and as soon as I did the computer started up with no issues, with everything including ram still being properly detected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is curious though, the fans on the 980ti were working properly, it never went over 75c even on intense gaming, it was not overclocked, and it had been fine for over 2 years, it just started dieing, and is now dead, as far a I can tell.&nbsp; Luckily it is
 still in the 3 year warranty from EVGA, so I contacted them and am waiting on their response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the crash happens again after this point, or EVGA looks at the card and says its good, I am naming the 980ti the culprit as a dead piece of hardware.</p>

<h2>            BSOD Page Fault in Non paged Area - Stop 0x50</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
First time newbie to the forum so please be bear with me.....<br />
<br />
A desktop computer that I have been using running Windows XP Home Ed. [HE] SP3 has recently been experiencing multiple problems leading to a "BSOD" error stating Page_Fault_In_Non_Paged_Area along with Stop 0x00000050 (WWWWWWW, XXXXXXXXX, YYYYYYYYY, ZZZZZZZZ).<br />
<br />
Here's a short summary of the history of this problem:<br />
<br />
1. Computer working fine but noticed Antivirus Firewall switching itself off<br />
2. Contacted Antivirus Software Manufacturer who ran a clean/wff.zip process and advised to un-install and then re-install Antivirus Software [Mcafee].<br />
3. Computer re-booted however Internet (using IE7, I believe) no longer working. Note: Checked on various other devices via ethernet cable and via wireless and confirmed internet, modem and cable not at fault since these devices showed full internet access.<br />
4. Contacted Mcafee who couldn't fix or understand the issue suggested contacting OS provider [Microsoft].<br />
5. Computer no completely unresponsive unable to access home page or log on due to BSOD with the above issues.<br />
6. Miscrosoft suggest re-installation of Windows XP HE SP3 using CD. <br />
7. Ran process to "repair" Windows via CD however was unable to continue passed "c:\windows&gt;" prompt.<br />
8. Contacted computer manufacturer [DELL] who also couldn't help with this issue.<br />
9. Ran some pre-installed software that claimed it would locate and fix any computer problems which also did not work.<br />
10. Am now running Windows with limited functionality using "safe mode restore option" when F8 key held down during restart.<br />
<br />
Points to consider:<br />
- No access to the computer outside of the "safe restore mode" as all other options such as "...last known good configuration, safe mode with networking etc.." crash default to the BSOD with the above error code.<br />
- System restore points have been completely wiped clean so cannot revert computer back to a date when it was working fine.<br />
- "Chkdsk" also shows no problems when run along with "chkdsk /f /r"<br />
- I do not believe, or more likely, cannot tell if there is malware/a virus or trojan applications running on the machine. Did a check using "attrib" along with "attrib -ab" looking for .exe or .inf files though couldn't see anything such as this. Again it
 is possible that I am not sure what I should be looking for hence may have missed something.<br />
<br />
That is a summarised version of events however if anyone can offer any advice it would be greatly appreciated. The machine is DELL Dimension 8300 with a Pentium 4 processor. 1 GB of RAM. Before anyone says anything - yes it is a slightly older computer but
 it has been working very well up until the firewall problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks and season's greetings to you all.<br />
<br />
/of London<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description, it appears that you are getting a Blue Screen of Death error stating Page_Fault_In_Non_Paged_Area with an error code Stop 0x00000050.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will certainly help you out with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>"Stop error code 0x00000050 (PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON-PAGED_AREA)" occurs after installing Service Pack 1 (SP1)</span></b></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Perform a repair installation of <span>Windows XP</span></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>Insert your <span>Windows XP</span> CD into your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Restart your computer. If prompted, press a key to start from the CD-ROM.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>When the <span>Welcome to Setup</span> page appears, press Enter on your keyboard.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>On the <span><b>Windows XP</b></span><span> Licensing Agreement</span> page, read the licensing agreement. Press the Page Down key to scroll to the bottom of the agreement. Then, press F8.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e. </span></span><span>When prompted, press R to have <span>Windows XP</span> attempt to repair
<span>Windows</span> by reinstalling important <span>Windows</span> components.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The repair and reinstallation process might take more than an hour. Eventually, Setup prompts you to answer questions just as if you were installing
<span>Windows XP</span> for the first time.</span></p>

            Thanks for the response....<br />
<br />
I do not believe Method 1 will help as the computer is using SP3. <br />
<br />
I was about to try Method 2 (which I have tried before) however I have realised that the Windows XP CD I have is actually SP1.<br />
<br />
Also whilst using the computer in "safe restore mode" I am starting to get "kernel32.dll" errors boxes repeatedly too as I attempt various functions e.g. viewing internet pages, opening documents etc. It does not stop me from performing tasks as all I do is
 click 'OK' each time. However it is highly interuptive and possibly related to the overall problem, so thought I should flag this too.<br />

            So I wiped everything clean and the computer seems to be working - although on Windows XP SP1. I now want to update it to SP3 plus add any AV software asap from Microsoft site but cannot get onto the Internet through IE.<br />
<br />
I am aware that it could be that I need to update "network connections" but not aware of any CDs that were used to do this. I have run connection wizard and it keeps diverting to dial up mode. Only connections I can see are:<br />
<br />
LAN or High Speed Connection:<br />
1394 - Enabled/Firewalled<br />
<br />
Dial Up:<br />
Dellnet Disconnected<br />
<br />
Broadband <br />
Broadband Connection Disabled/Firewalled (This is the one is the one I setup through the wizard insturctions).<br />
<br />
Is this a common issue?<br />

    <title>Import Photos from SD card to Date Taken Folder on Window 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonrhw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import Photos from SD card to Date Taken Folder on Window 10</h2>
                    <p>Until a very recent OS update, I used to be able to import photos from my SD card and be able to customise where the photos went (in particular, specifying that they get copied to a date taken folder). This was available by: inserting the SD card, open file
 explorer, right click on the device and "open as portable device", then right click and "Import pictures and videos" and finally use the "more options" screen to specify the action I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this has now disappeared. How can I import photos from an SD card into date-based folders?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;With your card inserted open Windows Live Photo Gallery and click Import (top left) and if your card appears in the box you can import you pictures, if the date is set on your camera it will automatically sort and store them in dated folders. Also when
 in the gallery if you click you&nbsp; File&gt;Options&gt; here are import and other controls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Glad you found a solution although Windows gallery is a built in app and should be available in the list of apps, an update should not have removed it.&nbsp; Did you ever notice it on your system previously?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help on this. I don't appear to have Gallery, but do have Windows Photo Viewer (which I believe was the replacement for it). From reading around, what is left on your system seems to depend on the upgrade/fresh install route you use to arrive
 at Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I've got my solution, so I'm happy now.</p>

            Please fix this issue. It's extremely infuriating. I canceled my Spotify account to go back to a Music Pass account and now I can't even listen to my music on my tablet because of this issue. I am sure it is widespread. Please respect the fact that people
 are paying for a service that they can't even use.

 the "sign in" process starting, then it crashes.&nbsp;

            That is your video card software, not windows 8. Go to AMD support and see if you need an updated driver and software. If you have a laptop, go to your computer's support site to check for updated drivers.

                    Obviously some recent update has wiped out all my saved login and password info for a couple of Skype accounts I've had for years. Equally obviously I no longer have the email addresses associated with those accounts. What a load of hoops to jump through
 only to be told I have not supplied enough information! Obviously I don't remember it else I would have supplied it! So, what's to do? Dump Skype forever? Seems a good idea to me!!!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand you are having issue installing programs on your windows 8.1 Computer. I'd be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please provide us certain information to narrow down the issue:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Did you make any changes on&nbsp;your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Which security program is installed on your computer?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to place your computer in Clean boot state and then try to install program and check if issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong><span> </span>

</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also suggest you to<strong> Run the Microsoft safety scanner </strong>
and check if your computer is infected by malware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also install all the important and optional Windows updates and check if the issue persist.</p>

<h2>            This PC system folders nested - irreversible &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I was moving system folders from their original location (C:\Users\username) to folders I created on D drive, everytime choosing to move the files inside along with the folder. At last I moved the Desktop folder to D:\Documents\Desktop, and suddenly all
 the files from the Documents folder appeared on the desktop. Now my ThisPC list has four folders named Documents but the icons are still different (Documents icon, Music icon, Videos icon and Pictures icon). Everything I put in any of these folders also appears
 on the desktop.</p>
<p>If I try to move any of this folder to its default location, I see the Documents icon at the top of the Location window and clicking the default location button gives back this path: C:\Users\username\Documents.</p>
<p>Is there any way to restore system folder names and corresponding folder locations? Maybe through regedit?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The documents folder and all other folders like music, pictures, video cannot be moved or copied to other drive since these folders are default folders which comes with the Operating system. The files/folders which are there in C:/ drive should not moved/copied
 because it creates duplicates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you click on restore default location it will take you back to the same location where the Operating system is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this behavior happens while copying other files/folders from d:/ drive to other drive(if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status.</p>
<p>

            <p>Morning (afternoon/evening as applicable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have experienced the same issue.<br />
It occurs when redirecting the target location for the additional folders in 'This P.C'.<br />
Right clicking on the folder and selecting location allows you to redirect the folder to documents etc stored on separate, non-OS, partitions (in the same way as you would for libraries) but changing one location changes them all. I re-assigned the documents
 quick access link to my D drive and ended up with all links (Documents, Music, Photos, Videos) all pointing to the same folder. As the OP states, I accidentally tried to reset the desktop link to its default and found it pulled all the contents from the other
 documents folders onto my desktop, believing this to be a duplicate I cleaned my desktop only to find I had in fact deleted all my documents and files from my D drive (luckily I had backups). Any attempt to now reset these link locations to default results
 in them all pointing to "C:\users\.........\documents" </p>
<p>Given the 'This P.C' folder links just do the same thing as libraries I can't see the need for them personally and this fault where redirecting one seems to redirect them all makes them a bit dangerous at the moment.<br />
<br />
FYI, for those feeling brave, I used a registry edit to remove these folders all together and return to only seeing drives in This P.C:<br />

            <p>This is actually a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why I should not be allowed to change the location of these folders. There is a location tab just to allow to do that. If I manually update the location in the Location tab, it works fine. But if I use "Move" option it is acting funny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways I updated all the system folders manually to point to D: drive instead of C:.</p>

            <p>It's indeed surprising that Windows 10 has such a bug and even more annoying that answers.Microsoft.com does not provide a solution. Fortunately and after searching for a long time I found one on&nbsp;http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/shell-folders-merged-music-videos-same-folder/</p>

<h2>            Sennheiser U320 &#43; stereo adapter problem</h2>
                    
<p>I just wanted to voice that there are problems with the Sennheiser U320 when using the new xbox one stereo adapter.
</p>
<p>-Headset works without the adapter minus the mic. When in a party the game audio is down a lot, but I'm pretty sure if the adapter worked right I could adjust it through the headset or the adapter.</p>
<p>-When adapter is plugged in people can hear me, but I can't hear them. </p>
<p>-When charge and play is plugged in along with the adapter there is a very loud buzzing sound.</p>

<h2>            Having Windows 10 nightmare&#63; Join our class action&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 10 caused us so many errors and finally led&nbsp; our beautiful computer to crash. It cost us $400 to repair it , requiring a scrub and rinse. It seems this is happening to millions of people around Canada and US alone. I am going to start a class action
 suit (I am lawyer) with the assistance of a class action expert. Let me know if you want to join. Its simple but make sure you keep good records of your problems and costs associated with either repairing your computer, or the value of your computer "lost.

<p>It doesn't matter. They can disclaim what they like, it doesn't relieve them of all responsibility. There is a reasonable expectation that the product will work as advertised.</p>

            There is no active class action suit, nor does it appear that there will be one.&nbsp; You can "join" the ghost brigade if you like, but don't expect it to come to anything.&nbsp;

            That's exactly correct. You can not completely make oneself immune from all legal responsibility by merely stating a sweeping clause in a licensing agreement.&nbsp;In fact, courts rule all the time that certain clauses are not valid such as seeking to make
 oneself immune from responsibility from <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
gross negligence causing foreseeable damage.&nbsp;</span> This is clearly the case here. A huge number of people were caused very expensive repairs due to this product. So if anyone knows of a Canadian class action, please inform me. I'm at $5000 for repairs and
 this is considered very reasonable for the work done. Almost mind boggling that a company like Microsoft could release such a toxic product. I want my money back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I used to be a license holder for a lot of corporate software and I can tell you I have been contacted many times to join a class action against MS. I just chose not to do so because I wasn't harmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that MS has made it harder to file a class action but it still is not impossible. Failing Class certification, individuals can still seek compensation in small claims or other courts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to your point about physical damage, an operating system can render disk drives and arrays unusable as is the case with me and Win 10. You can't restore data if the RAID drivers have been deleted</p>

<h2>            security icon, actions recommended</h2>
                    <p>since i 1st updated my new laptop 3 weeks ago i have seen a "!" on my security icon and it says actions recommended.</p>
<p>when i open the security dashboard all icons&nbsp; virus protect, account, firewall/netwok, app browser control, device security and performance and health are all showing a green tick, all but family options so im assuming that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a way of removing the recommended action notification as i have started to ignore it which would be a shame for me to ignore a real security issue... i dont have a family so i cant change anything there</p>

            Hi Andrew
<br />
<br />Sometimes it comes and goes and you will just have ignore it. 
<br />
<br />Right now, its showing up on mine because I am low on disk space. 
<br />
<br />Usually when I apply virus definitions, it changes to green. 
<br />
<br />It does give me an option to dismiss it from within the Defender app, but it appears yours is not. 
<br />
<br />You can also try refreshing Explorer to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart

<p>None of the above work if you've never owned an Xbox 360 and are trying to claim the Xbox 360 GwG games for use on the Xbox One. &nbsp;That's the problem. &nbsp;MS is advertising that you now get twice as many games on the Xbox One (due to the BC feature), yet there
 is no way to actually claim those games unless you own or previously owned an Xbox 360.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to Wi-Fi after updates</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Can not use Wi Fi after widows update. Have a HP pavilion on 8.1 with Mediatec wi fi adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 3 occasion now after the automatic updates the Wi fi that was working the day before starts saying no network found. Yes I have installed the latest drivers from the HP site. I have reset the network adapter. The tecs from HP checked the Wi fi card was
 OK . It seems to be an issue with 8.1. Computer originally had 8.0 o it. The I pad. touch mate tablet and the HP printer can all find the network just not the computer on windows 8.1. I'm just lucky I can&nbsp;plug the device in with a usb cable as I no Lan wired
 connection</p>
<p>I have been told by the technicians where I bought the computer that Windows some how has it's own drivers that at times are in conflict with the media card drivers and stop both from working.</p>
<p>It was working fine yesterday and after the latest updates it is not working today. This is the 3rd or forth time this has happened after an update and only on 8.1. I like 8.1 better than 8 and would like to keep it if only not have to del with the "update
 to 8.1 it is free" blue band every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any non generic help I would appreciate it. I have read all the other "my wi fi is not working on 8.1" seems like a common issue with 8.1.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing drivers or failed drivers </li><li>Anti-virus blocking</li><li>Missing updates.</li><li><span>Network connection settings</span></li><li>Software or Hardware issues.</li></ul>
<p>I may need some more info:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens when you try to connect to wireless network? Do you get any error message?</li><li>Do you get any exclamation mark in device manager under network adaptor?</li></ol>
<p>You can check the exclamation Mark by going to Device manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows and X key together and select Device Manager.</li><li>Locate the&nbsp;Network adapter and expand the driver icon.</li><li>Look for Wireless driver. Do you see any exclamation Mark?</li></ol>
<p>Let's try the methods below and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Network Adaptor Troubleshooter and it will disable and re-enable the adapter and fix some other common errors.
<span>This troubleshooter will disable and re-enable the adapter and try some other common repairs: try using the Network Adapter troubleshooter to automatically find and fix some problems.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>You may perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your detailed reply. </p>
<p>This morning the Wi fi did not work but a simple restarting of the computer and it was working. It is like a lottery . I have unclicked and re-seated the Mediatek Wi fi card and after that it worked when the computer started again so I thought that may have
 been the problem until this morning. </p>
<p>I have used the network adapter trouble-shooter&nbsp;numerous times to no help and checked to so if I have the most up to date drivers. Un installed and re-installed new drivers with the help of HP technicians but it is still a lottery so next time I will try
 the clean boot and see how that goes and then let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again Niranjan</p>

            The Wi fi did not work this morning at all. Had to plug the wireless internet device in using the usb cable to get the instructions for the clean boot which I did. Then followed the instructions and did the restart. Not only did I not have Wi fi but the
 I had no connections at all. (no even local area which is what it usually says using the usb.) Restated normally and had the usb back but Wi fi could not find any network.

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. It is unfortunate that the issue still persists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li></ul>
<p>Try disabling the security software and check if it works. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><span><em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

            <p>Well&nbsp; I think you are a genius Niranjan. Turned off the smart firewall and the Wi fi immediately came back. Turned the firewall back on and so far the Wifi is still working. We have Norton 360 premier&nbsp;edition.</p>
<p>If all I have to do each time is turn the firewall on and off I will be happy enough but is there a way to tell Norton that Mediatek is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks heaps for the advice</p>

</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated and good to hear that the Wi-Fi has come back on. There can be possibility of some settings missing in the firewall and I wish I was aware of the same. I would recommend checking with Norton.

            <p>HI Niranjan. It now says it is hooked up the the net with good signal but will not browse. HP have suggested this ( Below)but I have to get the Lap top back to try it out. I got an Apple iMac back that I owned but was on permanent loan to the community radio
 station for using Pro Tools. It works fine so I left the Lap top with a mate as I was sick of spending hours trying to get it to do anything.</p>

            <p>I have fixed <strong>all</strong> of the problems with the computer. Even a lot of the apps not working. It took all afternoon but it is done now. I refreshed it back to
<strong>factory 8.0</strong> and all is good now. Will not up grade to 8.1 again. It just does not work on this computer. Did think about getting a full install of 8.1 not upgrade but I have the iMac and the HP on 8.0 so I think I will leave it at that.
</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your help.</strong></p>
<p>Flushing the DNS server helped for a little while but if you used the Internet explorer app off the start page you had to do it again. Would not let me download Chrome or Firefox to set as default browser to get around the problem but 8.0 fixed everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Windows store app is not working, but only for 1 user.&nbsp; It looks like the below picture in the apps menu.&nbsp; This user is an admin, and I've tried the troubleshooter and the reset cache.&nbsp; Nothing has worked.&nbsp; Any ideas how to get it installed for this one
