<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after powering on, you have no splash screen logo (Dell, HP, etc.) that would point to a hardware problem.</p>
<p>You would need a Computer Tech to test the Hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can try this, but if same result as you have been getting (nothing)&nbsp;a trip to the shop is required:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You can use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows Recovery Environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            NVDA Screen Reader with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My NVDA Screen reader doesn't work in Kindle or Adobe&nbsp;with Windows 10 pro or home.&nbsp; I am a&nbsp;preview user so I have early access to the pro and home versions.&nbsp; On Windows 7 and 8.1, I opened my kindle accessibility reader, launched NVDA and pressed</p>
<p>CTRL + R to read the page.&nbsp; Is there a way to do this in Windows 10 pro and home?&nbsp; Or is there a better way to use the screen reader in the kindle app?&nbsp; I do not want to use the narrator by itself&nbsp;because&nbsp;I don't need it to read everything on the&nbsp;screen

<p>I am unsure who you spoke to as Skype's avenues for support is the Answers Community and live chat. No official phone support exits. I am unfamiliar with any officially released Microsoft OS ever being called Windows XT. There are Windows NT-based operating
 systems, Windows RT and Windows XP. You may have a 3rd party modified/themed version of Windows XP or other OS installed. Knowing the exact version/build number of Operating System installed or providing a DirectX Diagnostic, would be helpful.</p>
<p>

<strong>dxdiag.exe</strong> (Start - Run or Win key +R) then press enter or click "OK". Once the diagnostics completes, "Save All information..." to a text file.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Star Wars&#58; Battlefront 2 remake needed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Sort of like what 343 has done to CE: anniversary (which I am highly looking forward to) I think that this amazing game needs to be put on 360, or added to xbox originals for download. It was probably my favorite game to play with my friends on the original
 xbox. Who agrees/disagrees/has thoughts/trolls?</p>

<p>I would rather 3 somehow get pulled out of development/licensing hell. I kinda preferred 1 over 2, but liked both of them. Didn't like how linear some of the maps in 2 got from the objectives, preferred the more BF style ones of 1.</p>

<p>I think it is in Limbo now</p>
<p>I would rather 3 over a remake of 2.</p>
<p>The gameplay demo I saw of 3 was amazing. You could take off from the ground of a planet and fly out into orbit and land in a orbiting star destroyer.</p>

<p>I would like a Battlefront 3 on Frost Bite 2. Remakes never seem to please because nostalgia will always surpass how good a game actually was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pandemic which made one and two died off quite awhile ago and I think that Battlefront 3 was on their list of projects and I haven't heard anything about it since. The content is probably floating in limbo at Lucas Arts and with a the new MMO out soon it
 might be a dead franchise at this point.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update - Undoing changes</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to download the Gamepass for PC beta for my Laptop and it needed me to update Windows&nbsp; 10 to the 1903 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update downloaded, my PC restarted and it got to 67% and then turned itself off. I turned the laptop back on and it had the loading wheel turn for a little while the said something like 'Retrieving your update' then it said 'undoing changes' after about
 10 mins it booted up but without being updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled the problem and tried restarting in safe mode and deleting the files in the SoftwareDistribution folder and then returning the update. Exactly the same thing happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then downloaded the update troubleshooter and fixed the update and tried again and exactly the same thing happened. Update downloaded, in the middle of applying it and then the laptop just turns off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried resetting Windows 10 and that didn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a HP Pavilion 15-G094SA, not that new but should be able to update... right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>In this thread there are two additional procedures:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-hangs-on-please-wait-screen/fb09be8c-8297-4660-bfe6-845eab394e9d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-hangs-on-please-wait-screen/fb09be8c-8297-4660-bfe6-845eab394e9d</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The three answers there are the one above plus these two:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another workaround that should achieve the same, as posted by others:</p>
<ol>
<li>login to the affected account</li><li>Press Windows Key +&nbsp;r</li><li>Type: <br />
taskkill /f /im restoreoptin.exe</li><li>Open Charm menu (windows key + C), select "Settings", then Change PC Settings</li><li>Select Skydrive</li><li>Modify the File Storage, Camera Roll, and Sync Settings (not sure which one does the trick)</li><li>logout &amp; log back in</li><li>you should no longer be prompted with the blank 'please wait' screen</li></ol>
<p>and just for completeness, you could also try:</p>
<ol>
<li>login to the affected account</li><li>Press: Windows Key + r<br />
Type: <br />
taskkill /f /im restoreoptin.exe</li><li>Press: Windows Key + x<br />
Press: a<br />
Press: &lt;Alt + Y&gt;<br />
(run cmd as administrator)</li><li>
<p>Type:<br />
cd c:\windows\system32</p>
<p>restoreOptIn.exe /Ramp</p>
</li><li>
<p>Complete the Wizard</p>
</li></ol>
<p>That said, this is one of those things that shouldn't happen.&nbsp; Anybody know what this restoreoptin.exe process that seems to run and mess things up.&nbsp; Maybe I should just find it and rename it?</p>

            Exactly the same issue after upgrading to 8.1 on a brand new Asus Vivobook. The WIN+R and taskkill solution (Bill's first workaround above) works for me - though because the whole screen is covered with the Please Wait pane, I need to do it 'blind' (hit
 WIN+R, trust that it's opened the Run dialogue, then type in the taskkill command, and hope for the best. But I'll be damned if I'm doing that every time I start up the PC.
<div><br />
<div>It seems that restoreoptin.exe is something to do with Skydrive, but noone seems to have figured out how to stop it recurring on every startup. Would renaming the process help? Deleting it? Can Skydrive be disabled completely from the registry? Can Microsoft
 give me back the days of misery I've had with this since shelling out a thousand dollars on a new laptop?</div>

<p>WhoElse1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users have reported varying levels of success with a number of workarounds described in this and a large number of similar threads.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, many of us have tried them without success or have momentarily eliminated the problem only to have it suddenly recur days or weeks after we thought we had resolved it completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of us cannot afford to gamble on the Please Wait screen appearing on our next boot up because we use our computers in a work environment where we simply do not have the luxury of wasting fifteen minutes to&nbsp;work around the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us, the ONLY reliable fix has been to roll back to Windows 8.0 (which I am using on my laptop now) because it is not vulnerable to the Please Wait bug.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot update to 8.1 until Microsoft chases this bug down and stomps it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug seems to plague Dell and Asus laptops, especially (maybe always?) if they are running nVidea video cards.&nbsp; Whenever Windows 8.1 installs&nbsp;updates, there is a decent chance the bug will recur, even if you did one of the various workarounds.&nbsp;

            <p>I've seen some HP laptop threads with the same issue - at least it's some way hardware agnostic, which makes me think this one is firmly with microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing I didn;t try but will do later, is to create a new local admin account, with no one drive links, and migrate all profile data over and validate if it works - then scrub the old account once I'm done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>There's a pretty easy fix for this problem - like the other posters have already indicated, one drive (formerly sky drive) is the issue - though you definately don't have to disable it.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I had the issue when creating 2 new accounts for both my children - I setup theses accounts as "Child" from the user accounts section (control panel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the issue, I had to temporarily create the Child account as an Administrator account (Standard user may work...). Reboot the pc and then log into the account. Wait for the account to be setup (the please wait screen should, after a few minutes,
 proceed to the skydrive/one drive screen - and set it up as per normal. Once its done and you're returned to the start screen, click on the OneDrive app on your start menu to start the app - this should make sure its properly setup (you don't have to actually
 do anything in there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, exit the account and re-log into your normal admin account to change the Child's account back to type "Child".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Like I said, this worked for both my children's accounts. Was a very frustrating issue though that needs to be fixed!!</p>

            <p>Hi Byron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused due to user profile corruption or outdated java.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to visit the below website and check if your computer has java installed in It:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://java.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://java.com/en/</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer doesn't have java, try to download java and install it. Once java is installed check with the website, if it still displays no java, the site may be malicious.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 can&#39;t connect to my router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greenjackal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 can&#39;t connect to my router</h2>
                    I have windows 7 ultimate installed on my pc along with windows xp on another hard drive. When I use windows xp, my internet connection works perfectly but when I use windows 7, it says no connection found. I tried to restart the router and also re-plugged
 the cable but it doesn't work.

<p>**Dual boot at same time will not work properly** If set to dual boot, set to boot only XP or 7 at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**First make sure you have all windows 7 updates, especially Service Pack 1. If not make sure after the fix to update win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Are there any other PC's or just this one with XP and 7 on separate drives. I need to know this. If so, Unplug modem and shut down all other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Is this computer the one connected to the Modem/router through LAN and is your main computer on a home network. if so continue, or use the computer connected to the Modem/router as main computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. disconnect modem power</p>
<p>2. unjoin homegroup on&nbsp;win7 if u are joined and unjoin homegroup on any computers on your home network. Note the password and save it.</p>
<p>3. do a RESET Network or remove your network on both XP and 7.</p>
<p>4. shut down computer.</p>
<p>5. plug in modem power and wait until all connection lights are lit.</p>
<p>6. now boot up win 7 and log on.</p>
<p>7. now reboot modem again and when it connects restart computer and log on again. See if you are connected to internet. if so continue.</p>
<p>8. now boot up win&nbsp;XP&nbsp; and log on. check to see if you are connected to internet. If so all&nbsp;is&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>9. if not, make sure XP is set up to a new network since you reset or removed the previous one.</p>
<p>10. not boot to Win 7 again and log on.</p>
<p>11. Now if you have other home network computers, start and log on to one at a time and check internet connection.</p>
<p>12. create a new homegroup on Win 7 (THIS SYSTEM with XP and 7), or use previous one and password, but I suggest if possible to create a new one and not joining the previous one.</p>
<p>13. Join Homegroup with password on all other network computers. </p>
<p>14. reboot modem one more time and restart all computers.</p>
<p>15. If all is good, now boot to XP again and check if you are connected to internet.
</p>
<p>16. if not, reboot to 7 and unjoin homegroup on all computers, reboot modem, restart all computers and log on. Then reboot to XP and check if you are connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually encountered this issue many years ago with the same issue. I then made 7 the main computer to set up a network. Your router/modem plays a vital role because your ISP stores that in in modem settings. you want to clear the settings in modem by
 using 7 to create a new network. and it syncing to your ISP creating a new network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access most Modems/routers by entering this in to browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://192.168.0.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you may have to or can update or&nbsp;reset your network settings&nbsp;in the router settings provided by your ISP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this address does not work, search on web for your router brand and get address to access router settings. I did not have to do this in router settings, but just another possible tool to try if issue persists.</p>

<p>Actually Win 7 OS isn't looking at "Networking adapters" listed in networking.Win 7 needs the connection</p>
<p>data usually located at bottom of the router,write the data down,enter them in router properties/networking.</p>
<p>Also,most routers have its software/drivers to install,get either at router mfg web.....</p>

<p>Yes windows 7 needs the drivers. If it is an older router, Windows 7 most likely has the generic drivers for his modem. Some ISP providers send you a connecting CD to set up network and install drivers. I would use that or download it from them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if drivers provided on Win 7 OS and then if fixed and connected boot to XP and see if connected too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, but the router from ISP is locked with XP as the machine your ISP used to setup&nbsp;for internet access and your network. I been through this same exact situation many years ago. So the main machine, which is XP, needs to be connected to router to allow
 setup for Windows 7 internet/network access. But it isn't connected because he has booted to 7 and XP is no longer the main machine connected to allow ISP to allow 7 to use network. It is a possibility. Not saying it is fact. Depends on ISP and their system
 and procedures. Like I said could be simple fix or could be more sinister to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be numerous reasons causing this issue. </p>

<p>Ya, my <strong>VDSL2</strong> router and even my VDSL, windows 7 and 10 had generic drivers for it. took 15 seconds to install them automatically and then took ISP about 30 seconds to connect. Only have to enter your PPP user and password and use set up
 CD&nbsp;for router&nbsp;and ISP customer setup to connect the first time 15 years ago. I never had to use a CD or enter anything changing routers or upgrading to VDSL2 router and faster speed, except for the new wireless encryption key or PIN# if using WPS. I did have
 to run setup shown in&nbsp;photo on bottom after new modem/router or Subscription change to faster speeds. All info already stored and qwest reconfigures automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All he has to do is go to:</p>
<p>Network folder. If drivers are installed it should show Modem/Router there.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9220a732-0411-4f99-8ead-44e43b4806c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9220a732-0411-4f99-8ead-44e43b4806c0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on that (Modem/Router) and select properties.</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;properties Window click on "Settings"</p>
<p>You will see if you are connected to ISP</p>

            <p>I have not explored what you are trying to do but you what you have downloaded&nbsp;is an
<em>evaluation</em> copy. I would not expect it to come with a product key. Install it to your virtual environment and I would expect that you should get 120 days free, after which you would be expected to
<em>purchase</em> a product key to continue use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do <strong><em>not</em></strong> expect that you will be able to legitimately purchase a product key though. XP has not been in production or sold for years, look at the date on the download page (15 Apr 2005).</p>

            <p>So far as I am aware, MS haven't offered the XP Evaluation for download for years - they certainly haven't sold&nbsp;the product&nbsp;for years (except possibly in the Embedded form).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is however still a 90-day trial of Windows 7 Enterprise edition available.</p>

            It is sad to see a random response from an MCC. The download is still available on the MS site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=33656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=33656</a>, as anyone can see.
 The OS installed *does* require activation, otherwise it dies after a month of use.
<div><br />
<div>Using Windows 7 can not substitute XP in development and testing, which will be required. As of today, XP constitutes about 40% of the OS installation base.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>It is expected for Microsoft officials to dismiss the need to support XP users, however I hope that community could have a different attitude.</div>

            Its seems like you are running an earlier version of Windows 10, probably version 1507 or 1511. 
<br />
<br />Mobile Hotspot was first introduced in version 1607.
<br />
<br />I recommend you try upgrading to a later release in order to user Mobile Hotspot.

<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created.

<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.

<p>Hi Christa,<br />
<br />
There could be a lot of reasons why this is happening to your browsers, one of them could be caused by a program that is running in the background. Second, it could be a software that's retaining the settings of the browsers. We would like to know more about
 the issue, please provide answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us if you made any changes to the settings of your PC?</li><li>Were you able to perform a full system scan using your antivirus software?</li><li>Do you remember downloading any programs recently?</li></ul>
<p>

    <title>Vista unable to see network drives but other machines working fine - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vista unable to see network drives but other machines working fine</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Really silly and simple problem that's driven me round the twist as I can't see what's causing the problem.<br />
<br />
I have 2 laptops and 2 network drives on the same network set up as follows;<br />
<br />
- 1 laptop running windows 7.<br />
- 1 laptop running windows Vista<br />
- 1 dedicated NAS connected via Ethernet that's also a media server<br />
- 1 USB drive converted to a NAS by connecting the drive to the router's USB port<br />
<br />
The windows 7 laptop can access the internet and network drives fine and access the Vista laptop - all is fine with this machine.<br />
<br />
The Vista laptop can access the internet and Windows 7 laptop but I'm unable to 'see' the network drives when browsing the network to map the drives.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, both the laptops have the same settings and are in the same Workgroup as each other and the Network drives.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Grahame<br />

    <title>I can&#39;t install windows 7 after wiping out my hardrive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amit182  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t install windows 7 after wiping out my hardrive.</h2>
                    Ok SO here's the story. I had Windows Vista on my laptop that I upgraded to Windows 7. I made recovery disks for both Vista and 7, and they did work in the past. I tried Windows 8-Developer edition. I hated it to put it mildly and decided to go back to
 W7 while still saving my data. So I booted with Ubuntu Live CD and deleted all files except my data folder (deleted program files, boot files, Windows, Windows.old, Users, app data, etc), tried to boot got bootmgr is missing. Great! So I try to boot with W7..
 It tried to install but in minutes have me the error 0x00000e9 which tells me that the DVD-ROM may have been removed unexpectedly.. Not the case. Tried installing with this same DVD on a different laptop, it works fine. So tried to install Vista. Same error...
 Tried XP SP3 CD, "Unexpected error". I thought Ooops, there goes the laptop.. Will have to get a new drive installed.. Just tried Ubuntu CD anyways.. It INSTALLED!!! So I'm taking a wild guess here that the hardware is not the issue. I tried to play a DVD
 movie on Ubuntu and that works... So I assumed something on HDD stopping a windows installation.. I removed partitions and complete formatted (not quick format) the HDD found no errors and went thru all the steps again.. I cannot install any version of Windows..
 From XP&gt;Vista&gt;Windows7&gt;Windows8. Can anyone help me here please? <br />
PS: I have tried the DVD's on another laptop (an older one) and they all work there, so I am assuming its not the scratched media. Plus I can not find a bootable USB stick.
<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us try the methods mentioned below, and check if they help.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Format the Drive<br />
The steps here are to use the command line to format the disk properly using the diskpart utility.<br />
<div><strong>Note: </strong>This will erase everything on your drive. <br />
a.&nbsp;Plug in your USB Flash Drive<br />
b.&nbsp;Open a command prompt as administrator (Click on Start, All Programs, Accessories, right click on Command Prompt and select “Run as administrator.)”<br />
c.&nbsp;Find the drive number of your USB Drive by typing the following into the Command Prompt window:<br />
diskpart<br />
list disk<br />
The number of your USB drive will listed. You’ll need this for the next step.&nbsp; I’ll assume that the USB flash drive is disk 1.<br />
d.&nbsp;Format the drive by typing the next instructions into the same window. Replace the number “1” with the number of your disk below.<br />
select disk 1<br />
clean<br />
create partition primary<br />
select partition 1<br />
active<br />
format fs=NTFS<br />
assign<br />
exit<br />
When that is done you’ll have a formatted USB flash drive ready to be made bootable.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> Make the Drive Bootable <br />
Next we’ll use the bootsect utility that comes on the Vista or Windows 7 disk to make the flash drive bootable.&nbsp; In the same command window that you were using in method 1:<br />
a.&nbsp;Insert your Windows Vista / 7 DVD into your drive.<br />
b.&nbsp;Change directory to the DVD’s boot directory where bootsect lives:<br />
d:<br />
cd d:\boot<br />
c.&nbsp;Use bootsect to set the USB as a bootable NTFS drive prepared for a Vista/7 image. I’m assuming that your USB flash drive has been labeled disk G:\ by the computer:<br />
bootsect /nt60 g:<br />
d.&nbsp;You can now close the command prompt window, we’re done here.<br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong> Copy the installation DVD to the USB drive<br />
The easiest way is to use Windows explorer to copy all of the files on your DVD on to the formatted flash drive.&nbsp; After you’ve copied all of the files the disk you are ready to go.<br />
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong> Set your BIOS to boot from USB.<br />
This is where you’re on your own since every computer is different. Most BIOS’s allow you to hit a F2 key at boot and select a boot option.<br />
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now try installing&nbsp; using USB.</div>

<p><span>The slipstreaming works (it was getting to the hard drive copying the OS down and starting windows) but MDT has a process where it decides what plug and play drivers you need and injects them. I found
 it did not "decide wisely" and the install was balking on drivers MDT chose to put down not the issues covered in the slipstreaming article for the NVMe drives</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I slipstreamed all the divers needed into the wim (it’s a copy of our current standard build wim file) for this machine specifically and turned off the inject drivers in MDT (as well as cleaned out

            I got stung like that years ago. Best advice is to not sell redeem codes as you run the risk of this. In my case he said the code was used and demanded his money back via ebay.&nbsp;

            No. If you were to contact support they could verify if it's been used or not (which you already know) but they won't say to what account. Unfortunately it's always a bit risky buying and selling codes through ebay for reasons like this.&nbsp;

<h2>            DVD&#47;CD drive &#40;HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GH15F&#41; not recognized after upgrade to Windows 7</h2>
                    Shortly after upgrading from Vista to Windows 7 I noticed my DVD/CD drive was not being recognized (...not identified when click&nbsp;"Computer" on Start menu). When I go to the Device Manager&nbsp;under the General tab, I get the following message:<br />
<br />
"Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code
 52)".<br />
<br />
I have tried updating the driver, but apparently all my drivers are up to date.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to correct the problem.<br />

    <title>Homegroup connectivity problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Homegroup connectivity problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP desktop and an HP tablet both running Windows 10 Creators version. &nbsp;I have created a homegroup on the desktop and joined the tablet to the homegroup. &nbsp;Both machines show up under homegroup on both machines. &nbsp;I have shared "documents" and "printer"
 on both machines.</p>
<p>BUT &nbsp;when I go into homegroup on the tablet and click on the desktop icon under homegroup I cannot see any shared folders - there is an icon for "documents" but it is greyed out.</p>
<p>HOWEVER when I go into homegroup on the desktop and click on the tablet icon under homegroup I can see all the shared folders and more and I can access the files in those folders and use them. &nbsp;I can also copy/paste files from desktop to tablet - no problem</p>
<p>I have run homegroup troubleshooter on both machines - no problems found - but suggests problems might be network connected - so ran network troubleshooter on both machines. &nbsp;On the tablet the results say "your computer is set up correctly but the HP Envy-desktop-
 is not responding. &nbsp;On the desktop he results say "no problems found" but firewall might be blocking this. &nbsp;I have compared firewall settings (Defender) on both machines - hey are the same. &nbsp;I have checked "advanced" homegroup settings on both machines and
 they are both the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One further thing - I purchased the HP Pavilion at the beginning of August and set up homegroup between both machines and everything worked OK. But I started to get this problem at the beginning of September and it seems it was after I had installed a Windows
 update.</p>
<p>I have re-set the HP pavilion back to when I first bought it and have brought it up to date with Windows updates. &nbsp;I have restored the HP desktop to a time when I knew the homegroup was working. &nbsp;But nothing has solved this problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM DEFEATED - does anyone out there have the answer</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Hi Darleen</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your prompt reply</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>In answer to your questions&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On both machines the Windows installed is Windows 10 Home 1703</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For a 64-bit operating system x 64-based processor</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do not use any other user profile on either machine</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Neither computer is attached to a domain</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regarding the HomeGroup link you sent me I have looked at the info given.&nbsp; I should mention I am not a computer novice having used computers for the last 30+ years.&nbsp; I am quite competent
 at setting up home groups to work properly and have used the procedures given many times over without experiencing any problems.&nbsp; However this time I am completely defeated as to the cause of the problem, that is why I contacted the Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>I have no problem looking at files on Pavilion from ENVY – I have today copy/paste files from ENVY to Pavilion.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>I have tried again today to view the files on homegroup from Pavilion to ENVY I can see the shared folder icons
 but I now get the following message when I try and access them</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a5ffd99-d9d6-403a-96aa-6fb940709484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a5ffd99-d9d6-403a-96aa-6fb940709484" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I have today un-shared the folders on the ENVY and the icons disappear when viewed from the Pavilion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have then re-shared the folders using both selecting just Valerie Wright
 – which is the Pavilion user name – and the option to allow view &amp; edit by all homegroup users – however the icons still look “blank” and I keep getting the above message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Thanks for your help</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Valerie</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, but I do not understand the comment "since your device is connected to a domain".&nbsp; I said to you in answer to your question previously, that neither of the computers involved was connected to a domain, having assumed by "domain"
 you were referring to a website.&nbsp; If not then please explain your use of "domain". &nbsp;</p>
<p>But even if the problem is domain-based it does not explain why I have not had this problem before with other home group connections over the years and why there was no problem for the first month that I used the HP Pavilion and HP Envy together.&nbsp; Nor does
 it explain why I have this problem with the home group link from HP Pavilion to HP Envy but not with the home group link from HP Envy to HP Pavilion.</p>

<p>The domain we are referring to is a form of a computer network, in which all computers, printers and other security principals, are registered with a central database located in one or more clusters of central computers known as domain controllers. Windows
 domains are typically used on large networks, such as corporate networks and government networks. Windows domain allows network administrators to manage a large number of computers and control them from one device. If your device is connected to a domain,
 it requires advanced troubleshooting steps. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your explanation regarding the meaning of "domain". &nbsp; From which I can say categorically that my two computers are not connected to such a "domain".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My husband has a desktop &amp; a laptop both using Win10 and I have a desktop &amp; a laptop both using Win10.&nbsp; We live in France and have an Orange Livebox which we use as a router to connect to the internet and we also use the wifi connection through this box
 to set up home group.&nbsp; My two computers are connected to each other by wifi through a home group; at the moment my husbands computers are not connected to this home group. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat that the problem only occurs when I try to access the desktop from the laptop via my home group.&nbsp; When I save documents from desktop to laptop I have no problem But if I work on document or spreadsheet on the laptop I am not able to save it directly
 to the desktop via the home group.&nbsp; I have to use the desktop to go into the laptop via home group and use copy/paste. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I get when using the laptop to access the desktop via home group does not make any sense - it talks about not having permission to use this network resource and to contact the administrator of the server.&nbsp; It also talks about a "logon failure"
 - "the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you an explanation of this please and then I might be able to sort this problem</p>

<p>We appreciate your detailed response. Damaged system components is one of the possible reasons why you are experiencing issues with saving files from your laptop to your desktop using the HomeGroup. For initial troubleshooting, we suggest running the automated
 troubleshooter for HomeGroup issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the HomeGroup troubleshooter, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key + X and then choose Control Panel. </li><li>Click on Network and Internet.</li><li>Select HomeGroup and then click Start the HomeGroup troubleshooter. </li><li>Click the Next button and then click on Skip this step. </li><li>Wait for the troubleshooter to finish the process. </li><li>Restart the computer after running the troubleshooter. </li><li>Check if the issue persists. </li></ol>

<p>Thank you for your message &amp; instruction</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say that I was not able to follow steps 1 &amp; 2 - the "Press Windows key + X" did not work so I went straight to Control Panel.&nbsp; There was no option "Network &amp; Internet" but there was "network &amp; sharing" - which I used to get to the Home group page
 and was then able to follow the steps.&nbsp; I was then able to access the documents on my HP ENVY via home group on my HP Pavilion. &nbsp; When I started up the computers this morning I still had that access.&nbsp; SUCCESS.&nbsp; However just before carrying out this procedure
 I had downloaded a cumulative update, so I am not certain which action was responsible for the good result</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I am curious about is that I have run the trouble-shooter before and it has not solved the problem, but then I have not "skipped" running the network trouble shooter and I have not restarted the computer after running the trouble shooter.&nbsp; Perhaps that
 is where I went wrong</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep these instructions on hand just in case I get another home group problem like this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you or your help</p>

<p>Hi Darleen - it is Valerie Wright again.&nbsp; Further to my reply of 2nd October saying that the homegroup problem was resolved;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have to report that the problem reoccurred yesterday and although I again followed the instructions you gave me on 1st October,
 I have not been able to get back homegroup connectivity between my 2 HP computers. Again I can see the Pavilion when going into homegroup on the ENVY, but when I click on homegroup on the Pavilion I am told the ENVY is not available. All that changed yesterday
 was that I downloaded a Microsoft Cumulative update KB4041676!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried coming out of the homegroup and then re-joining but although I am told there is a homegroup available to join when I follow the procedure and put in HG password nothing happens
 - the computer sat there for over 5min trying to connect.&nbsp; Have you any further helpful suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again</p>

<p>Hi Valerie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you provided, you mentioned that your two HP computers received an update then that's the time they were not able to get back to the Home Group. With this, we suggest that you try to uninstall the updates on both computers and
 try connecting back to the homegroup and let see if you'll get the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Your mic isn&#39;t working, try a different one&#34; - Razer Seiren</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Skype on my phone for a long time to speak with friends. However, I have recently tried to transition over to PC. I can log in perfectly fine and I can hear my friends through my speakers. However, when I select my mic in the settings, I get
 the message in a bar at the time of my screen saying <em>"Your mic&nbsp;isn't working, try a different one"</em>. This problem has persisted and I can not find a way for my mic to work on skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Razer Seiren microphone by Razer. I use this mic for gaming and it works perfectly fine in games and editing software such as Sony Vegas Pro. I contacted Razer and did all of their troubleshooting steps and they&nbsp;came to the result that it
 is an issue with Skype. I am using windows 10 version 1709 (OS Build 16299.248) All my updates and drivers do not require updates and I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype numerous times. As you can see I have gone through all the steps
 before writing this comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know whether there needs to be an update on Skype to support the Razer Seiren or all Razer products as many comments are to do with Razer products. Please tell me different ways on how to fix this issue or bring out an update to support the Razer
 Seiren microphone. I do not want to stop using Skype but if this issue persists I will have to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype detects the microphone perfectly fine however the audio still doesn't work. My mic&nbsp;is
<strong>not</strong> on mute. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for reading and replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Skype&nbsp;version is "Skype 12.1803.279.0" Like I said before, I am using windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using a headset, I clearly stated I was using a microphone, a microphone on its own. My microphone is USB if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I play the audio through my speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if you had properly read my question I said what the error message was. But it is as shown -</p>
<p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the misunderstanding for saying Headset, because one of my friends just bought a bundle of Razer mic + headset/headphone bundle, so the headphone's came through my mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to your issue. There was this one user, what he/she did is to change the microphone permissions via Windows 10 settings.
