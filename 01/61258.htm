            Hi Andre.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where and when are you seeing this?  
<br />
<br /> Are you having any problems with Windows Update?  
<br />
<br />there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most through way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

                    As the title says. I downloaded a game folder which I have used on Windows Vista without any problems, but now I am getting "access denied" messages on each file. Just wonder if anyone might know why. OS is now Windows 8.

            <p>Hi RuairidhMacAoidh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for opting Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks that you are getting ‘Access Denied’ error when you try to open a game folder in Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask you a question before we move towards the troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Are you getting this error only with this particular folder or with any other folder?</p>
<p>2) What is the exact/ complete error message you are getting?<br />
3) Have you logged in to your computer with Administrative account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three things you can try that may help resolve issues with "Access Denied" error messages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>You may not have ownership of a file or folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you recently upgraded your computer to Windows 8 from a previous version of Windows, some of your account information may have changed and you may no longer have ownership of some of your files or folders. You might be able to resolve this by taking ownership
 of the file or folder. To take ownership of a file or folder, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a) </strong>&nbsp;Long press the folder you want to take ownership of, then tap
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
<strong>b) </strong>&nbsp;(If you are using a mouse, right click the folder, then click Properties.)<br />
<strong>c)</strong>&nbsp; Tap or click the Security tab, tap or click <strong>Advanced</strong>, then tap or click
<strong>Change</strong>.<br />
<strong>d)&nbsp; </strong>Tap or click <strong>Edit</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<strong>e) </strong>&nbsp;Type the name of the person you want to give ownership to and click
<strong>Check Names</strong>.<br />
<strong>f)&nbsp; </strong>The person that you’re giving ownership will have their account displayed in the box, click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<strong>g)</strong>&nbsp; If you want that person to be the owner of files and subfolders in this folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects </strong>check box.<br />
<strong>h) </strong>&nbsp;Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: You may not have the proper permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems accessing files or folders may be related to permissions. Permissions are rules associated with files and folders that determine whether you can access or make changes to the files or folders. To check the permission of the file or folder, follow
 these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a) &nbsp;</strong>Long press or right-click the file or folder, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
<strong>b) </strong>&nbsp;Tap or click the <strong>Security </strong>tab.<br />
<strong>c) </strong>&nbsp;Under <strong>Group </strong>or <strong>user names</strong>, tap or click your name to see the permissions you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open a file, you need to have read permission. To change permissions on a file or folder, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: You may need to be logged on as an administrator to change file and folder permissions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a) </strong>&nbsp;Long press or right-click the file or folder, and then tap or click
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
<strong>b) </strong>&nbsp;Tap or click the <strong>Security </strong>tab.<br />
<strong>c)</strong>&nbsp; Under <strong>Group </strong>or <strong>user names</strong>, tap or click your name to see the permissions you have.<br />
<strong>d) &nbsp;</strong>Tap or click <strong>Edit</strong>, then check the check boxes for the permissions that you need and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: The file or folder may be Encrypted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Encrypting files is a way to protect them from unwanted access; you will not be able to open an encrypted file without the certificate that was used to encrypt it. To see if the file or folder is encrypted, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>&nbsp; Long press or right-click the file, and then tap or click Properties.<br />
<strong>b)&nbsp; </strong>Tap or click the General tab, and then tap or click Advanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Encrypt contents to secure data check box is selected, you need the certificate that was used to encrypt the file to open it.
</p>
<p>You should get the certificate from the person who created or encrypted the file or folder, or have that person un-encrypt it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Graphics&#47;Screen Problems</h2>
                    


Samsung NP680Z5E-X01US laptop which has the Intel HD 4000/AMD Radeon 8700/8800 hybrid graphics system.  After upgrade to 8.1: 



1. System just booted to a black screen with the mouse pointer in the center, nothing else.  Googling shows this was a problem at least three months ago with HD4000 drivers and 8.1 candidates, the suggestion was to roll back the driver to pre 8.1 release.  That has the computer working again, but... 



2. With the older driver (which is what was installed before the 8.1 upgrade) the screen brightness function does not work.  The sliders move around, but do nothing - used to work. 



3. The Intel graphics control center won't load.  Just crashes. 



4. Screen fonts are terrible and fuzzy.  Used to be a very nice looking display, now pretty much ****. 



4. AMD only has a beta driver for 8.1, and the control center crashes when you try to use it. 



Turns out (with hindsight) that all of these were issues with pre-release versions of 8.1, how come they did

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have the unusual desktop setup of dual monitors + dual gfx cards. AMD/ATI HD 7850 and the IGP Intel HD 4000. After updating to Win 8.1 I lost the monitor on the IGP connection. I tried in vain to update the Intel drivers and experienced the same issues
 i.e. the Intel console wouldn't start.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Upgrading the AMD/ATI drivers fixed the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please, try that. It worked for me, it might work for you....</div>

            Any driver issues are the responsibility of the manufacturer not Windows 8.1 or Microsoft, always has been always will be. So your issue is with them. Good Luck. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

<div>Your own Muir quote says it best, it's not just the hardware manufacturer's fault, everything is linked. &nbsp;Maybe the hardware people did crappy coding, or maybe Microsoft didn't release sufficient information to allow good coding. &nbsp;But, it was the 8.1 update,
 which also installed new drivers for the hardware, that broke the system, and that is all Microsoft. &nbsp;I didn't go get the new (faulty) drivers, Microsoft did. Rolling back the driver to the last 8.0 good version seems to be working fine, but it was a lot of
 pain to get there. &nbsp;Shouldn't be. &nbsp;Especially for a sub version upgrade. &nbsp;In the entire software world, moving from 8.0 (for clarity) to 8.1 shouldn't break how the drivers interact with the hardware, it's a sub version upgrade. &nbsp;If you're going to do such
 drastic work that it interferes with how the hardware talks to the system it should be labeled as a new version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just my opinion.&nbsp;</div>

            Your not going to get anywhere the issue is with the Manufacturer period. No exceptions. IT is the Manufacture of the hardware/software responsibility to make sure their product will operate correctly in Windows 8.1. It is time all you Microsoft bashers
 put the blame for these issues where it belongs.-with the third party Manufacturer, period. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

            I'm having the same problem - lost my second monitor after the update, have tried installing the updated AMD Graphic Drivers but then the system crashes and I get the blue screen - I have a feeling it is because of LucidLogixs Virtu MVP - which doesn't
 seem to be compatible - but I can't remove it post 8.1 install ... To fix, I am probably going to clean install 8 then update 8.1 and try again.. .else just roll it back to 8 and keep it there for a while..

</strong></font></span>I have a Samsung NP680Z5E-X01US system with Windows 8 Pro. I have upgraded the BOIS and all Samsung software as well as Windows 8 updates. After installing Windows 8.1, the system reboots and displays a black screen. There are no error
 messages, just a black screen. I am able to move and see the mouse, but unable to see anything else. Once I was able to get into safe mode and the Device Manager shows a PNP Monitor for the Display. Even though I am able to use the touch screen. When I try
 to go to the Samsung Support page to fin drivers for my model, I get a Page Not Found. This happens on a Windows and Mac computer.

<blockquote>Samsung NP680Z5E-X01US laptop which has the Intel HD 4000/AMD Radeon 8700/8800 hybrid graphics system. After upgrade to 8.1: 1. System just booted to a black screen with the mouse pointer in the center, nothing else. Googling shows this was a problem
 at least three months ago with HD4000 drivers and 8.1 candidates, the suggestion was to roll back the driver to pre 8.1 release. That has the computer working again, but... 2. With the older driver (which is what was installed before the 8.1 upgrade) the screen
 brightness function does not work. The sliders move around, but do nothing - used to work. 3. The Intel graphics control center won't load. Just crashes. 4. Screen fonts are terrible and fuzzy. Used to be a very nice looking display, now pretty much ****.
 4. AMD only has a beta driver for 8.1, and the control center crashes when you try to use it. Turns out (with hindsight) that all of these were issues with pre-release versions of 8.1, how come they didn't get fixed? And when will they get fixed? Please don't
 suggest I get the latest drivers, I've done that and they don't work. This is why people by Apple products, as Mr. Jobs said "it just works". Now I get the runaround of Samsung pointing to Intel pointing to AMD pointing to Microsoft pointing back to Samsung,
 all because a software release by Microsoft broke what was a wonderful system. Very disappointed that an upgrade to a minor version increment could do this much damage.

<p>yes, your digital games and Xbox Live Gold are tied to your gamertag, so if you setup your friends X1 as your home console, then he will have access to your digital games and Xbox Live Gold, and since it will be the home console, your gamertag does not have
 to be signed in, and then when you sign into your console, you will also have access to your games and Live as well.</p>
<p>something to note, you can only set a console as your home console 3 times a year, and i don't believe this is an official feature, so while MS doesn't seem to care, that could change in the future.</p>

<p>For the people "sharing" games...if your friend breaks the C.O.C./T.O.U. while playing a game of yours on the Home console that is at their house, would your account get banned? Say he mods lobbies in C.O.D. (Your game/home console), would you get the punishment?
 Personally wouldn't want to find out the hard way that was the case. </p>

<p>Good advice. While you (Not saying you are participating.) may have a great friend/many friends that you could trust, I believe a lot of people are not so cautious with whom they are sharing, and are trying to save a few bucks with someone they don't know
 all that well. Microsoft needs to address this practice and tell once and for all if it's acceptable or not, and the rules on how and when; great idea and selling point if it is.</p>

<p>So what's everyone's username and password? Seriously though, MS seem a bit relaxed about this at the moment, I still wouldn't do it as this practice can ban consoles on PSN, It's npt a good idea unless it's family that you can trust.</p>

<p>It is a grey area, that kind of feature is mainly allowed for 2 Xbox ones in the same household, in theory YOU must own both consoles for this to be within Microsoft terms and conditions, so whatever you do, keep that in mind as they can enforce their policy
 at any time they choose.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Realms Replace world</h2>
                    Hi, I am attempting to add coordinates to my realms server. I understand I have to download the realms world first. Then open the world settings and turn on "show coordinates". I open and play the world to verify its on. then I try to replace realms world.
 Here is where the issue is, the upload initializes and then just shows the loading bars that are sweeping back and forth. if i let it sit alone for an hour and come back to it the loading bars are gone and only the cancel button is present. Both windows 10
 and xbox one do this. any insight&nbsp; would be appreciated.

            <p>​Hi,<br />
<br />
</p>
<div><span><br />
<span>As I understand, you don’t have<span> </span></span></span><span>a consistent internet connection during the upgrade process.</span><span>
</span><span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span><span>You may perform a <b>Hardware Clean boot</b> to disable the devices and check if the issue occurs.</span></div>
<div><span>a. Press Windows logo + X and select "<b>Device Manager</b>".</span></div>
<div><span>b. In Device Manager, disable the items in <b>Display Adapter, Floppy disk drive, Intel(R) Network, Modem and Sound, Video &amp; Game Controllers</b>.</span></div>
<div><span>c. Right click on each of the devices and select <b>Disable</b>.</span></div>
<div><span>After disabling the devices and third party programs check if you are able to install Windows 8.</span></div>
<div><span>Once you have upgraded to Windows 8 enable the devices. Also refer to the computer manufacturer website and install the latest version of Windows 8 drivers.<br />
<br />
<div><span>Place the computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></div>
<div><span>Follow the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></div>
<div><span>Step 1:</span></div>
<div><span>a. Press the<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></div>

<div><span>c. Click the<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></div>
<div><span>d. On the<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></div>
<div><span>e. On the<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></div>
<div><span>f. On the<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window</b>under<b> startup tab,
</b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></div>
<div><span>g. Click<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></div>
<div><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished the installation, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></div>
<div><span>a. Press the<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></div>
<div><span>b. In the<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></div>

<h2>            Not enough hard drive space to update Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Support,<br />
<br />
I have an HP Stream 13 with at 32GB SSD. I purchased the computer preloaded with Windows 10. The computer was performing updates fine, but recently the updates have stopped and I receive a message saying that I need at least 8BG of hard drive space to make
 any additional updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have version 10240 and my PC is trying to download updates for version 14393.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleaned up every possible file on my computer, deleted all temporary files, unnecessary applications including HP bloatware, and still only have 6.8GB available to use. I'm running the most barebones version of Windows I can think of an have deleted
 all personal documents and photos as well. I also ran programs like CCleeaner to help with this cleanup process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Windows ever going to release an update that can lift the 8GB requirement? If I had known I would have been stuck in eternity without any future Windows updates or drivers, I would have never purchased this computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>P</p>

<h2>            How to remove computer from Network</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I have a computer running XP that was set up to be part of a network domain (it was set up for an office environment)</p>
<p>Now we don't connect to that network anymore and I would like to remove that domain without doing a complete clean install of XP.</p>
<p>I tried to login using (XXX/this computer) and I am able to login but obviously I don't see any of my documents, wireless networks etc.</p>
<p>How do I transfer everything so that I can remove the domain without losing any data. emails, and apps loaded?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
You need to perform a clean installation in this case. Or the other way is to contact the system administrator of the domain.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<p>Hi If I need to perform a clean install here is the dilemma: I have 3 DELL computers in the house and i found a couple of Windows XP disks but&nbsp;I don't know exactly which disk belongs to which computer. Does it matter?</p>
<p>Can I just pick one and use it to do a clean install?</p>
<p>I would rather not&nbsp;do a clean install because I may not have all the disks for all the applications. BTW what would contacting the network admin do? I have admin access to the computer already.</p>

<p>Hi Jack, I don't really understand your instructions. I don't have a home network.</p>
<p>I really would like someone to tell me if I can use any disks to do a clean install using "any" windows XP disks, when I don't know which disk belong to which computer. That will help me out a lot.</p>
<p>(I have 3 DELL computers in the house and i found a couple of Windows XP disks but&nbsp;I don't know exactly which disk belongs to which computer. Does it matter? Can I just pick one and use it to do a clean install?)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If all the computers are Dell&nbsp; and the disk are&nbsp; too, it does not matter which disk you use.</p>
<p>However, the Key that is typed in has to be the one that is on the computer's case sticker.</p>
<p>P.S. If the computers configuration is Not blocked&nbsp; by the domain configuration (or you have the credentials) you can just change it to a WorkGroup configuration. It does not really need to be on one.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
From the description provided, it seems that this issue happens after upgrading to Windows 10. Since you can access anything on your computer, we suggest that you disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if you are able to boot
 to the desktop. <br />
<br />
Update us with the result.

Well, the problem happened while I was trying to flash Windows 10 over the top of Chrome OS, so I doubt Windows 10 did anything. :/

    <title>Windows 10 Administrator rights issue... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr.rrivera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Administrator rights issue...</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed an old game I had laying around Civ 3, and once installed when I tried to open the game to play I got a prompt that administrative privileges were needed to open file.&nbsp; I am the owner of the pc and administrator, I install and remove programs
 and set all settings as I see fit.&nbsp; Why is it asking for administrative privileges?&nbsp; So I did a search on the web and applied the following "FIX":</p>

Step 1.
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
Click the "Start" menu, select "All Programs" and open the "Accessories" folder. Right-click "Command Prompt" and select "Run as Administrator" from the drop-down menu. Click "Continue."</p>

Step 2.
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
Enter "net user administrator /active:yes" in the command box and press "Enter."</p>

Step 3.
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
Log out of your account on the computer.</p>

Step 4.
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
Look for the new account on the log-in page. You should see the new "Administrator" account along with any other user accounts.</p>

Step 5.&nbsp;
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
Log in to the administrator account -- no password is necessary to log in. Set a password if you desire.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
After completing the above steps, I did see both options My original account and the administrative account.&nbsp; I logged in as administrator, fixed the desktop icons and proceeded to open and play the game.&nbsp; No working circle or anything happens.&nbsp; I went through
 file explorer and my DVD drive is not showing.&nbsp; Confused I open the DVD drive and made sure the disc was in properly and closed it.&nbsp; I look at file explorer and their it is.&nbsp; Game window open and I click Play game.&nbsp; Civ 3 Window disappears and the game does
 not start.&nbsp; I gave up!!!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
So I decide to open a document and work on something else.&nbsp; All my word, PDF documents are gone.&nbsp; My Music and photos are gone.&nbsp; :(</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
So I shut down windows 10 depressed... &nbsp; But figured "hey I can log back as my regular "Non administrative rights account" and get back all my stuff; a thought.&nbsp; To my disbelief, I do not get the option, upon boot up it goes straight to Administrative account.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
PLEASE tell me how to fix this and regain all my work, music and family photos.&nbsp; PLEASE...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
Thank you for your time and sorry for the long message...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">

            Which version of Windows the game was originally designed for? It might be too old to run on Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Try launching or reinstall the game in compatibility mode:

<h2>            laptop shift keys stopped working</h2>
                    <p>right and left shift keys stopped working while i was typing on word 2010. </p>
<p>when i pressed shift with question mark it displays this /</p>
<p>when i press shift with open bracket it displays this 9</p>
<p>when i press shift with another letter it displays a lowercase letter. i have to press caps lock in order to type uppercase letters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the shift keys don't work as well when i type texts on firefox browser. i haven't tried typing on other browsers. i am not computer savvy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in attempt to fix this problem i did the following:</p>
<p>unchecked sticky keys</p>
<p>system restore</p>
<p>updated keyboard driver</p>
<p>tried typing in safe mode</p>
<p>messed with region and language options location, keyboards and languages, change system locale, as i am outside US</p>
<p>
</p><p>all to no avail. both shift keys are still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, on-screen keyboard left and right shift keys are working properly and i am able to type the following characters: @ ! &amp; % ( ) + ~ * ^%$ Caps</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am typing a document that has to be completed in five days' time and it's really difficult without the shift keys.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help me fix this problem. thank you.</p>

            i just don't think it's hardware because i remember typing fast just before the problem occurred and i was holding down the right shift key trying to capitalise the letter s. i must've pressed the shift key repeatedly, which would've activated the sticky
 keys. however, after i unchecked the sticky keys option the problem continued, so it must be something else that seems to have disabled both shift keys.
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply though. </p>
<p>
</p><p>in any case i'll have to ask a comp tech to look into this, as i don't have the 'know how' nor the tools to open my laptop.

1. I was able to sign successfully into https://web.skype.com using Chrome (63.0.3239.84 64-bit), Safari (10.1.1 12603.2.4) and Firefox (57.0.1 64-bit) for Mac. On first try "Your security info change is still pending" screen was presented to me, but no empty
 screens afterwards. I've just tried to sign into all those browsers again and everything worked fine as before.<br />
<br />
2. While signing into Skype for Web I left "Keep me signed in" check box unchecked. As for Skype for iOS, I'm not sure how to check if auto sign in is turned on. Seems like in newest version there is no such setting anymore. At the same time I'm able to sign
 out, forget my account and sign in again without any issues into Skype for iOS.<br />
<br />
I've tried to sign in to Skype for Mac again for several times, but no luck.

<p>BTW, yesterday I received an SMS notification saying that "wait is over" and security info was replaced for my account. After a month of waiting I finally got to sign in to desktop version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this "blank page" issue definitely caused by extra <span>
"Your security info change is still pending" step. Please make sure bug is filed properly for this case.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, web version of Skype presented a warning saying that I should sign in to Skype again and started to open new Safari tabs periodically and eventually opened about 70 new tabs (refer to screen shot attached). This
 is hilarious. Not sure how to reproduce this&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;again.</span></p>

<h2>            PC Stuck in Infinite loop startup.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><strong>My computer build is:</strong></p>
<p>MSI Mobo Z87-G45 Gaming</p>
<p>GTX 760 OC 2GB </p>
<p>8G Gskill DDR3</p>
<p>i7-4770K</p>

<p>Toshiba 256 SSD (OS)</p>
<p>Samsung 128 SSD (storage)</p>
<p>3TB HDD (Storage)</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Issue:</strong></p>
<p>I apologize for the long post, but I want to be sure to be as detailed as possible.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yesterday, I began a Mcafee and GForce Experience Update on my pc.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I was also reading emails at the same time as normal from gmail.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, the mouse topped responding.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did a forced restart after about 5 minutes and got to just after the BIOS screen to a BSOD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The first error was: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCPETION.<span>&nbsp; </span>The computer restarted immediately and then began to just restart 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>I let the computer ‘rest’ and went back to try it again.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Before I turned it on, I reset the BIOS ans was able to at least get to the PC Recovery options.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was able to get so far as to restore it to a previous date and get in with some functionality.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While in, I attempted to uninstall the GForce experience and disable everything in startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then, the computer froze again without completing the uninstall.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I restart and get a BSOD: DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL.<span>&nbsp; </span>Frustrated again I left it after shutting it down for a few hours and attempted to restart.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It goes into the infinite looping of attempting to start bet never gets to the BIOS Flash screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I got to an advance trouble shooting screen option finally, tried to do another restore to no avail, then received a BSOD: MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I unhooked all the peripherals, turned off the power, cleaned the entire PC of any dust, also used electronics cleaner to clean of the connectors of the video card/memory.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was able to restart up to the PC Diagnostics again but at this point I tried using my image disc, but it came back invalid.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m out of things to try as now its just doing its looping startup and not getting to the BIOS flash screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can let it rest again and try, but I really don’t know what to do at this point.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any help even using commands in DOS would be helpful.<span>&nbsp; </span>I appreciate ANY help in advance as I am super frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its currently back at the restart mode, looping.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:&nbsp; </strong>Sometime, I get in (safemode) and then it just becomes non-responsive again, so then I have to restart. Could it possibly be the power to the MOBO or its connections?&nbsp; I do these retrys after I let the computer sit for 2-3 hours
 and it lets me in, but then it just stops again.</p>

            Hey,<br />
<br />
I had the same issues with my new&nbsp;laptop and I too was ready to smash the ____ out of it, but thank god i didn't.&nbsp; I finally found out a quick and permanent solution to our problem.&nbsp; I am currently using win 7 ultimate and this may work on all versions of windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Guaranteed
 to work the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't need to download&nbsp;error fixing programmes and pay money to down load drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just follow the steps below and it surely will fix your problem permanently.&nbsp; It may be&nbsp; a little inconvenience but it's worth&nbsp;doing it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Problem:&nbsp; any time u open, right click, or even try to open a file in windows explorer it says 'Windows explorer not responding, windows explorer is shutting down and restarting.'<br />
<br />
I read in many forums that it can be a virus and other stuff but if u have an antivirus programme, it should detect it and fix the issue.&nbsp;Here is a free antivirus programme from MS, it's free, so you don't have to pay renewal fees and other ____. Just clik
 on the link below and download MS Secutity essentials <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a>.&nbsp; It updates automatically so it's realtime protection.&nbsp; I hope you have backed up your pictures, music etc&nbsp; which may be effected by this change (only the files&nbsp;you choose to delete will be effected and nothing
 else, i asure you). So here is what u need to do to permenantly get rid of the frustration.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Turn off your computer<br />
2) Turn on your computer, when it's booting up, press "F8" to go into safe mode<br />
3) Black screen appears to verify your choice, choose "Safe mode"<br />
4) Once it brings you to your desktop, windows troubleshooter is displayed, close the window, it ain't gonna help<br />
5) Go into 'my computer' and locate the files causing the windows explorer to crash<br />
6) Once you have located the file 'Delete' the file, picture, video...etc.<br />
7) Empty the recycling bin once the file removal is complete<br />
8) Shut down computer and restart it normally and the windows explorer shouldn't crash anymore.<br />
<br />
I know deleting files such as music, video, pictures which you have downloaded from the web or your camera, email etc. is a pain in the butt to re-download or copy everything, but is it worth the frustration and money to fix the stupid problem yourself&nbsp;?<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this will help solve your poblem.&nbsp; Give me&nbsp;a shout back once you have fixed the error.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>There are so many posted problems like this one.&nbsp; I had 3 months living with a very similar experience with applications not responding apparently at random, toolbars freezing, windows explorer not responding and requiring a restart - even when just leaving
 the computer idle for an hour or so. -&nbsp; I tried all the suggested troubleshooting&nbsp; suggestions in the posts (except for reinstalling system software) and ran all the suggested restores, checks and tests...no problems were found and none of the suggested fixes
 by disabling of services or anti virus software, etc. worked beyond a few hours..&nbsp;</p>
<p>My solution (and it has been fixed for more than 30 days now) was to go to my manufacturer's support web site and carefully specify the system as exactly as possible (or use a service tag if you have one) and found there were two critical/urgent driver downloads:
 a bios update for my system and a newer SATA driver.</p>
<p>That fixed things and have had no problems with Vista (home premium 32 bit) since. -&nbsp; - DW</p>

            I conquer with earlier posts about virus and malware.&nbsp; AVG (free) didn't mind three things MS Security Essentials did.&nbsp; Once removed with that program, no further problems.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you very much for your reply. I have carefully gone through everything you say. I was not familar with Restore but completed the Restore exactly as advised. The Restore took me back to before an "Critical Update" timed at 1020h 9th Jan. So far so good
 - BUT - the update that appears to have done the damage was done sometime in the small hours of Fri 8th Jan (you will need to allow for American time - we are on CET). There didn't appear to be a restore time before that one. My next step was to attempt a
 repeat to step back from the Sat 9th update to before that of the Fri 8th Jan - but - there were no further restore points. It appears that one must ask for a Restore point before every update - but I've no idea how to do that. It seems I cannot chose a time
 retroactively - presumeably because files need to be backed up and thus a restore point must be chosen in advance - Am I right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I now have no hope for reversing the update of Friday 8th? Can you suggest any way to go back to before that fatal update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing all this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would I gain anything by the following:</p>
<p>1. Find and copy the driver files that are clearly identified as HP1120C related</p>
<p>2. "Remove Printer" for the HP 1120C</p>
<p>3. Copy back the driver files</p>
<p>4. Go through the "Add Printer" steps so that hopefully the system "finds" the driver files</p>
<p>5. The printer is on LPT1 - how do I make sure it goes back to the same place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would not help of course if the drivers themselves have been corrupted and I haven't been able to find replacement "clean" files to download as replacements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!! HELP!! Many thanks.</p>
<p>Donne</p>

            <p><span>Hi Donne,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to perform System Restore. It restores your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">,
</span><span>documents, or photos. However if there are no restore points shown we cannot go back.</span></p>

<h2>            Internet &#40;WiFi&#41; is slow on just one computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a seemingly impossible issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days after upgrading (clean upgrade from 8.1) to Windows 10, the internet went extremely slow. Fast on all other computers, just slow on this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome and Firefox can't load any pages at all. Internet Explorer can just load just a few, but can't download files at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ping tests come back normal. Its a clean install, so no malware/viruses but I scanned anyway; no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The internet is fast in Ubuntu</strong> (dual-boot). This rules out the adapter or any hardware problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different WiFi adapters that have different drivers, but its still slow with them too. This rules out driver problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, if its not the adapter, it must be the router! My 4G modem/router doesn't have LAN ports, so I used another computer, a spare router, and internet sharing to 'rebroadcast' the network via the spare router. Same problem. This rules out the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I'd been putting if off but all fingers point to Windows itself being the problem (after all, it can't be anything else!). I did a clean install back to Windows 8.1.
<strong>The internet is still slow!</strong> Windows 8 used to work, so why doesn't it now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss on what to do. After all, what more can you do than replace the router, the adapter, the driver, and Windows itself???!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, as mentioned earlier, the internet is fast in dual-boot Ubuntu. From there, I run Windows in a Virtual Box for the time being.</p>
<p>I'm taking the computer shortly to a friend who has an Ethernet port which I can use. Will post an update on the results for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Rishad. Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a desktop with an Acer Motherboard, Intel® Core™ i7-4790 CPU and&nbsp;GeForce GT 710 GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already followed all the steps on that page, to no avail. I even reinstalled Windows 8.1 again but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean it is a motherboard problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried it on my friend's router with Ethernet, and its slow there too.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox Play and Charge kit&#59; does it come with everything&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I wanna buy a rechargeable battery for my controller but when I look on the store, it gives multiple things. For example, there is a thing where you can buy it to recharge your battery and another thing to plug it in the console and controller with a wire.
 So, do I need to buy the wires AND the battery rechargeable thing or with the P&amp;C kit, the battery recharges when connected with the console and controller? Sorry, its sorta confusing.</p>

<p>A P&amp;C kit comes with a rechargeable battery pack that you place into your controller and leave there forever, and a cable that connects your controller to your xbox. &nbsp;The cable charges your controller as you're playing or even if it's connected while the
 console is off. &nbsp;A P&amp;C kit is all you need.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I had some problems with the two brands for play and charge. Hama and Speed link.</p>
<p>Hama had some visual &nbsp;defects, &nbsp;but technically it was relatively ok</p>
<p>Speedlinkl It has technical problems: the battery is discharging very quickly.</p>
<p>After a full charge if I put the battery out of the gamepad, in three days is completely discharged..</p>
<p>When I changed the brand &nbsp; I wanted to buy the original play and charge kit. This one
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/hard-drives/play-and-charge-kitMy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com/.../play-and-charge-kitMy</a> gamepad is for windows with a receiver</p>
<p>But the guy at the store, in which I did not really trust, He told me that this is only for xbox.</p>
<p>Then I bought Speedlink which was found to be defective.</p>
<p>So Tomorrow I go to the store to return it and I want to know if the original play and charge kit It can charge the battery from pc?</p>
<p>1. My gamepad is for windows with a receiver</p>
<p>Question: The Gamepad for xbox (console) and one for Pc (Windows) are the same?
</p>
<p>my Opinion: My logic, I must believe that they are teh same, the only difference is that the gamepad for pc has a receiver for sincronization.</p>
<p>2. People from xbox. fabricated a PC gamepad with receiver.</p>
<p>Question: where is the play and charging kit for PC?</p>
<p>my Opinion: The cable from play and charge kit is only for charging, with USB jack</p>
<p>It is just a charging cable with a rechargeable battery.</p>
<p>If the gamepad for xbox is the same with gamepad for pc, only difference is that the gamepad for pc has a receiver</p>
<p>Why the cable would not fit to PC?</p>
<p>3. So. Can I buy the original Play and charge kit to charge my gamepad from PC or not?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello. Yesterday I was called to go to the store as those in service had changed my product with a new one, but with the same brand (Speedlink). I put the &nbsp;game pad down for charging, exactly as written in the book. After it was fully charged &nbsp;I started
 to using it in gta 5. After 8 hours &nbsp;the controller began to indicate low battery and after another 3 hours completely discharged. So the charged battery lasted 11 hours .., not 40 as was written on the box. I would like to know if anyone can tell me, how
 many hours of gameplay resist the original xbox360 battery. And eventually if the &nbsp;play and charge kit for xbox one is compatible with xbox360 gamepad.
</p>
<p>I will test him two days after that I think I have to ask for money back and I will try to buy the &nbsp;play and charge kit Xbox360.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

    <title>The Dreaded Code 45 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadey_645  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Dreaded Code 45</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell laptop with Windows 10.&nbsp; I've had it for several months now.&nbsp; All of a sudden, I can no longer play CDs.&nbsp; The computer isn't acknowledging the drive at all.&nbsp; I went to the Device Manager and found the CD/DVD drive under Hidden Devices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked, the properties gave me a Code 45 (Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer.)&nbsp; This is
<em>ridiculous </em>as the CD drive is an internal device and I can't just unplug it or plug it back in.&nbsp; How on earth am I supposed to 'reconnect' it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue <em>does not</em> stem from a software update as the computer has always had Windows 10.&nbsp; I strongly hesitate to uninstall then reinstall the drive, as many are suggesting, as I've tried that with other things that have gone wrong in the past
 and seriously messed up the computer and then had to take it in to a computer fix-it place which charged me too much.&nbsp; I've tried Troubleshooting.&nbsp; I've tried scanning for hardware changes, and updating the driver software.&nbsp; I've rebooted my computer numerous
 times, so don't ask me to do <em>that </em>again as that doesn't fix it.&nbsp; I haven't dropped the laptop, or shaken it, so that isn't my problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some help would be greatly appreciated, but only if you use simple steps to follow please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I've searched the help forums, and I couldn't find anything similar to this problem.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can right click on the device in Device Manager then UNINSTALL it - reboot and it should be re-initialized. If that does not work then it is likely a hardware issue. You should check with Dell and/or a local shop (one that does its own repairs on Dell laptops).<br />
<br />
Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation,<strong> diagnostics</strong>, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
<p>
=====================================================<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting if you can&nbsp;get the drive&nbsp;recognized AND if needed. (Be sure to check with Dell.)<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X&nbsp; OR&nbsp; place the mouse in the lower left corner and Right Click - Command Prompt (ADMIN)<br />
<br />
Enter the below (or COPY and PASTE ) :<br />
<br />
<span>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001
</span>
</p><p>
</p><p>REBOOT&nbsp;<br />

See if that troubleshooter helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Control Panel - Device Manager - DVD-CD drivers -&nbsp;Right Click the drive -<br />
Driver Tab - Click Update Drivers -&nbsp;then Uninstall the drive - then&nbsp;restart the computer<br />

Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10<br />

</span></a><br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all &nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on <br />
another computer&nbsp;since your's will not start - XP, Vista,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8/8.1 , or 10<br />
or even running&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;does not matter).&nbsp;You could also try booting with <br />
another Windows disk&nbsp;- any OS though do not use&nbsp;it to try to ANY&nbsp;repairs <br />
unless it is absolutely the same&nbsp;version of Windows on your system - just <br />
boot to see if the drive&nbsp;works. You can even&nbsp;make a Windows 10 DVD boot<br />
disc&nbsp;by running the Windows Media Creation tool&nbsp;(on any computer) -<br />
<br />
Windows Media Creation Tool (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS<br />
version you are running.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set <br />
the boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Or ry booting to a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are <br />
not some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

    <title>Audio stopped working &#43; update difficulties - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio stopped working &#43; update difficulties</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Windows 10 on my laptop for a while, but just today my audio completely cut out. It worked perfectly up until today, and I don't think there was any significant change or update, so I'm not sure why it stopped working. I followed all of the steps
 in the sound problem troubleshooter and I've tried updating and reinstalling the drivers, but nothing has changed. The audio works fine through headphones, which makes me think it's an issue with the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there are several updates appearing in the Windows Update menu and its "View installed update history" section that say they need a restart to install, but I have restarted several times and these have not installed. One of these is "2018-01
 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4058258)." I tried the Windows Update troubleshooter, but to no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm mostly concerned with the audio problems. Does anyone have suggestions or recommendations for these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the audio issue is related to software, running the troubleshooting and updating the audio drivers should address the problem. We suggest that you check if the problem is isolated to a specific application. If the issue is isolated to a specific app,
 it means that the application is damaged and needs to be reinstalled. If the issue is happening to all of the applications on your computer, run the automated troubleshooter for playing sounds. To do so, visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, click on Find and fix problems playing sounds and then follow the prompts to successfully run the
 tool. If the same issue persists, you can consider bringing the device to a technician so that the hardware can be checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to your concern about installing an update, it will be best to boot computer into
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> before running Windows Update. This can reduce software conflicts while an update is being installed.
 We also recommend downloading the KB4058258 update using Windows Update Catalog. This
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/323166/how-to-download-updates-that-include-drivers-and-hotfixes-from-the-win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> serves as a guide on how to download updates from the Windows Update
 Catalog.</p>

<p>Ok I have a similar problem but not the same. I have no audio coming from installed games and games only on my windows 10 pc, any game I play through the browser if fine and videos/movies both have audio. I've been trying for a month now. I reinstalled and
 updated both my sound drivers being Nvidia HD And Realtek HD, tried turning off audio enhancements, used headphones, troubleshooted and couldnt find anything online either. It happened when I was playing roblox. The sound came off and I heard static sounds
 coming from my speakers then no audio coming from the game. This is what I picked up so far. I noticed that my checkers delux game that I dowloaded had audio..........so then I thought the problem could be directx since roblox, asphalt, GTA, Halo etc. would
 use directx but of course a checkers game wouldn't. So I started looking for audio problems relating to directx but none relating to my issue... I ended up just reinstalling windows and I was really dissapointed that even that didnt work so I had to reinstall
 my apps for nothing. This problem is VERY annoying and I just don't know what to do. My last resort is to carry it to some local technology guy but I was pretty surprised that even resetting windows didnt do anything so please help me.</p>

<h2>            EDGE  Microsoft needs a browser that works</h2>
                    <p>It seems that Microsoft dosn't want anyone else to have a browser to work with Windows 10. &nbsp;I am very, very disappointed with Windows 10 for many reasons, but Edge seems to be really, really bad. &nbsp;I have used Chrome but when I installed it the first time
 in a newly downloaded Windows 10 upgrade, it caused all sorts of problems that I never could correct. &nbsp;Had to start brand new. &nbsp; I just bought a second computer for my wife and have had constant problems with Edge with that one. &nbsp;I haven't tried Chrome with
 that yet, because the forums seem to be full of problems being reported. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend a Good, Working browser other than EDGE?</p>

            <p>I have returned the computer that I bought containing Windows 13 and went back to Window 7 on the computer my wife uses. &nbsp;I had bought her a new one because the old one was slow. &nbsp;The new computer failed and I returned it and am back to the older one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;When using it, it open, but very, very slowly at times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I remember one crash using Edge if you consider a Hang a crash. &nbsp;I had to force a stop and restart.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;For a while, I could't download Internet Explorer. &nbsp;I don't know the exact cause, but it just wouldn't download. &nbsp;It was as if Miccosoft recognized that I was downloading it to Windows 7 and wouldn't download because it wasn't compatible. &nbsp;Just before
 the computer failed, I did get to download if but didn't use it much before the failure. (I believe it was a hard drive failure)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;I did install all updates.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;I didn't make any Hardware changes. &nbsp;Nothing was added or removed. &nbsp;I had downloaded a few programs, such as Norton. &nbsp;The computer came with McAfee and I prefer Norton.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;I did get one once but it went with the computer and I didn't write it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't be of much help, but I don't think I will be using Windows 10 again unless forced to. &nbsp;Windows 7 is GREAT and I trust it and will stick with it as long as it is maintained.</p>

    <title>New EU Ruling Allows You to Sell your Digital Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cokney charmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            New EU Ruling Allows You to Sell your Digital Games</h2>
                    
<p>From StickTwiddlers:&nbsp;<a href="http://sticktwiddlers.com/2012/07/03/new-ruling-allows-you-to-sell-your-digital-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sticktwiddlers.com/2012/07/03/new-ruling-allows-you-to-sell-your-digital-games/</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>A recent court ruling in the EU has brought in a law that has essentially made the EULA worthless, meaning gamers can now re-sell their digital games and software</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://sticktwiddlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/steamlogobanner.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsticktwiddlers.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f11%2fsteamlogobanner-550x236.png" /><br />
</a></p>
<p><strong>The EULA, that is End-User License Agreement dictates what the end user, you, can do with the game, such as sell it, back it up, and archive. The EULA contains other things too, such as who is liable if the game causes issues with your PC/hardware.
 These are usually just regarded as terms and conditions, however, they are actually two different things.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It would seem now however, that the EULA has no real power. It usually dictates if you can re-sell a game, however a ruling from the&nbsp;<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-07/cp120094en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Court of
 Justice of the European Union</a>&nbsp;has stated that&nbsp;<span>“an author of software cannot oppose the resale of his ‘used’ licences allowing the use of his programs downloaded from the internet.”</span>&nbsp;This means that in Europe
 you can sell&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;digital game from Steam, Origin, and theoretically XBLA and PSN.<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://sticktwiddlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/xbla-logo.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsticktwiddlers.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2fxbla-logo-550x236.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The new legislation also goes on to state that the company you purchased your game from, whether that’s Microsoft, Steam, or GOG, will have to supply a way for whomever you sell your game to to buy it. If these companies decided to put a fee in place
 for these transactions, it has the potential to be a real cash cow for them.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>With the recent rise in devices to combat second-hand sales of retail titles, it’s certainly going to be interesting to see what might be done to combat this new ruling, if anything at all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;So...would you consider selling your XBA titles to someone else, if you could?</p>

<p>They'd have to fundamentally change the way licensing on the 360 works to be able to do this.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you transfer licenses to a new console the old ones aren't automatically deleted, they are only removed when the game/DLC is removed or redownloaded on the 'old' console by the purchasing gamertag.
<br />
<br />
So you could end up with two copies of the game being used AT THE SAME TIME for the price of one. Hard to see even a handling fee compensating Microsoft or the other publishers for that.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Don't be surprised if we end up losing the console license and we have to be connected to LIVE in order to use the games.</p>

<p>ah but Vote DC that would be illegal as now we own the game so if they make it so they won't function without online play its illegal.</p>
<p>The same with on Disc locked off DLC, also now illegal as we own the product as a whole so any content that doesn't work could be classed as the game being broken meaning without the EULA saying the company has no liability for broken products then actually
 will do.</p>
<p>I welcome this news with open arms though how much it will be enforced is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>My guess is the game sales system will probably end up like ebay or something, you pick the game put a price and then there will be a giant list of games people are selling with Ms taking a cut of the sales prices to keep the system going. Basically it will
 end up with lots of terrible XBLA games selling really cheap and no great deals on content people want.</p>

<p>Where does it say that we now 'own' the game? I'm reading through the <strong>
<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-07/cp120094en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">document</a></strong> now and all I can see is mention of we are allowed to sell digital only content. Is it in the full version because, damn, I don't think I want to
 go through all that.</p>
<p><br />
Also as mentioned in the document the person selling would have to render their copy inoperable but how many folk are really going to do that?<br />
<br />
Now I know this sounds like a good idea, I've plenty of XBLA titles I wouldn't mind selling on, but I really can see Microsoft changing their licensing/DRM. Whether that be to the previously mentioned online only idea or to that only the purchasing account
 will be able to play the game, online or off, we shall have to see.<br />
<br />
Actually that latter one is the more likely now I think on it, after all it is the system they use for GFWL titles now. I'm sure Microsoft would like to sell each account on a 360 a copy of the game instead of the console license letting everyone play it.<br />
<br />
This might seem like a good thing but do you really think that Microsoft and the other publishers aren't at this very moment working to ensure their profits don't go down.&nbsp;</p>
