<h2>            How can I get the MTP USB for the Nokia Music Player in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    When translating music between the PC and a Nokia 5235 with Ovi comes with music, Windows 7 needs to obtain&nbsp; the MTP USB controller, if you want to translate the associated DRM from the computer to the device or viceversa. If you don't have it , the solution
 is to translate the files directly and to get the rights via phone afterwards. Not neat, and very expensive indeed.

            <p>Hello, Carlos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried using Windows Update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the software from the Ovi disc </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mowie's solution - </p>
<p><span><span>1. First insure u either have Windows Media Player 10 or 11 installed</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Download Microsoft
</span></span><span><span><span>Media Transfer Protocol Porting Kit from:
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A2E73160-E862-4F19-BB26-C0CAFE798955&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Here</span></a><span>
 if you have a legitimate copy of windows, if not download this uploaded version I stuck up for you
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>poor suckers
</span><a href="http://www.2shared.com/file/OINmKOgj/mtppk12.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Here</span></a><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Once downloaded and opened the files should extract to by default C:\WMSDK. If so navigate your self to C:\WMSDK\MTPPK12\Tools\DirectMTP and extract the zip file</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>relevant to which version of Windows Media Player you have installed and your
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>operating system.</span></span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Once extracted navigate through the unzipped directory 2 folders in (they repeat the original name of the extracted folder. Once among list of files you shall find a file</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>named mtpinfup.exe double click it and a command prompt window should appear
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>briefly then disappear.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Right click my computer, click manage, then select device manager and select the
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>MTP device that is still unknown. Right click it, select update driver and allow it to</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>automatically scan for the drivers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go directly to your MSN email account, everything should work pretty much the same...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My MSN account works exactly the same in Win 8 as it does in Win 7...</p>
<p>I don't use the mail app though... &nbsp;or any other link... I always go directly to my email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most all email services provide a way to block senders\text in incoming emails in Options, Settings, or Account Settings ...</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you are using the default Email App (Program) in Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To delete the junk mail enmass, perform the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Junk Mail folder to open. </p>
<p>Click any one of the emails in that folder.</p>
<p>Press the Ctrl+A keys to select all of the emails in the folder.</p>
<p>Press the Delete key to move them to the Deleted folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Deleted folder and perform the same 2 steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default Mail App in Windows 8 works over the internet, like most email apps. You can access your MSN email on the MSN website. Set up your Junk Mail options there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Can you tell us when did the issue start?</li><li>Did you make some changes on your computer before it occurs?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you run the Windows app troubleshooter to scan and repair your game. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for the steps. In addition, kindly try to temporarily disable your antivirus on your computer
 before trying to play your games. Some antivirus may cause the game to stop functioning properly due to blocking some of its features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Looking for smart file overwrite in Vista &#40;or program that supplies it.&#41;</h2>
                    I'm looking for a smart overwrite in Windows Vista.&nbsp; When merging folders containing many files, inevitably there are a lot of files with duplicate names but different file sizes and data.&nbsp; It would be awfully nice to have the option for my computer to
 overwrite duplicates if two files share the same name and size, but automatically rename and save any file that has the same name but a different file size, instead of having to do this manually (and tediously.)&nbsp; Please note that I'm not talking about FTP
 or synchronizing data between different computers, but merging folders within one computer.<br />
<br />
Is this possible in Vista, or is there a program I can buy to do this?

All of the above have happend when there is nothing going on. If this persists, 1 of 2 things will happen, also to maybe adjust my USB issue if this comes down to a format and reinstlal of Windows Vista Home Premium 64, my thinking is that it won't fix it,
 it will just make it all new issues and crashes and more of the same on my usb as a generic connection.
<br />
<br />
the Second is to format and place Windows 7 Beta on here, but then after a time I will have a totally unworking system as it will time out. So the last option is to Put Slackware 12 or some other linux on here untill I get my "Supposed Free Windows 7 Disc as
 an Apology to all the Windows Vista Users Problems" as reported in many places. At which time it will make all my time, effort and more that I do like DJ, an a Guild Officer in Guild Wars of which I will not be abloe to do with Linux but if this persists,
 I am wondering that if one day I get up, and get the message "Windows has Completely Stopped Working and Will Shut Down" and then what, another format and the same message? What is this lady going to do? Is there EVER going to be an Operating System from Microsoft&nbsp;
 that Just works? I know Windows 7 will but thats months away and I need something DONE RIGHT NOW!<br />

another Superfecth Crash, and on rebooting, walked to the store, and when got back in 15 minutes, windows was LOCKED up and not responding at all with this last superfetch crash, seems that my expected "Windows has Completely Crashed and Will Shut down" scenario
 is close to happening. Why oh why is this doing this, I have 2 120MM&nbsp; fans and a 240MM Fan and a V1 on my CPU keeping things cool and conmfy, what is the issue with this darn superfetch crashing so much<br />

I do not think this applies to my version of Windows Home Premium 64, it applies to an X86 or 32 bit version.
<br />
Not a 64 bit version, oh and again soon will be redoing my entire system as the newest Live Update seems to have worked for an entire 3 weeks then just arbitrarily stopped working and every time I open Live Mail, Live Messenger or any of the Latest Live programs
 it just says Stopped Working and close. Not sure why they are doing this now, seems nothing has changed yet they have and that is what is crashing. I looked at what that KB file is and its not one that applies to an 64 bit system. Could you please make a mental
 or sticky note or even more an Full note in the Database and Let them all know that this is a Full 64 Bit system, not 32 and updates for the 32 bit Vista just love to crash&nbsp; the 64 Bit version. now once again system specs:<br />

I really hate to think of having to spend the next 2 days, or more getting my system formatted, and cleanly installed and watch it do exactly what it has been doing since this last one clean install. Oh and really odd is that Nero my CD DVD Burning software
 I will have to reset my licenses for, SAM Broadcaster again, all my Second Life, Guildwars and all my system drivers, one for the SATA to get it to see these drives right, and 2 the USB won't go to 2.0 cause the Microsoft Drivers can't even tell what the USB
 Chip is so it gives it a Generic Driver and assigns a Standard Enhanced tag to it and then a subset of 2.0 but mostly 1.1 so it thinks its 2.0 and its not when a REAL 2.0 Device is Plugged in, Windows opens the dialog of "This Device CanPErform Faster if Plugged
 into a USB 2.0 Port, then click here to see, and all the Ports are all the same 2.0 they are on the BOX in the BIOS but not with Microsofts Drivers cause they are 1.1 and not 2.0. 1000's of Hours of Work lost, 100's of Dollars of Programs to have ot reinstall,
 oh and my Poco Mail for my COX e-mail that cost me 45.00 would have to even redo that and make sure the backups I have all work. Too much and way too many things for this lady's liking to have to sit here in front of this computer for 3 Full Days to get back
 to where I am, oh and lastly my Perfect Disk Defragment program, would have to get that back, yes more and more money and time, wasted, when all microsoft has to do is actually program some 64 Bit USB drivers that use a Good HAL Detection scheme and then maybe
 just maybe could fix all the issues. <br />
<br />
I really can't wait for Windows 7, I have the Beta 2 but it will time out, and then I will have an unusable system again and have to once again format and do all the above, call Spacial for a New License since could not even get in to deactivate it. This has
 really gotten to me, STRESS and more because none fo the helps anyone here has given me works, or fixes any of the problems I have had with Vista since it updated and wrecked a lot of my programs that used to work, and even worse the updates are Microsoft
 and they are also what broke and just won't work anymore. Something is really wrong and it seems that no one wants to step up and find a REAL Viable Solution. I have learned all about computers,&nbsp; because I can not trust someone else to fix it for me, so I
 fix it. I am an UnCertified A+ Technician, and also knows a lot of the workings of Microsoft PRoducts. having had to fix others systems with XP, 98SE and Vista. Really time consuming for me with this system, I built it around Vista with all the things I have
 Verified Vista Ready, so that shoudl say something to you, but seems I am still going to see this close too, like the USB issue Thread I started, and won't get fixed.<br />

on another note, after a FRESH format and clean install, seems that Superfetch/Prefetch crashed again.&nbsp; Yes that's right Crashed on a Clean fresh install on the system from&nbsp; the post here. Well my Fix was Disable Prefetch/Superfetch, and wow so far no crashes
 though, Windows wouldn't load after rebooting, and my Internet Safety Suite crashed, but a reboot fixed that, So on a system like what I have Superfetch is useless and a waste of time to have since the Main Drive has a 16MB Cache and the others 8MB and with
 8GB or DDR2 1066 ram windows loads better and faster with it disabled and not loading. Another Fix by me to make Vista Run right. One day I might actually get my USB ports to be 2.0 but no they are stuck at 1.1. Oh well checks that thread too.<br />

    <title>IBM ThinkPad T42 would not connect to my secured home wireless network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sanorris  say:</h3>
<h2>            IBM ThinkPad T42 would not connect to my secured home wireless network</h2>
                    
<p>Windows IP Configuration __An internal error occurred: a device attached to the system is not functioning. __Please contact microsoft product support services for further help.</p>
<p>Others have had a similar problem, but I've tried the solutions that worked for them, with no luck.<br />
<br />
All of the sudden, my&nbsp;IBM ThinkPad T42&nbsp;would not connect to my secured (WPA2-PSK) home wireless network.&nbsp; It would either (1)stay in&nbsp;a constant state of "aquiring network address" or (2)not recognize any wireless networks in range.&nbsp; Sometimes, it would connect
 to a neighboring unsecured network, but this network would still not show up in the list of available wireless networks.&nbsp; So I tried plugging directly into the ethernet, which also didn't work.&nbsp; I then ran the ipconfig /all in command prompt, and got the message:</p>
<p><br />
Windows IP Configuration <br />
An internal error occurred: a device attached to the system is not functioning.&nbsp;<br />
Please contact microsoft product support services for further help.<br />
Additional information: Unknown media status code.<br />
<br />
So I went to Microsoft Product Support Services, which didn't seem to offer any solutions.&nbsp; I searched for this error message online, and found several similar problems - some users had virus problems.&nbsp; Some users had winsock2 corruption, and some recommended
 reinstalling the drivers for my network adapters.&nbsp; I'm computer literate, but not a computer wizard, so I was able to follow their directions for checking for winsock2 corruption (I think), and I think that's fine.&nbsp; I ran a full&nbsp;symantec scan, but that came
 up with nothing.&nbsp; I downloaded the drivers for my network adapters which are: wireless - 11a/b/g Wireless LAN Mini PCI Adapter, ethernet - Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Mobile Connection, and was able to update my wireless driver, but not the ethernet driver.&nbsp; The
 wizard for the latter said it "could not find a better match for your hardware than the software you currently have installed".&nbsp; I got the wireless internet to work for a few hours last night, although I still got the same error message when I run ipconfig
 /all.&nbsp; I started up my computer this morning, and the same problem again - constantly says "aquiring network address" although no wireless networks are showing up on the list.&nbsp; Also, I tried system restore to see if I could go back to before the problem started,
 but after I tried several dates, system restore was still unsuccessful - it wouldn't even work.<br />
<br />
So now I have my computer in safe mode, and it is connected to the wireless internet although the ipconfig /all still gives the same message, and I'm running symantec again to see if I can find something!<br />
<br />
Please help me out!&nbsp; If you think I may have missed something with the winsock2 or with the drivers installation, or if there's something I couldn't find on the internet, please let me know!&nbsp; I'll try anything.<br />
<br />
Note: I have Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, <br />
The network adapter drivers I'm running are:<br />
wireless: Date - 5/2/2007, Version 4.1.2.156, Provider - Atheros<br />
ethernet: Date - 10/24/2006, Version 8.7.9.0, Provider - Intel<br />
<br />
THANKS!<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: When I disable the Intel PRO/1000 MT driver, I can run ipconfig /all successfully.&nbsp; So imagine it's something to do with this adapter or driver.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Ok, so here is what I did to fix this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated to the latest BIOS from IBM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then obtain the WLAN driver from the manufacturer, NOT IBM, NOT Windows Update. Depending on your card it will be Cisco or Intel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that the updates from IBM and Windows update did not work and I wasted a lot of time. However when downloaded directly from the manufacturer (newer version) they worked perfectly!</p>

<h3> trechix  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t hear any sound coming from my computer.</h2>
                    
<p>I am running a Windows Vista PC with external SigmaTel speakers (plugged into appropriate green 1/8 jack) that have been perfectly working for the last couple years. But now, when I try out any sound I can't hear any of the audio. When I attempt to listen
 to something on Windows Media Player, I get an error (C00D11B1 or 80040154). I haven't downloaded or changed anything recently to cause any drastic changes towards the sounds or speakers as I recall. I know the hardware isn't faulty because I checked every
 connection and even tested out a pair of headphones that didn't work either. I tried the speakers in the standard rear jack and plugged it into the audio jack in the front of the processor with no luck. I've already looked at topics in Microsoft Support and
 Community Support and I've even ran the Microsoft Automated FixIt program which didn't detect any problems as well. I'm suspecting that there's something wrong with the computer, it's installed software, the audio plugin ports, or something like that. I've
 checked everything I could think of: The Basics, the installed Driver, and Device Management in my Control Panel. I would really appreciate any help for the problem, thank you!</p>

    <title>Remove an Old Computer from Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove an Old Computer from Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>How do I remove an old laptop from my Microsoft account? When I upgraded to Windows 10 and made my Microsoft account password the password that unlocks my computer, I discovered that my Microsoft account still&nbsp;listed as one of my devices&nbsp;the laptop that
 I traded in to a retail store for my new laptop. Naturally,&nbsp;I definitely do not want it some unknown person's laptop&nbsp;on my Microsoft account that's associated with my current Microsoft Account.&nbsp;The newer Windows 10 laptop is the only computer I now own.</p>
<p>We are not talking about a Homegroup problem here, nor does the old laptop belong to anyone I know - unless by a very odd coincidence, so how do I fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Luckily, this is an easy fix.&nbsp;Here's how to manage the devices associated with your Microsoft account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">www.microsoft.com/account</span> and login to your Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Under "Devices" click <strong>See all</strong>. </p>

<p>

<p>It's quite simple really. Make a class where you have a **** rifle with grenade launcher equipped. When the 'camper' kills you from his hiding place simply aim the grenade launcher to where you know he is and fire, BOOM.
</p>
<p>This can also be a good way of getting multi kills because in my experience most campers have a loyal companion or minion camper with them

<p>It's funny, I like campers mainly for the challenge, It's like, their in a corner with claymore covering one entrance and they air iron sighting the other, how do i get in, normally it's flash-bang, grenade and if needed another flash-bang with a charge!
 I personally only camp if we are going to lose lol i hate being the last victim</p>

<p>I can't stand people that camp, but it's incredibly easy to kill them in this game...if they don't have Flak Jacket and Tac Mask Pro.</p>
<p>And I love running the tube on my FAL, because it can punch through pretty much any wall, and it softens them up for the tooby.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of concussion nades, I pretty much throw one through any entrance im about to go through usually knocking out claymores and it always rewarding to toss one in the direction of a known camping spot to get a hit-marker and then run in to see
 Mr Camper flayling his arms about helplessly, I just sit there and watch a while and then usually plug them in the head or if I have time stick a tomahawk in there chest.</p>

 rode the elevator up to the smaller camping room, knowing full well almost there whole team was in there, I equipped my M72 LAW and when the doors opened at the top i just closed my eyes and launched it straight in ...4 kills at once num num num!</p>

<p>So many artards hide in those things. My favorite was when this kid rode the elevator up (I was sitting next to the other elevator), the door opens...so I switch to my tube...don't see anyone, then the door starts to close...so I fire the tube inside before
 it closes...double kill.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 fresh install blue screens or goes into startup repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davejyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 fresh install blue screens or goes into startup repair</h2>
                    <p>I am in the process of installing Windows 7 32 bit on a PC.&nbsp; It is an older PC, with an Intel D865GBF motherboard, Intel Pentium 4 2.6 GB (2 CPUs), and 1.5 Ghz or RAM installed.&nbsp; It does have an older Intel graphics card that does not run Windows Aero (no
 update available).&nbsp;&nbsp; I am attempting to do a fresh install of Windows 7, but after completing the initial install, the PC will either blue screen, or go into Startup repair a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it starts up, it seems to run OK, and I can do updates, etc., but every
 so often it either blue screens, or goes into Startup repair, which then seems to run endlessly.&nbsp; I push "reset", and am able to get Windows to start OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can't get this new PC to join my homegroup (currently have 5 PCs on it).&nbsp; I enter the password provided by my homegroup, and it states "invalid password",</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not the configuration, as currently I have 4 other PCs with the exact same motherboard and same basic configuration, and all run Windows 7 without issue.&nbsp; I have replaced the RAM, and tested the RAM in other working PCs, and also have replaced
 the Hard Drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried a fresh install of Windows 7 with a different install disk, but still have the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***RESOLVED*** - for this particular motherboard, there is a software download (available on the Intel website) called the Chipset INF Update Utility, which installs files to set up USB, and other features.&nbsp; It is listed&nbsp;for Windows XP, but installs and
 solves issues in Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you have some of the old 486 series motherboards, find &amp; install this software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I thought it was resolved - but I still once in a while get the blue screen,&nbsp; It refers to Win32K.sys.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise the PC works fine - and as I said earlier, I have 4 other PCs with the same configuration, and am having no issues whatsoever with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>What is the complete error message that you get on blue screen?</li></ol>
<p>There may be alot of reasons for getting a blue screen, most of the times it is due hardware failure that is when we generally get blue screen. You may refer to the following article for issues related to blue screen and check if that helps:</p>

            This is a "homemade" computer.&nbsp; See my original posts for the specs and info.&nbsp; I was unable to get the message from the blue screen as it flashed up and disappeared so quickly I couldn't get the info.&nbsp; I can't use System Restore as this is a FRESH install
 of Windows 7.&nbsp; I have already ran chkdisk, and no issues were found with the hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also tested the RAM by installing it in a different (but identical motherboard) PC, and it worked fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no files on my PC yet, as it is a Fresh install
 of Windows 7.&nbsp;

            <p>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what it says; the exact text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error next
 occurs by following the procedure described below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down the Stop Error code and related information properly. Select Start, right click on Computer select Properties, Advanced System Settings,
 Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart on system failure after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows Advanced Options Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the option
 - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly the right time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please post copies of your dump files as shared files (excluding any more than one month old) to your OneDrive with a link here.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The dump file will be created at c:\windows\minidump. You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and
 verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known
 file types" is not checked.</span></p>

            <p>Buna,</p>
<p>For this to happen you must have had&nbsp;an Option for your Motherboard to BOOT from USB Enabled Drives&nbsp;in your BIOS.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;is been looking for this External&nbsp;Drive&nbsp;Option as the BOOT Option when you turn on. but there is nothing it can BOOT from on your External Drives as they would be NOT Bootable for you.</p>
<p>It is a WRONG Option for you so&nbsp;change&nbsp;in BIOS.</p>
<p>Please read and change&nbsp;to make it Not BOOT from USB Drives; sorry you have to do this oposite to what they say</p>

<h2>            svchost.ext is taking 100&#37; of CPU</h2>
                    I've run AVG, Malwarebytes, and Windows Defender, and no problems are evident, however the CPU runs nearly constant when the computer is in use. Sometimes the fan runs so fast and makes so much noise that I put the computer on "stand by" and restart just
 to quiet the fan. Once when the machine was left running and unattented, the computer turned itself off to high fan speed.&nbsp; Thanks for any and all help

            You need to identify which service is taking all your CPU and disable it.&nbsp; Try the following procedure...<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Download and run "Process Explorer" from Microsoft.&nbsp; This is basically a task manager on Steroids:<br />
Process Explorer:&nbsp; &lt;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a> &gt;</li><li>When you run Process Explorer, you will see the instance of "svchost" that is using up all of your CPU.&nbsp; Hover your cursor over the text "Svchost.exe".&nbsp; A Pop-up window will appear that will give you a list of the Services that are being executed under
 this instance of svchost.&nbsp; Write these services down on a sheet of paper.</li><li>Start up the Services window&nbsp; (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "services.msc").</li><li>For each of the services you wrote down in step 2, find that service in the list, double-click on it, and then click "Stop" or "Pause".&nbsp; If your CPU goes down to normal, then you have found the service giving you the problem.&nbsp; If not, then restart or resume
 that service and move on to the next one.</li><li>Once you find the service responsible, you will need to determine how to handle it.&nbsp; If it is a 3rd party application, then you may need to uninstall / reinstall that application.</li></ol>
I have had prior experience that "Windows Management Instrumentation" often will peg my machine at 100% CPU.&nbsp; Usually this is only for ~10-15 minutes or so and then it goes back to normal.<br />

<h3> ihearnowords  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phonak ComPilot not connecting to laptop - help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I received my Phonak ComPilot and wear hearing aids in both ears. The ComPilot connects to my hearing aids and connects and pairs with my phone without a problem. However, I do have a problem with connecting my laptop and the ComPilot. They both
 pair together but will not connect even if they are in range of each other. It looks like this when I pair the devices but they don't connect:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8be0341e-1920-43a2-b843-7aa2894cd851" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get this while the pairing process is happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc6d4ab7-f31e-49d7-9583-09d73ad7fdfb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But after these files are installed, the ComPilot doesn't connect and this is shown:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14afc5cd-5180-472e-b0b3-f98261eef246" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stuck on this and I don't know what to do. I have tried to unpair the devices and pair them again but it doesn't work at all. I use Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please tell me what is wrong and what to do in order for them to pair and connect properly?</p>

    <title>IE won&#39;t load or upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE won&#39;t load or upgrade</h2>
                    Recently, my IE stopped working. I get the message "Internet Explorer has stopped working. Windows can check online for a solution to the problem." If I ask the system to check online for a solution, the app window spins its wheels a little then disappears
 and nothing else happens. If I ask for problem details, I get this:

</div>
<div>I tried the troubleshooting steps at&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/tips-for-solving-problems-with-internet-explorer to no avail. I made certain my system was updated with all the latest patches. I also tried to update to IE 10, but I
 received the message, "Setup can't continue because a more recent version of Internet Explorer is installed on your computer," which seems odd since the dump above seems to indicate the version I have installed is less than IE 10. When I look at the iexplore.exe
 file on my computer, it was installed 10/8/2012.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only thing I can think of next is to uninstall the version I currently have and trying to reinstall a clean IE 10. Any other opinions or warnings?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div>

<div>Thanks for your reply but I already tried that. I rarely run IE at all, so I don't have any add-ons. It is embedded in another program I use (ancestry.com),. so I still need it.</div>

<h2>            Constant Issues with party chat - Microphones</h2>
                    <p>I am facing an issue that keeps coming up and I hope to get some input/guidance from those in the know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son and his friends are 10 yrs old and they are constantly experiencing issues with communication using microphones.&nbsp; Sadly it might just be that his friends are using bad equipment, but I want to be sure that things are good on my end.&nbsp; This doesn't
 seem complicated and I believe that my son is setup properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using a Turtle Beach headset with a microphone that plugs directly into the xBox controller.&nbsp; We are also using the first edition of xBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious of two things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Does anyone know if the Turtle Beach headsets are problematic for xBox?&nbsp; I don't believe this to be the case, but just curious.&nbsp; Also, is there a better headset that I could be using for him?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; The newer xBox that was released last year... does it use the same setup menus for Party and such?&nbsp; I know the benefits of buying a newer console with relation to the overall specs and storage.&nbsp; Does the newer version use the same menu system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p />

<p>Hey Radar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. To answer your first question, Turtle Beach has been a highly reputable brand of gaming headsets since the 360 days. What is neat about them in comparison to other brands, is their wide selection. You can go from a budget $30
 mic or spend a couple hundred on their higher end models. You should be good with your current setup, luckily the Xbox is compatible with most headsets if you ever feel like changing. Now to your second question, yes. Our three Xbox Ones (Original, One S,
 and One X) use the same operating system and interface. Hope this helps! :D</p>

<p>The operating system is the same for all Xbox One console, whether an original, S, or X so there is no settings that would be different on a newer console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you have the turtle beach plugged directly into the controller, is this by an adapter or have you bought a newer controller with a 3.5mm jack?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check in settings&gt;kinect &amp; devices&gt;devices &amp; accessories and ensure that the controller has the latest firmware update.</p>

    <title>Start menu or built-in applications not starting. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernard valmonte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start menu or built-in applications not starting.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems with the Start menu and all of the apps that came with Windows 10 (Groove, Photos, etc), as none of them start up. When I try opening a file with any of them, it just says "The app didn't start." And as for the Start menu, nothing pops
 up when I either click on the Windows icon, or press the Windows key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started just yesterday when I changed some settings on the Superfetch and Windows Search services. I changed the settings from "Automatic" to "Disabled", as I read somewhere that doing so would prevent another problem I was having wherein the Disk reaches
 100% usage, even if I only used it minimally or not at all. (I reverted the settings to "Automatic", but that didn't help.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would really appreciate any help offered. I really want to get things working as they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have the Windows 10 Home Single Language, Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.321)</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Apologies if I place this in the wrong forum/topic; I'm quite new here.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. I have already tried reverting the changes I've made (Re-setting SuperFetch and Windows Search to "Automatic"). I'm now attempting the instructions specified in the link you've provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, just wanted to give further information. Apparently, it's not just the Start Menu, or apps like "Photos", or "Movies &amp; TV", but also the icons on the bottom-right (Power, Volume, Connections, Calendar,&nbsp;Notifications) don't seem to work.</p>

            <p>So far, I've tried the first three steps: Check for updates (and update), restart my PC, and tried the troubleshooter. I doubt the first two did much, as the update just updated some definitions for Windows Defender, and I've restarted quite a few times
 already since a few days ago, and still nothing. After using the troubleshooter however, I got these results:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I haven't continued to the "Create a new local administrator account" or "Reset your PC" as I hope the information in the photo might help.</p>

            <p>Didn't work. When I try to click "Add someone else to this PC", a window just pops up then closes immediately after. I've also tried following the steps on the first link you provided, which started with me signing in to a local account, then tried "Add
 someone else to this PC" and it just had the same result. Also, now when I try to press "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead", it does the same with adding someone, a window pops up then closes.</p>

            <p>Let's try to create a new user profile using the Command Prompt. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click<strong> Start button</strong> and choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> in the dialog box. </li><li>On your Command Prompt, type the following commands:<br />
<br />
<strong>Net user Test /add</strong><br />
<strong>Net localgroup administrators Test /add <br />
</strong><br />
</li><li>After that, exit Command Prompt. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done, click Start button and click your current user profile, then select your Test user profile.

            <p>Sorry for the late reply, been away for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've tried the steps, and followed all except the part where it says "click Start button and click your current user profile, then select your Test user profile", since when I left-click the Start button, nothing happens. Instead, I right-clicked,
 signed out, and logged in to the Test account (I hope that should have the same effect). But, in the end, nothing changed. Went into the profile, tried the apps or any of the features on the task bar, yet nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my only choice now to reset my PC?</p>

            By the way, did the photo I sent in one of my previous posts have any information that could be used to help figure out the problem?

            <p>If the possible troubleshooting to fix your Start Menu did not work, your Windows 10 might be already corrupted that is why you are experiencing this concern. For this, we can Reset your computer to start it to its new state.
