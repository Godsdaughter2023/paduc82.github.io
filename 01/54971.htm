    <title>new microsoft update and adobe illustrator cc 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roblaf  say:</h3>
<h2>            new microsoft update and adobe illustrator cc 2016</h2>
                    Since my pc has installed the latest updates to windows 10 (30 of the 9th 2016) I have been having problems with my current and up to date version of adobe illustrator cc 2016. The problem is when I start illustrator the cursor gets a blue loading circle
 beside it that stays loading and the cursor and loading circle begin flashing.I cant select things correctly in illustrator if I get illustrator to open (some times the click command does not work when this happens) I cant select things like the drop down
 menus.Its like they open and close the microsecond they open.I also cant delete once this is happening.Do you know of anyone else with this problem or how to fix it.Has anyone one else reported this problem.As far as I can tell my up to date version of photoshop
 works so this may be a problem that only affects illustrator.

            Perhaps its your hardware that is incompatible. Or you might have to give it a while if you just recently upgraded.&nbsp;

<h3> zombi fiend  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox goes to dashboard when game is paused</h2>
                    
<p>I have searched and searched for an answer to my problem but have found nothing.&nbsp;<br />
I was going for the 5 and 7 day survivor achievements (which i achieved) in Dead Rising and was well into my 10th day and able to go another 36 hours in-game with the food I had left. Thats about 18 hours total IRL. It was around 4 am and I couldn't go much
 further so I decided to pause and get a few hours sleep and continue later. When I returned to the Xbox, I turned on the TV only to see the Xbox dashboard. You know the scene in Planet of the Apes when Charlton Heston sees the Statue of liberty and drops to
 his knees? That was me.<br />
I yelled, I screamed, I cursed. I don't normally do that gaming , but jeez, I had just went through the longest gaming session in my 43 years. Well, sadly I didn"t get to keep my trophy, the Laser Sword, as I didn't die and save. I already got the 2 achievements
 but I still wanted that sword so I checked the xbox settings to make sure that auto shut-off was disabled and climbed back up on the horse. I could'nt go near as long as before but was well into the 5th day, with only a few more in-game hours to get to the
 5 day point. I paused, and set my alarm to wake me in 4 hours. When I awoke, i turned on the tv to see the same issue, the freaking dashboard....wtf???!!!<br />
<br />
Basically my question in how can I keep this from happening again? do I just turn off the controller? Im testing that option right now.<br />
sorry if I seemed to be rambling as I am very tired and angry.<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
ps....another question, for all the DR players- is that sword gone for good or can I do another 5 days and get it again?</p>

<p>It sounds like you had a problem with the mains power during the night. What probably happened is that the voltage supply to the xbox dipped for a fraction of a second, meaning that the console turned itself off but restarted again due to residual power
 in the brick. It happens in my area occasionally due to a shoddy electrical company. The supply to the house occasionally dips and all the running computers/consoles would boot up like I'd just pressed the restart button. Buying a UPS (uninterruptable power
 supply) will prevent this from happening in the future. They're units which connect to your wall socket, and have an internal battery which acts as a buffer for any intermittent supply fluctuations. Some can supply power for a few seconds or a few days, depending
 on how much you're willing to spend. Talk to your local electronics store and see what they reccomend!</p>

<p>Hey OP, I agree that you may want to try a different power supply, to see if that prevents this issue from occurring again.

<p>Yeah it does sound like a supply problem. There's several things that cause such fluctuations. Your electricity provider may have switched generator duties at one of it's facilities for general maintenance, a transformer may have blown a fuse on the power
 lines, the chemical processing plant down the road from your house may have exploded and is currently venting raw chlorine gas into the air, just about anything. Well ok, apart from that last one.</p>
<p>If you want to test and see if it happens again leave a PC on overnight running a game or MS Word or something, doesn't matter which. If possible plug it into the same socket that your xbox was in, maybe have them running at the same time on a power board.
 If at any point they either 1. Turn off, or 2. Restart and go to login/dashboard, then you know for sure it's a supply issue.
</p>
<p>You can get a decent quality UPS for about $150 that will protect both your xbox and PC from doing this in the future. All you need is one which will supply power for a few seconds to let you ride out the voltage drop. You won't need much more than that
 for home use, anythig more expensive is industrial grade only. If you can try and find one that will protect against surges as well. The wikipedia article is very helpful if you want to learn more about UPSs

            The error is often caused by a bad WIndows Update.  Did it start erroring immediately after the Clean Install, or did it wait until Updates were installed?  

Compare the Clean Install you did with the one in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587 

If you decide to do it over monitor for the error before each group of Updates, each program install and settings change, to try to isolate when the problem occurs.  Then uninstall the Updates, program or settings change suspected.  

You can hide Updates using this tool:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930

<h2>            MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ870BJ Unrecognised by Win 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp;Toshiba Satellite L870,&nbsp;loaded with&nbsp;the following: Win 8.1 ver 6.3.9600, X64 Processor&nbsp;Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2328M CPU @ 2.20GHz, 2200 MHz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s), System SKU&nbsp;PSKFLC, Installed Physical Memory (RAM)&nbsp;6.00 GB, and the original
 DVD drive Burner failed.</p>
<p>So, I Purchased an new Drive for a failed DVD drive on the&nbsp;Laptop with a &nbsp;MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ870BJ. The unit installed correctly for a few days, but has since become unrecognised by the system. The Error message comes up saying driver is corrupt, but when
 attempting reinstallation or an upgrade of the driver the system says the driver is correct. In Device Manager there is an triangle with an "!" within it, "even after attempting repairs". Ive tried removing the drive, rebooting without it, and then reinstalling
 same. Its Still not recognised. Is there a specific driver necessary for this drive? Am I doing something wrong to get this Drive recognised to play DVD's install programs etc.? Hope the info given is sufficient.</p>
<p>As always any help is greatly appreciated..</p>

            <p>The fact that the drive is new and failed early on indicates hardware failure is likely. &nbsp;Remove the drive physically, and boot the computer with the drive removed. Turn he computer off, reinstall the drive and boot. If the drive still isn't recognized,
 it's probably RMA time.</p>

<h2>            Macrium Scheduled Backups Broken with Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>I use Macrium Reflect V5 to automate my backups.&nbsp; Thank god I had done a manual backup before Creators update because CU bricked my PC and I had to restore from the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I say manual backup because on March 10, Microsoft forced upon me the Anniversary Update which resulted in the scheduled tasks in Macrium Reflect being broken.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Why is Microsoft forcing these damaging updates on us?</p>
<p>2) How can I get my Macrium scheduled backups to run properly?&nbsp; I've uninstalled, reinstalled, recreated all my backup schedules and nothing works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous.&nbsp; I'm half tempted to go find myself a copy of Enterprise LTSB.&nbsp; I won't make use of the bloatware MS sticks in new builds, so there's no sense in having them forced on me.&nbsp; STOP IT!</p>

            <p>Reflect v5 was working just fine, right up until the day I installed the Anniversary Update which made changes to the task scheduler API breaking Macrium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to use any "Anniversary" features pushed out via Windows Update, and there's a high likelihood I won't use anything in Creators either.&nbsp; Seriously, stop with the forced builds.&nbsp; There's no reason I should have to lay out money for a new copy of
 Macrium Reflect.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not once in the history of Windows XP and Windows 7 being the dominant OSs did an application suddenly become rendered inoperable.&nbsp; Christ almighty, there was a better likelihood applications ran properly after moving from XP to 7 than there is between builds
 of Windows 10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft: Un-screw what screwed up my Macrium software, or give me a free copy of Enterprise LTSB so I don't have to continue to deal with this BS.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 frequent BSOD&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aargos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 frequent BSOD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC that was experiencing occasional BSOD's and lately (last few weeks) its gotten worse. This PC is primarily used by a family member to game on but its used for general use also. The errors were not always the same. Sometimes it would be 'Kmode
 exception not handled' , or 'system thread exception not handled', and others. The BSOD's would occur at any time, sometimes just sitting at the desktop doing nothing (no game or app running)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated everything. No change. I started to remove things one at a time (like 3rd party antivirus, etc) but it wasn't helping so I decided to do a wipe of the OS (I was thinking it may have been file corruption somewhere). I booted into Recovery and chose
 to Reset my PC, and chose 'Remove everything'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some system info (system is nearing 4 yrs old)</p>
<p>
</p><p>MB: Gigabyte F2A88XM-HD3 with latest available BIOS</p>
<p>CPU: AMD A10-7850k (using integrated graphics with latest drivers)</p>
<p>Win 10 build 17134</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come here because I did a clean install as noted above &amp; minutes after install completed (took about 2 hrs) I went to reboot the machine and it BSOD'd before I could finish clicking. This is before I installed anything else. It has since BSOD'd many
 times before I installed any driver or anything else, just with base windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran today the memory diagnostic (I was beginning to think some component failure), I did the extended test with 8 passes. Took about 5 hours to run. No issues with memory detected. I don't know what else to try short of buying new components.</p>

            Hi Aargos, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

    <title>SmartBattery &#40;ACPI software for Compal mobo based notebooks&#41; - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken himura  say:</h3>
<h2>            SmartBattery &#40;ACPI software for Compal mobo based notebooks&#41; - How to install</h2>
                    <strong>First I'm going to tell my history looking for this driver. The instructions to install it are on the last 4 lines.</strong> But remember: first you need to install the SmartBattery software, only after this you can install the drivers.<br />
<br />
I installed Win 7 RC1 in my laptop about 2 weeks ago. Almost all the drivers were installed at the first use (I was using Win XP before, and I had to download lots of drivers for it to work properly), except for 3 drivers: 2 were "basic system device"s and
 one "unknown device". After some research, I discovered that both "basic system device"s were my card reader drivers that weren't installed, and the "unknown device" was my laptop's ACPI software (known as "SmartBattery"). I was able to easily install the
 card reader drivers (just needed to do some research to find the latest driver - found it in windows update catalog), but spent a few days looking for the ACPI driver, without success. The truth is: the software (SmartBattery) was already installed - it came
 in a CD from my laptop's vendor. In Win XP, installing SmartBattery solved the problem (the drivers were installed during smarbattery's setup). But, in Win 7, it didn't work. Tried to download 3 different versions of SmartBattery, tried to manually install
 a generic ACPI driver, nothing worked. Then, I found <a href="http://tohenk.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/compal-smart-battery-on-windows-7-x64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this blog</a> , from an indonesian programmer, which has the solution: Go to device management, select the "unknown device", "right click, update driver". Select to install the driver manually from a known folder, then select
<strong>X:\ProgramData\Vista64</strong> for the driver location, "X" being your system drive. This should install SmartBattery's drivers successfully.<br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />3. Try uninstall and reinstalling your Bluetooth drivers and look for updates first
<br />
<br />Also, I attach some link with more procedures in case the steps above didn't work:
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it works,
<br />
<br />Best Regards,

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please refer following suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run Bluetooth troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. If that doesn't helps, do this:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows + X, select Device Manager. 
<br />
<br />2. Under Batteries, right click on your Bluetooth device/driver and select Uninstall. Click OK. 
<br />
<br />3. Then click Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Device Manager and reboot.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<p>how do&nbsp;I attach a screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because to show what I am seeing specifically, because my Bluetooth&nbsp;pairs properly and it's on but then when click connect, a message pops up saying "That didn't work. make sure your Bluetooth&nbsp;device is still discoverable, then try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked if my device was connected to my phone and it wasn't my phone Bluetooth&nbsp;turned off</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: one more thing, I tried on another laptop and my Bluetooth&nbsp;device could connect, it was working fine but not on the laptop, I am using now.</p>

            As I think ,you can uninstall this game , and sign in the account which you want to sign in , try to download the game again, then you will see it automatically sign in the account you want .

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unsure if you've resolved this as it's been a couple of years already but I just got a new laptop and installed Win10 and had this same issue where i signed into my Microsoft account associated with my computer login, but had a different Xbox account
 that I wanted achievements to save too. No matter what I did I couldn't get SOME games to log in to the Xbox account I ended up signing into, they were forever stuck on account that was signed into the laptop, no matter if I logged out in the game and resigned
 in, or reinstalled the game completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was I went to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in with local account instead</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once i made it a local account instead of logging in with a Microsoft account, the game, when loaded after signing into the computer, required me to sign in with my Microsoft account. At this point I successfully logged into the right account for it to save
 my progress to the correct Xbox account.<br />
<br />
I assume the reason this was happening was because I had 2 Microsoft accounts going at once and I guess it was getting confused and going with the easiest one to log in with, in this case the computers user and not Xbox Live. As soon as I made my computer to
 sign in locally instead all was well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

<h2>            Halo channel says I need to buy MCC to watch nightfall, but I already have.</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday when I got home, the first thing I did was was buy a digital copy of the Master Chief collection, and once I installed it it also installed the halo channel and Nightfall. However, I can't watch it due to Halo channel simply saying I have to buy
 the game, but I've already got the entire game installed.</p>

<br />	How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update version 1803 using ISO File from Versions 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703 or 1709

<br />
<br />Detailed steps:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
