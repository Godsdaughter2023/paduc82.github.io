===============================<br />
Are you saying a complete system recovery as in<br />
just like it was when you first booted it up? That's<br />
called OOBE (out of the box experience).<br />
<br />
If that is what you mean...your photos and other <br />
personal files are probably gone. In the future it <br />
may be a good idea to create a backup on external <br />
media.<br />
<br />
There's a slight chance that&nbsp;you might have some<br />
success in recovering the files with the following<br />
freeware:<br />

    <title>Re&#239;nstall Alps drivers and functionalities for touchpad, after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonka nl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re&#239;nstall Alps drivers and functionalities for touchpad, after upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>My Acer Aspire 7551 Laptop has an Alps touchpad installed, with better funtionalities than it's Synaptics counterpart.</p>
<p>The most important function that Synaptic doesn't seem to facilitate, is to switch off the touchpad, when an USB mouse is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(hidfind.exe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade, standard issue Synaptic drivers were installed, removing the Alps functionalities. Also in device manager, the Alps touchpad was reborn as a Synaptic model. Well, whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I retrieved the old Win 7 driver package from Acer (http://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver/TouchPad/TouchPad_ALPS_7.5.2015.1111_W7x86_A.zip?acerid=634261601641032118&amp;Step1=NOTEBOOK&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE 7551&amp;OS=ALL&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=PA_6).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation was refused by Win 10. I&nbsp;added the driver manually. After the installment, Win 10 tells you the Synaptic Touchpad cannot be connected to and if the software should be removed. A simple OK finishes the job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all the nifty Alps functions are back again. No errors, no nuthin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            hardware secure removal</h2>
                    <p>After the upgrade to Windows 10 it is no longer possible to do the secure removal of an external disk: by selecting the secure removal icon the disk is displayed, but after selecting it nothing happens: the disk continues to blink and the icon can no longer
 be selected (it does not respond any longer).</p>
<p>The only way to remove the disk in a secure manner is to switch off the PC. In Windows 7 it used to work perfectly, with the same anti-virus. We already tried to disable the anti-virus in Windows 10 but the result didn't change.</p>
<p>What shall we do ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>HI, thanks for your kind reply. Here are the answers to your questions:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What is the make and model of the computer? SONY VAJO VPCEB45CE</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is this issue specific to any specific drive? No, it happens with all external peripherals (hard disks, pendrives)</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you check this with a different port? Yes, there is no difference: all the ports behave erroneously</p>
</li></ul>
<p>As far as the BIOS is concerned, you know that VAJO does no longer exist. So the BIOS is the same as before that was working fine with Win 7.<br />
The drivers are updated (just checked). We noticed that when switching off the PC there is at least one app (ELARA app) still ruuning. Sometimes there is also Magellan MSWHEEL still running. After few seconds the system shut them down and completes the switch
 off. Maybe this is related to the secure removal problem ?<br />
Please note also that we are running AVG free edition as antivirus. Do you suggest to activate Windows Defender instead ?<br />
<br />
Maybe you can be interested in understanding another strange behavior of this PC after the upgrade to Win 10: Windows Media Player does not longer work correctly: we can hear the sound/music but no images are displayed on the screen. We by-passed this problem
 by installing VLC Media Player which works just fine. Can you understand what happened to Windows Media Player ?
<br />
<br />
Looking forward to receiving your suggestions,<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
</p>

<h2>            Disabling Volume Shadow Copy &#40;Volume Shadow Service&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) for the time being due to security concerns with sensitive files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore seems to be functioning normally after disabling VSS, but what are the long-time implications of disabling this service?</p>

            <p>Hi Rusty,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Apart from the obvious like the Previous Version's of files not working if you needed to restore a particular version of a file or a folder contents you'd modified at a previous point in time disabling VSS will also affect System Restore and backup functionality.</p>
<p>System Restore allows you to restore your system to a previous point in time - say if you tried to install a new driver and it had an adverse effect on your PC/laptop. You'd be able to roll back that change.</p>
<p>Windows backup's may also fail completely.</p>
<p>You may also inadvertently affect other software that's installed on your PC/laptop that utilizes the VSS service such as non Microsoft backup programs. You may also encounter issues with your anti-virus program if you need to switch the VSS service back
 on for some reason in the future. I'd check to make sure there are no known issues with your antivirus package around VSS when disabling it or enabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Martin</p>

            <p>Please see this thread on the software developer's support website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softcity.com/question/creative/photo-explosion/photo-explosion-deluxe-version-3-does-not-work-on-my-windows-7/wEzM3MzN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.softcity.com/question/creative/photo-explosion/photo-explosion-deluxe-version-3-does-not-work-on-my-windows-7/wEzM3MzN</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>It appears that V3 was not intended to be used on Windows 7. You could try different compatibilty modes, but even then there seems to have been only limited success - for method see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could upgrade to V4 which is Windows 7 compatible. See:</p>

<p>There are plenty of other photo-editing, cataloging type products on the market. Adobe has just released Photoshop Elements 10 which might be of interest depending on your needs.</p>

<p>Oh SKYPE PLEASE!<br />
<br />
My phone number is 1 number away from Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas.&nbsp; It is 1 number away from Steinberg Diagnostic, that does xrays, and blood testing.<br />
<br />
Before you took away the ability to leave a personalized message my message said:<br />
<br />
"Thank you for calling "MY COMPANY NAME"&nbsp; This IS NOT Sunrise Hospital nor is it Steinberg Diagnostic.&nbsp; If you are trying to call these medical facilities, please check the numbers and dial correctly.&nbsp; If you are calling "MY COMPANY NAME" your call is very
 important to us, please leave a message... etc.<br />
<br />
So now, thanks to your inability, unwillingness, or lack of concern, I have to return, on the average, 106 wrong numbers a day.&nbsp; YES 106!&nbsp; I have to tell people no one will respond to the message they left because they called the wrong number.<br />
<br />
"I'm sorry but you were trying to get in touch with Sunrise Hospital because your husband died and you are trying to arrange for the funeral home to pick up his body?&nbsp; You dialed the wrong number."<br />
<br />
"I'm sorry you were trying to get in touch with Steinberg Diagnostic to schedule a mammogram?&nbsp; Yes, I am so sorry but you dialed the wrong number.&nbsp; No I'm sorry I can't work you in today you called the wrong number, I'm a psychologist."<br />
<br />
Honest to the almighty, I could write a book about the phone calls I have had to return.&nbsp; It's not funny and it is a waste of my time.<br />
<br />
I am a SKYPE paying customer.&nbsp; I pay for two numbers.&nbsp; This is just beyond ridiculous.<br />

    <title>When trying to search on Windows ten, the start menu keeps auto - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian p. &#40;student&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            When trying to search on Windows ten, the start menu keeps auto scrolling to the top.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, I'm very confused about how to fix this. When I hit the windows key to search for a program and the start typing it auto scrolls to the top and I can't stop it. For example, if i hit the windows key and then start typing "Visual Studio" it will
 highlight visual studio, and then immediately scroll to the top. Same with if I try to type in the search bar, it won't let me type anything and will just highlight the cortana three bar logo on the top. My mouse is working fine, and it doesn't auto scroll
 on any other website or anything else. Anyone have any idea what could be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: this seems to be happening on any Microsoft apps, for example, when I opened up photos and clicked "Create" it would just auto scroll through the 3 options.</p>

            Hi,  Ian
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Afzal,</p>
<p>With all respect, your answer appears to be way off base.</p>
<p>You start out by claiming that the Office Doc Image Writer (MS ODI) cannot be used on a 64 bit machine. That seems very doubtful under the circumstances, but&nbsp;if&nbsp; true but you&nbsp;have failed completely to provide any evidence of that.</p>
<p>The first link you provide makes it clear that they are talking about a completely different problem; namely, an INSTALLATION problem. My description of my problem made it clear that INSTALLATION of MS ODI is not a problem at all. It was available as feature
 in MS Office 2007; all I had to do was turn it on.&nbsp;The point you seem to be missing is that the the whole scan process worked fully with MS ODI until the point at which scanning was 100% complete. At that point, it made no mention of MS ODI being "unavailable".
 It simply came up with an error msg and crashed.</p>
<p>The second link provides information on exactly the same (irrelevant) pproblem the first link mentions - namely another INSTALLAITON problem with MS ODI.</p>
<p>if you want to provide relevant assistance on this problem, please RE-READ my problem description. The MS ODI worked all the way to a progress bar of 100% before crashing. This is obviosuly not an "Installation" problem.</p>
<p>There are some references elsewhere on the web to this problem, which suggests that it may be a security/authorization problem.</p>
<p>I would expect that if it were a problem with incompatibility between 32 and 64 bit OS and software, that it would announce that incompatibility at the outset and not execute at all. If you can provide evidence to the contrary, please do.</p>
<p>One additional piece of info might be relevant here ( I am not sure. ) I am running Win7 Pro, which includes the emulator for running 32 bit prorams more or less transparently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palcouk,</p>
<p>1. It's Canon, not Cannon.</p>
<p>2. Re: "Assuming...". Bit of a large assumption. In fact, they don't.</p>
<p>3. Even it they did, it would probably be irrelevant. Canon supplies drivers but that's all they supply. You still need a piece of software that uses those drivers. That piece of software, up to now, would be MS ODI. Since it is apparently a 32 bit app,
 hooking up to Canon's drivers wasn't supposed to be a problem. Other software apps such as Adobe Photoshop can offer an alternative, but that would mean an additonal software purchase. Canon also supplies an additional interface, Color Network ScanGear, but
 this app has to be called by the app that uses the drivers! Canon does not supply an equivalent app to MS ODI.</p>
<p>But thanks anyway for the try.</p>

<p>Being facitious is hardly likely to encourage any help</p>
<p>2) so you expect us to check Canon site to see whether their device is supported in win7 64bit?</p>
<p>If Canon dont supply win 64 bit drivers for their hardware, its not going to work, the full drivers/software pkge supplied by the device maker feature all software required for the useage of their device (but since you say cannon doesnt supply 64bit drivers,
 thats irrelevant)</p>
<p>However according to Canon site win7 64bit drivers/toolbox are avialable, for your model, so did you install them *prior* to connecting your device or did you just plug it in?</p>

<p>Palcouk,</p>
<p>Re: your admonishment of my being facetious. I suggest you consult a dictionary. It generally means being frivolous or not serious in intent in some way. I think there is nothing facetious in my previous reply to you.</p>
<p>Your most recent post, I believe, is in error. You seem rather precoccupied with the idea that the real issue is 64bit technology. I am quite willing to be persuaded that you are right on this, provided you supply me with some evidence. My understanding
 of Office 2007 is that it is, in fact, all 32 bit technoloy. This includes the MS ODI. Here is my evidence to support this claim:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyreviewer.com/office/view/microsoft-ime-works-as-32bit-when-office2007-is-installed-on-64bit-116339649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thedailyreviewer.com/office/view/microsoft-ime-works-as-32bit-when-office2007-is-installed-on-64bit-116339649</a></p>
<p>As I told in a previous post, the issue is not likely to be 32-bit 64-bit incompatibility since all the software involved is 32 bit. If someone can point out, with evidence that I am wrong in this, I shall be quite happy to stand corrected.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I shall have to conclude that your information is misguided.</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts, but I think it would be better to stand aside and let someone try to solve it this who is better informed.</p>

<p>Linney,</p>
<p>I think you might be on to something. The reason is that the last thing it appears to be doing when it crashes is attempting to do convert the scan via OCR. The scan completes fully, as I mentioned in my initial post. The image of the text can be seen on
 the Canon app "Color network Scangear", which in turn, is being called by MS ODI. The progress bar at that point in the scan is 100%. Then it says something about attempting to convert to OCR and then it crashes. I shall follow up your lead.</p>
<p>Thnx.</p>

            I'm glad you have a solution and hope it continues to work for you.&nbsp; You may be interested to know that Office 2010 does not have such software as&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Document Imaging included with it (much to the ire of many people).

    <title>Bluetooth audio streaming cuts out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth audio streaming cuts out</h2>
                    
<p>I have a top-spec dell laptop, i7 Intel with 6gb ram.&nbsp; I am streaming via bluetooth advanced audio to a bluetooth receiver connected to my Hi-Fi.&nbsp; It seems that whenever the laptop performs a background task or when I issue a keyboard command, the audio
 stream cuts out while the processor works making the sound from the Hi-Fi choppy and fragmented.&nbsp; I know little of the workings of the bluetooth stack but went to Task Manager and "upped" the priorities of anything that looked like a bluetooth proces.&nbsp; Not
 sure if this is a sensible thing to do! Nothing improved.&nbsp; This is not a router issue as it happens when streaming internet radio and local mp3s. I also don't think it's the drivers as i have loaded the BlueSoleil stack and the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any ideas how I can cure this?&nbsp; Is there a buffer setting somewhere that would smooth out the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hello PDES,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to put the computer in clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps in the above article to reset the computer to start
 as usual.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If not, I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the bluetooth drivers from device manager and check what happens.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking<strong>Control
 Panel</strong>, clicking<strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under<strong>System</strong>, clicking<strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><span><span>‌</span></span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>In the
 list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Right click on the device to uninstall the drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Restart the computer to reinstall the drivers.</span></p>

            Unfortunately, you cannot. Office 365 uses about 1 to 2 GBs of space. Maybe there is something else you can remove, see the following:

            You can analyse your disk with the help of any disk analyzer softwares. You can search for disk analyzer tool and pick up which suits you well. 
<br />
<br />Office 365 consumes very less space approx. 1.2 GB depending upon the version. The cause of disk occupancy is something else which a disk analyze tool will tell you.

 feature in Win7 where the volume is automagically controlled “When Windows detects communications activity”, since I have this set at “Do nothing”.&nbsp; Thank you for your time and assistance…

<p>These are normal.&nbsp; And notice that all of the processes shown in your screenshot except one Firefox.exe are using no CPU cycles.&nbsp; For that reason, I don't think that anything shown in this screenshot is the reason for your system "running slow and seems
 messed up."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the button in Task Manager to "Show processes from all users" and you'll probably find some processes running under SYSTEM, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, or one of the other system accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More than likely, if this slowdown happens when you first turn on the computer, it is Windows Update checking for updates, your antivirus program doing a system-wide scan, and other installed applications also checking for updates.&nbsp; You can configure most
 of this sort of activity to not happen automatically on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also can run Resource Monitor (click button on the Performance tab of Task Manager).&nbsp; This will give you a better idea of what processes are using which resources (CPU, RAM, disk access, network).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox has separate firefox.exe processes for each tab that you have open in Firefox.&nbsp; For example, see
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1147868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1147868 </a>&nbsp; That explanation was from quite a while ago, and although the default is still 1 process per tab, I don't know if the suggestion for disabling that behavior still works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the the multiple Dropbox.exe processes are OK, but the explanation I found from a couple of years ago that there was one Dropbox.exe process for each Dropbox account that is actively signed on doesn't seem to be the last word on the matter.&nbsp; Here's
 a more reassuring response (although not very explanatory) from the "solution" in this thread:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Installation-and-desktop-app/Dropbox-has-two-entries-in-my-PC-Startup-Why/td-p/181091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Installation-and-desktop-app/Dropbox-has-two-entries-in-my-PC-Startup-Why/td-p/181091</a></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting Dropbox!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that it is expected to see multiple Dropbox processes in task manager when Dropbox is running. The Dropbox application needs these additional components to monitor that everything is running correctly and that the desktop application is always
 healthy and up to date. The additional processes should consume a negligible amount of CPU and memory resources. If they are causing any performance issues on your computer please let me know.</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>If you still have doubts, ask in the Dropbox forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia Share.exe is also expected to have multiple copies of the process running.&nbsp; See
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/343120/what-are-all-those-nvidia-processes-running-in-the-background/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/343120/what-are-all-those-nvidia-processes-running-in-the-background/</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>The NVIDIA Share processes (NVIDIA Share.exe)—and yes, there are two of them—also appear to be part of the GeForce Experience overlay. This makes sense, as the overlay contains sharing features for sharing video clips and
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/340372/how-to-take-screenshots-of-your-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
screenshots</a> of your gameplay on a variety of different services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you disable the In-Game Overlay from GeForce Experience, these processes will also vanish from your system.</p>
<p>However, if you end both NVIDIA Share processes and then press Alt+Z, the overlay will reopen and you’ll see that the NVIDIA Share processes are now running once again. This seems to demonstrate that the ShadowPlay Helper listens for the keyboard shortcut
 and then hands off to the NVIDIA Share processes, which handle the overlay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nvcontainer.exe is another Nvidia process discussed in the same How To Geek article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>cis.exe is Comodo Internet Security.&nbsp; Multiple instances are normal.&nbsp; See the post from "EricJH" here:&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 Family Safety Screen Time Bypass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossh.24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Family Safety Screen Time Bypass</h2>
                    <p>My son signs into his Windows 10 PC using a Microsoft account, and is part of our family, and subject to Family Safety screen time limits of 2hrs on a Saturday, from 8am to 6:30pm. Also note that his account is verified (I know from experience that Family
 Safety doesn't work properly when an account is not verified).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today he discovered that when he gets the "15 minutes to go, request more time" dialogue box, if he simply turns off his PC at this point (I mean unplugs it from the mains without shutting down properly), then when the PC starts up again and he logs in,
 it seems to forget how much time he's used so far today, e.g. it's as if the time limits are reset so he gets another 2 hrs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, simply doing a hard power off of his PC (equivalent of a power cut) at the relevant time allows him to totally bypass the daily screen time limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known problem, because it seems like a pretty massive flaw in the screen limits system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>Ross</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answer but I'm afraid you have missed the point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on a single PC, so has nothing to do with multiple computers. I have reworded the original description to try and make this clearer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you try reproducing the problem as originally described to see if this is a general issue or something specific to me. It might be useful to send me some instructions on how to enable logging of the family safety screen time functionality, so you
 can diagnose the problem.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well I have the same problem as yourself. My son has managed to circumvent the screen time limits (single PC), in exactly the same way your son has managed to do it. Even after resetting his account and re-veryfing it, he still manages to bypass it. I had
 hoped Microsoft would have included a solution in the anniversary update, but no, he can still do it.</p>

SO TRUE!!! Yes I know that. I also found another way to bypass this but takes a long time and skill. Family safety is rubbish. Shouldn't have told my dad how to create a microsoft account for me. Didn't see that coming. He blocked games, I hated that, I'm not
 going to turn into a total nerd and have a sad life but that time i knew his account password and made life better but he left the games unblocked and put the screen time back again. He changed his password unfortunately and now I know a way to bypass this.
 Family safety probably won't be able to stop both methods GREAT!!! But I'm sick and tired of family safety. Wish i didn't have this screen time limit like your kids and i'm the only kid in my class to have this rubbish thing. Microsoft should remove it then
 if it's useless. EVEN BETTER!!!if they did...but they won't. If i get my own computer, my dad has to remove screen time limit from my account but depends on the computer Windows or Mac. Screen time limits just made me hate windows and now i would be going
 for mac when i get my own pc. Screen time limits are unfair for everyone who has it and double unfair if you're the only person in class who has it AKA me. YES you probably worked out something here about me.

            VERY frustrating to see this as the ONLY response from Microsoft. Not everyone, however, has the ability to limit their child's computer access to one machine or, ultimately, none. I am a parent with such ability and will begin to transition, once again,
 to alternatives. I will spare this forum issue participants my long list of grievances. I had opted to go full on with Win10 after its release. Wow, fool me twice. . . for shame. Shame on me. Who the hell is supervising Ruth? Has no one trained this representative
 how to respond to customers?<br />
