<p>Burning CD error</p>
<p>I was successful at burning&nbsp;a number of cds to back up my media and all of a sudden I couldn't burn anymore and began getting the following error:&nbsp; Windows Media Player cannot burn the files. If the burner is busy, wait for the current task to finish. If

 I have done all of the following except&nbsp;for checking to see if my CD player is connected properly.&nbsp; I'm not sure how I would go about doing that with a laptop containing and internal CD player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>•Verify that the CD burner is connected properly.<br />

 please fix this, I've followed all step found throughout this whole forum &amp; still nothing.

<p>I'm not familiar with EraseData by Tech Ember, but taking the company's web site at face value, it says that the program has 4 options:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Full Data Erase:&nbsp; Completely erase all data on the hard drive including the operating system</li><li>Erase User Data:&nbsp; Erase personal data but keep the operating system intact</li><li>Erase Free Space:&nbsp; Permanently erase previously deleted files</li><li>Erase Mobile Device:&nbsp; Erase data from an iPhone or iOS device</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You apparently chose option 2.&nbsp; If you didn't also choose option 3, you should
<em><strong>at least</strong></em> do this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the reasons I discuss in detail below, I recommend that you choose option 1 (which is the same thing that Darik's Boot and Nuke does -- for free, instead of having to pay for EraseData).&nbsp; Option 1, of course, will remove Windows along with everything
 else.<br />
</p>
<p>It's not at all clear what option 2 really does.&nbsp; I suspect this option is rather incomplete.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, each user account includes by default (that is, aside from anything you may manually create) at least 10 folders.&nbsp; These are stored (by default) under C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\&nbsp; (where &lt;username&gt; is the account name, e.g., your first name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>AppData</li><li>Desktop</li><li>Documents</li><li>Downloads</li><li>Favorites</li><li>Links</li><li>Music</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Saved Games</li><li>Videos</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><strong>least</strong></em> that option 2 should do is to delete the contents of folders 2 through 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folder 1 presents an interesting case.&nbsp; This normally-hidden folder includes many subfolders, probably at least one for every company whose software is or has been installed on your computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That raises the question of installed software.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, these are neither "the operating system" nor "personal data."&nbsp; So does option 2 of EraseData delete installed programs?&nbsp; My guess is that it does not, although you can easily confirm this
 one way or the other.&nbsp; If installed software is not deleted, it is likely that the AppData folder is also not deleted.&nbsp; There will likely be personal information buried in AppData and its subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the AppData folder, some software creates additional folders under C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.&nbsp; Particularly troubling are "cloud storage" applications such as iCloud and Dropbox.&nbsp; There may well be copies of your personal files in these folders.&nbsp;
 I've also seen a "Contacts" folder here, which will include information about people you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in addition to folders in C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\ , some software creates yet more folders in the "root directory" e.g., C:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's seems pretty clear to me that option 2 of EraseData at least leaves the user file structure intact:&nbsp; you still see your name when you log on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assume that EraseData considers "User Data" to include installed software in addition to the contents of the named folders in each user account.&nbsp; Let's also assume that EraseData is smart enough to delete all folders under C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\ except
 the 10 folders listed above.&nbsp; That still leaves the possibility that someone or some software has created a folder or folder structure in the root directory.&nbsp; So let's make one more assumption:&nbsp; EraseData is smart enough to delete all folders (and subfolders)
 in the root directory (C:\) that aren't there in a default installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The plus side of leaving the operating system intact is that you can give the computer away to someone and they won't have to buy a copy of Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The negative side of leaving the operating system intact is that even with all of the assumptions above, there is still personal information buried in the Windows operating system.&nbsp; Both your name and email address(es) are almost certainly somewhere in the
 Windows Registry.&nbsp; In addition, passwords and program license keys are embedded in the Windows Registry -- and much of this information is easily retrievable by using utility programs readily available on the Internet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you just one example that doesn't run afoul of Microsoft's policy of not providing advice concerning how to bypass passwords, you can install "keyfinder" software that will dig the product keys for many (not all) installed application programs out
 of the registry.&nbsp; See <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-product-key-finder-programs-2625119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.lifewire.com/free-product-key-finder-programs-2625119</a><br />
</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, if you want to be really sure that there's none of your personal data left, you need to "nuke" the entire disk and make whoever gets the computer install their own operating system.</p>

    <title>Hindi automatically added to keyboard languages - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hindi automatically added to keyboard languages</h2>
                    Since I switched to Windows 10, I've noticed an unusual thing that Hindi language is already added to key board at my login screen due to which many a times I've to reattempt the login repeatedly as language has automatically changed to Hindi. I've extensively
 checked, I've only English US added to keyboard and have tested adding &amp; removing others, still Hindi is reflecting as one of them although it's not added at all. I've set location different from India, but still no solution. When I press Windows + Space keys
 to display the language menu, Hindi is one them, although not added as mentioned previously. Can you please help me out here.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14c1dc20-3b8e-4428-a4d8-a24873a68557?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14c1dc20-3b8e-4428-a4d8-a24873a68557?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/383da7c3-bd64-4f11-9e5f-708396a874f0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/383da7c3-bd64-4f11-9e5f-708396a874f0?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking an initiative to assist me in this. I followed your advised steps, but could not locate Hindi in there, there are 2 languages only English &amp; Urdu (which I had installed earlier to test the same and later uninstalled the Urdu language
 pack). As I couldn't find Hindi, I uninstalled Urdu over there, <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/599e1f5e-9e23-4108-b626-05d91e1a1b3b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the key valued 2 (3rd entry in the screenshot), but when I sign-out from the machine I can see Hindi still there and upon signing in again, opening regedit, I see the key valued 2 somehow has been automatically recreated. I tried it multiple times,
 got the same result.</p>

            Yes Sumit, I tried it with admin privileges and without admin privileges as well and re booted the machine also, nothing changes. When I login, I see the deleted registry value recreated and Hindi still among the language options when Windows + Space bar
 are pressed.

                    <p>Hi, I have a Dell Studio 15 laptop with Windows 7 Premium pre-installed. After the recent update&nbsp;<em>(of which restore point was not created)</em>, m<span>y computer has 'write protected' every folder! This is freaking me
 out. Opening 'properties' shows read only attribute filled blue (Actually it's not checked. Have a look at the image).I tried to modify it through properties, it doesn't change, no matter how many times I try.</span></p>

<p>This Windows bug has almost eaten my pendrive. I'm a great fan of Microsoft Windows. But inspite of so many complaints about this bug. Microsoft is least bothered about this. That hurts the feeling I had about Windows. Hoping Microsoft finds a solution soon.</p>
<p><span>While searching web I came across this answer:</span></p>
<p><em>"Folders are&nbsp;not&nbsp;read-only. The read-only attribute does not apply to&nbsp;folders. Ignore the read-only box. It has no meaning for folders."</em></p>

<p>Issues are same on every Windows machine. I heard that Linux systems can format a pendrive as they don't understand windows's write protection. Not many use linux based OS over here, so I tried it using VirtualBox with fedora. It shows the drive but when
 formatting it either returns some input/output error or timeout error. My pendrive is of 'iball'. There's no chance of counterfeit as I bought it directly from 'iball' vendor.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> nigelgoodenough  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting &#34;network&#34; contacts from Windows Live Mail 2012</h2>
                    I run WLM 2012 under Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 8). &nbsp;If I view my contacts as a list most are 'from' the address book but several have no entry in the 'from' column. &nbsp;Those with no entry cannot be edited or deleted. &nbsp;Several people on the Forum
 have suggested that they come from Skype, but I certainly don't have them in my Skype address book. &nbsp;Also, they are not in my gmail contacts list. &nbsp;I can't think of any other place they might have come from except perhaps they were imported from my last computer
 when I upgraded. &nbsp;Any idea (1) how to delete them (2) tell where they come from or (3) stop WLM picking them up from wherever. &nbsp;The problem is they are all old and some people have changed email address so I now have entries that are just plain wrong.

            <p>Thanks Firedog, I really appreciate your input. &nbsp;The entries I'm trying to get rid of don't appear on the People page. &nbsp;On my WLM contact list I have two entries for maybe 20 contacts. &nbsp;In some cases the two entries are identical but where someone has changed
 say their email address I have one right entry and one wrong, the right one being the address book entry which I have created because I couldn't edit the old entry. None of the duplicates appear on the People page, just the right entries. &nbsp;Bizarrely, if I
 view the contacts (in WLM) in 'online status' format and double click one of the problem entries nothing happens, but if I view in 'list' format and double click the entry I get an edit dialog. &nbsp;If I edit the entry and try to save the edited form I get a warning
<em>The contact information could not be saved. &nbsp;Check the Contact's information and try again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The build is&nbsp;16.4.3528.0331 and this is not an upgrade from outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks. It will be upgraded at some stage, at which point prepare for further shocks ...</p>

<p>I'm going to ask you to look again. People is a bit smarter at managing contacts in some respects, so it can in some circumstances merge the display of multiple entries so they appear as one. A young lady of my acquaintance, for example, is listed once in
 the left-hand pane, but when I click on that entry, this is what I see.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab190ca8-74d8-4f37-88b7-182bf3bf33f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab190ca8-74d8-4f37-88b7-182bf3bf33f1" style="margin-left: -15px" /></a></p>
<p>She appears four times in Windows Live Mail, once for each of the four sources given under the profile picture, which comes from Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how this came about, but I suspect that one of the Outlook entries - whose data comprise a mobile phone number only - was at some stage imported from my own phone, possibly via Google.&nbsp;The Skype entry in Windows Live Mail can't be deleted there.

            <p>Being a 'glass half full' person I look forward to the update solving all the WLM problems known to mankind ........</p>
<p>
</p><p>but in the mean time, I've checked the People entries and the couple of problem cases I've looked at only have one entry when you click on them in People. Some names in 'People' do have two entries (usually Outlook and Skype), but these are not names that
 have two entries in my WLM contacts. &nbsp;The problem cases (i.e. those that I can't edit or delete in WLM) only have one entry when you click on them in 'People'</p>

    <title>Set default keyboard for all programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wordswest  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set default keyboard for all programs</h2>
                    I'm using Word 2010 with Windows 7. I'm a French-English translator and French (Canada) is my preferred keyboard layout. But I constantly find that the keyboard switches back to English (Canada) without my having done anything. For example, I will be working
 on several documents and writing emails with the French (Canada) layout, then go to do a Google search and when I type in the search window, I'm back to English (Canada). Is there any way to set my default preference once for ALL programs? Note that I am not
 talking about setting the proofing language. I am talking strictly about keystrokes. I am used to my question mark being "Shift 6," and my quotation marks "Shift ."&nbsp; Having to keep hitting Alt+Shift to switch back to the keyboard I thought I was already in
 is very annoying! Thanks.

<h2>            Does Microsoft support Microsoft Exchange 2013 in AWS Cloud environments&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does Microsoft now support Microsoft Exchange 2013 in AWS Cloud environments? &nbsp;I have read in 3 places that in 2013/2014 Microsoft would NOT support customers that had exchange 2013 servers at Amazon Web Services /AWS. &nbsp;So have things changed in 2/3 years
 ? &nbsp;I hear of a lot of Exchange servers in AWS, but are these users forgoing a supportable environment? &nbsp;In the past, you would have to replicate or prove your issue on a physical environment, before Microsoft would provide support. &nbsp;Which means NO SUPPORT,
 and is not practical. &nbsp; I am seriously considering putting a production Exchange environment in AWS, but only if I can get Microsoft support or have a supportable environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any documented proof either way about this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?<br />
<br />
If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.<br />
<br />
Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.<br />
<br />
* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle<br />
<br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Type CD\ and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Other solutions:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.<br />
<br />
2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.<br />
http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/<br />
<br />
3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in your
 off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.<br />
<br />
4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you have
 a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.<br />
<br />
5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced the
 issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which is based
 on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.<br />
<br />
6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Accept User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.<br />
<br />
7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />

Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.<br />
<br />
Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.<br />
<br />
Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.

<h2>            how do I save a picture from my email to photo gallery</h2>
                    <p>I sent pics from my phone to my email. I open them but I cannot figure out to save them to my picture gallery with Windows 8. I just received the computer yesterday. I want to place pics in my gallery so I can download them to facebook. To do that, I need
 to browse for my picture files. Help. Please. and thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have posted once and the answer wasn't able to help me. I have pics in my email box and want to save them. The responding answer said to right click pic and save target as. There is no prompt to save target as in Windows 8. The only prompt shown says save
 to computer. I click it and cannot locate the pics in my gallery. I am visually impaired but not totally without some capability. I don't think I like windows 8. I found some pics located in a library, what that is, I have no idea. Please help</p>

    <title>Microsoft Edge&#58; Unable to close browser&#59; suspicious messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hd68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge&#58;  Unable to close browser&#59; suspicious messages</h2>
                    <p>February 15, I was using the Microsoft Edge browser to review news and decided to open an article. The tab opened up to the following message
<em>overlaying </em>a faded out error 333 message. </p>
<p>The essence of the overlay message: MS [it used the letters MS not Microsoft] network server has detected some suspicious activity at [my] IP address. Something about Cydoor Spyware. The message goes on to read:
 call a Microsoft Certified Technician at +1 877- 671-3431. The error message is an overlay on the website. Under the overlay I could read BSOD: error 333 registry error.
</p>
<p>I was unable to close the browser. I had to turn off the computer to close it. For several hours, I occasionally tried to use Edge again, but the same issue occurred and I had to turn the computer off each time.
 I use Kaspersky Total Security product on my computer, ran a full scan and it showed no problems. I could get online with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>On Microsoft community, I see that others have experienced a similar occurrence. However, I have information to add. When I shut down the computer after the initial pop-up in Edge, my computer did take significantly
 longer to reopen [as if it was installing an update or something.] </p>
<p>Yesterday, 2/19, I began seeing in the lower right hand corner of the computer screen a message that read:
<strong>Software Download Complete</strong> offering only two installation selections:
<strong>Install Now Install Later.</strong> Hovering over the message there was nothing to indicate what the software was, no opportunity to view what it was
<em><strong>and I hadn’t downloaded any software</strong></em>. The message was in a suspicious print: not crisp.</p>
<p>Due to location I knew that I couldn’t leave the message or at some point, I would probably inadvertently install it - whatever
<em>“</em><em>it” </em>is. I scanned the computer with Kaspersky. No virus. Scanned with Malware Bytes. No virus. Rebooted and still got the message. Tried restore point restore, but it came back that a file was missing and it couldn’t restore the computer.
 I finally did a complete system recovery. </p>
<p>I hope that this information is useful. Perhaps someone can shed some light on all of this.</p>

      If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      For Edge:<br />
      <br />
      User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.<br />
      <br />
      ************************************************<br />
      <br />
      When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task
      Manager.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the
      offending site tab will be gone.<br />

<p>I had the same thing on my PC just a moment ago.</p>

<h2>            Screen flickers every 30 seconds</h2>
                    My laptop screen flickers every 30 seconds. This is after the latest Windows 10 update. I had this the last time I had an update and it was to do with an app that I had to try and find and uninstall. I can't find an app at the moment so is there an easy
 way to find the corrupt app?

            <p>Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
The easiest way to find a corrupted app is to run the System File Checker (SFC) tool. We suggest you check the article below to know more on how to use the SFC tool.</p>

            I tried every single step again but nothing works. Its still the same. I am getting "joining horizon life" but i ain't getting into a server online. And i think thats because its blocked but i dont know how i would fix that. I tried to disable and then
 enable my firewall but that wont work aswell.. I am kinda frustrated that i can't play online on the xbox app on the computer. I can join xbox party but i can't speak because my internet is "blocking"

<h2>            Unable to check Windows updates getting Error message &#34;Some settings are managed by your system administrator&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: How do i get updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I had a problem with my update settings.&nbsp;I couldn't check for or download updates and automatically check for updates had turned off as it said that some settings are controlled by the system administrator even though I am the administrator
 and only user of this pc.&nbsp;Automatically check for updates is on now but I don't think it is checking. There is an update for my surface pro 3 but in the control panel it says that the last check for updates and last installed updates was never even though
 I have updated it before this started happening. Under settings -&gt;update and recovery the 'windows&nbsp;update' part has completely disappeared. In the control panel it still says that some settings are controlled by the system administrator when I click on check
 for updates. I have windows 8.1.</p>

            I haven't changed any settings before this issue occurred and I'm not getting any error code. I tried the first method and changed "configure automatic updates" from enabled to not configured. This just changed the update settings in control panel to "never
 check for updates". I tried the second method but the administrator account had the same problems as my other account.

<p>Hi Buddy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're backing up your file using the automatic file backup feature and encountered error
<strong><em>0X80071A91</em></strong>, this may indicate a possible corrupted system logs or files. As an initial step to get the backup working again, I suggest that you run this repair command below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong><em>Start</em></strong> menu.</li><li>Type <strong>cmd</strong> in the search box.</li><li>Right-click <em><strong>Command Prompt </strong></em>from the list, then select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>. Click <strong>Continue</strong> if prompted.<br />
</li><li>In the <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em> window, copy and paste the command below:<br />
<strong>fsutil resource setautoreset true c:\</strong></li><li>Wait for the command to complete, then restart the device.</li><li>Once you're done, check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, you can perform the troubleshooting methods provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> on how to fix
<em><strong>Windows Update</strong></em> issues. Select the scenario that best describes your concern to view the appropriate steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I did perform the autoreset as you described and it gave me the message "operation completed successfully". Still when I click "Backup Now" I get the exact same error message. Do you have another idea?</p>

<p>I appreciate the prompt response. It seems that I'll be needing additional information in order to effectively assist you with your concern. Could you confirm if you've made any changes on your device prior to your concern? Also, what are the troubleshooting
 steps that you've already tried to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest that you perform the back up while the device is in clean boot state. To perform clean boot, you can follow the steps provided on this

<p>I went through the steps provided to preform a clean boot and attempted to back up the system. I again received the error message&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>"Windows could not enable the automatic backup job for the following reason: Transaction
 support within the specified resource manager is not started or was shut down due to an error. Error 0X80071A91."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only changes to the system recently was installation&nbsp;of Office Professional&nbsp;Plus 2016. It does seem that the back up problem came up after that installation. The Office programs seem to run correctly. To be honest
 I have read and tried multiple steps to resolve the problem including the trouble shooting help provided when the backup error occurred&nbsp;and the autoreset you provided. This has been an ongoing problem for several weeks and I can't remember all the exact troubleshooting
 steps I've tried. Using the Microsoft Community&nbsp;help has been my last resort.</span></p>

<p>Hello Buddy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the delayed response. Our next option is to restore your system to a well-known state. This method will help us narrow down the issue and will rule out any errors affected by unwanted changes made on your system. To do this, follow the steps
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart the device. During startup, keep on pressing the <strong>F8</strong> key to access
<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong>.</li><li>From the list of option, select <strong>Repair your Computer</strong>.</li><li>This option will take you into a <strong>Repair Boot</strong> mode.</li><li>On the <strong>System Recovery Options Menu</strong>, select <strong>System Restore</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.</li></ol>

<p>Sorry it has taken so long to respond but due to family issues my PC priorities dropped. That said.... I just tried your last suggestions for the Advanced Boot. Since all my back ups are on an external hard drive I connected that hard drive to the laptop
 before I restarted the laptop. I held the F8 key for almost 10 minutes without anything happening with a blank screen. As soon as I released the F8 key windows started as usual. I once more tried a back up and system restore only to encounter the same dead
 ends and error messages as before. Next I disconnected the external hard drive and followed your procedures again. This time I was able to get to the Advanced Boot Mode Options and followed your directions. When it came to system restore the only restore points
 available were dated April 26, 2018 and were Windows updates that were tried after this chain of messages first began. All my past back ups and system restore points are on my external hard drive but I cant seem to access the Advanced Boot Options when it
 is connected. What next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Buddy</p>

<p>Hi BuddyRobinson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping posted with the results of the troubleshooting advised to you on the previous posts. I would like to clarify a few things before we pick up on the last troubleshooting you've performed:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tested if the issue persists on a different user profile?</li><li>As of the moment, do you still encounter the error message?<br />
</li><li>Have you tested if the issue persist when booting your computer on <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> for testing?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user profile</a></strong> and name it as
<strong>test</strong>. This is for us to isolate further the issue and ensure that your current user profile's
<strong>PowerShell</strong> is intact.</p>

    <title>At wits&#38;&#35;39&#59; end with Customer Support - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            At wits&#38;&#35;39&#59; end with Customer Support</h2>
                    
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I was told this was the only method of submitting a corporate complaint to Microsoft regarding the poor customer service I've received. None of the representatives I've spoken with, including several supervisors and a customer service manager had access
 to a corporate complaints address.</p>
<p>First let me start by saying I have been a loyal Microsoft customer for most of my life (I'm 27). My family and I have owned Windows PCs since I was in the second grade and I currently have two Windows 7 desktops. I am still a proud user of a Windows Mobile
 smart phone. I bought the first Xbox, and have since upgraded to two Xbox 360s (my family members have another two) and a Kinect along with over 50 games. I've been an Xbox Live Gold member for seven years and I've purchased over 30 arcade games. While I wish
 I had more time to spend on gaming, I have certainly logged my fair share of hours over the years and I generally have an advanced understanding of technology, so much so that some of my friends and coworkers call me “Tronics”. With that said, I'd never once
 contacted Microsoft customer support until about a year ago when I bought a new Xbox 360-S console. After successfully transferring all my saved games to my new console, I needed to re-download Fable 2, the one On Demand game I owned. I was right in the middle
 of playing Fable 2 and had spend approximately 40 hours playing it when I upgraded to my new console so I was disappointed that I had difficulty transferring it over. For some reason, whenever I tried to re-download the game, I received a non-descript error
 stating it “could not be downloaded”. I attempted to troubleshoot this on my own and tried to download to a friend’s console but that did not work. The game showed up in the purchase history on my console and on Xbox.com but there was no way for me to get
 the game back on my console. After several attempts to download this game, I called Xbox support at 1-800-4MY-XBOX. The representative I spoke with was very friendly and walked me through all of the standard troubleshooting steps. We added the game to my download
 queue from my Xbox and from Xbox.com but still, it gave the same error. We went into my hard drive and deleted all instances of Fable 2, including my saved games but still, it gave the same error when trying to re-download. Finally, I was offered a refund
 but I declined for two reasons: 1) the game was purchased during a special promotion and had no refund value and most importantly 2) I had spent 40 hours and purchased two expansion packs in hopes of finishing the game. A significant reason I had enjoyed my
 Xbox during that period was Fable 2 and the thought of giving up on a game was frustrating. The representative insisted that the only thing he could do would be to offer me a refund (I’m still not sure what that would have been). At the time, I equated that
 to a Windows support representative giving a customer a refund in the amount they paid for the operating system but offering no assistance in fixing a the software functionality on a perfectly functional piece of hardware. &nbsp;Essentially, this representative
 was trained to give up supporting his companies own product rather than getting to the bottom of the problem. Undettered, I explained I’d really like to finish the game and declined the refund. To the credit of that first representative I spoke with, he was
 fine with that and agreed to transfer me to a supervisor who might be able to help. This supervisor, also very friendly, went through another round of troubleshooting and then assured me he’d submit an advanced support request to get to the root of the problem
 and that I’d get a call back within 24 hours. After six months and over ten calls to support (totaling more than 16 hours), I still never received a call back and never received any resolution. Each time, I’d speak with a very friendly and capable sounding
 representative, ask about the status of the previous investigation, and learn that nothing had been done to resolve my case. Each time, the representative profusely apologized, convinced me that something had gone wrong with the previous request, and promised
 to re-submit my request. The most frustrating part is that not once was I told that my problem could not be solved, or that there was a reason for the delay. To this day I have no idea what the issue was but it was clear to me that after I hung up the phone
 each time, no one from Microsoft EVER worked on my case and that no one ever followed-up on their promise to call me back. As someone who deals with clients on the phone and over email for much of my job, I found the lack of accountability from call to call
 to be bewildering. Some people say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I, along with the support representatives I was working with, had reached that point so I cut my losses and vowed never
 to contact customer support regarding Fable 2 (and hopefully anything else) again.</p>
<p>On January 4<sup>th</sup>, things changed and I was forced to again contact Xbox support. I received two emails indicating that my email and phone number for my Xbox live account had been changed to some random Chinese email. Knowing I did not do that (and
 don’t speak Chinese), I went directly to Xbox.com and tried to log in, only to find that my password had been changed too. I was finally able to get back into my account after some sort of verification and I logged into Xbox.com to find all of my Microsoft
 Points missing. I hadn’t purchased anything in some time so I immediately suspected fraud. Sure enough, that same day someone had cleared out all 6000+ of my points buying some sort of FIFA 12 game add-on. &nbsp;I immediately called Xbox support and opened a fraud
 investigation, fearing the worst for my personal information. The representative explained this was a fairly common occurrence and assured me that the problem would be resolved within 3-5 days. Unfortunately, I had left my power cable at my parent’s house
 over the holidays and would need to call back whenever I had access to my console ID and serial number.&nbsp; On 1/17, I did that and was told my case would be resolved within 3-5 days and I’d receive an email upon resolution. On 1/28, I still hadn’t heard anything
 and called in again. After asking about the reason for the delay, I was transferred to a supervisor who explained that for some reason, my alternate email address had never been recorded on my initial two calls. He said there had been no activity on my account
 since 1/17 but also said that the email address was not the reason for that. This representative went on to assure me that this never would have happened had he or a member of his team worked with me initially. &nbsp;He then assured me that the case would be assigned
 to a high-level care team who would track my case and contact me via email if there was another delay beyond 3-5 days. On 2/4, I decided to call in again, as it had been beyond 3-5 days and I received no contact from this high level care team. After speaking
 to a representative, supervisor, and Manager, there were no updates on my case that had been open since 1/17 and no indication that the representative ever referred my case to a high-level care team as he said he was doing on 1/28. The Manager confirmed that
 this time my case had indeed been assigned to this high-level care team and that I would be contacted via email should the delays in my case persist. 6 days later, I’ve not been contacted. At this point, my Xbox Live account has been disabled for 37 days,
 my console ID has been logged for 24 days. Despite being told I’d be contacted by a high-level support team if my case was delayed beyond the typical 3-5 business days, I’ve not been contacted. Again, I have no indication that my case is being worked on and
 there is no accountability from representatives from call to call. Promises and timelines are made and never kept. I recognize that my prior experience may be making me extra-sensitive this time around but as the saying goes, “fool me once, shame on you, fool
 me twice, shame on me.” I’m writing to let you know I’m extremely disheartened and frustrated by the terrible customer service I’ve received from Microsoft. Despite all of the representatives being friendly over the 20+ hours I’ve spent on the phone, there
 have been broken promises, no accountability, and most importantly, no results. I’m at wits end and my brand loyalty only goes so far, not to mention I have major concerns about the security breach of my account. Assuming I don’t get a substantive response
 and resolution in short order, along with some sort of reason to stay loyal to Microsoft, you can count me and my family/friends out of your future earnings calls. I’m sure there are many other companies who would appreciate my business and loyalty.</p>
<p>I hope I’ll hear from someone soon but I won’t hold my breath.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It would have been easier for you to have purchased Fable 2 from a retailer such as Gamestop, used of course, and you still would have been able to use the DLC you bought for it as well. The refund would have been for the current
 amount of the game. I understand your stand point but sometimes you have to know when to say okay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It is also possible support could not tell you there was an issue because either they did not know there was or not enough people were reporting it. That is why the refund was offered. If I were you I'd contact support and see
 if that refund is still open then buy a used copy to continue your quest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Phone Support doesn't always give the correct information, they should but they don't (they are out sourced after all), to certain policies/procedures. While in normal circumstances it would take only &lt;25 business days to complete
 a UAI there has been a boom in account thefts due to a lack of security in EA, namely FIFA. So that has increased the amount of UAI cases and the time to complete a case. Now it can take from several days to several months depending on where you are on the
 qeue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I know this is information you don't want to hear but it is what it is. I would keep on top of support. If they say they'll call by a certain day and they don't, call the next day with your Incident Number at hand, as well as
 any previous ones, so you don't have to repeat most of the issues you are having. You shouldn't have to but that may be the only way to see a resolution quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">As for providing feedback, you can do so two ways. One by clicking the feedback link at the bottom of this page (note you will not get a response by using that one). The other way is by sending them an e-mail, just click on support
 link at the bottom of the page, and in a few days you'll get some sort of response.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>temhotabot: thank you for the response but I didn't post this here to get a snarky response, including formatting suggestions ( I copied and pasted the response from Word but that apparently the formatting didn't come out right), from other members of the
 community. And I really do appreciate the fact that you took the time to try and help me. It's just that I'd like to get a response from someone who works at Microsoft if that's at all possible.</p>
<p>The feedback link does not provide enough space to fit what I'd like to say and posting to the forum was specifically recommended by a CS Manager. I've sent an email as well and that gets a standard response from a standard CS representative so far. They
 have nothing to say other than "sorry for the inconvenience".</p>
<p>I'm confident that I've done everything I can to "keep on top" of support. &nbsp;In fact, I've never had to repeat my incident number or describe my issue again. The bottom line is that not one single rep has done what they've said they would do and I find that
 unacceptable. &nbsp;I know I could have just purchased a used copy but I didn't (my saved games were already deleted as a result of the troubleshooting). While I appreciate the gesture, I do not need directions to the nearest Game Stop.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this is a complaint and not a troubleshooting request. This is the only forum (pardon the pun) that was made available to me. Members of the community, please keep that in mind before responding.</p>

            <p>Hey chad - first of all, thanks for your post. I can certainly understand your frustration, and I'm sorry to hear that you've had a less than stellar experience! I understand that you've had an issue with Fable II, as well as an issue with an unauthorized access on your account. Was your account migrated to another region, or were just the email and contact information changed? Also, it appears that one of our specialists contacted you regarding your Fable II issue and asked if you could try some troubleshooting for the download. Were you able to perform that troubleshooting? Thanks!</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, my account was not migrated to another region. I have no idea how to check that. As for Fable II, I tried troubleshooting with various support reps at least five times. The reps tried having me delete the game, delete saved games, delete
 my cache, restart my xbox, restart my router, etc. After a certain point, when it became clear it was not a problem with my Xbox, my router, or my error, troubleshooting was clearly not a viable option and I was just trying to get a call back from someone
 other than the standard customer service representatives who had no capability to solve the problem. That never happened, even after multiple follow-up calls over the course of six months and that's why I'd like to file a complaint.</p>

<p>dang sorry to hear ... what im reading from forums n all... its more then a 2+ month waiting period ^^... mine has been under investigation since umm.. beg of dec .. ^^ so im more at 2+ months...
</p>
<p>wise thing to do.. ask for a refund next time.. if they want to do there frad investigation tell them HELL NO u just want a refund of all purchases ^^... and if u believe they got ur info.. change your passwords remove your CC's and call ur CC company ask
 for a new card.. </p>
<p>and IMO it seems like alot of ppl latley are having there accounts hacked... so keep a bit of a warning to all u ppl out there.. remove your CC info till xbox decides to implement a more secure server or other steps to prevent stuff like this happening in
 the first place..</p>
<p>oh whats worse IMO... if u call MS CS ... they ask u to validate ur account by asking u what is the answer to your secret question.. DONT GIVE IT TO THEM.. refuse to and just give your last four digits of ur CC u use.. why cuz u just gave a person your answer
 to your secret question and that could be the same question and answer to alot of other accounts.. hey u might not know .... that person on the other line could be the hacker and writing down everyones ansnwers to secret questions...</p>

<ol>
<li>Typical waiting time is not 2+ months unless the account was migrated or missing vital information.
</li><li>Refusing to do an investigation and saying "HELL NO" is not going to magically get you a refund.&nbsp; They have to do an investigation to prove the account was not in your control when the purchases were made.&nbsp; Furthermore, only the fraud department can actually
 give refunds for points because that's the only time you will ever get a refund for a point purchase (by refund I mean the actual money, not refund to get the points themselves back).&nbsp; This is probably the worst advice you could follow when an account is stolen.
</li><li>Using prepaid cards instead of credit cards is a great idea to prevent fraud charges, however stolen accounts will continue to occur because&nbsp;MS cannot stop people from getting phished, socially engineered, or getting malware on their pc.&nbsp; It has nothing
 to do with MS servers not being secure, thieves are just getting smarter in how they attain your information.
</li><li>Refusal to give enough information to validate an account can result in the support agent not being able to answer any questions at all.&nbsp; Not to mention your own plan there has it's own contradiction.&nbsp; You say skip the secret question and just do the last
 four of the credit card, but then before that you said to remove the credit card in the first place.&nbsp; Do you see a problem with that plan?

</p>
<p>well in control or not in your control of your account u can request a refund if you make or didnt make a purchase.. am i correct? isnt it like buying a product n returning it??
</p>
<p>why i say this cuz off experience.. MS Support doesnt no sh^t and tells u whatever.. i was told by MS support they have different CS locations and all been trained differently blah blah blah... 1 MS support tells me i have to do investigation, a month later
 Another MS support tells me i should of just requested a refuned and that was it.. &nbsp;while 2 months later they need my secondary email which i gave them a month n half before hand..</p>
<p>going to be 3month on march 10th and still havnt been fixed... im the only one making the effort of contact MS support n bit@hen wtf is taking so long and all i get is.. "They cant do anything while its under the Investigation Team"

<br />
So what you're saying is your e-mail account was hacked therefore giving away most if not all of your personal info likely also including the answer to your secret question but you're still confused as to how you managed to lose another two accounts that were
 also using the same secret question and answer as your previously hacked e-mail address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tough one that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well the email you give them to contact you for an investigation cannot be one that is currently on the account as the person that stole the account can see that email address and potentially have compromised it as well (people tend to use same passwords
 for numerous accounts). &nbsp;From the sounds of things, you gave them an email that was already on file and that's what is holding up the case. &nbsp;So that goes back to my first point where I said it doesn't normally take 2+ months unless you are missing vital information.</p>
