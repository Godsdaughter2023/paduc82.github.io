<h2>            App Store Download Error</h2>
                    <p>So I have recently purchased Gears of War Ultimate Edition for Windows 10 however when I try to download it I get the error "Try that again, thre was an error" and the download starts from scratch. The furthest I have been is 42GB complete out of 52.8 only
 to get the error message. It has happened at various points along the download process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone tell me how to either get the download to complete or tell me who I need to speak to so I can get a refund.</p>

            <p>Firstly, thank you for taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as for Method 3, this is a clean install so it rules that out. Method 2, if you think I'm going to deactivate protection for a 52GB download you are sorely mistaken. Method 1, trobleshooter is about as useful as hammering screws as it only looks for
 driver updates which, as per method 3, all is newly downloaded and updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you or anyone just tell me how I go about getting a refund.</p>

<p>Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>&nbsp;Do you get this message when you run some program?</p>
<p>(1). Run the program as administrator and check if it works.</p>
<p>(2). Check the compatibility of that program with Windows 7 in this link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>(3). you can try running it in Compatibility mode and see if you could make it work, if not then you might have to upgrade it to a newer version.<br />
I will provide you the steps to go in to the XP compatibility mode.<br />
Here are the steps to go in to the XP compatibility mode.<br />
To change compatibility settings manually for a program:<br />
1. Right-click on the software, <br />
2. Click Properties, and then <br />
3. Click the Compatibility tab. <br />
4. Put a check mark on “Run this program in a compatibility mode”.<br />
5. Select the operating system as Windows XP<br />
6. Click “Apply”<br />
7. Click “OK”</p>
<p>Check this link for more information.<br />

            <p>To clarify your queries, detecting broken registry entries and modifying your registry is not advisable as this would compromise how your Windows 10 behaves. However you can identify issues if the usual action you are trying to perform is not working compared
 to before. Cross-referencing the issue and re-producing the issue would help a lot in determining what caused the issue to arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for running a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker</a></strong>, this helps in terms of detecting
 possible damaged system files as it will correct what system file that needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)</a></strong> is best
 used when you experience issues in relation to any updates needed by your system. (eg. Drivers, Windows Updates, etc.)<br />
</p>
<p>To check for the integrity of your computer's drive, you can perform a <strong>
Check Disk (ChkDsk)</strong> command through the command prompt by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X</strong>.</li><li>On the list, click on <strong>Command Prompt (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A</span>dmin)</strong>.</li><li>Key in <strong>chkdsk</strong> (if you wish to check only for the integrity of your computer's drive), or
<strong>chkdsk /r</strong> (if you want to have Windows check and repair any possible drive issues).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>And as for your main concern, you can test first if all the basic functionalities of Windows works without any problem by running
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong> to isolate the issue.</p>

</p><p>1. The computer used to boot up to black screen with the mouse pointer showing. I connected an external screen and it would show the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The computer doesnt boot up in safe mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. chkdsk has completed successfully and reports there is nothing to repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The laptop doesnt boot up with any of the 9 options available when you go through the startup repair screen using the trouble shoot options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. When I tried to re-install windows 10 it does go through and detect the hdd but then it reports that it cant install windows in this volume.&nbsp; The hdd was installed with 2 partitions and I am not able to see these partitions with the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I am able to access both partitions when I use the command line which I am able to get to sometimes if the repair CD is in the DVD drive and I am able to select boot from DVD drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>However now I am in a situation where I have to activate windows and the windows 7 key that was attached to the laptop has rubbed off so difficult to read and apply for activation.</p>

<h2>            I went to Disk Management, chose my USB, and clicked the red &#34;Delete&#34; button. Now it is not able to access the drive. Why is this happening&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was making a Windows 10 USB, but my USB only showed 2 MB of storage, even though it was 16GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I searched it up, and people said to go to disk management and delete the partitions, but I went there and accidentally clicked on the whole USB drive and deleted the whole thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't access the drive, and it doesn't work even on other computers. It just says&nbsp;"Please insert a disk into USB Drive (E:)."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB is by Gigastone, and is 16GB. I've tried formatting it and everything, but I can't seem to make it work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need an answer fast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Never mind, I used EaseUS's Partitition Master to restore the deleted partition, and now I can access it again.</p>

<p>No, but I know that this one is 16GB, because I have tried it before, and it was 16GB. But this time when I checked, it was only 2MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I followed the following tutorial, and it started working correctly fortunately.</p>

    <title>Surface 3 touch stuck in Right Click mode on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface 3 touch stuck in Right Click mode on Windows 10</h2>
                    I've noticed this very very annoying bug in Windows 10 after a few minutes of use, from switching between apps,&nbsp; such as OneNote and Edge,&nbsp;&nbsp; the touch only responds with right click functions instead of left click functions when you tap the screen with
 your finger.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far I found the only temporary solution is to restart the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bug will always return.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there something else I can check to correct to very annoying problem?

            <p>Hi Tod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you upgrade to Windows 10 - Windows Update or with Media Creation tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand your concern. In this case, I would suggest you to hard reboot the system by pressing and holding the power button until the system shuts down. Power on the system after 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then you might have to boot from the installation media and run a Startup repair.
<span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page to create media:

<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer.

            <p>I have a workaround: touch with 2 fingers.</p>
<p>It will recover, and after 15 or 16 clicks, the bug returns.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's related to the pen, because it appears after I paired it with a new surface pen.</p>

            <p>Hi Harkanwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A repair or fresh install does not solve this problem. &nbsp;I have performed this and a few other options. &nbsp;I have noticed it happen more when I use OneNote 2013 and have recently upgraded to the Office 2016 OneNote where I have also had it happen. &nbsp;I would
 say there has been some strange behavior from Chrome in regards to touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously something goes wrong and the whole touch system thinks all touch input is a right click action. &nbsp;Sometimes I am able to stop this by touching the screen with five or more fingers. &nbsp;Other times I just reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this happen when the Surface 3 upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. &nbsp;A fresh install of Windows 10 it does continue to happen. &nbsp;What I have been doing lately is only keep one instance of OneNote Desktop open instead of my usual multiple window
 instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is something that can't be easily reproduced either. &nbsp;Perhaps when it does happen there is a process or something that we could create a memory dump on when the right-click touch action is happening?</p>

<p>Same issue! And the same solution (two finger touch) for me</p>
<p>But really annoying</p>
<p>I also have problem in double click with finger. It hardly works and I finally need to use the&nbsp;pen or keyboard to open the file.</p>
<p>I can just hope they fix it soon.</p>

            <p>Exact same problem here. I counted the number of left clicks before the right click problem. I find 16 clicks too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Pro 3, (Core i3). Upgraded from W8 to W10 through Windows Update as soon as I bought the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>very annoying.. this machine is definitely going back to the store. I will wait for things to be ironed out and use my Macs until then.</p>

</p><p>The link provided is for Windows 8 and below for persons configuring images for distribution.&nbsp; However, this does nothing for people experiencing this problem on our new Windows 10 upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC already has the "Type" DWORD in the registry with a value of Hex 20, instead of Hex 0x10 per the document.&nbsp; So, given that this entry is already in the registry AND I am unable to change this registry setting EVEN when running Regedit as administrator...what
 is a new Windows 10 user to do?</p>

</p><p>My PC seems to lockup after getting the first message...spinning wheel for at least 7 minutes and I don't get an option to logon until I have hard rebooted the PC.</p>

            Will anybody be providing support for those personal computers not on a domain with Windows 10 Pro that are having this same issue? I see several people listing the same issue claiming not to be on a domain including the OP, however, the only reply of
 support I see is for the Domain connected machines. As was stated "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>If your computer not connected to a domain network, please let us know, we will help you.</strong></span>" So has anybody been
 able to get any help with this yet?

    <title>Problems with adding email accounts in &#34;Mail&#34; of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with adding email accounts in &#34;Mail&#34; of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone at Microsoft know why some people have no problem adding email accounts in the "Mail" app of Windows 10 when others cannot even open a window to do add an account. &nbsp;Microsoft support does not seem to know. &nbsp;One support representative concluded
 - "... your PC is not Compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;That might be a reason of that some Apps are not working properly." &nbsp;After today's session I was told "... &nbsp;in POP email we need to contact the email provider first and for troubleshooting the Mail application
 we have more troubleshooting steps on it"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to remember that when I first got a Windows PC Outlook (Express) allowed me to add email accounts by entering POP addresses and Ports etc. &nbsp;It amazes me that Microsoft was able to do that in the 1960's but cannot do it in 2016. &nbsp;It is incredible that
 I must contact my email provider to continue the resolution of my problem. &nbsp;Apparently many people have been able to add an account without contacting their email provider. &nbsp;Several websites show Windows 10 screens of places to enter POP, IMAP, Port information
 etc. so it seems to me to be a Windows 10 issue when those same windows don't appear on my PC. &nbsp;(Those windows appeared on my Nextbook Windows 10 tablet)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently purchased a refurbished HP Compaq Elite 3000 with Windows 10 operating system.&nbsp; I have loaded several applications which seem to work OK (I also have a Nextbook tablet with Windows 10 with which I have had few problems).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday, September 24<sup>th</sup> I started trying to add my email accounts (other than my Outlook.com account).&nbsp; I first started the “Mail” app, chose “add account”, chose “Google” as the account to add but Windows 10 simply opened a window saying
 “searching for settings” and running blue dots from the left side of the window to the right side.&nbsp; Nothing good ever happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then opened “Settings”, chose the option that includes email issues and tried again.&nbsp; Once again the blue dots appeared but
 nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then (on my XP computer) googled “how to add an email account in Windows 10”.&nbsp; The message indicated that many people have had issues performing this seemingly simple task and that one “work around” that has worked was to choose “Add a POP or IMAP account”
 and then put the Google settings in there.&nbsp; I tried that again with no results.&nbsp; I then started trying to contact Microsoft support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually I was able to open a chat session with HB (Case number 135...081) and spent the next 4 hours working with him.&nbsp; He assumed control of my computer and tried a number of things but he finally concluded:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“thank you for patiently waiting RT.&nbsp; As of now I have tried to troubleshoot the issue in all of the possible ways but now I came to know that your PC is not compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; That might be a reason of that some Apps are not working properly.&nbsp;
 How ever if you will allow me to start the In place Upgrade of your Windows.&nbsp; Which would install the Latest Updated Windows 10 in your PC.&nbsp; It would fix the System file corruptions and the Critical issues would get fixed.&nbsp; Even some of the websites are not
 working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what would you suggest RT.&nbsp; Shall I initiate the Download of Windows 10 Anniversary Update or you want to Continue with what your computer supports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Update it] (I said)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay!&nbsp; So, what I am going to do is.&nbsp; I would be initiating the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.&nbsp; Its a huge Update so it may take a while to Download.&nbsp; All you need to do is once the Download finishes, you need to Open the file and Double Click the Setup
 file.&nbsp; The Installation would start automatically.&nbsp; Shall we proceed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[yes] (I said)”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HB said he had “Run the Setup for (me).”&nbsp; I then confirmed with HB that I had time to walk my dog and he said yes.&nbsp; When I returned from the walk my computer had an open window saying “Getting a few things ready” with little blue dots running around in circles.&nbsp;
 This went on for several hours.&nbsp; At some point the message changed to “Cleaning up some things” (or something similar) and that message and little blue dots ran all evening and was running when I went to bed.&nbsp; When I got up Sunday the window was closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried adding accounts again but the same things happened.&nbsp; Over night I thought that one of the messages I had been seeing when I tried to create a new account (to-wit: “searching for settings”) did’nt make sense because I had never entered the settings
 into this computer and I didn’t think Google would let some computer come in and find my settings.&nbsp; I then thought that maybe Windows was going to Outlook.com to find the settings so I clicked on “Edge” to go to Outlook.com to put the settings there.&nbsp; However
 I was foiled again because my computer had lost it’s internet connection but my other computers were still connected.&nbsp; I tried establishing the connection but Windows 10 continued with its curt and cryptic messages and menu choices.&nbsp; Frustrated again I left
 and came back Sunday night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then restarted my computer (which apparently reestablished the internet connection), went to Outlook.com and entered my gmail account and another account as other accounts for Outlook to check.&nbsp; Once again however neither Mail or Settings did anything
 different. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then searched for installed updates to Windows 10 but apparently the Anniversary Update was not installed.&nbsp; I cannot find it again but somewhere I saw a message that said the update installation failed.&nbsp; “About” shows that version 1511 of Windows is installed
 on this computer (not 1607 – the version number for the Anniversary Update) so I assume that the Update was never installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am now back to square 1 (except that now my cd/dvd drive is not working).</p>

<br />
4:08 PM RT: Hopefully we are back<br />
4:08 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Hi.<br />
4:08 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Is that the update you do?<br />
4:09 PM RT: The update is gone I guess since I restarted the computer<br />
4:09 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Yes, can you check.<br />
4:10 PM RT: Its not on Task Manager anymore<br />
4:10 PM [Microsoft Rep]: That's good.<br />
4:13 PM [Microsoft Rep]: How was it?<br />
4:13 PM RT: What do we do next?<br />
4:13 PM RT: I assume the Update just stopped and was never installed.<br />
4:13 PM [Microsoft Rep]: It is not installed<br />
4:15 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Hi are you still there?<br />
4:16 PM RT: I am still here but I don't know what to do<br />
4:16 PM [Microsoft Rep]: May i know what other errors you have?<br />
4:19 PM RT: As far as I know I still have all of the email problems, my cd/dvd drive (which has a 2003 Microsoft Office installation disk in it) still doesn't work. &nbsp;It showed up when you looked at File Explorer but it did not show the installation disk that
 is in it as it has been doing when I installed other programs. &nbsp;I cannot get to it to run the installation of Office 2003<br />
4:20 PM [Microsoft Rep]: That's it, it is now installing.<br />
4:25 PM RT: I will wait until we are through to go through that - I didn't know it showeed up. &nbsp;I guess I will try the email again.<br />
4:25 PM [Microsoft Rep]: I see, sure.<br />
4:25 PM RT: The email problem has not changed. &nbsp;Nothing has been fixed about it.<br />
4:25 PM [Microsoft Rep]: For that kind of email we need to contact the email provider on that.<br />
4:27 PM RT: With all due respect that is hogwash. &nbsp;Google "how can I add an email account to "Mail" in Windows 10" and see what you get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
4:29 PM RT: Windows supposedly will automatically add gmail and yahoo accounts and will let you add tx.rr.com accounts
</p>
<p>-IF and that's a BIG IF - Windows would let you enter the settings like Outlook did in 1965<br />
4:29 PM [Microsoft Rep]: For Outlook you can if it's the appliication.<br />
4:30 PM RT: I bought a computer with Windows 10 and I DAMN well expect it to do what it is supposed to do.<br />
4:31 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Yes, I know why you are frustrated right now, but for other email provider we must use Outlook applications.<br />
4:32 PM Robert Tharp: My Nextbook tablet running Windows 10 let me add all of my emaiil accounts without hassle. &nbsp;Now you are telling me Windows 10 won't do that on this computer? &nbsp; Microsoft had better start supporting XP again if thats true.\<br />
4:33 PM RT: Is there a Supervisor I can talk to?<br />
4:35 PM [Microsoft Rep]: First may I know if it's working before?<br />
4:39 PM RT: I just got it Thursday and it has never worked correctly. &nbsp;My Nerxtbook has and my XP and my VISTA have and they have let me enter the necessary POP or IMAP settings or automatically setup gmail, yahoo and outlook email accounts. &nbsp;I know you think
 I am stupid but I am 70 years old a retired lawyer, CPA and have an MBA, have fought in Vietnam have tried cases before the Supreme Court of the US and the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. &nbsp;I am not senile yet<br />
4:41 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Yes, I understand you sir,let me do things for you and have the best resolution on this, if we can't then we need to contact first the email provider so they can set it up, and I know how frustrated you are as well as I if I encounter
 the same problem.<br />
4:43 PM RT: It will be a cold day in **** before I try to contact and email provider to do something Windows 10 is supposed to do automatically. &nbsp;If you are not going to connect me with a supervisor then I guess we are through,<br />
4:46 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Can we try troubleshooting steps first?<br />
4:47 PM RT: what have we been doing for the past several hours?<br />
4:47 PM [Microsoft Rep]: We look for the errors and try to configure it.<br />
4:49 PM RT: You said there was nothing we can do and you told me to go contact an emaiil provider to solve my Windows 10 problem. &nbsp;I do not want to continue doing the same things I have done with Microsoft Support personnel for 10 or more hours already.<br />
4:50 PM RT: I will work with a supervisor if I am connected to one.<br />
4:50 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Everything is fine is that the other email address in IMAP, so we need contact the email provider first for us to get the email configuration, because we have different settings for IMAP.<br />
4:52 PM RT: Nothing is fine - my gmaiil account has not been added to "Mail", my Yahoo email account has not been added to "Mail, and my tx.rr.com POP email account has not been added to "Mail"<br />
4:52 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Can I further it please?<br />
4:52 PM [Microsoft Rep]: Can I further check it please?<br />
4:53 PM RT: HB could not solve the problems Saturday and you have not solved them today. &nbsp;I think I need a supervisor.<br />
4:56 PM [Microsoft Rep]: May we try to troubleshoot again, please?<br />
4:58 PM RT: I really think you have already tried everything you know to try so it will be a further waste of my time and yours to continue. &nbsp;I am ending this chat.<br />
5:00 PM [Microsoft Rep]: I respect your descision about that, but in POP email we need to contact the email provider first and for troubleshooting the Mail application we have more troubleshooting steps on it.<br />
5:04 PM RT: I have NEVER had to contact an email provider to set up an email account on my Radio Shack color computer, my Radio Shack Tandy 2000 computer, my endless stream of windows computers. &nbsp;When I Googled this problem I found many situations where other
 people input POP and/or IMAP settings yet Windows 10 will NOT even open a window for me to do it. &nbsp;Many other people have done that unless they were lying.<br />
5:05 PM [Microsoft Rep]: That's why our first step is to contact the email provider first for the configuration of the email.<br />
5:07 PM RT: Go ahead and contact Time Warner aka roadrunner aka many other things. &nbsp;Let me know when you find an answer. &nbsp;Goodbye.<br />

            <p>I really don't mean to add insult to injury here; it's meant as empathy &amp; what I did to fix an installation gone bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my HP COMPAQ DC5750 from December 2007 running XP Pro&nbsp;with an "Upgrade" to Win10 Pro x64&nbsp;from the MS Store. I was aware that there was no upgrade path from XP to WinX, so I backed everything for 8 years to a 2TB USB HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Upgrade" went horribly. I screwed around from Christmas 2015 to mid-January 2016 trying to get it to run smoothly. Then a co-technician told me to use the Win10MediaCreationTool, download the Win10_1511_Build10586.420_x64.iso,&nbsp;and use a&nbsp;16GB+&nbsp;USB 2.0
 (very important) memory stick to perform a "clean install".&nbsp;With the Media Tool &amp; the ISO in the same dir (on my USB HDD), the Media Tool will create a bootable USB image; reboot. I had to change my boot order by pressing F10 or F12, I don't remember which.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a RegEdit problem I had to run down (M$ approach to fix regedit in 10.0.10586.****), but all else with the installation&nbsp;went well. I can supply you with the Media Tool &amp; RegEdit fix if you are unable to find them (MS may remove or move the URL(s)
 when they stopped the Upgrade path from Win 7, &amp; 8.1). What drivers not integrated in the installation were easily retrieved from the Internet (I guess MS made sure they supported almost all known NIC drivers so it could guarantee Internet access to their
 site).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This path made sure of the latest build was installed, as my understanding it was the last distribution version to be released; the updates would supply the necessary patches. After installation, I made sure Automatic Updates was turned On. It ran all night,
 rebooting however many times. The next day, I started configuration &amp; turning off bloatware. Everything I needed to do ran smoothly, thanks to my [now] friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you or readers of this post, need assistance, email me &amp; I'll tell/give you what I know/have to facilitate the process. May good luck fall upon us all.&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; In my case the third Microsoft support tech finally solved the problem by stopping some processes (?) that were running.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't know what he stopped.

<p>Should this be fixed before I attempt to run the program?</p>

<p>Do you need the complete text, or is it a version incompatiblity&nbsp;&nbsp;with windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Xbox Reward Pr&#228;mienpunkte nicht gutgeschrieben </h2>
                    <p>Hi. Meine Xbox Rewards Prämienpunkte wurden mir immer noch nicht gut geschrieben. Am 30.5 nicht und jetzt am 15.6 auch nicht. Ich habe Microsoft Rewards beendet. Und in der Info steht das dann sowieso alle verbleibenden Punkte gutgeschrieben werden. Und falls das nicht möglich ist, das ihr euch dann meldet. Aber weder das eine noch das andere ist passiert, nur die Bestätigung das ich mich vom reward program abgemeldet habe, habe ich bekommen. Was muss bzw kann ich jetzt machen? LG&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Halo&#58; Reach Bungie Link-up Daily Challenge</h2>
                    
<p>I tried to link up my gamertag with Bungie.net and then played a multi-player matching game like the challenge says and I didn't get the challenge completed. When I sign in on Bungie.net and click the Halo: Reach symbol near the top right of the screen it
 looks like I'm linked: my gamertag and friend list shows up and my info of my Service Record; rank, commendations, last date I played, etc shows except it's showing where all those were as of March 28, 2012 (last date played according to the account) but I
 have played almost everyday since then and my commendations and rank are past what the Bungie.net account says. What's going on? Why isn't the Bungie.net account up to date and why hasn't my challenge completed if my gamertag is now linked with Bungie.net?</p>

<p><b>From:</b> dean-dean</p>
<p>If you've used 3rd party cleaner, it may have deleted the desktop.ini in the Recent Items folder.&nbsp; If you navigate to C:\Users\(Your Name)AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows, does the Recent Items folder have
 a special icon?&nbsp; If it doesn't, and only shows the generic manila one, and the folder is just called Recent (without the word Items), right-click on the Recent folder and choose Delete.&nbsp; Log Off and then Log On.&nbsp; Open your Start Menu and type shell:recent.&nbsp;
 This should restore the folder with the correctdesktop.ini, which will then restore the right-click context menu item "Clear Recent Items List" (right-click inside the folder that pops up to test that).<br />

    <title>EPG expiring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank blundell  say:</h3>
<h2>            EPG expiring</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows XP and Windows 7 on my desktop and laptop respectively.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;use M/S Media Center to record digital TV on both PCs.</p>
<p>In order to do this I HAVE to use the "EPG" Electronic Program Guide contained within both versions of Media Center to schedule the recordings.</p>
<p>My XP PC is now complaining that there is only three days of EPG and I must download the latest listings but if I do there is no improvement.</p>
<p>If I go into TV Guide there are no listings beyond 31/12/2012</p>
<p>If I go into "Settings-TV-Guide-About Guide Listings" it shows an End Date of "01/01/2013"</p>
<p>My Windows 7 laptop has a similar problem but that "End Date" is "06/01/2013" and, similarly, no listings exist beyond 05/01/2013</p>
<p>Both PCs show that the EPG data is downloaded from "Broadcasting Dataservices Ltd" an English company.</p>
<p>I have trolled the internet and can find no reference to any such problem.</p>
<p>I have gone through the "Setup TV Listings" process to no avail.</p>

<p>Just performed a fresh install, and guide expiry (in Guide/About) is 01/01/2013.</p>
<p>This is a real bummer! It seems to be a MS problem. It seems to download the data, but the end date is preventing MCE from using it.</p>

            Has anyone else had any joy with this? I'm experiencing the same issue on my XP MCE box and have not had any guide data for 3 days. Before I found this thread (which at least makes me realise it's not just me) I had re-scanned services and re-setup the
 guide.<br />
<br />
Update: I just did some further searches [ http://www.google.co.uk?q=mce+epg+01%2F01%2F2013 ] and this seems to show it's even more widespread : http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-media-center-users-in-the-uk-experiencing-epg-outage<br />

            Thanks for the information. That is a lot of work you have put in. If they don't sort things soon I'll have to go down that road myself. My Media Centre with DVBT is loading and updating it's EPG. It's the one with two Sat recievers that is failing to
 get an EPG update.

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
Thanks for that. From what I can find out, RedBee are saying this is beyond their control. While I can't verify this I suspect that they're publishing the data as they always do.<br />
<br />
I've been to the MS site here : https://connect.microsoft.com/site1145 and found a whole load of UK EPG issues there (under feedback). MS are now at least acknowledging the issue. I found the entry with the largest number of votes and voted it up myself. This
 one : https://connect.microsoft.com/site1145/feedback/details/775612/uk-epg-not-updating<br />
<br />
It may help to escalate it if others here can do the same.<br />
<br />
Let's hope this is fixed soon!<br />

            <p>Hello Srimadhwa B</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks to you and all of the others who have contributed.&nbsp; What amazes me is that this issue seems to have been missed for so long.&nbsp; My W7 netbook is only 9months from purchase and its EPG expired weeks ago.</p>
<p>There are a number of worrying details,</p>
<p>a&nbsp; The Microsoft Support site no longer lists Media Center for online support, it simply points you to this community.</p>
<p>b&nbsp; Windows 8 is not supplied with Media Center, you have to buy it as an expensive extra.</p>
<p>c&nbsp; As some have found Broadcasting Dataservices ltd. deny responsibility.&nbsp; From what I have gathered from its web site I suspect that Microsoft have "forgotten" (ha ha) to renew its license and are thus unable to issue an update to all of its "valued" (ha
 ha) customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of those "valued" customers I am seriously considering responding to Microsoft in kind with my own "V" sign and using an alternative software.&nbsp; You will find a number of them out there.&nbsp; I myself am looking at MediaPortal which looks good but am battling
 with a bug fix caused, would you believe by Microsoft.</p>
<p>This bug only exists in XP systems, the W7 version should not have the problem and I will report on this when tested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also waiting to chat with a friend who may be able to help so I will come back post that conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you all had a good Xmas and New Year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frank B.</p>
