<p>
</p><p>If this started out as Win 8 and was upgraded to 8.1, it may have messed up the ability to restore it to factory...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>In order for this to work you will need a USB Hub, keyboard, mouse, and a adapter from microUSB to a standard FEMALE flat USB...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind of turning the Tablet into a Desktop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you boot from the installation media you can try to do the reset from there...</p>
<p>If your tablet has Win 8.1 with BING it makes things a bit more tricky, but regular Win 8.1 of whatever you have should work to try the reset...</p>

<h2>            jpg thumbnails are blurry in file explorer but are crystal clear in Photoshop &#40;and camera LCD screen&#41;</h2>
                    All of a sudden, I'm having this problem. &nbsp;I went to download photos from my Canon DSLR and all of the images appear to be blurry. &nbsp;I checked the properties and they are all approximately the same size as all of my previous photos. &nbsp;When I open a photo
 in Photoshop Editor, it is crystal clear. &nbsp;They are also clear on the camera LCD screen. &nbsp;What's going on and how can I fix it? &nbsp;TIA.
<br />
<br />
ETA: &nbsp;I just checked the windows photo app and photo viewer and the photos are fine in both of those programs, too.

            <p>Hi Cidar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have&nbsp;in viewing photos. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the application&nbsp;you use to view photos downloaded from your Canon?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Is the issue specific to&nbsp;the photos downloaded from Canon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the required information. I will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I was in the process of downloading them from my camera which was directly connected via USB to my computer. &nbsp;I was using file explorer. &nbsp;Based on all of the properties, the photos were of the typical quality (size) as they usually are. &nbsp;This is a sudden
 problem after years of it working fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened the photo in the photo app and using the photo viewer program (I can't remember if it is windows based or not), by double clicking from my camera's memory in file explorer, they were perfectly fine. &nbsp;They were also perfectly fine when opened
 in the same way to Photoshop. &nbsp;But the thumbnails made them appear to be horribly out of focus, kind of like that pixelated thing that happens when they first pop up in the folder (before they become clear).<br />
<br />
I ended up importing the photos through Photoshop Elements onto my computer. &nbsp;NOW they look fine, now that they are downloaded and on my hard drive. &nbsp;But I'm still interested in hearing what you think happened in case it happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has never happened before. &nbsp;I've never had a problem with either the Canon or my iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            An answer (as requested) would have been helpful. I have the same issue. When I view my images on my iPhone5 using a usb cable and file explorer (win10), they are very low resolution and so unclear - like a thumbnail image. When copied to the pc and viewed
 in file explorer they are fine. But it is difficult if I wish to make a quick specific selection to be sure so I have to copy down more images to choose from.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed a new version of Windows 8.1 few days ago and everything was working just fine. But, out of the blue, whenever I open a Start menu Desktop's icons show up on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I mean:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2032a39-5afb-4608-9151-7e0f68250d95" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>They do disappear after I restart the operating system, otherwise they are quite persistent. Any help or suggestion on how I can overcome this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Mirko,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are getting windows desktop items behind start screen and it gets disappear once you restart the operating system. The issue
 seems to be peculiar and it might be happening due to the impact of any third party program or with the windows settings and personalization. I will certainly help you with the same. However, we need few more details to understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you get any error message?</span></li><li><span>Have you recently made any changes on your computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the desktop items gets disappear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from
 the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists then please try
<strong>Method 2</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this method we will try to modify the taskbar settings from properties.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on taskbar and click on “properties”.</span></li><li><span>Click on “Navigation” tab.</span></li><li><span>Please modify the settings on “Start Screen” column.</span></li><li><span>Uncheck everything which is under start screen column and click on “Apply”.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still unable to see any difference then please try to login to default administrator account and check if you get the same issue on that account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)</span></li><li><span>Type
<strong>CMD</strong>. <strong>Command Prompt</strong> would appear.</span></li><li><span>Right click on
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> and click on <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type, “net user administrator /active:yes” without quotient.</span></li><li><span>Logoff from current user account and check it from Administrator account which should be on login screen.</span></li><li><span>If you find start screen without desktop background then the problem is with user account or settings.</span></li><li><span>To undo or turn off default administrator please type, “net user administrator /active:no” without quotient on command prompt.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Reply along with the result of all the steps which you will perform to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The methods you suggested all work temporarily. The problem even seizes when I change the theme. I can't exactly pin point when it happens, so the first method would actually be a hit and miss. This also happens on laptop (on which I also have Windows 8.1
 installed).</p>

            I think I figured it out. Whenever I press Windows Key+D to bring up the Desktop, the icons appear on the Star menu. I tested it multiple times and I can confirm it.

<p>Just to make sure that I understand, are there two consoles that you are trying to access the content on? Any content you purchase gets a profile license (what allows your profile to access the content via live anywhere) and a console license (which allows
 all profiles on that console access it). The second license is where the license transfers come into play. If you are trying to get a second profile access to content on a different console from where the purchase was made, it will not work (that's where the
 license transfer comes in, to fix this). Keep in mind, you can only do a few license transfers a year, about once per 3 or 4 months.</p>

<p>Hi Kitty,<br />
<br />
Is this the only DLC content that is not working on the second account? I ask, because the license distribution for DLC is controlled by the publisher, and they do have the power to make it only possible to play that DLC on the account that purchased it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Just to confirm, you performed the license transfer on the account that purchased the content, correct? Also, is the secondary account you are trying to play it on an online account?&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Let us know, and we can go from there. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I stop disk reading of datastore.edb crippling my PC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haptad  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop disk reading of datastore.edb crippling my PC&#63;</h2>
                    Periodically my Lenovo X200s laptop, running Vista Business, grinds to a virtual halt for 5 minutes or more, especially on resuming from sleep. The Reliability and Performance Monitor (which I now keep permanently running to diagnose this) tells me that
 the culprit is the process svchost exe (netsvcs), which is reading datastore.edb at 120Mb/min or more. While the disk is grinding away reading this file, the computer seems unable to do anything else.<br />
<br />
I've searched forums for fixes (such as disabling BITS or Automatic Updates) but can't find anything definitive. I can't believe this is unique to me (indeed, my wife's HP desktop has similar issues), so can anyone help?<br />

            <p>A thought on gaining a better grasp on what is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start your computer, while it's crippled start Task Manager, find the netsvcs process (turn on command line display), right click and choose Go To Services. The services in that process will be listed. Start at the bottom (Windows Update) and work up (right
 click - <em>Stop Service</em>). When you hit the right one it will stop being crippled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the list from my computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BITS, IKEEXT, iphlpsvc, MMCSS, MSiSCSI,&nbsp;ProfSvc, RasMan, Schedule, seclogon, SENS,&nbsp;ShellHWDetection, Themes, Winmgmt, wuauserv.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows ships with a database repair utility. Tonight the first time I ran it so I'm no expert. But try verifing the checksum of the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>esentutl.exe /k c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\D<br />
ataStore.edb</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For help type</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>esentutl.exe /?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also defrag and repair. If problems were detected in the verify do a recovery followed by a repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>esentutl.exe /r c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\D<br />
ataStore.edb</em></p>
<p><em>esentutl.exe /p c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\D<br />
ataStore.edb </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defragging mine reduced it from 225MB to 164MB. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>esentutl.exe /d c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\D<br />
ataStore.edb </em></p>

<p>Note that these are the same file. "C:\Users\All Users" is actually a legacy shortcut to its new location of "C:\ProgramData"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you will need to temporarily disable Windows Search Indexing in order to defragment this file. It's not enough to Stop the service, since it may auto-start while you're trying to work on the file. You will need to set the service to "Disabled" while
 defragmenting it.</p>

            <p>I successfully reset my Microsoft account password, but when I try to log in with the new password, I still get the message asking for my old password. I entered both old passwords, and neither one works. This is super frustrating. Because I can't sign into

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft Community forums. As per the description, you are getting an error message "Get "unable to cast object of type 'system.boolean' to type 'system.string'" when you boot the computer. Let's analyze and identify
 the cause of the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot in safe mode with networking and check if you face the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts <span>Windows</span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start<span>Windows
</span>are installed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To boot into safe mode refer to the link provided below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Start tapping the <b>F8</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span>c) You will get advanced boot option window.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<b> </b></span><span>Select the option<b> “Safe mode with Networking”.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer to the link provided below for more information on safe mode:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode I would recommend that you perform Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><b><span><br />

    <title>How to stop Win 10 Home From Updating Nvidia Gpu Driver Creators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dgeesio  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Win 10 Home From Updating Nvidia Gpu Driver Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Win 10 started out not to bad sure there was some bloated bits and unnecessary things in it but.. overall pretty decent experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now with each update it becomes worse . any kind of support for it.especially if you on a high end pc with dedicated graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now...with the recent creators update and this update is supposed to benefit people like me who create content, its actually a worse experience.the very update windows made to make the experience better is worse in literally every way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now the main post is about Nvidia gpu drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>like many of us on a decent gaming machine and content creators.we have a dedicated card. why are windows forcing us to use certain drivers ? you could turn this off until recently now its forced on win 10 home.doesnt matter what driver you put on and you
 cant stop it because its forced not a choice you just get the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now...because certain Nvidia cards like and perform better and worse with certain drivers you need to have the choice !</p>
<p>
</p><p>all the recent nvidia drivers along with Creators update have been useless ! many things are broke and not fixed.you have gamma issues / colour profile issues.refresh rate issues.monitor issues, brightness issues.stuttering,lagging. just to name a few.certain
 older drivers perform better but nope Win 10 deems it better to force us to have the newer broken drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so for close to two months now i sit with a over bright over gamma screen which you cant correct because you cant use a older driver and win 10 isnt released the fix for colour profiles or fixed the other issues. nvidia cant do it because they need you to
 fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so many Content creators which this update is supposed to be for are in a worse place for being on the latest operating system with the supposed update for them.its almost comedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we need a option to just let us choose.we are not tablet users.our pcs are used for more than browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing should be forced .</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this moment i cant install the gpu driver i want to.i cant use the monitor driver i want to.i know what is the better experience im using the pc not windows.i want to be able to choose what i want to use.not be forced into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please make the changes for the content creators this update is supposed to be for. oh by the way win 10 removed windows movie maker for many who reinstalled win 10 for this update if they did a clean install which many would they would of lost the main
 content movie maker wise which was windows movie maker. you removed the biggest thing that makes movie content . thats how much of a content creators update this is.</p>
<p>

<p>it is un-ticked.win 10 will still auto update nvidia driver through windows updates and monitor driver to a later driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is on Win 10 home.people are being forced to use broken drivers because win 10 thinks they are better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>go on the Nvidia forums go see how many have these issues.its been going on for months now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>doesn't matter if you turn off or untick options on Win 10 home it still will update and put on the latest drivers.</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t install March Of Empires</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have an issue with my game on pc (Windows 8.1).&nbsp;Every update I&nbsp;had to install game from the scratch. This time I uninstalled the dame went to the store&nbsp;with my account. I pressed the "Get Game" button and got message "You already own this game". I couldn't
 find any place on web to download this game again. It always takes me to the Microsoft store with "You already own this game" message. How can I return my game to my PC? Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>I probably was not clear enough. Not Windows update caused the&nbsp;problem but game's update. Every time the game&nbsp;was updated I had to remove it and install from the scratch. I tried to talk to live person as you suggested but connection never went through.
 It kept connecting&nbsp;until I just closed the window - about&nbsp;10 minutes. I'll try do it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I didn't try to install other games of this type so I don't know. I installed new&nbsp;windows' updates. It is also done automatically on my PC. I tried restarting my PC and even shutting it up. I get same result - "You own this game"

<p>hoje, no globo repórter! </p>
<p>hueuheuhehu</p>
<p>acho q a maior (ou mais louca) foi a microsoft comprar Minecraft. mesmo isso não mudando nada no jogo (continua sendo multiplataforma) é de se tentar entender o q eles querem com isso (alem de faturar uma boa grana)</p>
<p>e tbm a Microsoft ter anunciado o novo TR como exclusivo (temporario), seguido da Sony torna o proximo SF Exclusivo (parece q definitivo) e a noticia de q a ms vai ser a publicadora do novo TR, que apesar de não ter mudado nada sobre a exclusividade temporaria,
 pode ser q mude ainda</p>
<p>isso pra mim é algo grande, pois pode ser que isso venha a se tornar mais frequente no futuro (ai vai f u d e r com tudo!)</p>
<p>*obs: "exclusivo", me refiro por não ter no console concorrente, eu sei q tem no pc</p>

<h2>            Burning DVD&#39;s using DVD maker stops at 99&#37;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title: Windows DVD Maker Problem</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a problem with DVD maker on my laptop, I am using vista. I used to be able &nbsp;to burn DVD's no problem at all using Windows DVD maker, but all of a sudden DVD maker will not burn anything. It reaches 99% then comes up error. I have tried;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Different types of DVD'S (DVD-R, DVD+R,) </li><li>Different Makes of DVD (Verbatim, Maxwell) </li><li>Restoring to earlier point </li><li>Converting to different format (AVI, WMV etc) </li><li>Burning at lower speed </li><li>Creating DVD through Windows Movie Maker</li></ul>
<div>I even tried to burn a sample videos pre-installed on vista in the public folder of the bear in the river and the same thing happen, 99% burned error&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;and cannot even burn this video to a&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;using DVD maker.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only type of video i burn is videos of boxing bouts. Each file on average is around 1 hour long. I have hundreds of discs burned using DVD maker and never had a problem until a month ago. One thing that should be noted is that I can create a DVD with
 the any of the files using Windows Media Center.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help with this problem would be much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Hey,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks so much for&nbsp;replying. I have windows vista home premium. I have had a few different&nbsp;third&nbsp;party&nbsp;software's&nbsp;on the computer as trial versions which I uninstalled. I tried your suggestions but no luck. I am testing it by trying to burn the short video
 of the bear from the public folder. Still no luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The strange thing I am finding is even the&nbsp;third&nbsp;party software would not burn this video to a disc but as stated before windows media center would. The only thing with media center was when I put a hour long file the quality output was poor.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure if anything I mentioned above may help find a solution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand how you feel about the situation. This issue could have occurred due to some incorrect settings or due to a incompatible network adapter driver. I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1: Run the Windows network diagnostic tool first as it can detect and fix most of the incorrect settings related to network. Right click on the network icon in the task bar and select 'Troubleshoot'. make sure that you make a note of the report

<h2>            Temporary file and Other folder file unble to remove in Newer Version of Windows 10 Pro &#40;1803v&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,<br />
I'm using <strong>Windows 10 Pro version 1803 </strong>on my <strong>HP EliteBook 8460P</strong> and I'm not able to delete the Temporary Files and Other files from Storage Sense which are taking a lot HDD space. I have tried to remove those unnecessary files
 but some amount of files are still exist on my PC. For this reason I reinstalled for several times but it still exists. Don't know why those files are not removing which takes extra HDD space about 5 or 6GB and it make my PC performance a bit slower - specially
 when I run adobe products to work. Please tell me now what should I do to remove them permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please don't suggest me to contact with HP. I know its a windows problem and now I'm asking for sort it out.</strong></p>
<p>Here some images to better understand... Take a look please and give me better way to solve.</p>

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            <p><span>Hi Rajendra_T,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for the post. I understand that you would like to allow Windows updates in firewall by creating an outbound rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>I will definitely help you with this.</span><br />
<br />
<p><span>You need to add the Windows Update website addresses to the blocking program's exceptions or "allow" list or allow Windows Update Service to connect to the Internet through port 80 and port 443.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To add the Windows Update websites to a firewall exceptions list</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows Firewall ships with this version of Windows and should already include these sites in the exceptions list. If you use a different firewall, refer to the software publisher's documentation to see how to add these websites to your firewall exceptions
 list:</span></p>

                    <p>hi guys I’m having an issue with my new Xbox one x. There are horizontal lines appearing on the screen for a second once every minute or two. Don’t think it’s my tv as my Tv&nbsp;works fine when not using the Xbox/when I connect other devices through the same hdmi cable</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - monitor not working through docking station</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I've been through all the solutions I can find on the forums and still cannot make the Surface Pro recognize a monitor when plugging in through the docking station. The monitor works fine using a miniDP to DP connection direct and is a AOC&nbsp;G2460PF</p>
<p>Windows 10 and docking firmware is upto date.</p>
<p>Further assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p><span><strong><em>cannot make the Surface Pro recognize a monitor when plugging in through the docking station.

<p><span><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Based on my experience with my monitor and my Surface 2 Pro I don't know how you could know what is going on. &nbsp; E.g. frequently, just resuming from Sleep, I get
<em>HDMI-2 No Signal</em>&nbsp; flash on the monitor. &nbsp; Is that similar to your symptom?&nbsp; I have a software only workaround that lets me use the monitor as Second Screen Only but it always requires getting there from another display configuration using the Project
 Win-P dialog.&nbsp; E.g. switching to PC Screen Only would be Win-P, Home, Enter and then switching (hopefully) directly to Second Screen Only would involve pressing Win-P, End, Enter.&nbsp; However, a problem with that is that there is a "Keep this...?" prompt with
 a ridiculously brief opportunity to respond Yes instead of No.&nbsp; I have to respond without seeing it.&nbsp; Sometimes CursorLeft, Spacebar works; sometimes it needs to be Tab, Enter.&nbsp; Who knows what it wants?&nbsp; And if I use Narrator (Win+Ctrl+Enter) to get its hints
 I had better remember to turn off its Lock Narrator key mode (e.g. press z) because there would certainly not be enough time to press x before each intentional keystroke.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sometimes just to keep me on my toes Windows 10 switches the Display configuration automatically to PC Screen Only (but still keeps my tablet screen black), so then pressing Win+P, Home, Enter would not have the desired effect (because it would not result
 in a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">change</span>.) &nbsp; Therefore, having Narrator running to describe what is happening is always a good plan.</p>

                    On a server 2008 domain our users are locked down. &nbsp;If I need to install anything I just use run as. &nbsp;I installed 3 new windows 7 pc's fully updated and one of them when I try the run as on anything i.e. a file or when adding a printer it will ask for
 credentials. &nbsp;When I put in the creds (of course the spelling is correct) it then errors out saying File not found.
<div>It is definitely there<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If i'm logged in as an domain admin there are no problems. &nbsp;Anyone out there seen this before?</div>

<div>Edit: &nbsp;The plot thickens. &nbsp;If I do run as then use local admin credentials it works fine.</div>

<p>Essentially I've noticed this happens with email software the most. When programs are installed in Program Files (+/- x86), the software is available for all users of the computer and resources can be easily shared between users (ie. Internet Explorer, Google
 Chrome, Firefox installed at this location). However, for some email software, while it would make sense for this to be installed similarly, they've chosen to be different; most likely its because they've designed the software to be customizable per user accounts,
 and allow for different mailboxes to be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's really not much of a reason to fix it, the software will still run in either location.</p>
