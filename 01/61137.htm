I can't change the resolution from 1280 x 1024. It won't accept any other resolution. My actual res is 1920 x 1080 I can't find an alignment grid in Win 10. I know how to do it in Vista and 7 but not 10. How do I access the alignment grid?<br />

<p>Nobody knows how to find an alignment grid in Win10 . . .really?</p>
<p>Does this silence mean there is no alignment grid? </p>

            <p>My issue is somewhat similar, the display is a little too big so I only see the tops of the taskbar icons and the corners of the display are not visible.&nbsp; I contacted Samsung and they said it is a graphics driver update that I have to get from Microsoft.&nbsp;
 I am not sure if this is true.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I can't get a definite answer for my question either. But that's the norm around here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hello Microsoft! Is anybody home?</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to the alignment grid that was in win/vista and win7? It is gone and I need to move the picture to the right a little. I am using the suggested/default resolution settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't send me to the monitor mfg, they sent me back to you because I use this monitor as a TV and the picture is just peachy-keen when viewing cable TV. It needs moved to the right only when I am using win7. (which, in my opinion, would make it a Microsoft/nvidia
 problem.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            High CPU and memory usage on few programs open.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a surface laptop 2 on Christmas and ever since I got it, my laptop has been constantly freezing and have received a few BSoDs as well. I checked my task manager to see what was going on and noticed that the "system" process has an average
 of 10-13% of CPU usage even though I have no other programs open. I have also noticed that my ram is always on the high percents. Based on this task manager, these "service hosts" process are taking a big chunk of memory each, ranges about 2-5%, I've done
 so much research on this issue and none of them work so far and end up freezing again every few hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-825OU CPU @ 1.60 GHz</p>

    <title>Blue &#47; Purple screen error on password screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaighalor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue &#47; Purple screen error on password screen</h2>
                    I updated from Windows 8 to 8.1 the other day but when I shut down the lenovo G580 laptop the picture screen before the password screen would not load and a solid blue screen fading purple and back only showed.
<br />
No key combination worked and I could not get it to work. I ended up restoring from a previous backup. I risked trying again in case it was the install but the error still occurred so I restored for the second time.
<br />
<br />
Can anyone work out how to fix this error as I really want my start button back! All help is much appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi Jai, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop errors (also sometimes called blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes<span>Windows 8</span> to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "<span>Windows</span> has been shut down to prevent
 damage to your computer."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues, and it can be difficult to troubleshoot the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Remove any external devices attached to the computer(Except keyboard and mouse) and boot the computer and check if the Blue screen error stops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Check the link mentioned below on Creating a Installation media , then perform a Automatic Repair.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
<strong>b)</strong> In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘<strong>language to install’</strong>, ‘<strong>Time and currency format’</strong> and the ‘<strong>keyboard or input method’</strong> and click on ‘<strong>next’</strong>.<br />
<strong>c)</strong> Click on ‘<strong>Repair your computer’</strong> and select ‘<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>’.<br />
<strong>d)</strong> Click on ‘<strong>Advanced options’</strong> and select ‘<strong>Automatic Repair’</strong> and select the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply if you have any questions. </p>

            There are no pieces of external hardware and I don't have a windows 8 product key as my laptop came pre-installed with it. I also don't have a 8.1 product key as I updated via the windows 8 store so I can't use method 2 either.<br />
<br />
The blue flashing screen that appeared does not meet the description of a stop error / BSOD error but the rapidness of the flashing was affected when there was high CPU usage such as when multiple keys were pressed or when the laptop put to sleep then woken
 up.<br />
<br />
Do you have any solution to this?<br />

<h2>            Gamertag does not exist on xbox live Lag</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so yesterday i found an original gamertag that i would loved to use as my gamertag (change my gamertag) .The first thing i did was to look if the account was not taked yet so i went on the ''add friend'' and added the gamertag in question.&nbsp;I was so happy
 to see that the gamertag ''does not exist on xbox live''.</p>
<p>Today i went to buy some microsoft points and redeem the code on xbox live and i was about to change my gamertag but at the moment when i clicked on ''change gamertag'' in the ''change gamertag menu'' , it said that the gamertag was taken !&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i looked in my friend list and clicked on the ''add friend'' &nbsp;and then i tryed to add the gamertag that i was looking for but it said that '' the gamertag does not exist on xbox live''!</p>

<p>I dont know what im supposed to do?? This gamertag use to exist but on xbox live but dont exist on xbox live?! Where is the logic ? XD</p>

<p>People make gamertags just so no one els can have them . Unfoutantly the one you picked was taken. Some of them will not show up in the "friend request" good luck though</p>

<p>Sometimes people can make accounts for just forums or to be able to use in sigs on other sites while not actually ever gaming on live. There are many gamer tags you cannot search for. If you really want the name simply change a few aspects of it. This is
 really your only option if it is taken. Hope you still get set up with a great name.</p>

<p>it may well have been a gamertag on the old xbox or it is a gamertag that has not been used for a very long time but it will still be listed as used.</p>
<p>try some variations by using 1`s instead of I`s or 3`s instead of E`s for example.</p>

<p>The tag system is in use on different Microsoft services. So even if it's not in use on the 360 it could be in use somewhere else. The system also doesn't see things like spaces as making a unique gamertag. So if you were to look up GamerTag but can't change
 it, someone else might be using it as Gamer Tag.</p>

<p><span><b>I can't change my Gamertag (GT).<br />
</b>Most of the time if you are seeing a message saying the GT you want is unavailable, it’s true. One thing to remember is that spaces and capitalization don’t make your GT unique. For example, “Major Nelson”, “MajorNelson”, and “MaJoRnElSoN” are all the same
 GT.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>GTs are also tied to services like Zune or Games for Windows LIVE. If a GT doesn't exist on Xbox, it might be in use on one of those services. If you try sending the GT you want a friend request and it says it’s not a valid GT that just means it isn’t
 used on Xbox LIVE, but it could be used for Zune or GFWL.</span></p>

<p>I also have this problem!!:@ i want this name however it says its taken, i went to add the GT as a friend and i got a message saying there's no such name on Xbox Live. The chances of it being taken are very low as its my surname plus an extra couple of letters!</p>
<p>I also checked this GT availability thing which tells you if that GT is taken or not and it says it isnt!!!!!</p>
<p>WHY CANT I CHANGE IT?! :(</p>

                    win8 bug:can't delete ISO file if it is corrupt/incomplete<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
steps to reproduce:<br />
1.create/download a test file as an ISO and make sure it is corrupt or incomplete. an incomplete download can cause this.<br />
2.bring up windows explorer with [windows-logo-flag-key]-E and right click on C:&nbsp; and pick properties, tools, and check/scan c: for errors. should show "noneed to scan for errors". scan anyway.<br />
3.try shift-delete to delete the file<br />
<br />
<br />
expected:<br />
file should be deleted.<br />
windows should identify a cdrom ISO as a cdrom ISO, not as a disk image. a .dmg file is a disk image.<br />
<br />
actual:<br />
windows incorrectly identifies a cdrom ISO as a disk image<br />
get the dialog<br />
1 Interrupted Action<br />
An unexpected error is keeping you from deleting the file. if you continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for help with this problem.

            not sure, but I think I did mount a different ISO. not sure if I did this one. if I did, windows was not smart enough to check checksums before mounting.<br />
anyway, when I right click it, top of context menu says "Mount", so I am guessing it's not mounted - if I try it gives me that same error.<br />
<br />
filesystem is "OK".<br />
the file is corrupt. windows authors have taken the unfortunate action that a corrupt file error means you can't do anything with it. even delete it.<br />
<br />
that's a bug.<br />
<br />
it is possible that there is a growing bad disk block right where the file is. so I am forced to run chkdsk /f /r. which means I am also forced to submit another bug report against windows 8 - it doesn't have the capability to check for bad disk blocks anymore
 through the GUI (bad move, microsoft).<br />
well, there's always spinrite 6. but I don't have that software right now.<br />

            SOLUTION:<br />
-------------<br />
check for and lockout bad disk blocks. use<br />
<ul>
<li>buy ($89) and burn and boot <a href="http://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
grc spinrite 6</a>&nbsp; and then run against disk (watch the videos. run this program every 3 months to keep your disk data in good shape)</li><li>chkdsk /f /r and then reboot</li></ul>
locking out bad disk blocks would NOT have been possible using the GUI, microsoft took out this feature from windows.<br />
so it WAS caused by a bad disk block (bit rot).<br />
<br />
<br />
STEPS:<br />
--------<br />
0.print this out.<br />
1.create a shortcut on desktop to c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe<br />
2.modify the shortcut to run as administrator.<br />
3.avoid deleting the shortcut. you must dismantly it first. otherwise, deleting the shortcut would delete the cmd shell, which some installers like Norton depend on.<br />
4.double click the shortcut you just made and give permission to run (regardless of complaint from the system's UAC)<br />
5.type in the following into the cmd shell.<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
y<br />
shutdown -f -r -t 0<br />
6.delete the file you originally wanted to delete which gave the error.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Office Picture Manager Icon taking over all other Icons&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpk06c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Picture Manager Icon taking over all other Icons&#33;</h2>
                    My sister recently&nbsp;received&nbsp;an HP notebook as a gift with Windows 7 installed on it out of the box. For the first few weeks it was running fine and then sometime last week while uploading pictures from her digital camera on the default program, it did
 something to where all the Icons on the desktop and the start menu are the Microsoft Office Picture Manager icon. Whenever you click any icon, say for Google Chrome, or Itunes, it will open up picture manager. The only icons ive been able to get anywhere with
 have been the system tools and I am not really sure what to uninstall to make the default program go away.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ive read in previous forums about this happening with various Adobe software, but never with a pre installed default program. I am not sure what to do or how to resolve this and I wanted to ask here before I wipe the whole thing and start over. Any information
 would help. Thank you.</div>

                </div>

            This happens if someone have used the "Open With" option to associate .lnk or .exe files accidentally with Office Picture Manager. Running the .lnk/.exe file from the following link should straighten up the problem.<br />

<h2>            How to disable accelerometer in Windows</h2>
                    Hy there,
<div>I just noticed the problem, that some Microsoft Software have problems with the internal accelerometer of my notebook.</div>
<div>Onenote and also the windows input from the touchpack react on moving the notebook and the textbox for input disapears or doing strange things :)</div>
<div>Because there is no option for disable the accelerometer in the controlpanel or somewhere else (clean windows 7 install and also no software from the manufacturer for that), i want to know if there is trick to disable the function of the accelerometer
 in windows 7?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

    <title>Cannot update Windows 8 - no updates will install - error 0x800F081F - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartpeacock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot update Windows 8 - no updates will install - error 0x800F081F or 0x8024A000</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 8 a couple of weeks ago and have so far had no problems, but with the release of the updates a few days ago I started to suffer the same problem as it seems a lot of others are, only mine seem more extreme in that it's not just KB2769165
 and KB2770917 that I cannot install, no update will install no matter how I try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background information and configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 Pro</li><li>Dell XPS 8200 Desktop</li><li>Core i7 2.8GHz</li><li>256GB Samsung 830 Series SSD</li><li>2 x 250GB Seagate HDD in R1 mirror using Intel ICH10 controller and Intel RST driver</li><li>16GB RAM</li></ul>
<p>Symptoms began with the batch of updates released mid November, some of these installed correctly - KB2727528, KB2729462, KB2737084, KB2761226 &amp; KB2769034 -&nbsp;but two refused to install - KB2769165 and KB2770917.</p>
<p>No matter how often I try to&nbsp;install these updates, installation fails and I see one of two error messages, either&nbsp;0x800F081F or 0x8024A000.</p>
<p>Error 0x8024A000 is seen when I run Windows Update after running the troubleshooter and the troubleshooter claims to have fixed the problem, if I click the 'try again' button, Windows Update will repeat the attempt to find updates and will succeed in finding
 them the second time, however, the download starts but then fails at 5%&nbsp;with the 0x800F081F error.</p>
<p>Whenever I run the Windows update troubleshooter it will claim to have found and fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Potential Windows Update Database error detected 0x800F081F"</li><li>"Windows Update components must be repaired"</li></ul>
<p>It will repeat this no matter how many times I run the troubleshooter, even if I run it twice immediately in succession, which suggests this is either a standard fix or that the problem persists and the troubleshooter is not fixing it.</p>
<p>What I have tried to date (each one individually and in combination):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop Nalpeiron license service</li><li>Stop all non-Microsoft services and disable all startup items (using msconfig)</li><li>Manual install of updates downloaded from MS download rather than using Windows Update</li><li>Disable Norton 360 security and AV</li><li>Uninstall Norton 360</li><li>Run the System Update readiness tool as described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821?wa=wsignin1.0</a></li></ul>
<p>Whatever I try, I end up back in the same place - unable to install any updates and with the same error(s) reported by the Windows Update&nbsp;troubleshooter.</p>

            <p>Well, I'm able to answer my own question now, and not so long after posting it either.</p>
<p>After a lot of faffing around all morning with this issue I have finally resolved it, with the help of a combination of solutions proposed by others and some other ideas contributed by me.</p>
<p>I believe that a significant contributor to the solution has been the System Update Readiness Tool - DISM - and in particular the use of it proposed by DocSlax in this thread on 19th November 2012:

<p>For anyone else experiencing this issue, I will summarise what I found to be the fix for me, this may or may not work for others, from what I've seen there are a variety of similar issues and fixes and what works for one person does not seem to work for
 others. However, as I seem to have had what appears to be one of the worst cases of this problem with all the symptoms reported by others and none of the proposed fixes working, then I hope that the fix described below will reliably fix the issue for others
 too.</p>
<p>I suggest you print this out and read it through once before starting as you'll need to refer to other posts and KB articles.</p>

            In reverence or response to Windows Update 0x8024a000, and other update issues<br />
<br />
I've tried many other remedies, that didn't help, the best I've found after research and works very well is go to any web browser and type, 'intel driver updates for windows 8', then click on 'Intel Driver Update Utility', the site should be www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect,
 so you know you have the right one, then click on the blue-Check your system for updates, then it should start loading ,intel_srldetect_4.5.13.0, if it says "The Intel Driver Update Utility installation failed" that's normal, because its not functioning properly,
 click the OK button, Now, underneath the Microsoft Internet Explorer, there should be in blue small print, "Download the Activex*Java*Installer" click on this, then the ("intel_srldetect_4.5.13.0") it should allow you to download this now, once installed,
 then go back to your Windows Update in the System, not the Control Panel, by right click, then click Check for Updates, this will get you back to business. THIS WILL WORK WITHOUT ANY HASSLE<br />
<br />
I hope I could be of assistance.<br />

            I had the same problem with my laptop. After I upgraded my windows from 7 to 8, windows update was not able to download any updates anymore. I tried everything that people said on the forums. I even refreshed my laptop's windows, but I still had the same
 problem. However, when I clean installed windows 8, the problem got fixed!

<p>Hey snowbruno,</p>
<p>That is the error code for a missing storage device. You should</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Turn off your console.</p>
<p>2.Remove all console storage devices, including any USB flash drives, external hard drives or the internal hard drive on the Xbox 360 E console or Xbox 360 S console.</p>
<p>3.Add your primary storage device, for example, the hard drive.</p>
<p>4.Turn on the console</p>
<p>5.Try updating the console again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This link will tell you how to remove the hard drive. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Double Tap and Drag on Mousepad not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Double Tap and Drag on Mousepad not working.</h2>
                    <p>Alright so, I just got my Acer laptop back from a repair shop because my hard drive broke down and needed to be replaced. I had them replace it and reinstall Windows 8.1 everything else works wonderfully except that I've lost the ability to double tab on
 my mouse pad and drag so that I can highlight phrases, scroll more easily, and move things around. All of the other shortcuts on my mousepad/touchpad work - tapping and two finger scrolling, but I cannot get the double tab and drag to work.<br />
<br />
I went through the options and there is nothing listed under Mouse and touchpad options in the PC Settings that allows me to turn it on although I've seen images of other peoples where the options are there. The only options I have under touchpad are these:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d2cc88b-95bf-4d92-adec-a939121256d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d2cc88b-95bf-4d92-adec-a939121256d2" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>I would be really grateful for any help in getting the double tap and drag to work again as I enjoyed having it as an option that made my work faster. Hopefully it's something simple. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also here are my laptop details:</p>

    <title>Game Taking Hours To Install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game Taking Hours To Install</h2>
                    I decided to buy an Xbox One because there was 1 game that I wanted to play on the next gen console: NBA2K14. I read online that it takes about 45 minutes for the game to fully install before I'm able to have access all the modes. I don't know if maybe
 my system is faulty or not, but I've been installing the game for over 5 hours and now it's at 95%. I've read online about disconnecting my Internet and letting it install, but when I do that my system stops installing. Can someone please explain to me why
 it's taking me 6 hours to install a game to my HDD? Maybe I'm doing something wrong???

<p>G'day all! When you're connected to Xbox Live and installing a game, the game's latest updates will download and install first. That's why you may see it hang at 0% for a while as the main install is paused while this happens. This part of the installation
 will depend upon your network connection speeds, which is why the workaround of disconnecting seems to speed things up initially. You'll still have to install those updates before playing online though.<br />
<br />
All Xbox One games are pretty big, and some are larger than others so they'll take longer to install. NBA 2K14 is particularly hefty at over 40 GB. It takes a while to transfer that much data to your hard drive, but when the game is partially installed to a
 point, it will inform you that you can start playing in limited capacity. It's okay to jump in at that point!</p>

<p>Disconnecting does not work, you have to be online in order to install the games. This feature is ridiculous! My connection is slow so in order to play any xbox one games I have to wait at least 24-30 hours (because that's how slow my connection is) in order
 to play each game.</p>

<p>I was literally playing last week and everything was fine. The only thing i can think of on why its doing this is the power went out while i was playing, but all my other games are fine&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>first thing to try:</p>
<p>please try the manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help then set the Console to Offline mode, this can be done in the Network settings on the console, after that please restart the console via Guide - Settings - Restart console. When the console is fully booted try to start the game to see
 if the game will load properly or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it also fails to load your profile in the game, then try the following. Reconnect the console to internet, restart the console.
<br />
<em>Note: This will only work if your console is regularly connected to Xbox Live, since that will synchronize your save game to Xbox Live.</em></p>
<p>Remove the local save game for the game, via My Games &amp; Apps, when the game is highlighted press the Menu button (one with 3 lines) and select Manage Game, on that section you should have the option to remove your local save game, be sure to Only delete
 your local save, after that when you start the game it should download your save game from Xbox Live.<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>I don't personally have any Videos stored on my device, but that's how it works with songs in Xbox Music.</p>

<p>No, that was the first thing that I tried. The videos aren't stored on my phone, its the ones that I have purchased and are available to me to stream. But I've "purchased" quite a few free videos and they make navigating my collection a pain when I'm trying
 to find something I actually paid for and want to watch. Its more of a convenience thing. On both Windows 8 and the Xbox 360 there is an option to remove a video from my collection, letting me free up some screen space and making it easier to scroll through
 my videos. I was wondering if something similar existed so that I don't have to scroll through the free TV shows I have "purchased", watched once, and decided against buying full seasons of in favor of quickly getting to the videos I actually did buy and want
 to watch.</p>

            <p>Ignore the post above. I just downloaded Xbox Video and had a play around with it.</p>
<p>The process for removing videos is a little convoluted, but it can be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Collection</strong>.</li>
<li>Press <strong>See All</strong>.</li>
<li>Defaults to <strong>TV</strong>, switch to <strong>Movies</strong> if you want.</li>
<li>For films, <strong>choose the Movie</strong> you want to delete and skip the next step; <strong>for TV, choose the series</strong></li>
<li>Now pick the <strong>particular episode</strong> you want. It will have the 'radio' icon if you own it.</li>
<li>On the detailed screen for the movie/episode, press the <strong>ellipsis</strong> ("<strong>...</strong>").</li>
<li>Now choose <strong>Remove [episode/movie] from Collection</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Remove</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That should be all done.</p>

            <p>Darth, it's easier for us to help if you make your own thread. It's just easier for us to keep track of different users with different issues and their current status.</p>
<p>Make a new thread and include all relevant details about your problem. Also include which version of Windows Phone you are using and which version of Xbox Video (is it Music+Videos you're using or the standalone Xbox Videos app?). Or is it perhaps a video that's been recorded using the phone itself?</p>
<p>Make that thread and we'd be happy to try to help you out. :)</p>

<p>Go to Settings, Storage Sense, Phone, Video, Manage, &nbsp;that will clear the history also of personal videos you delete through direct connection to your phone. &nbsp;You'll see under My Videos that your personal vides can be deleted, if they are already deleted,

<p>Im sorry for the inconvenience, you try four things, 1. Make sure you have a good WIFI connection. 2. Make sure everything is updated. 3. Completely restart both consoles. 4. Make sure you are not using the beta version of minecraft, both players have to
 be running the newest stable version.</p>

    <title>&#40;Fixed&#41; Stuck in the automatic repair loop, no bios access, no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjaminvalley  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;Fixed&#41; Stuck in the automatic repair loop, no bios access, no safe mode acess, and USB boot attempts don&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p><strong>(Here was my fix. The initial problem is below the fix) </strong></p>
<p><strong>My fix was only made possible by the fact that I was able to access the command prompt. I don't know if it would work from inside Windows, I don't see why not, but I'm ignorant. I did so from &nbsp;the "advanced startup options" that would finally present
 itself after waiting for automatic repair attempts. I thought the computer was frozen, but after waiting for long periods of time, with the screen only showing the windows icon, it would ask to either restore or try advanced options. Through this menu I was
 able to access the bios, but that did not help, and safe mode didn't work. I had to select the "repair" option a couple times and it meant turning the computer on and coming back in a while. I would turn the computer on and it would attempt a repair. The screen
 would just show a windows icon after the attempt and I waited until it offered to "repair," or "shut down." After I went through this waiting process twice, the "advanced repair" option would finally come up. I could reinstall windows from this menu, which
 is called restore I think, but it would only get into windows once and I could not install a different version of windows since upon restart I would end up back in the repair loop only to have to restore windows again. The computer would get into windows but
 any attempts to reinstall, restore, restart or even sleep would end up back at the original automatic fix loop.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My eventual victory, after 10 or more hours of research and reboot attempts which took two weeks, came from a command prompt formatting of all the partitions. Here's the link I used, though there are other pages that offer the similar techniques.
 Once formatted there are no repair options. It just showed my samsung logo, then powered off, and performed this boot loop indefinitely.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>http://www.howtogeek.com/forum/topic/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-7-8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I used an automatic boot usb after this, which can be difficult to make in its own way. I made mine with the "windows 10 media creation tool" It makes a bootable USB very easily, where as I had some issues making one for windows 7. Making a bootable
 usb can potentially be a little difficult. You should be able to use a boot DVD, if that's what you have, but I can only speak of my own experience. I tried to use this boot usb without the formatting process, but neither windows nor the bios priority list
 helped to get it to work on its own. No matter what, I always ended up in that ridiculous boot loop until I formatted everything.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So in short, I used the command prompt accessed from the "advanced repair options" to format the hard drive entirely. After that I started the computer with the bootable usb in, and finally was able to get it to install an uncorrupted version of
 windows. It sounds easy as I write it, but I restored windows some 30 times before giving up and formatting everything. &nbsp;I'm obviously not a professional. Do keep in mind that I was out of options and risked formatting everything since I had been messing with
 it for hours and hours and hours. If I had failed I would have paid someone too much money to format and reinstall windows for me. I considered it a gamble to format the drives this way, but I was out of options.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I hope I made this all clearish, but if not, just ask me and I'd be happy to offer my simplistic moron advice if it can be of use. If I can help one person, I'll feel better about the MANY wasted hours, and two weeks without ****... I mean stock
 quotes.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Original problem) I have a massive problem caused by a small one. Fed up with some issue, I "restored" windows, I.E. re-installed it, and the nightmare began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running windows 10, a free upgrade due to my immense dislike of windows 8, and after the restore it reverted back to windows 8. I attempted to reinstall windows 10 with the "media creation tool" and after that installation the computer would freeze
 upon startup. I attempted to restore it to a previous state and am now stuck in an "automatic repair" loop that only attempts to restore windows (8 I think), which ends in it freezing at the page with the windows logo. There are never other options other than
 restore. The f2 bios access doesn't work, the f8 safemode doesn't work, all other f#s do nothing, the DVD boot disk doesn't work and the usb boot doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent so many hours trying to fix this and I am out of options. My biggest irritation is that a dvd or usb boot does not even pop up, when It used to be the guaranteed fix for this weird stuff. My working computer doesn't even recognize the microsoft
 official windows 10 usb boot when it starts up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm praying to my fellow people for help. Thanks for any thoughts.</p>

            <p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern regarding automatic repair loop, we strongly recommend that you contact your computer manufacturer since all of the
<strong>Function keys </strong>doesn't work. You also mentioned that you cannot access the
<strong>BIOS</strong> which is before the <strong>Windows </strong>Operating System.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> nymyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online status unknown</h2>
                    <p>Tested network connection multiplayer connection, NAT connection, did a hard reset cleared cache, signed out then in again, removed account and put it back in... Etc but nothing seems to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Description: was playing on destiny this morning, no connection problem, game run just fine. Join a party with my clan, no problems in terms of party connection (I can hear the , they can hear me). Then they needed an extra for the raid. They sent the party
 a game invite, I don't receive it, I check the roster, no one appears online on the clan tab or friends tab. One of my friends says i'm actually not showing as online in his friends list but rather as "last seen 4h ago: home". I go onto the sign in screen
 and try to change my status from online to offline and it doesn't allow it and says "online status unknown". Since then the problem persists and can't seem to find a way to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: my Xbox went to idle while i was typing this message and even tho the problem is still there it nows says on my sign-in screen "last seen 6m ago: home".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone knows how to fix ut yet (seen some threads about it but every solution they suggested doesn't work for me)?</p>

<p>Hey there Nymyr!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get online and change your status as such. If you have already tried those troubleshooting steps,
<span>there's also this little trick that I like to do that resolves a bunch of general problems that you may have concerning your console. When you get a chance to go</span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Settings&gt;Disc
 &amp; Blu-ray&gt;Blu-ray&gt;Persistent storage </span></span><span><span>and
 clear it 3 times. After doing that, go to </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network
 Settings&gt; Advanced Settings&gt; Alternate MAC address </span></span><span><span>and
 clear that alternate MAC. The console will say it needs to restart to apply the change, so let it do that and see if that helped clear up the problem.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help, then I would suggest a soft factory reset of the console.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for several problems.
</span></span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Since it seems to effect others I would suggest just waiting it out for now. It happened last night and was worked out. It might just be Server side issues.&nbsp;

            Aaand its happening again. Its only started since we've started playing Destiny 2.coincidence maybe? But no, definitely not an issue at our end. Seeing as this issue seems to have been occuring for a while now, you'd think it would have been resolved?&nbsp;

            I had the exact same problem today (it was on Destiny aswell). I tried power cycling the console, connecting to different networks, ect. My account said 'Last seen 8hours ago on Xbox app', and when I tried a different network it refreshed my status to
 say 'home'. but was still unable to change my status, and it started saying I was last seen on xbox home so-and-so hours ago.
