    <title>Does converters for USB to USB-C from a surface pro 4 to be connected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does converters for USB to USB-C from a surface pro 4 to be connected to a pc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Like in the title can these converters work in a surface pro 4? Like since there are low voltage proccessors and graphics card, it makes the application run slowly such as apps like Fusion360 where it requires a good graphics to run the software so is it
 posible to have this converter from the built in USB input to USB-C or HDMI which would be to be connected to a better pc with better graphics card and processor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,
<br />     The Surface Pro 4 does not support external graphics cards. You need to have a dedicated port on the device, the specific hardware on the motherboard or the bios options. As far as my memory goes, I don't think any Surface Devices support this. An adapter wouldn't cut the mustard with an external card. 
<br />
<br />I really see you have two options:
<br />
<br />1) Upgrade to a laptop that has this ability 
<br />2) Virtualise!
<br />
<br />My prefered option would be to virtualize. Run an online server in the cloud with the required software. This is very dependent on your internet connection and proximity to a Data Center,  but this is really  a different kettle of fish       
        </p>

            Sorry, no the USB to external port  (USB-C, HDMI) won't work to take advantage of an external graphics card/graphics on another PC. Please don't shoot the messenger and please DO mark as Answer.

You stated in your first post that you could not install the drivers - what is the exact error message you are getting when you try to install them?<br />
<br />
In the answer from Amzas, he is suggesting that you try to install the drivers in XP compatibility mode, not that you have XP operating system.&nbsp; If you read his instructions in detail, he explains how to install the drivers using XP compatibility mode on Vista.<br />
<br />
In your second post you say you can not download the drivers.&nbsp; That is different than not being able to install them.&nbsp; What is the exact error message are you getting when you try to download the drivers?<br />
<br />
Let us know these things so we can better assist you.<br />

<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue regarding headset, we would suggest that you try to use other Bluetooth-enabled headset, and see if it does the same thing. Also, try to use your current Bluetooth-enabled headset on other computers/devices, and see if it does the same
 thing as well.</p>

<h2>            Cannot set external text editor as default for .txt extension</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I was opening a normal .txt file and suddenly the editor I normally used (Notepad++) for that extension wasn't the default anymore. So I just went back to Default Programs and... well, it doesn't let you choose any other than the
 Microsoft Notepad or Wordpad. Any other program, even those that shouldn't be able to read them, cannot be set as default.<br />
Same issue for every extension that Microsoft owns a program for... like Word .doc/.docx cannot be opened with OpenOffice, such as any other extension part of the Office suite.<br />
I feel like this isn't just a case, anyone can help me?<br />

So far I tried these commands on Prompt, following an online tutorial, but didn't work</p>

            Hi David, for now there is nothing you can do . . . <br />
<br />
Setting File Associations in Windows 10 is now impossible and this is particularly true when it comes to a Text Editor, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />
Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, hopefully this is one of the bugs they are working on
<br />
<br />
Please provide feedback to the Windows Developers on this bug, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker it will be resolved . . .

<h2>            No sound after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last Windows update (version 1803 17134.648), I don't have sound anymore. On the volume icon, I see the error "No audio device has been installed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to read a mp3 with Winamp, I get the error:</p>
<p>Bad DirectSound driver. Please install proper drivers or select another device in configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Device Manager, my High Definition Audio Controller shows an error (code 39). Strangely, a USB driver is also shown as "unknown". When I unplug and plug the audio cable, I get a message saying the USB device has not been recognized. But this is not
 USB...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all solutions I found on the forums to no avail:</p>
<p>- Update the driver by Windows</p>
<p>- Remove the device and reboot</p>
<p>- Reinstall the latest driver (Realtek ALC887 8-Channel)</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone explain me what's going on? I of course precise that just before the update, my audio speakers were perfectly working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu
<br />
<br />Go to Apps and find the photos App in the resulting list
<br />
<br />Select that and choose 'Advanced Options'
<br />
<br />Then click Reset

<br />When that completes, open the Photos App and see if that has been resolved . . .

<p>Hello Wanda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that there is a glitch in the said gaming application that is why you can't bind your Facebook account to Farmville.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you try to uninstall the Farmville app and try to reinstall it and check if it resolves the issue. You can refer to this
<strong>how to uninstall the application</strong>. Look for a drop-down in the article and choose
<strong>Remove in Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still experiencing the issue after doing the steps, then our best course of action is to contact the developer of the application so that they can troubleshoot the issue with their application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    When I put on the computer it freezes as the Microsoft Corporation green bar crosses the screen. (vista 64 bit) If I switch off and back on and start normally then it works. However sometimes it takes a few switching offs. If it did work first time it
 froze when using. If I use the computer and restart everything is fine. It is as though it has to be warmed up to work properly. Please can you help.

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation with motherboard change</h2>
                    <p>Probably a common question, but I have not found anything helpful yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a motherboard with an Intel processor and have updated to a an AMD processor. Windows handled the transition okay, but I have been having no luck getting windows to re-activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the troubleshooter, and it fails. I have tried the option 'I changed hardware on this device recently', and it does not even show the computer I am using as an option to activate. Now my computer used to be an option, but even when I selected
 it the tool would fail to activate windows, simply saying it was impossible and pointing me to the Store. I then logged onto my Microsoft account online and went to manage computers. I saw my old computer (with the old motherboard ID) on the account and removed/unlinked
 it from my account. After doing that the tool now shows neither my old or new system as options to re-activate. Note, I still see my new computer on my account page...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code I get in the setting page is 0xC004C003. This is a retail copy of Windows purchased through the Windows Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and let me know if any other details are needed.</p>

<br />
<br />To activate W10 after a hardware change, you need to perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Then connect with your Microsoft account and W10 should be activated. 
<br />
<br />If the issue still persists, 
<br />Select the Start  button, select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Activation
<br />and then select Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't help, call Microsoft support to activate W10

            Hi, HV12, 
<br />
<br />If you did not go to the manufacturer and replace the Motherboard with one similar to the Original Motherboard then you have basically created a New PC. It is then necessary to  purchase a New Windows 10 License for the device
<br />The Windows 10 license was tied to the Original Motherboard, not an AMD Motherboard.
<br />
<br />Users who run a Microsoft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) operating system may upgrade or replace most of the hardware components on the computer and still maintain the license for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software provided by the OEM, with the exception of an upgrade or a replacement of the motherboard. An upgrade or a replacement of the motherboard is considered to create a new personal computer. Therefore, Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred from another computer. If the motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect then a new computer is created, and a new operating system license is required. If the motherboard is replaced because of a defect, the user does not need to acquire a new operating system license for the computer. The motherboard replacement must be the same make and model, or the same manufacturer’s replacement or equivalent, as defined by that manufacturer’s warranty. The reason for this licensing rule primari
<br />
<br />Understanding that end-users, over time, upgrade their computers with different components, Microsoft views the CPU as the one remaining base component that still defines that original computer. Because the motherboard contains the CPU, when the motherboard is replaced for reasons other than defect, a new computer is essentially created. Therefore, the original OEM cannot be expected to support this new computer that they did not manufacture. 
<br />
<br />The licensing rules do not apply to non-OEM Microsoft operating systems. 
<br />

            Hi,
<br />The last resort is to contact support.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.

            Hi  HVJ2 
<br />
<br />It depends on the license:
<br />
<br />When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing too.
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.
<br />
<br />Full version (Retail):
<br />
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />
<br />- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />
<br />- Expensive
<br />
<br />Upgrade version (Retail):
<br />
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />
<br />- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />
<br />- Expensive, but cheaper than full version
<br />
<br />OEM :
<br />
<br />OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:
<br />
<br />- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel
<br />
<br />- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on
<br />
<br />- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard
<br />
<br />- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
<br />
<br />What happens if I change my motherboard?
<br />
<br />As it pertains to the OEM licenses this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license. If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
<br />
<br />From the Windows 10 end user license agreement:
<br />
<br />b. Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.

<p>Thank you for the responses so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the advice below I decided to do a clean re-install of Windows 10 from a USB drive. However, this has not helped the issue, as I get a new error:</p>
<p>0x803F7001</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter cannot find anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note this is a retail license of Windows, not an OEM version.</p>

<h2>            problems with winupdate and settings</h2>
                    <p>last Septembers update went fine then I got 3 updates that wont install.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 update for x64-based systems (kb21919355) 890mb, &nbsp;and update for windows 8.1 for x64-based systems (kb2990967) 30 kb, these both keep coming up and failing to install,
 this has happened over 10 times, I tried hiding them but they keep coming up. The&nbsp;October &nbsp;update went fine the these too popped up again. I don't want to keep down loading 890mb then have it not work, again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third update is Definition update for windows defender (kb226702) definition 1.187.168.0 106mb this keeps changing but it always fails, I don't use Windows defender any more I use bit defender, so why is it still trying to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>lastly I cant get into settings I open the charms menu tap settings&nbsp;then tap change pc settings, I get the blue screen with the cog but I cant do anything because it just wont stay up I can go to the top left corner and see the preview but if I click it
 just blinks then goes away, I want it because this account is local I want to make it a Microsoft acc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you, </p>

<p>Hello Rajesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you able to boot the computer normally after you save and exit from the aptio setup utility?
</span></li><li><span>When exactly you get this setup utility? Is it after booting to desktop or on startup?
</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If you are able to boot the computer normally, I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if the same issue occurs again. You can place the computer in the same mode for two to three days and verify the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform Clean Boot. </p>
</span>
<p>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot the computer normally, I would suggest you to use Windows 8 installation DVD and run Automatic repair to repair boot files. If you don’t have an installation DVD, refer to the link to create one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Let us try to <strong>create Windows 8 installation media (DVD or USB)</strong>. Refer the following link.</p>
<p><br />

<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Contact your computer manufacture for the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have bootable DVD or USB drive for windows 8, I would suggest you to perform following method and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Perform Automatic Repair using installation Media</span></span></strong></p>

<p>I am new,&nbsp; so hello. So when I saw this thread I definitely wanted to say hi because I am an adaptive controller user as well as device maker myself. I end up using the adaptive controller differently all the time because of my condition. I have Ehlers-Danlos
 syndrome and every day can be different for me.&nbsp; Some days I need to use foot switches to operate the majority of my buttons, and sometimes I need to use a thumb clicker button but every day is a little bit different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My adaptive controller needs to be kind of flexible based on how bad of a day I'm having, sometimes I need to operate it with my feet, sometimes you need to operate it was my elbows and sometimes I can use my hands or palms but every day can be a little
 bit different. I ended up building a completely custom set up using a variety of off-the-shelf hardware that is pretty cheap.&nbsp; I wanted to get adaptive buttons from the store on Xbox.com with the majority of them are $65 apiece and I didn't have $2000 or more
 for a full set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the amount of buttons that are typically used in most games it is really hard to make an affordable adaptive set up unless you go off the beaten path and look at custom building something. My own adaptive set is built using a combination of MAME
 arcade buttons and other cheap gear, and tattoo machine foot switches. Obviously I needed to do a little bit of tweaking for some of the control devices, but it was mostly just wiring 3.5 mm mono jacks to buttons to 2 wires, which I asked for help doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for me most of the ready-made adaptive buttons were way too expensive like I said, I couldn't afford $65 per button so I ended up coming up with a super cost-effective way of building out an entire adaptive controller really cheap. So I ended up using
 a MAME / JAMMA&nbsp; arcade stick for my left and right analog sticks. They are wired to usb converter boards that run to the left and right usb for the controller. They also by chance have 3 buttons on each side extra so A B X Y and the menu and start buttons
 are all wired to th boards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I just had to create left and right trigger and bumper (which were my worst enemies trying to use a real xbox controller. I was never able to comfortably use the trigger buttons or bumper buttons on the Xbox controller because my physical disability
 makes strength in my hands a difficulty. Beyond that I could never pull the triggers repeatedly because it hurt my arthritis too much. Despite the fact that I'm still really young my physical disability causes me a ton of pain and difficulty moving so for
 me my data set up needed to be really flexible day-to-day so sometimes I can operate it with different parts of my body hour to hour depending on how bad my dislocations are at that point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can buy a MAME to USB converter boards with wiring and buttons In a package pretty cheaply including the analog stick for about 10 or 15 bucks. It will give you enough buttons and an analog stick for half of the controls. I ended up buying two converter
 boards which gave me two analog sticks one for left and right, and it ended up giving me about 20 buttons that didn't need to be wired because they have push on adapters.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also ended up buying mono 3.5 mm wired lugs,&nbsp; which looks like a long wired headphones set without the headphones on one end, it just has two different U-shaped lugs which you can either put directly to the contact points of the button, or you can cut
 and wire around to different contact points. I chose to do the latter of the two but I did need some help wrapping the wire around the small post in the foot switch I was doing it to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed to do to modify the buttons to be used with the adaptive controller was by a bunch of 3.5 mm mono&nbsp; on off switch lug cords&nbsp; from RadioShack. If you use a 3.5 mm mono on off switch cord you're just wiring to the button directly and it seems most
 MAME&nbsp; or JAMMA&nbsp; buttons are ready digital and work native with just plugging them directly in the other 3.5 mm mono plug.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I took photos the entire time during the build of this device and I'm planning on putting together a video showing how it was put together, it looks complicated but it's actually pretty simple to assemble yourself. Considering I'm physically disabled
 and have a hard time using my hands I managed to do it pretty well considering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tattoo machine footswitch buttons I created were actually even simpler to rewire because a tattoo foot switch already comes with a quarter-inch mono on / off Jack. The only problem is that the Jack is a quarter-inch instead of 3.5 mm. The easy way to
 fix that is to use one of the RadioShack 3.5 mm mono lug records and replace the entire wire because the foot switch itself has two spots the wires can literally just be wrapped around you don't need to solder them or anything like that. Lucky design honestly
 because the tattoo foot switches are just simple stainless steel switches and there is to post that stick out of them all you have to do is attach one lug to one, and one look to the other side and you can actually create a really nice set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a couple photos of my setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first photo is the entire bunch of pieces except I have about 6 of the footswitches. Some days I need to do a majority of my playing with the footswitches instead of the buttons of the adaptive controller box. So on those days I just use the left and
 right sticks on the box and control all the buttons with my foot switches and the profile select on the adaptive controller to mod with foot switches do what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b406294-09ce-4f6d-9528-460673c4781f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b406294-09ce-4f6d-9528-460673c4781f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that picture it only shows 2 footswitches but I have 6 of them, those are probably the most useful because they can be places around me laying down or in my wheelchair to touch my feet, elbows, chin, face, legs or other places. They only need a minor
 amount of pressure to trigger them, so they also are pretty sensitive for people that have some weakness. They are not hair triggers, but they are pretty close. The only difference is these footswitches only cost about 3 -5 each on ebay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next is a close up my my physical therapy controller. I use this thumb button on good days when I can do a small amount of physical therapy. The button is held in a weighted metal container so holding it exercises my hands and arms. It is a little bit heavy
 so on one of my arms I needed to use a wrist strap to stop me from dropping it when I can't hold it anymore. They would not be good for people that are regularly weak in their hands, but for people that have good and bad days they can help exercise while doing
 something fun like playing a game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/017ef697-4496-476c-aaf3-96111004dc14?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/017ef697-4496-476c-aaf3-96111004dc14?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The footswitch is also great for your hands if you can't really have consistent strength but you have enough strength to hold your hands on a table or flat surface slightly. What I do is place it under my hands and rest my hand over it, when I need to press
 the switch I let the weight of my hand fall to the table,then I curl my hand slightly to have my fingers slightly over the switch again. Here is an image of that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e72825b2-9e85-4435-9162-579754bead26?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e72825b2-9e85-4435-9162-579754bead26?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are a few of the controls I built for the xbox adaptive controller. Anyone that is having a hard time with their adaptive setup and can't afford to go all out on $2k worth of buttons feel free to contact me for more info on how to build something like
 this. I am happy to help in any way I can. I would even consider building more of these switches for people people to buy if people were really interested in them just let me know. I know for me price was such a big issue I was literally trying to play games
 with only 2 or 3 buttons clicks for months until I figured this out. Hopefully this post will actually help some other adaptive controller users out there struggling right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone wants more info on my build or how to make custom controls for adaptive controller get in touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes there is an amazing quad stick, it is a bit pricey at about $500 but here is the link to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>https://www.quadstick.com/shop/quadstick-fps-game-controller<br />

<p>This is to the home page to quad stick direct, although you need to know which model to get, so the above link may be better.

            I believe that some of the models go from $550 up as well. It is a custom wiring setup since it is generally for ps4, switch, ect, but the xbox adaptive controller really helps in wiring it all up and getting it working.

<p>The $1 charge is put on to test the payment method. They are generally reversed in a couple days. If not, contact either your bank or MS phone support.</p>

            Hi Maxxx38767, Windows Reset is generally more successful when run from the Windows Recovery Environment, if that does not work, you can clean install Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not complete, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

    <title>Windows 10 Notifications to disappear when moving back to lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Notifications to disappear when moving back to lock screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With using Windows 10 (Version 1803), I want to set our lock screens up so that they doesn't display any app/program notifications and that anything is private, especially with Google Hangout chats for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I've managed to use a Group Policy to stop notifications appearing when you're actually on the lock screen at that point in time, which works fine in testing. However if you're working on your desktop at the time a message pops up and then you lock
 your desktop without closing that notification down, it stays visible in the bottom right corner for anyone to view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can get the Windows 10 lock screen to drop an active notification that's on screen via GPO without disabling desktop notifications entirely or is it going to be a case of user training to close down notifications before locking their desktops
 please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Anthony.</p>

            Hi, Sonic23,
<br />
<br />See the last post in this thread. Member uses RemineMe  app from Windows Store along with Group Policy.
<br />
<br />The new build is 1809. You should consider upgrading  to the new build then Edit policy.

<p>I'm not sure where this post is you mentioned about as there isn't a link to it. But, unless I'm mistaken, the RemindMe app looks like it creates custom reminders. Does this replace the use of reminders within Windows OS or is it used in conjunction with
 Windows reminders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also what group policies are being used with the app to stop reminders from appearing on the lock screen if that person accidentally forgets to close down the reminder please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any current intention to move to 1809 currently because as a company we're testing with Windows 10 Professional, we're waiting for the Enterprise version to be purchased later this year before I can consider moving up to a later version with
 using the extended support for 30 months.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Generic Music Playing During Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Generic Music Playing During Sleep Mode - or, Haunted PC&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been plaguing me for two years, and I've reached the point where I'm about an inch away from throwing my computer out into the rain.</p>
<p>About 1 in 3 times when my Windows 7 Acer desktop computer goes into sleep mode, it plays strange, generic music at top volume. It doesn't matter what volume I turn the computer to, it changes the volume to 100 and blasts this weird music. The screen is
 completely black, the computer looks exactly as it should sleep mode, but this music is blaring. Turning off the speakers makes it stop (if it didn't, I'd be typing this out for CreepyPasta, not Microsoft) but I have a deep (irrational) fear of someone watching/spying
 on me through the computer and this stupid music increases that fear incredibly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I owned this computer for about a year before the music started. The computer has been factory reset twice since it started, once to try to get rid of the music and once when I got a laptop and the old computer became the family PC. We've checked all of
 our system settings, even tried wiping every single audio file, default or otherwise, from the hard drive. The music will not stop. There is no screensaver set. No programs are open when this occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, someone help me out before end up in the loony bin.</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description I understand that a generic music starts playing in sleep mode. This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict or may be due to incorrect power plan settings.
<span>Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How exactly are you putting the computer in sleep mode? </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Are you using the power option on the desktop screen? Or are you using the power button of the tower?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you access the power options, there are two options:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Turn off display and
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Put the computer in sleep mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to check the power plan settings where you might have
<strong>enabled</strong> the <strong>Turn off display</strong> and may have chosen
<strong>never</strong> for "<strong>Put the computer to sleep</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Because when you put the computer to sleep mode, the display is turned off and the computer is not going to sleep&nbsp;mode.</span></p>

                    Call of Duty 2 will not load after installation. I get an "Error during inititialazation" message. I installed patch 1.3...still doesn't work. Running Windows 7 Premium on a new quad core computer. I don't know what the sound driver is, but it runs games
 as new as "Black Ops 2", and as old as the original "Halo", &nbsp;without any problem at all.

            <i>"but it runs games as new as "Black Ops 2""</i><br />
Interesting. A lot of people seem to have a problem with this error when running BOp's 2.<br />
Have you tried reinstalling the game ?<br />
If you installed to the default location - Program Files (x86) try running the game using the
<br />
Compatibility setting 'Run...as Administrator' (even if logged on as&nbsp; admin). <br />
<br />
<i>"I don't know what the sound driver is -</i>"<br />
I gather you mention this because you have been researching the problem.<br />
On a new machine this game should not need an update for audio drivers, but it's always
<br />
best to use the most recent audio drivers for your system anyway.<br />
- If the machine is a laptop or OEM (DELL, etc) PC download the Audio drivers from<br />
the mfgs web site. <br />
You could also download from the mfg of the sound chip (Realtek, etc), or the motherboard<br />
mfg's site if you are using a 'custom' build PC.<br />
- Unistall the current Audio driver and after rebooting the machine, install the new drivers.<br />
<br />
If you use a sound card it may help to either disable the Integrated (on board) audio via the<br />
BIOS, disable via <i>Device Manager, </i>or uninstall the drivers for the Integrated audio.
<br />
The same if you are using HDMI for audio, as the drivers for the graphics card will also install
<br />
HD Audio drivers that work with HDMI.<br />
- Also check <i>Device Manager \ Sound, Video and game controllers </i>for other audio devices<br />
you may not be aware of. <i>The High Definition Audio Device drivers </i>are the Windows generic driver<br />
and you can leave them active, but you may want to disable any others (particularly any modem<br />
audio drivers ) that you are not using.<i><br />
</i>eg - I have The Windows driver, and Realtek High Definition Audio.<br />
<br />
- As the highest audio setting in the games settings is 44KHz you could try changing the setting<br />
in Windows to match the games. Go to -<br />
<i>Control Panel \ Sound \ Speakers </i>(or headphones). Click on <i>Properties \ Advanced.</i><br />
In the Default Format select&nbsp; <i>24bit 44100Hz</i> and click Apply.<br />
- If the game runs you should be able to revert your sound Default Format to a higher setting<br />
after running the game one time (mine is at 96000Hz and there are no problems with the game).<br />
<br />

            Thanks for the suggestions. I'll try them.
<div>I did reinstall the game. Twice. And I did run as admin. Neither made any difference.</div>
<div>It IS a custom gaming computer. How do I find out what the motherboard is? Unfortunately, I don't know a lot about computer hardware.</div>

            If the machine is new you should be able to get support from whoever built the machine. They<br />
should be willing to help with both driver installation, and getting the game running.
<br />
<br />
An Open Source (free) program called <i>cpuz&nbsp;</i> will display most of the important component information<br />
(click on the purple download button, not the green one) -<br />
<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/downloads/cpu-z/1.66-setup-en.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">cpuz download page</a><br />
<br />
Go to the download section on the web site for the mfg of the motherboard and enter the<br />
model number. There will be a number of motherboard drivers in addition to the audio drivers,<br />
so you may as well update them all.<br />
<br />
<i>gpuz</i> will display all the information for your graphics card -<br />
<a href="http://www.download366.com/techpowerup-gpu-z?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=366_AU_longtail-Display_Utilidades&amp;utm_content=GPU-Z&amp;utm_term=gpu%20z&amp;gclid=CPr4traOz7kCFQThpAod6FIAqAhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">gpuz download page</a><br />
<br />
Another handy program for that displays even more system details, including what is installed,<br />
is Speccy. This can be handy for uploading systme information when troubleshooting is necessary.<br />
The free version is adequate -<br />

            There is no place on my control panel that says Properties/Advanced for Sound. There is no Sound Speakers/Headphones link. All I have is Hardware and Sound. When I click on that I get Adjust Volume, Change System Sounds, and Manage Audio devices. The last
 two bring up the same window but there is nothing about properties listed.
<div>In Device Manager, under Sound, Video, and Game controllers, I found AMD High Def Audio Device, and also High Def Audio Device, separate. I disabled High Def and left AMD on. It then loaded the game for multi player, which I do not want. When I told it
 to switch to single player I got a new error message.....EXE_ERR_MSS_INIT FAILED_MP</div>

            <i>"There is no place on my control panel that says Properties/Advanced for Sound."</i><br />
<br />
Ah, Right ! I tend to forget about the default Control Panel settings.<br />
When using the<i> Categories</i> view&nbsp; you would have a <i>Hardware and Sound</i> option.<br />
- Click on <i>Hardware and Sound</i> and then select <i>Sound</i> (main heading in bold) in the next Window.<br />
This will open a small Widow where you will click on the&nbsp; <i>Playback</i> tab and your speakers should
<br />
be listed there.<br />
If they are not listed you probably don't have the drivers for the motherboards integrated audio
<br />
installed.<br />
Click speakers and the <i>Properties</i> tab will be activated.<br />
Follow instructions as above, but maybe select 16bit 44000Hz instead of my previous suggestion<br />
for 24bit 44000Hz.<br />
<br />
(If you&nbsp; select small or large icon in the View tab the control panel will break down the<br />
&nbsp; categories into smaller components. )<br />
<br />
<i>"In Device Manager, under Sound, Video, and Game controllers, I found AMD High Def Audio Device, and also High Def Audio Device, separate. I disabled High Def and left AMD on."</i><br />
<br />
The High Def Audio Device should be the generic Windows drivers.<br />
The AMD audio - not sure, but perhaps you do not have the drivers for your Integrated audio installed, unless your Integrated audio is an AMD product, but I would think the drivers you mention came<br />
with your graphics card drivers - assuming you are using an AMD graphics card.<br />
<br />
- Have you identified your motherboard ? If not do so and look up the specs and find out what<br />
sort of Audio it uses. Download and install the drivers if necessary.<br />
<br />
COD2 has two different&nbsp; executables, one for single and one for multi-player. Verify you are not
<br />
using the&nbsp; short-cut for multi-player&nbsp; instead of the single player short-cut. <br />
You may want to try using the <i>COD2SP_s.exe</i> from the games install folder instead of the desktop short-cut.<br />
If that works make a new short-cut from the <i>COD2SP_s.exe.<br />
<br />
</i>Failing<i> </i>all the above uninstall and reinstall to a non-default location.<br />
Either install games to another Partition on the HDD or make a new folder in&nbsp; <i>
C:\</i> and install games <br />
to their own sub-folders in that, but do not install to any of the three Programs Files folders
<br />
created by Windows<i>. <br />
</i>I don't know if it will help with this game as I install all games this way because it avoids various problems (mostly with permissions),&nbsp; but it's worth a try.<br />

            I guess I have a BioStar Motherboard. I don't know how to download any upgrades for it OR the sound drivers. It's way beyond me.
<div>It's a shame COD can't make their games playable on all platforms without so much annoyance and problems. It's their responsibility to make sure these games work on any and all OS. No game player should have to make certain he has to do so much screwing
 around to make sure a game works. Halo 2 for Vista did the same thing. They assure you that it works on Vista and any OS after that, but it does not. It ONLY works on Vista. I had to install a 2nd hard drive on my gaming computer, with a Vista OS, simply to
 be able to play Halo 2. Now it looks like I'll have to install a 3rd hard drive with Windows XP if I want to play COD 2. It's not fair at all. If I could do it over again, I would never play any games on a PC. I'd get a Playstation or a XBOX and be done with
 it.</div>

            Well, I plugged a cord into the mic input on the back of my computer. Then I clicked on "set" AFTER I had already installed and setup the program. Then I simply went back to the desktop icon and it is now playing flawlessly....so far.

Game developers do not have a crystal ball to gaze into the future to see what Monopoly$oft has<br />
in store for it's future operating systems. COD 2 was released in '05, well before Win7.<br />
<br />
With PC's it's your responsibility to know where to find drivers and how to install them.<br />
Once you have all drivers installed, and updated when necessary, the game will run on any<br />
Windows PC that has an adequate graphics accelerator (card or integrated).<br />
PC's, by nature of their flexibility and almost infinite combination of hardware and software,<br />
are not plug and play - set and forget machines.<br />
If you want plug and play it's best to stick to playing games on consoles.<br />

Yes. You know, I thought there was a system already on a computer that automatically downloaded updates to the drivers it used.
<div>I did download an update patch to the game.</div>
<div>But anyway, it's running NOW....with something plugged in to the mic input in the back, and after clicking on the :"setup_exe" file AFTER I had installed it. There are quirks and weirdnesses to systems and games as well, that make them not always get along.
 Usually, someone out there, like yourself, has discovered what it takes to make them work together.</div>

I have read this fix in the past. <br />
Still don't know why it helps, but whatever works is good.<br />

<h2>            Use a third party app and program for webcam use</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is use my iPhone 7+ as a webcam for Skype. I don't use video calling very often, so that's why I don't want to buy a webcam. Plus it's another hardware supply on my desk and my phones as a front and back camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install some software to show the camera image on desktop but Skype does not 'seeing' it as a webcam. Also the goal I would like to complete is to use it as a cabled, USB webcam an no IP/WiFi webcam. This to prevent that this would use some
 of the, already slow, connection I have. Does someone knows a solution for this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>We regret that using 3rd party applications, especially with the new Skype, is not guaranteed to work. It is not yet configured to detect these types of&nbsp;applications. More so, when the device you are using is primarily a mobile phone and not a webcam.

<h2>            Windows 10 fails to start after setting number of processors in advanced boot options</h2>
                    <p>Hi Al,</p>
<p>I did something stupid and can no longer get into my computer....</p>
<p>I have a hp elitebook 8760W with 16GB of RAM. When doing renderings, I noticed that it never uses more than 4GB of memory, even when all 4 cores (8 logical processors) are maxed out at 100%.</p>
<p>Googling the topic, I&nbsp;came up with a suggestion of going into advanced boot options and checking the memory checkbox, forcing the use of 16GB rather than unchecked (auto).
</p>
<p>While there, (and here comes the stupid part) I also checked the number of processors checkbox. Not knowing if it refers to physical processors, number of cores or logical processors, I went "safe" and selected 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer rebooted fine, but on running task manager again, it revealed that I was still running less than 4GB RAM and now only one processor, instead of 8. So back I went and unchecked the checkbox for the number of processors. All subsequent attempts
 to boot into windows failed and all I get is a blue screen with:</p>
<p>:( your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then you can restart. (100$ complete)</p>
<p>if you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO</p>
<p>I also tried restoring to a previous restore point, by that failed as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or advice would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Pieter</p>

            <p>I have the EXACT same problem. The "solution" is not responsive to this issue.&nbsp; The troubleshooter doesn't help and none of the recovery options work.&nbsp; The computer will not boot into any Safe Mode options.&nbsp; Ivan access cmd (and see the HDD contents and
 open .txt files with Notepad, and can open regedit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!&nbsp; We are certainly not the only ones with this problem! </p>

            You've got a command line ? good.
<p>
</p><p>Run <strong>bcdedit</strong> and take a look at the entries.&nbsp; You're looking for the
<strong>Windows Boot Loader</strong> which includes options which look vaguely like the ones you messed up in msconfig.</p>

            Microsoft 2nd level tech said bcdedit would not work.&nbsp; I was unwilling to try this and risk making things worse.&nbsp; Did Reset keeping data but losing software.&nbsp; pc works GREAT b/c almost nothing loading at startup. Just need to download and install software
 and then adjust all settings. C'est LA vie. It all works, boots fast, reads all RAM, etc. Thanks, case closed!

</p><blockquote>Microsoft 2nd level tech said bcdedit would not work.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that's interesting, considering that's what it's for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it just now using the relatively innocuous setting "Quiet Boot" to test with.</p>
<p>(for the curious, quiet boot in Windows 10 gives you the power to shut the spinny thing off on the pre-signin screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- msconfig, set Quiet Boot on, then...</p>
<p>- reboot into an Install stick --&gt; repair --&gt; command line </p>
<p>- bcdedit with no parameters, to check the entries: yup, it's there under {default}: "quietboot Yes"</p>
<p>- bcdedit /deletevalue {default} quietboot</p>
<p>- check again, and no quietboot entry.<br />
</p>
<p>It worked just peachy.&nbsp; So... "2nd level tech", eh ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think bootrec/fixboot would have done the trick as well; both solving the immediate problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, you're up and running with a freshly rinsed out system, which works better than it did before, and it shouldn't take more than a few days to reinstall your programs and get your personal settings right.</p>
