            <p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do not have a backup. It is a brand new netbook and it didnt cross my mind that a windows update could kill it. It was sold (by the microsoft store) as ready for win 10. It does not have an optical drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I did the upgrade through windows update</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. As far as I can find from the internet new machines with win 8.1 oem do not come with a license key as it is some how built into the machine bios but is not retrievable from within windows? Why should I need to repurchase software that the manufacturer
 has broken with an update ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The netbook does not boot so I cannot attempt any fix from within any level of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If I boot from a flash drive with iso win8.1 will it work without a license key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance</p>

            <p>update</p>
<p>spoke to support at Asus who said the only option without buying another windows license was to send it back.</p>
<p>However, I bought two of these machines so used the other to make a restore disk (flash drive) and got the first working again.</p>
<p>Now however I have got to a different problem; apart from the fact that I have no license key&nbsp; ****</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the win10 upgrade now results in a screen telling me that despite having a 250Gb flash drive plugged in, the 6.5Gb free space on my C drive is not enough.</p>
<p>This is a netbook with 32Gb ssd that in file explorer shows as 18.8Gb Capacity with around 6.5Gb Free</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the microsoft website it says that you need 8.5Gb free on C </p>
<p>so my question now is</p>
<p>How do I create 2Gb when all that is on is windows and a couple small Asus utilities?</p>
<p>How can this be sold as ok for win10?</p>
<p>help please</p>

<p>Are you using the built-in Chinese keyboard/Input? AFAIK, there is only one input style now incorporated in the built-in Pinyin keyboard. The current one incorporates the features on the old
<em>fast </em>style the <em>new experience </em>style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bapomofo keyboard can also do Pinyin, it's called <em>New Phonetic </em>or (微軟注音 in Chinese). It's available in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan language options. It offers the ability to enter Pinyin with or without tone numbers and phrase association.</p>

<h2>            Unable to read Win7&#40;Home Premium 64-bit&#41; key from the sticker at the back of Sony Vaio laptop. Need to format&#47;reinstall windows.</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
I own a Sony Vaio laptop which came along with pre-installed Windows 7 Home Premium. It's been a while since I've used it, and the sticker at the back can't be deciphered. The ALT + F10 method specific to Vaio laptops, ie. Sony Vaio Care seems to be of no help.
 Keeps giving me an error (Image attached). Also, I've tried various programs/scripts to get the Windows product key, but the key they output is &nbsp;the OEM key( Sony Customer Care confirmed this) and Microsoft doesn't accept it. Hence I cannot download a Windows
 7 image again.<br />
The number below the product key, as far I could read it, is as follows -&nbsp;00196-180-63-105.
<br />
<br />
Is there any way through which I reinstall my Windows?<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p><strong>Or if you can get into System which will show you your OS, the amount of RAM, and what it is,(x86 or x64 bit) you will be able to open the 54 Configuration number which is 9 'boxes with 6 digits in each and you can even do this through Microsoft
 menu which has the phone number when you open box for entering the product Key, and once you verify that it is a 'genuine Microsoft' version of your OS, you can get their support phone number and give them this nice long Configuration number. Once you have
 this then Microsoft can give you the product key or probably a new one because I had to do this with Windows 8 after I spent a year going through the preview stages of all the components of Win 8. Then they offered me 1 digital OS of 8 Pro and then the actual
 disc of Windows 8 Pro with the 2 discs inside and all for less than $100.00. But the digital was in ISO form and the key they sent me, well I had same problem as you, sort of, in that they wouldn't take the key but I verified it with the 54 character number.
 It can't hurt but it just might help you in your 'situation'. Rule #1 of all technology. Get a small diary type book; #2 write down all Keys and 'order' numbers; #3 ALL PASSWORDS INTO YOUR LITTLE BLACK, BLUE, WHATEVER BOOK! With all of this techie stuff, still
 takes pen and paper for a real backup. Especially after one spends a lot of money and then you have to do a reinstall. I just finished doing my yearly reinstall of all my 5 Operating Systems, which is a bit of a time consumer but, they all run like new when
 all is said and done. takes about a week to do it properly and also change your H.D.D. cables if you have a desk top. I even go and get a new cable for my wife's HP series 700 laptop I got her in 2008 and it is still going strong, for I have some good 'cleaning'
 programs on it and keep it all up to date. Acronis is about the best 'backup/restore' software out there and the nice thing is you can convert a Windows back up to an Acronis and visa versa. Plus, if your boot doesn't work then your Microsoft back up is worthless.
 Acronis, has a tool where you make a bootable disc which will boot you into your back up, then just a couple of clicks and restore. Get that number as soon as you can. Hope you get lucky and get your 'key'.&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <title>Vista Ultimate x64 not utilizing all four cores on QX6850 Core 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Ultimate x64 not utilizing all four cores on QX6850 Core 2 Extreme</h2>
                    &nbsp;Here's a doozy of an issue..<br />
[If this is in the incorrect spot, please relocate, just since the computer boots.. Seems like a performance issue]<br />
<br />
After upgrading to Vista Ultimate x64 from XP x32 [Clean installation] my system seems to have lost the ability to utilize more then a single CPU at a time.<br />
<br />
As this issue is abit difficult to explain clearly, I'll try to issue an example..<br />
<br />
--<br />
Running any modern CPU intensive games [Supreme Commander, EVE Online, Team Fortress 2, Ect.] Rather then dividing up the CPU load amongst the seperate cores to make for smooth operation, the OS only allows the programs to run on a single processor, often times
 running that single core up or above 80% while the other 3 cores remain inactive.<br />
--<br />
<br />
This issue is present, albeit in a lesser degree, on any&nbsp;active program in the system in relative to the overall need of the program..<br />
<br />
However, what is making this issue more difficult to diagnose is the fact that Vista and the device manager SEE all 4 CPU cores. I just cant seem to use them simultaniously. My research has me leaning towards a HAL incompatability since Vista 64 only has one
 version of the HAL, unlike its 32bit counterpart which still has multiple versions for compatability with uni and multi processor ACPI systems. However, since I'm not windows certified I cant say for sure what the issue is.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I have done to try to correct it:<br />
- Format hard drives and freah-install Vista.<br />
- Replace Motherboard and CPU<br />
- Check boot settings in MSConfig to set to HAL autodetection<br />
- Checked to see if multiprocessor support is enabled in BIOS<br />
- Disabled all overclocking and restore all BIOS settings to factory default<br />
- Checked for possible updates to the HAL<br />
- Checked HAL version and operating mode [6.0.6001.18000, Multiprocessor]<br />
<br />
System Specs<br />
- NForce 680i Motherboard<br />
- QX6850 Core 2 Extreme @ 4.0Ghz<br />
- Dual 8800 GTX [Non-SLI]<br />
- 4GB RAM<br />
- Vista Ultimate 64 Bit

            Hi again Black Wyvern,<br />
<br />
Your original post&nbsp;listed what you had tried troubleshooting wise, but I didn't see any mention of setting the affinity so I suggested it.&nbsp; One question though, when you try to set the affinity, how many processors do you have to choose from?<br />
<br />
<br />
You also said:<br />
<em>"As an extra note, please better research issues before posting, most pertinant information about programs and what they support nowadays is readily available on wikipedia. The recomended and optimal setup details for programs does
 not accurately detail exactly what the program can, at most support,&nbsp;and thus cannot, or more accurately, should not be used as a medium to determine such details in a diagnostic envionment."<br />
</em><br />
When at all possible I will look for an answer from the company that wrote the software.&nbsp; If they spent the extra time and money to make their product 64 bit combatable and capable of multi-threading to take advantage of multi-processors, they will usually
 brag about it or list it under recommended hardware.&nbsp; Wikipedia by its very nature is not an authoritative source for hard facts on issues.&nbsp; It makes for entertaining and sometimes enlightened reading but perhaps they say it best themselves:<br />
<br />
<strong>"Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite."&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About</strong></a><br />
<br />
With that said if Windows Vista is detecting all 4 of your processors and is functioning normally then you will need to contact support for the different companies that produce the games that you are trying to play.<br />
<br />

<p>The software itself has to be written to utilize multiple processors.&nbsp; Looking at the system requirements for the 3 games you listed, nothing is mentioned about multi-processor support or 64 bit versions.<br />

One thing you can try is to set the affinity of the desired process to use multiple processors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit <strong>&lt;crtl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;delete&gt;. </strong></li></ul>Choose <strong>Start Task Manager</strong>. <li>Click on the <strong>Processes</strong> tab. </li><li><strong>Right click</strong> on the desired process and choose <strong>Set Affinity</strong>.
</li><li>Check off which proecessors that you wish to use.</li>

<h2>            Microtech Support 247&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got a call from some guy at 5657657666 that apparently an application on my computer was off that prevented people from hacking and establishing a connection with my computer. I even opened Run and entered a msc (something or other) that showed what he
 was talking about. Well, long story short he opened a window through remote access that showed quite a few IP addresses connected to my computer. After a while he fixed the apparent issue and there was issues with a charge for updating my antivirus to premium?
 I don't have any money right now so there's an email with an invoice from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with the charge and I wanted to be sure it was a proper thing before freaking out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also have weird hours. 12 to nine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I was fine (and not suspicious)&nbsp;until they called back, the guy that first had the call before transferring me. Apparently they weren't finished and needed to run some stuff. This involved running a scan, recording from my camera, and opening
 **** sites. Seriously, was this for real? I hope it was a real thing and just very unprofessional behavior but....</p>

<p>I am happy that your problem resolved.</p>
<p>to Itknowledge24, I am agree that Norton should be removed thats why in my post I suggest As preview poster said Beta product are NOT error free and they are in Beta because they want user to try tthem and report bug to them.</p>
<p>However, sometimes this behavier might cause by Malware and NOT only product, therefore I suggest scan in safemode to remove threat first and then uninstall Norton. Just in case that uninstall Norton in already infected PC might cause more Malware get into
 systema and harder to remove it.</p>
<p>However, the problem of Gulf addict has been resolve and I am glad.</p>

    <title>Indexing Service filter daemon has encountered a problem and needs to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terry halley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Indexing Service filter daemon has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.</h2>
                    I am running XP SP3 on a desktop which is a second computer in the house. I recently re-installed XP because it was taking 5 minutes to boot up.&nbsp; I have all updates and run McAfee protection.&nbsp; For some unknown reason I keep getting this error message.&nbsp;
 It recently started popping up every minute or so. I went into Control Panel - Add or Remove programs - Add/Remove Windows components and unticked Indexing Services (although on the right the size was shown as 0.0 mb.&nbsp; I am still getting this error message
 and it is very frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't&nbsp;an issue before I re-installed XP so I either fixed it some years ago or it has now come up for some other reason. Can anyone help?&nbsp; Thanks

            <div>Hi Terry Halley,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you are receiving this error message even after disabling the Indexing Service, place your computer in Clean boot state to check if helps in identifying the program causing this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            W7 - Lite-On DH-4B1S Disc Writer does not read any disc</h2>
                    
<p>I have just performed a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate 64x onto my system, which includes one Lite-On DH-4B1S Serial ATA Interface Blu-ray Disc Writer.</p>
<p>I can boot from the DH-4B1S to install or re-install the operating system, but now that W7 is installed, the drive will not read any disk. W7 locks up Windows Explorer and I need to manually close it. My drivers are current.<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do to fix this, or is it most likely a driver issue?</p>

            I suggested those 2 trouble shooters because of this part of your erro r log:

<br />
<br />Those trouble shooters can clear that error code in specific situations.  If this is not one of those situations, then you will have to contact the maker of the application because the error message suggests that there is a problem with the way the whole package was created.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Install New Canon Printer</h2>
                    Just bought a new Canon PIXMA MG2920 printer and can't install it on my HP Pavilion 360 notebook wirelessly. It works when connected to a USB port. When I try to download the drivers for wireless setup, the files unzip and then I get the message "Failed
 to acquire information on the driver and software. Check network connection and try again." Canon customer support has tried, but can't offer any help. They suggest it has something to do with a setting on my laptop, but aren't sure. Any ideas?

<h2>            Surface accessories issues.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having issues with my surface keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard is playing up, disconnecting and reconnecting on it's own accord, turning tablet mode on and off which is frustrating while writing. Sometimes it disconnects and won't come back to life unless your restart the PC, which is a real pain. Also,
 the keyboard cuts out but the trackpad doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the mouse, I just can't get it to work unless I "forget the device" and then reconnect it, only to have the mouse stop working again soon after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Surface Pro 3 and I believe this is nothing new to Microsoft. The device is still in warranty.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

<p>Hi Jacob, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Surface Diagnostic toolkit may help resolve the issue. This will automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates for your device<span>.
</span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></span> to learn how to run the toolkit.</span></span>
<span><span>After running the toolkit, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force shutdown and restart your device</a></strong> to ensure all updates
 are applied. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are other things that you can try:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Detach and re-attach the Type Cover</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Unplug your Surface and detach the Cover.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol. (Use 95% or stronger isopropyl alcohol if possible.) Rub the cotton swab back and forth over the six circular magnets on the Type Cover's connector. After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that no cotton
 fibers remain on the connector. Then clean the connector on your Surface.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reattach the Cover, making sure that all the magnets touch the bottom edge of your Surface.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reinstall the Surface Cover driver </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>device manager</strong>, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the results.</li><li>Expand<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Keyboards</strong>.</li><li>Right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Surface Type Cover Filter Device</strong>.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Uninstall</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your Surface. It'll automatically download and install the Surface Cover driver the next time you connect to the Internet.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reset your Surface</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then it reinstalls Windows. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023533/surface-restore-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to learn more on how to reset your device.
</span>If resetting the device doesn't resolve the issue, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the recovery image for your Surface</a></strong>.
<span>This will reset your device to it's factory condition.
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of these steps were able to help fix the issue, then it is most likely hardware related. You can take your device to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>&nbsp;to
 try a different Type Cover, to determine if the issue is with your Surface or the Type Cover. If you're outside the US, contact

<p>Thanks Mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Toolkit before, but I didn't pick up any issues. I have also restarted the device, reattached the type cover and reset it, nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to use the chat by first using the bot that has been set up for support, but when I asked to talk to a person it just sat there trying to connect for an eternity. I have tried it before but the agents were pretty useless, took forever to respond
 and had no idea what to do on a simple issue. Should I ring phone support instead? I believe there is a replacement keyboard coming as the PC was still under warranty but I borrowed someone else's keyboard and had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the mouse playing up too? I was told it could be a software issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope we can sort this out, I don't want to consult with another "agent".</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us, Jacob. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you start your Surface in safe mode and check if the issues occur. This
<span>starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. To learn more on
 how to start your device in safe mode, click <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check if the issues occur when the power supply is plugged in to your device.
</p>

<h2>            &#39;&#39;new simple volume&#39;&#39; isn&#39;t in the Disk Management right click context menu, cannot get past initialzing the disk&#47;hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I bought a "like new" hard drive off Amazon, a Samsung HD204UI ATA (2 TB) drive it says in the devce properties. I couldn't initialize the disk when I had it connected to a USB 3.0 startech adapter so I connected directlly to the motherboard. I booted up
 using a hard drive I havn't used in a while because it was temporarly not working because without warning an idiot electrician from the neveda power company turned the power off without warning! But anyways, for some reason it started working again but stopped
 using it anyways, but here I am back using it. I noticed the volume button won't show if that's any indication of anything, and it's also grayed out in the turn icons on or off. Some guy on here with confirmation from another user claimedf if I log off then
 back in it will work again but whatever. So I'm able to initialize this disk on this Windows 7 x64 one (the same one I said I haven't used for months). But, then I discover to use it I have to select new simple volume (and yet it's in Basic mode). However,
 that command isn't even in the list, and the other ones are grayed out except for properties and some other weird one the thing that lets u switch between dynamic and basic, etc.</p>
<p>So what now? Should I try logging on or off and maybe that will cause it to appear, or do I possible have a messed up drive from this Amazon seller? Why can't I just format the thing like I can a flash drive?!</p>

    <title>Digital Game refunds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> retropyro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Digital Game refunds</h2>
                    
<p>With the push to get people to buy more games digitally, there needs to be a way to get a refund. &nbsp;If I buy a game from a store and that game turns out to be "broken" or nowhere close to what was advertised, I can trade it back for store credit for pretty
 *** close to what I paid (for example with BF4 I took it back after 3 days and was given a full refund minus $3, one dollar for each day I had the game). &nbsp;Or I could sell it on ebay or trade it for something else.</p>
<p>But digital is just a leap of faith. &nbsp;Up until now I've been lucky and enjoying each digital purchase and loving the convenience or it. &nbsp;Then yesterday I shelled out $79.08 after tax for WWE 2K15. &nbsp;The game does not play as I saw it advertised, has basic
 features that should be safe to expect in any game today (like the ability to change gameplay options for each mode and alter difficulty). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I love buying digital, but there needs to be some type of consumer protection built in rather than a "too bad".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retropyro hey there :)</p>
<p>That's not a bad idea, but this sort of thing is something you should produce on the feedback website. The site has a vote system and a comment system which allows the community to get behind you and get involved.</p>
<p>feedback.xbox.com</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the best way to prevent things like this from happening is to do a lot of research on what you are buying before hand, so you know exactly what you are getting. Refunds are usually not granted unless they are on the grounds of exceptional
 circumstances.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
