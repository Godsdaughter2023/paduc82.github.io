<h2>            kb2809289 not enough storage is available to process this command</h2>
                    When trying to install patch kb2809289 on Window Server 2008 SP2 with IE 7 I keep getting a message that says "not enough storage is available to process this command" when I right click on the patch and run as administator. I have 53gb bits free on a
 200gb hdd. Another co-worker of mine is also getting his same message when trying to install this patch on Windows 7 with IE 8. What is the fix for this?

            <p>I can tell both of you the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. KB2809289 was released on 12 March 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Since then, <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB2809289</a> has been superseded by <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB2817183</a> (09 Apr-13) as well as <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB2829530</a> (14 May-13). All three (3) are Cumulative Security Updates for&nbsp;IE8, IE9 &amp; IE10 (as well as IE6 &amp; IE7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If none of the above have been installed on the computers-in-question, something's very,&nbsp;<em>VERY
</em>wrong with the computers!</p>

            <p>Lessons you've hopefully learned from this experience:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;The Registry does NOT&nbsp;need to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimised.</p>
<p>2. Norton &amp; McAfee applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling "cleanly."</p>
<p>3. Only (1) anti-virus application should be installed &amp; loading at boot.</p>
<p>4. It's seldom, if ever, a wise move to "hide" <em>ANY</em> security update.</p>
<p>5. Ideally, you would never, EVER use System Restore&nbsp;after having installed&nbsp;updates or&nbsp;to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade (which often leaves the system in a "confused" or "torn" state)! Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, and/or IE
 upgrade &amp; reboot. If that doesn't correct the problem, <em>then</em> try System Restore.<br />

    <title>Devices on WORKGROUP network dissppear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wurlitzer1015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Devices on WORKGROUP network dissppear</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 8.1 on a DELL Inspiron 2330. &nbsp;It connects to other devices in the WORKGROUP over my local LAN, the other items are:-
<div>(a) RYAN PLAYON HD-2 (with a drive mapped to it from the DELL) (LINUX box)</div>
<div>(b) iMAC (MacOS)</div>
<div>(c) OpenELEC Media centre (LINUX box)</div>
<div>(d) Toshiba Laptop (WIndows 7)</div>
<div>(e) Canon printer</div>
<div>(f) Apple Air-Port time capsule (for backing up the MAC and providing another wireless point)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything has worked well, the DELL could see all devices on the network and freely transfer files and access remote devices (printers etc). &nbsp;They could all also see the DELL, connect and share, all that good stuff that WORKGROUPS gives you.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then a couple of days ago, for no reason that I can work-out (nothing changed in my setup) the DELL can now only see the Canon printer (and itself) in the network section of explorer. &nbsp;The mapped drive on the DELL can still see the PLAYON HD2 and I can
 copy files over but can't see anything else on the network, no matter what I try</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I go on the MAC, it can still see everything (including the DELL and its shared folders), the PLAYON HD2 can still stream from the DELL, the OpenELEC still has its mapped areas (using smb) etc etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So everything out there can see the DELL and ecxhange information with it but the DELL can't see them (except the printer).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried just about everything I can think off..</div>
<div>1. Rebooted</div>
<div>2. Disabled ipV6 (in the registry)</div>
<div>3. Checked that all discovery services are running</div>
<div>4. Disabled anti-virus software</div>
<div>5. Gone back to a restore point prior to the problem</div>
<div>6. Tried connecting to the network by cable (the normal way that always worked was via the Apple Air-Port time capsule)</div>
<div>7. Left the workgroup by creating a new one and then going back to WORKGROUP</div>
<div>8. Triple checked that HOMEGROUP wasn't active.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So where from here, any ideas would be most welcome.</div>

            Not getting much help on this topic but I'll just update anyway.. 



Yesterday all the network devices suddenly appeared again, nothing has changed but they're back. 



However this morning when I checked they've all disappeared again.  This is such a random thing that it is becoming impossible to track down what is causing it but it is sure as **** really frustrating.

            Well finally found the cause of the problem, there are quite a few threads around the web with this problem, none with a satisfactory conclusion so I thought I'd post this for a solution that should help quite a few...
<div><br />
<div>At the crux of the problem is WORKGROUPS and how it inter-acts with other other non-windows devices on the WORKGROUP network. &nbsp;Samba (smb) is used to provide the connectivity between devices on the network but windows machines become very confused if those
 non-windows devices are configured to act as the "master" and any windows PC has the "Computer Browser" service running. This results in the problem I was having with no network devices showing up, although they could be contacted via IP address or name. &nbsp;It
 was all down to a conflict that Windows couldn't resolve in this scenario and resulted in no network devices being returned by the "Computer Browser" service.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In this situation the following actions resulted in the network showing the devices in explorer, either of the two solutions below works, choose whichever suits you best.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Go to each windows PC and STOP "Computer Browser" under CONTROL PANEL--&gt;ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS--&gt;SERVICES and also "disable" it from it's properties. Don't just change it to manual, WORKGROUPS will start it. &nbsp;You must do this on ALL windows PCs in the
 WORKGROUP.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Alternatively, go to each non-windows device (in my case linux boxes and a Mac), login as root using ssh or telnet and navigate to /etc/samba/ , edit smb.conf and change the following lines from "yes" to "no"</div>
<div><br />
<div>preferred master = no</div>
<div>domain master = no</div>
<div>local master = no</div>
<div><br />
<div>Probably also best to check the windows machines and only have one running "Computer Browser" although multiple PCs running the service do seem to be resolved OK by WORKGROUPS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, as simple as that, would be nice if Microsoft came out of their shell once in a while and realise that other devices besides windows machines run on WORKGROUPS and didn't get so confused when many try an assert themselves as the preferred master...</div>

            Do a clean boot first and then try to delete it. It seems that one of the application is causing this issue.

<p>The thing is, I'm not in a Microsoft Family, and every time I click the Xbox Settings link I just get redirected to the same page, and I cannot find any settings link on the Xbox site.</p>
<p>If anyone knows what I am doing wrong, help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>In addition, every time I try to log in to the Xbox site, I just get redirected the main Xbox Site with no option to log in, and it is really ticking me off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a Microsoft wireless keyboard and the instructions I gave you easily turned off the Cap Lock pop up. Are you using the manufacturer's drivers for the keyboard or Microsoft's? It maybe that you need software from the keyboard manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>

            &nbsp;Hi Richard,<br />
Thank you for posting your queries on Microsoft Community.<br />
In order to assist you better could you please confirm a couple of things&nbsp;like:
<div>1. Does the computer operates&nbsp;fine whenever the Ethernet cable isn't plugged into the NIC card?</div>
<div>2. When the time computer shut down, is it instantly shut down or prompt any message before shut down?</div>
<div>
<p>3. Does both the machine shut down simultaneously or is there any discernable pattern in the process?</p>
<p>4. Are there any Windows Update that are pending on both the machines?</p>
<p>5. Does both the machines have up to date Network Adaptor drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless you can run the following command on your command prompt to know what is the cause of the most recent shutdown\reboot.</p>
<p>shutdown -d [u][p]:xx:yy </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us with the required information and we would be glad to help you out.</p>

            <p>Hello Sougata,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;Yes the computers operate just fine if the ethernet cable is unplugged from the NIC card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) All 4 computers shut down every hour on the hour and give a 1 minute warning before shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Yes they all do it simultaneously as it appears to be clock driven. Every hour on the hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I believe 2 of the 4 machines are completely up to date as far as updates go. &nbsp;1 of them is a completely fresh Windows 8 install and it does it also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Yes i believe every machine has the latest Network Adaptor drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I find it bizarre that all of them do it at the same time, this is why my train of thought was leading towards a virus or malware of some sort. But I just can't seem to find anything at all.</p>

            Hi John.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please know that MVP's are pressing Microsoft harder now on these disastrous version Upgrades. After you're back up and running, you can also complain to developers in Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where they are tasked to process Consumer feedback, but they will not even see it here as this is a tech forums where volunteers try to solve your problems.
<br />
<br />In cases similar to yours which we're escalating right now, that Rollback screen you're getting doesn't seem to even apply here since nothing on it works, it may be a legacy screen interfering with the actual Go Back to old Version needed here.
<br />
<br />To test this create the bootable media which is always the most stable method for repairs anyway. Please know that MVP's are pressing Microsoft harder now on these disastrous version Upgrades. After you're back up and running, you can complain to developers in Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where they are tasked to process Consumer feedback, but they will not even see it here as this is a tech forums where volunteers try to solve your problems.
<br />
<br />In this case which we're escalating right now, that Rollback screen you're getting doesn't seem to even apply here since nothing on it works, it may be a legacy screen interfering with the actual Go Back to old Version needed here.
<br />
<br />To test this create the bootable media to try the repairs from it, which is always most stable anyway, to try to Go back to Old Version. If it also fails then you can try the Reset or use the media to Clean Install with our help. 
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then More Options, then Go back.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot options to try Reset. 
<br />
<br />If these fail proceed with the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Close out repairs and try Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Sorry, this is widely reported currently and there is no known fix except to do a clean install or a Reset or wait until MS comes up with a workaround.

            Hi John, 1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, your est and probably only option is to roll back to version 1709
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous version of Windows

<h2>            Windows 10 update june 2019 removed all my saved themes and deleted my images</h2>
                    &nbsp;It told me an update was due for just the security windows defender, then it started to install something called version 1903 or something that area of numbers. when it finished and I restarted all my personalized themes were gone, not only that but when
 I went ti check my themes that I saved as you can&nbsp; save personalized themes, All of those were gone as well. In fact the PHOTOS I used to make those themes are gone. I can't find them anywhere, the June 8th 2919 update wiped all my saved theme photos and I
 would never delete themes they are pretty much irreplaceable. why would it do this? Please I'd like to know why it keeps randomly deleting files.

            Hi Courtney.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then for ten days only you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />Themes are supposed to be sync'd to your MS account so that when you sign in it will apply them, if you choose that in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync my Settings.  Look over those closely. 
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            It backs it up to your Microsoft Account IF that is what you sign in with.  
<br />If not it doesn't work.  And it doesn't always work anyway.  It's never backed up my Edge Favorites.  I back them up myself along with everything else I value.

            How long has the screen flickered?  Do you remember what was one just before it started?  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.

<h3> andreprins1  say:</h3>
<h2>            MDT using autologon during build SOMETIMES does not log on</h2>
                    <p>I have an odd issue.</p>
<p>we have a task sequence to deploy window 2016 server, and I am creating a local account (autologon) during phase 4 Specialize and make it an administrator.</p>
<p>Reason: When our systems join the domain, the GPO instantly renames the administrator account - so using the administrator account would fail.</p>
<p>The autologon in the 7 OOBE phase logs in using the new local account (autologon) after the restart.</p>
<p>this works fine most of the time, but occasionally NOT.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently, we imaged 2 servers nearly simultaneously - both are in the same subnet, same imaging source on the local subnet, identical computer models, and one automatically logs in, and the other one sat at the login prompt, and then we have to manually
 log in using the "autologon" account and its credentials, it logs in, and the MDT process continues OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say in ~ 90..98% of all builds, the autologon works, and occasionally it does NOT....</p>
<p>but the above example rules out models / drivers / network - they were the same Dell PowerEdge XR2 server, and same windows 2016 server OS, same task sequence, same imaging source, so I am just puzzled what can cause this odd behaviour...</p>

<h3> karmakerosene  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try to import photos from my camera, it says no photos were found.</h2>
                    This is my first time attempting to import photos using Windows 10. I hooked up my Nikon D7000 as usual and manually tried to import them by going to "This PC" and right clicking "D7000". I selected "Import pictures and videos" as I have done many times
 before. Then box popped up saying "No pictures or videos were found on this device". The photos on my camera have all never been uploaded to my PC before. They are all new. I've tried reconnecting my device to no avail - The PC seems to know it's connected,
 it just doesn't seem to think there are any photos on it. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

<p>Hello Ruth</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't figure out how to select the emails in bulk to delete them from my inbox other than holding down the control key and clicking on each one individually.&nbsp; On upgrading from Windows&nbsp;8.1 to 10 over 200 emails appeared in my inbox making&nbsp;this&nbsp;a
 time consuming exercise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 8.1 I simply clicked on "All" and then selected the option to delete, move, etc.</p>
<p>Windows 10 does not appear to have this facility. I would like to know how to select in bulk and how to permanently delete these emails from my inbox and my deleted folder.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using the mail app that came with windows. Initially with 8.1 and now with windows 10. I assumed this was outlook as the address was automatically allotted as outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I upgraded to version 10 just a few days ago I could select emails to delete by clicking on all or by checking the first box in the list of emails&nbsp;then scrolling down to the last email in the folder, then holding down the shift key and checking the
 box of the last email. All boxes would then automatically be checked and those emails could be deleted in bulk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it seems in version 10 I can only check the boxes one at a time by holding down the shift key or the control key. Then all boxes checked&nbsp;can be removed in one go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can batch&nbsp;check boxes and avoid checking one at a time?</p>
<p>Just to let you know my email account setup is imap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct that emails can no longer be removed in batches in Windows 10?</p>

            But this won't give you the possibility to mass select like (Ctrl-A for selecting all message) in previous version or the check box on top of all e-mails to select all. When you have 200 e-mails to delete you don't want to select each one one by one you
 want them all selected in one command and all deleted in one press of the delete button. It seems the Mail app coming with WINDOWS 10 is unable to do that. If there is a way, I would like to know it.

<p>It seems Windows 10 is lacking some of the email management facilities such as commands for emptying a folder and bulk selection for action that were really useful in previous versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard to believe that these facilities have been ignored version 10.</p>

            Hello Ruth, I don't want to select one e-mail at a time in Mail app I want to know how I can get back the "select all" box that used to be able to select all the e-mail &nbsp;in one click and delete them all in one click of the mouse. Pressing Ctrl and clicking
 e-mails one by one to select them all is not very practical and really tedious when you have more than 99 e-mails to delete.&nbsp;
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click on the first email in the list then hold down the delete key it gets rid of all emails really quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            A Windows patch for a particular OS built does not apply to same version of the Windows of a different built&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello fellow Windows 10 users,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a Windows patch is for a particular OS built, it it applicable to the same version of OS, but of a different built?<br />
<br />
The following applies to Windows 10 version 1607 and Windows server 2016 (OS Build 14393.2430)<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4343887/windows-10-update-kb4343887<br />
<br />
We are using Windows version 1607 Enterprise, but the built number is different.<br />
<br />
Is it correct that this patch does not apply to our Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Which anti-virus is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>3) How are you trying to create system image on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:<span>&nbsp; </span>Run the system file checker to check the system files corruption on the computer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes this kind of unexpected behavior shown by Windows due to some missing or corrupt important system files. I would suggest you to rum Microsoft Safety Scanner SFC /SCANNOW to scan the system integration and fix system file corruption (if any).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sfc /scannow (System File Checker) command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> <em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Make sure you Turn On the firewall as well as re-enable the antivirus after performing all the troubleshooting steps since the computer might be at a risk of virus infection.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> <em>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</em></p>

Hi,</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Thank you for the quick response to my enquiry.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
My answers to the points raised by you are as follows:</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I have Kaspersky Pure 3 anti virus installed. </li><li>Earlier this year I upgraded the computer from Windows XP to Windows 7. This is now a dual boot PC with Ubuntu running on a separate HDD (E).&nbsp;
</li><li>I have been attempting to create the system image by using Start &gt; All programmes &gt; Maintenance &gt; Backup and Restore and then selecting ‘Create System Image’.</li></ol>
<div><span>Despite following all of the guidance offered by you, I am still not able to create a backup of my System Image and continue to receive the same error message as before.
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Having run the system file checker, which completed successfully, the Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li><span>I was unable to mark the C drive partition as ‘Active’, as that option was ‘greyed’ out.&nbsp; With regard to the destination location for the backup, my external hdd , there was no option to mark it as ‘Active’.</span>
</li><li><span>Check Volume Shadow copy – this required being started.</span>
</li><li><span>Dependency of services – under ‘This Service depends on the following system components’ were – DCOM Service Process Launcher and RPC End Point Mapper. On checking the status of these components, both DCOM and RPC were found to be ‘started’
 and ‘automatic’.</span> </li><li><span>Disabling Antivirus etc. – I had already tried this before, when attempting to create a backup, which resulted with the same error message.</span></li></ul>
<div><span>Thank you for your help.</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thank you for your continued support.&nbsp; I have followed all of the steps as listed above, the results are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Microsoft software shadow copy provider service required to be started, it was set as manual.</li><li>Windows Backup service was found to be started and set as manual.</li></ol>
<p>An attempt to create a System Image Backup failed, the usual Error message was received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having restarted the computer in 'selective start up' mode, I again attempted to create a backup of the System Image; this failed and the usual error message was received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I returned the computer to 'Normal Startup'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we must have nearly exhausted all of the options to resolve this issue, and I don't wish to take up more of your valuable time. So, unless you wish to continue to work your way through the various possibilies, I would be content to leave things as
 they are and close this thread.</p>

            <p>Hello Rohit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to my last reply, I have found anomaly on my computer which may, or may not, have some significance to the problem I'm presently experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Throughout our efforts to resolve the problem on my computer, I have made several Restore Points just in case I ran into trouble.&nbsp; I have found that the computer is not saving these points after shut down or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On checking System Protection, I found that the radial button for 'Turn off System Protection' had been selected.&nbsp; I reset that to ' Restore System Settings' and made a manual restore point.&nbsp; On restarting the computer I found that the Restore Point that
 I had made had not been saved, and that the option to 'Turn off System Protection' had been selected again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still unable to create a Restore Point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to trouble further, but I thought this may be of interest.</p>

            Hi Ethasham,<br />
<br />
From your description, it sounds like an issue related to that user (we call him “unworkable user”) whose Skype for Business Basic “Lagged the video call”. So, let’s further investigate and troubleshoot the issue via the following aspects:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure the unworkable user’s client version is the same as the workable user’s
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ensure the unworkable user is under a good network environment. You can try changing a different network environment.
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform a clean boot</a> and
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business safe mode</a> for that unworkable user if he is using Windows OS.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please clarify the following information for further checking:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are the detailed Skype for Business Basic client versions for that 2 users (especially the unworkable user’s)?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If changing another user who has a video call with that unworkable user, does the issue persist?
<br />

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>sorry for my late reply,</p>
<p>but i still have the same issue i have done the steps you said.</p>
<p>1. both side skype for business version is same, i.e: Skype for Business 2016 MSO (16.0.4417.1000) 64-bit</p>
<p>2. Unworkable user is in the good network environment.&nbsp;<br />
unworkable user system's configuration<br />
windows 10 build 1067</p>
<p>Skype for Business 2016 MSO (16.0.4417.1000) 64-bit</p>
<p>Currently we have only two licenses so we can't change the user to test with another one</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you cannot test with another user, I suggest you set up the account of the user who experiences lagging video in the PC of the user who don’t have this issue. Then, start a video call and see if the issue occurs. This help us to identify
 whether the issue relates to the client or account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, the issue could also be related to the camera of the user who shares the video. I suggest you change another camera and see if the issue occurs.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox Live Disconnects When Playing Multiplayer Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Disconnects When Playing Multiplayer Games</h2>
                    
<p>The past few months now, I've had a consistent issue in which every time I play any Multiplayer game or even just sit in a party, I get disconnected within maybe 20-30 minutes of signing into Xbox live. After I disconnect, if I try and reconnect, it gives
 me an error saying I can't connect. But if I test my connection first, I'm able to reconnect. So basically I really need help with this issue. I've tried clearing my cache 3 times, redownloading my profile, and resetting my network settings back to factory
 default. It's VERY annoying and rage inducing when I have to go back to the dashboard check my connection when I know nothing is gonna be wrong and sign back in. Especially with games with long loading screens like GTA V. The only other way i can fix this
 is resetting my router which is in an entirely different room but I still disconnect ever so often</p>

<p>It sounds a bit like you may have a Nat issue. So for xbox live on your router your Nat type needs to be set to open. There are 3 types usually. Strict, moderate and open. Now Strict will not let you play at all. Moderate will let you play but you will experience
 a lot of disconnect issue's at random times(this sounds like you). Nat only effects multi player games, party's and online chatting, this really sounds like you.

<p>Ok so from your above post it says you need to reset your router to fix your issue, so it does seem like there maybe some kind of an issue with your network settings and your xbox, have you contacted your ISP?</p>

<h2>            I have no access to my Microsoft&#47;XBOX Live account whatsoever, and I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m being charged in the meantime</h2>
                    
<p>Earlier this year, I purchased Xbox Live Gold for my XBOX 360. Everything went smoothly, and I was up and running. Although, I moved the console outside of my wireless router location and therefore haven't used the Xbox Live for the previous months. Anyway,
 I've received&nbsp;a different console for Christmas and it's well inside the boundary for my router to pick it up.</p>
<p>However, there is quite a large problem; I don't remember my Microsoft account and therefore can not get underway on my Xbox Live account. I've tried numerous times to retrieve my account and the password, but I just can't do so. Over the period of my attempts
 all I have succeeded to do is finding the passwords to old, unused Microsoft accounts that have no use to me - like the one I've made a Xbox Live profile on, whatever that is.</p>
<p>All I ask for is someway of verifying my identity and therefore retrieving my account details. The details I know is my Xbox Live [Gold] gamertag that I used and the phone number I included in the sign up process, as it hasn't been changed at all since.
 I also have a great idea of which credit card I used to purchase the Xbox Live membership, (what I mean by this is I must have the card still with me and through some trial and error I will eventually identify which card I used). Also, if I do discover the
 correct e-mail associated with my Xbox Live account, I genuinely believe I would know the password as I've used it quite vastly for accounts on other websites. Although, I do not have a clue what the answer to my security question will be, or even if there
 will be one for that matter, for the reason that it's a blur to me.</p>
<p>I really do hope there is some way I can get these details back, and put them down somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Please help me, thank you in advance.</p>

<p>If you are locked out of your account and still being charged getting in contact with Xbox support would not only help with the charges being made to an account you are locked out of but also be able to get you back into that account if you choose to pursue
 that. They will be able to help you out no doubt about that.</p>

<p>Go to your network settings. There should be a option that tells you your data usage hour by hour. Games usually dont use up alot of data while playing.&nbsp;</p>
