<h2>            Missing IMs - Inferior workflow vs Skype</h2>
                    
<p>So I migrated my user base from regular Skype to Skype for Business (we all have E3 licenses).&nbsp; And I'm facing a user revolt because the reliability of SfB Messaging is vastly inferior to that of regular Skype.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how you cope with IMs that never get delivered to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>For instance I sent an IM to someone who was away from their computer in the same meeting I was at. SfB was running on his desktop. When he gets to his desk, and checks SfB there is no indication that I sent him an IM.&nbsp; With the regular Skype (which everyone
 is used to) this was never a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't imagine why an Enterprise IM system has these holes in them.&nbsp; Everyone here is agitated by this and is demanding I switch back to Skype.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>To understand this scenario, I would like to collect some information as below:</p>
<ol>
<li>About “the same meeting I was at”, do you refer to a group meeting? If so, do any other members in the meeting who are away from their computers encounter the same issue? Moreover, does this issue persist when sending IM to the user privately?
</li><li>The detailed information about “away from their computer”. Was the screen automatically locked or did the user manually lock it or shut down the computer?
</li><li>Can any other users reproduce the same issue? </li><li>The detailed version of your computer operating system and Skype for Business.
</li><li>What’s the Skype for Business’s status of the user when sending IM, Off Work, Available, or Busy?
</li></ol>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Noah</p>

    <title>Monitor display issue with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesprice73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor display issue with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p><span><span><em>Original title: </em></span></span><em>Monitor problem</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>efore I explain my problem;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>First, let me tell you a little about myself.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am 73 and I am a computer Novice and do not consider myself an expert..<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a degree in electronics with over 40 years experience. I have built many computers for family and friends for years.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The problem I am about to explain has me completely confounded.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here goes, I have a 24" I-Inc Monitor I purchased in 2008.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It has a beautiful sharp image which has never changed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Best deal I ever made in Monitors.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This Monitor was connected to my main computer i5 cpu running Operating System :<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Windows 7 Ultimate Professional Media Center 6.01.7601 Service Pack 1 (64-bit)fully updated.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Monitor is driven by Video Card NVIDIA GeForce 210</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So, all of a sudden a couple weeks ago, the screen on this Monitor started going dark and back, dark and back, dark and back.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The darkness would last anywhere from one second up to 30 seconds and the blinking would go on for one to five minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then stop and all is well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then maybe a while later, as I went to a different website it would start again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now, let me make it clear, there is nothing wrong with this monitor or my PC, which brings me to my next story.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After fighting this Dark Monster for a couple days, I decided to move it to what I call my workshop computer.
<span>&nbsp;</span>This computer has i3 cpu with NVIDIA GeForce 210 also in perfect condition.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>This computer has i3 cpu with NVIDIA GeForce 210 also in perfect condition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This computer is also a dual boot system, AND THIS IS A VERY KEY PART.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It has Ubuntu 14.04.3 md64(all my pcs are 64bt) AND Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This Monitor is also connected with an HDMI cable and when I plugged it in to this workshop cpu, I first booted to Ubuntu.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All was great for about one minute then the Dark Monster started it's dance for about two minutes then stopped and screen image was perfect.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I flipped around for awhile then the Dark Monster happened again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ok, so I decided to shutdown and boot to Windows 10.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may not want to believe this but with Windows 10, THERE IS NO DARK MONSTER.....PERIOD!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Fact is, it is still connected to my workshop cp in Win 10, and I am looking at it as I type and the image is perfect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>My conclusions:<span>&nbsp; </span>Nothing is wrong with Monitor which is still connected to workshop cp and working perfect.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Nothing is wrong with any of my hardware in either system.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I am using my backup Monitor on my main system and all is well.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Questions:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Why would this Monitor work in Win 10 and not in Win 7 where it once worked for years?</span>
</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 disconnects intermittently with the Surface Dock - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 disconnects intermittently with the Surface Dock</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Surface Book 2 15" with 512GB SSD.&nbsp; I have two Surface Docks, one at work and one at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Dock seems to randomly disconnect and it's not consistent and when it does.&nbsp; It could be fine for a few hours then it'll throw fits and disconnect and reconnect every 30 seconds or so. I want to say I see this more when I'm playing a game and
 installing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does it with both docks. Both docks have the latest firmware as specified by the Surface Dock updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I pull up the Device Manager and I expand Human Interface Devices, I'll see it flash and see the Dock items disappear, then reappear, then sometimes reappear with exclamation points next to it, then disappear... and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the docks with my Surface Pro 4 without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it seems to be solid when the dock is connected straight to the clipboard rather than the Surface Book 2 base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some research and this seems to have been an issue for a lot of people for the past year and a half with the Surface Book.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The findings that you and the other users who are affected by this problem may be true. However, the best option to confirm if the Surface Dock is not powerful enough is to take your Surface Book 2 to a Microsoft Store. They'll be able to reproduce the problem
 and perform the necessary actions to resolve it. You can use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> to find the nearest Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're just here if you need more help.</p>

<p>This forum is a secure site (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/">https://answers.microsoft.com/</a>). Do you get that error here too? Are you using your ISP DNS servers? You could try switching temporarily to the Google
 public DNS servers: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 instead of whatever you get automatically from your own router or from your ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always keep one of the Google servers as my secondary DNS, as very rarely my ISP's DNS, or those it depends on, have had issues and I retain full Internet access that way, after it fails over to the Google DNS.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a client whose SAP systems I need to connect to via a browser for some applications. Until last Friday, I always got the message that there was a problem with the site's security certificate, but had the option to continue to the site (even though
 it was not recommended). Since yesterday, when connecting to the same sites, I can no longer get past the warning but instead get the error reported by Don Cuthbert above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I cannot provide you with the URLs I am using as they are corporate servers and only accessible via VPN. What I can tell you is that the issue occurs whether I use Edge, Chrome or IE 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 4 different sites (all in the same domain) which I try to access. Moreover, there are some inconsistencies. Yesterday, I was unable to access any of the four sites. Today, with one of the sites I initially got a&nbsp;<em>different</em> error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64759ed1-66a0-41e2-949e-00a031ea787f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64759ed1-66a0-41e2-949e-00a031ea787f" /></a></p>
<p>After that, I was able to continue on to the webpage without a problem. However, as I am writing this reply, I tried again to access this same site and now get the initial error again:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00782cc2-3400-4968-8820-7e83c3373e44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00782cc2-3400-4968-8820-7e83c3373e44" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The other sites remain inaccessible. This is incredibly frustrating as I need to access these sites in order to support the client. Coming on top of the change that prevents One Drive from using SD cards for storage and has thus rendered OneDrive useless
 on my notebook, my confidence in Microsoft and Win 10 is taking a serious battering this week :(...</p>

<p>I have seen these errors from time to time. Usually, closing the browser entirely (not just that Tab) improves things. If the option to go on anyway is presented and I trust that the site is either in need of an update, or that it is a temporary browser
 glitch, I sometimes just continue on, as worked for you once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance that the site certificates are actually wrong or expired, since other https sites work properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the issue be due to the VPN? If you could connect from your same computer while physically connected to their Intranet, it might help to troubleshoot, but their corporate security may not allow that (or logistically impractical).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it likely that yours is the only device with Windows 10 connecting via VPN as you are? Are there any other reports of problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since all tried browsers are consistently affected, I wonder about antivirus software bring common to them all. The easiest way to a generic test might be to boot with something like a Ubuntu Live media. It would allow you to use the included browsers without
 Windows or any installed software interfering (if you can figure out how to setup the VPN).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach is to clean install Windows to a small partition and try connecting. This eliminates any inherited issues in your current install that might be involved. Running from a Virtual Machine, such as in Hyper-V, might be a similar test. I find
 a clean install can be done quite quickly, so it may be worth trying in a partition or VM.</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>thanks for the reply and suggestions. I am actually quite certain that the certificates are not up to date. I have been working for this client for over 18 months and in all browsers and connection modes on all machines, I always get the initial warning.
 And always I choose to continue to the site. What changed this week was the message above whereby the option to continue no longer appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it is a simple case of not closing the browser. In all my attempts to connect I closed and restarted the browser(s) before re-trying, although it is possible I had eg a Chrome window open and minimized while restarting Edge, for example. As
 they share some settings and resources, perhaps this was a factor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have the option to connect without the VPN as intranet connections are only available to internals with SSO. That said, when I am out of the office I use a Cisco AnywhereConnect VPN client but inside the office when connected to the wifi network,
 it is not necessary to run the VPN. So I can confirm that the issue is not VPN related as it occurs whether the VPN is active or not. Unfortunately, most of my colleagues (who are internal employees of the implementation partner) are still running Win 7, so
 I have noone to compare with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did just try was to connect from this laptop (which is not the laptop I use at work). On here I got the warning about the hostname in the certificate being different from that of the site, but with the option to continue. So on this machine I do not
 have an issue. Apart from the hardware itself (this is a Lenovo ideapad and the other is a Samsung Ativ Book 9+), the main difference is that this machine has W10 Home 64 bit versus W10 Pro 64 bit on the other machine. But the fact that the Samsung worked
 flawlessly until Monday makes me doubt it is machine specific, as there were no other software changes over the weekend except for Windows updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't run a separate instance of W10 on the Samsung due to another new issue that appeared over the weekend, whereby my OneDrive (which was installed to a 256GB SD card) came up with an error saying it no longer works with drives that are not formatted
 as NTFS. As I use OneDrive to sync files between multiple PCs, I had to move it to the SSD on the laptop, which is now dangerously full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, for the moment I have the workaround (which is to access the affected systems after hours from a different machine). It's not ideal, but hopefully the issue is resolved in future updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your input!</p>
<p>

<p>For OneDrive and SD, can you format the SD as NTFS? I assume that it is using exFAT now, since it is over 32GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have to wonder how much problem it would be for them to update their site security certificates, as having users make a habit of ignoring security warnings cannot be in the best interests of the corporation, especially with the recent ransomware
 attacks becoming an international issue.</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>I am waiting to see if anything changes in the next couple of weeks re the SD card. It seems like a very backwards step to force people to format using NTFS. I can understand them phasing out FAT32 and eventually exFAT, but why replace it with a system that
 is almost as old, especially when they have newer, more reliable formats like REFS. It's also the way it was done: without warning and without any support documentation, such as how to convert the FS. As the conversion is one way, I will wait before I do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the certificates, I agree it is madness that they do not fix the problem at its source. I have put in a support ticket requesting that, but I am a tiny, external cog in a huge machine and so unlikely to generate much traction for change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I will just put this down as a bad week ;)...</p>
<p>Thanks for the support and suggestions...</p>
<p>

            I had the same issues today with a client trying to access their OWA server, IE and Edge both blocked it, had to use Firefox and proceed to site which worked fine, Just looking for a fix myself before other clients have the same issue.

    <title>Cannot Access to Itunes Store - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Access to Itunes Store</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is running on Window 7 system and has installed ITunes for quite some times and running smoothly.</p>
<p>In this&nbsp;recent month, when I opened my ITunes (on my desktop) and try to get access to ITunes Store, it will stop automatically when close to getting thru the access (other functions like linking up my IPad or listening Music is working fine).</p>
<p>A message box saying " ITunes has stopped working.&nbsp; A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close down the program and notify you if a solution is available.&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;appeared and needed to close down the program.</p>
<p>It works every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows has recommended me to install the latest version of ITunes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Advise taken and have uninstall existing ITunes and re-install the latest version.</p>
<p>But it still have&nbsp;the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My feelings might be something not recognizable in my Windows Program which did not allow the ITunes access to pass thru.</p>
<p>Is my guessing right ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, could anyone help and advise the solution of this problem as I have not been using the ITunes for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<h2>            WiFi connection drops out several times a day on my laptop with windows 10</h2>
                    I have windows 10 installed on my laptop.&nbsp; I have 2 other computers and a printer also connected to the home WiFi.&nbsp; My laptop is the only device that drops the WIFi connection.&nbsp; When I try to reconnect with my network password I get the message "Some information
 has changed since the last time connected. We need additional information to complete the connection".&nbsp; Troubleshoot does nothing.&nbsp; I found the only way to reconnect is to reset the modem/router.&nbsp; I have downloaded new drivers.

I still have the same issue.&nbsp; Clearing the check where it says "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" just adds another issue where the network doesn't automatically connect when powering the unit back on.&nbsp; You have to manually go in and
 select the network every time.&nbsp; Any other work arounds?&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Getting taxed on purchases - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agent kei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting taxed on purchases</h2>
                    
<p>I live in Washington state and I had some points on my account that got transitioned into Local currency in June/July 2013? I purchased the walking dead 400 days in October 2013&nbsp;and I got taxed on it. From my understanding points that were transitioned to
 local currency should not be taxed. Here is a snippet from the xbox website.</p>

<p><b>Will I be taxed on the content that I buy in Xbox stores? </b></p>
<p>We will not apply taxes when you purchase content using currency that <i>we</i> add to your account at the time of the transition. However, when you use currency that
<i>you </i>add to your account <i>after</i> the transition (including from Xbox gift cards), all appropriate taxes will be applied to those purchases.</p>

<p>Now I spent over an hour and a half with support chat and they insist that the state will be taxing me for my purchases. If I'm not mistaken this is double taxation. I was taxed when purchasing the points and now I'm being taxed again purchasing the games.
 Can someone tell me if this is right?</p>

<p>going 2+ hours now on chat "support" and the best thing they can come up with is that "aiza" the person I am chatting with is confirming with their supervisor that every transaction is now taxable. Which goes against what the xbox website says and is totally
 double taxation.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Any points you had in your account prior to the transition that were converted would not have been taxed.<br />
<br />
I tested this myself by adding ~$15 worth of Microsoft Points to a test account. After the transition took place, I purchased an item in August, and I was not charged any sort of tax on that purchase. I then made a subsequent purchase after I added more money
 via a Microsoft Points card to the test accounts Microsoft Account balance, and was charged tax.<br />
<br />
If you added more currency cards or added more money to your Microsoft Account balance after that fact, then you would have been taxed on that.<br />
<br />
Only plausible explanation I can think of here is that you a.) added further currency after you had used the currency that shouldn't have been taxed, or b.) you used another payment method to cover the remaining balance if your Microsoft Account balance didn't
 have enough money.<br />
<br />
I'd really look through your billing history and make sure that the points you believe were converted way back in June/July are actually the points you were using in October. It's possible that you used those points, added more, or those points expired and
 you had added more.<br />
<br />
P.S: I couldn't test it on my main account because it had already been transitioned due the 2013 Dashboard Beta.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not quite sure honestly, perhaps it used the $10 Microsoft Account balance that you added with a currency card instead of the $50 of migrated credit. I wasn't able to test it out in that manner, but that may be the case.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure what to say here, you may want to contact billing support and see what the deal is and perhaps get this escalated to the advocacy team so they can see what's going on here. That doesn't really make any sense to me personally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with my earlier posts, I was on the online chat support with them for over 1.5 hours. In the end they blamed the state for taking out the taxes and "confirmed" with their supervisor that now all transactions are taxable. Besides since the migrated currency
 has an expiration date it should have been used first.</p>

<p>G'day Agent Kei. Sorry to hear about the confusion with WA state sales tax on this purchase. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this.<br />
<br />
When you added the $10 credit to your account, was it a Gift Card? Was it a promotional credit? Let's look at your Payment Options tab at
<a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">commerce.microsoft.com</a> and see if any of your account balance has an expiration date. If that $10 credit has an expiration date nearer than your transitioned points, then the balance with the earlier expiration will
 be used first and promotional credit will likely be taxed.<br />
<br />
I just tested this yesterday by redeeming MSP and buying a couple of Avatar items, and I was charged the same sales tax for those items.<br />
<br />
If this isn't the case, please do let me know. I fully understand the frustration that comes with this sales tax (I never have change for the dollar menu!) especially when it's unexpected.</p>

<h2>            HardwareCheck.exe &#47; Windows Command Processor Pop-Up &#47; Potential Virus</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8. In every startup, a pop up for admin permission comes for Windows Command Processor. My language is Turkish and it should have come as "Komut İşlemci", Windows Command Processor (WCP) in Turkish. It was suspicious and I checked the details.
 It seems like that it exists at that path: "c:/users/lenovo/appdata/local/temp/HardwareCheck.exe". I went there to upload it to virustotal to check if it is malware but there is no HardwareCheck.exe file there.<br />
<br />
So I am not sure that if it is virus or not. Is HardwareCheck.exe is an .exe that is normal or is it virus? If it is virus, what should I do?<br />
<br />
My fan starts to run with more noise since the pop up came and laptop gets hotter so it is really annoying. It makes my computer run slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Unable to wake Windows 8 Pro from Sleep state with Remote Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to wake Windows 8 Pro from Sleep state with Remote Desktop</h2>
                    <p>With Windows XP Pro on same hardware, I could waken the computer by initiating Remote Desktop Connection to it. After installing Windows 8 Pro, Remote Desktop works fine when the computer is awake but is unable to wake the computer from a sleep state.<br />
I have tried all combinations of Power Management settings under NIC Properties and confirmed that wake on pattern match and wake on magic packet are enabled. Under advanced power management, disabling hibernation and/or turning off hybrid sleep make no difference.
 With the default Microsoft/Broadcom NIC driver for Windows 8, whenever the computer sleeps, it always powers off the NIC - and once the NIC has been powered off it is unable to wake the computer on receipt of traffic.<br />
Hardware is HP DC5700 SFF core 2 duo. NIC is Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet. BIOS power management settings are configured to support wake up on LAN.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>I&nbsp;resolved this issue myself. Following is a summary of what I did:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From the command prompt enter <b>netsh interface ipv4 show interfaces </b>. This will list all available network interfaces. Note the index (labeled Idx ) of the target network adapter. Now enter
</p>
</span>
<p><span><b>netsh interface ipv4 set interface [index] forcearpndwolpattern=enabled</b> to
</span><span>f</span><span>orce the network adapter to wake on Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages. If the command is successful,
<b>OK</b> is returned.</span></p>
<p>2. Under the Driver tab of NIC Properties, click Update Driver and&nbsp;manually force the installation of Broadcom driver version 14.8.1.13 dated 2/23/2012.</p>
<p>3. Under the Power Management tab of NIC Properties, <u>check</u> the box for "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power",
<u>check </u>the box for "Allow this device to wake the computer" and <u>uncheck </u>
the box for "Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer". Click OK.</p>
<p>4. Reboot and then check Power Management tab of NIC Properties and confirm that the settings applied in step 3 above are persistent.</p>
<p>The above assumes the operating system is Windows 8 Pro, the network adaptor is a Broadcom Netxtreme Gigabit adaptor and that all other settings required for Remote Desktop to function have already been correctly applied.</p>
<p>After completing the above steps, when the computer sleeps there will be one green led and one amber led on the NIC versus both green when the computer is awake. The computer will now waken in response to an attempted Remote Desktop connection from a Windows
 7 or Windows 8 computer.</p>

<h2>            The Connection between your access point, router, or cable modem and the internet is broken</h2>
                    I have had a windows 8 for about a year now and never had this problem before my internet keeps dropping and when i hover over it it says, there is internet access when there is clearly not so, i do a trouble shoot and it says&nbsp; The Connection between your
 access point, router, or cable modem and the internet is broken
<p>While the small thing below it says default gateway not available - Fixed</p>
<p>so this keeps happening randomly when i at least expect it i been looking through post one after another and can never find a solution that would fix my laptop, so this laptop is the only device unable to connect to the internet without dropping any other
 device works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me find an answer im a bit slow at understanding complicated computer technology so can you please add pictures to show me or a video? Thanks</p>
<p>Just to mention my attempts to fix it, I tried restarting my modem no luck, Restarting computer No luck, Reset winlock No luck, Disabling security on my laptop No luck, Updating drivers No luck.</p>
<p>Just also to mention this never happened before until i started updating my computer since i usually never update now that im completely updated this happens so yeah..</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro keeps defaulting to Bitlocker Recovery after restarting or shutting down</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Pro 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I disabled BitLocker and I'm able to boot normally now</span></span>.&nbsp;<span><span>So what is the next step?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I was figuring completely decrypt the drive and re encrypt after a while but have no idea if it will solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've notice is it happened after win updates. Seems like I'm not the only one on the web who has that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come into this thread in the "Partner Network" but it's quite deep dive and I hope we can fix without using "in house" tools.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Since the Surface was purchase recently, not attached to any domain, it was not used a lot. I believe that it has TPM 2.0. For the Firmware update, we depend on Microsoft Windows Update and the latest is installed.</p>

    <title>Possible to change tooltips delay&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> magritte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible to change tooltips delay&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I find frequently the easiest way to distinguish similar windows on the taskbar is through the full path provided in the tooltip. However, with thumbnail display enabled, you have to first hover over the taskbar button, there's a slight delay before the thumbnail
 pops up, then there's a longer delay before the textual tooltip pops up. Once the thumbnail pops up I can move the cursor over other taskbar buttons and their thumbnails pop up instantly, but there's still the delay for the text tooltip. This gets rather annoying.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to change the delays so that a) the thumbnail pops up a bit faster, and b) the tooltip pops up much faster (preferably at the same time as the thumbnail)?<br />
<br />
There are other places in the UI that I would like tooltips to come up faster. For instance in explorer or on the desktop, in some views the full filename is too long to see so I need the tooltip to read it. Is it possible to change these tooltip delays as
 well?<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd prefer to have tooltips come up instantly and maybe have some way to make them disappear if they get in the way. Actually, what Windows needs is a status bar like at the bottom of most browser windows. Then there could be a permanent area to
 display additional info without cluttering up the UI. Too bad Windows 7 doesn't have this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Touchpad is a device which requires necessary driver software to function. If it has stopped working, either the device is disabled / locked or the device driver might have gone
 corrupted.</p>
<p>1. Were there any software or hardware changes in the Computer?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>3. Did you check if the touchpad button is locked by any chance?</p>
<p>4. Do you receive any error message while using the Touchpad?</p>
<p>5. What all steps you have done to troubleshoot this issue?</p>
<p>Perform the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><span>Run the Fix It from the following article and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try updating the drivers for the Touchpad in the Computer and check if it helps. If not uninstall and reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p><b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</b></p>
