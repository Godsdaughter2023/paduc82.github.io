<h2>            Reinstall operating system from an external CD drive</h2>
                    
<p>I have a trial version of Windows 7 currently that is going to expire today, so I would like to reinstall my original operating system from the CDs that came with the computer.&nbsp; My&nbsp;CD drive does not work.&nbsp; If I initiallize the reinstall, the computer does
 not read the cd&nbsp;from an external cd drive (via usb) because it is looking for it on the defunct drive within the laptop.&nbsp; How can I tell the computer to look at and read the reinstall cd from the external CD drive?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here we will try to install Windows 7 by copying the contents of the DVD to the hard drive on your computer.</p>
<p>After copying the contents, you need to make a USB flashdrive bootable device and you may start the installation procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>*USB Flash Drive (Minimum 4GB)</p>
<p>*Windows 7 or Vista installation files.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to create bootable Windows 7/Vista USB drive using which you can install Windows 7/Vista easily.</p>
<p>1. Plug-in your USB flash drive to USB port and move all the contents from USB drive to a safe location on your system.</p>
<p>2. Open Command Prompt with admin rights. Use any of the below methods to open Command Prompt with admin rights.</p>
<p>*Type cmd in Start menu search box and hit Ctrl+ Shift+ Enter.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>*Go to Start menu &gt; All programs &gt; Accessories, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.</p>
<p>3. You need to know about the USB drive a little bit. Type in the following commands in the command prompt:</p>
<p>First type DISKPART and hit enter to see the below message.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30447518@N04/3188204502/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.intowindows.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f01%2f12.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Next type LIST DISK command and note down the Disk number (ex: Disk 1) of your USB flash drive. In the below screenshot my Flash Drive Disk no is Disk 1.</p>
<p>4. Next type all the below commands one by one. Here I assume that your disk drive no is “Disk 1”.If you have Disk 2 as your USB flash drive then use Disk 2.Refer the above step to confirm it.</p>
<p>So below are the commands you need to type and execute one by one:</p>
<p><strong>SELECT DISK 1 </strong></p>
<p><strong>CLEAN</strong></p>
<p><strong>CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>SELECT PARTITION 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>ACTIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>FORMAT FS=NTFS</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Format process may take few seconds)</strong></p>
<p><strong>ASSIGN</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXIT</strong></p>
<p>Don’t close the command prompt as we need to execute one more command at the next step. Just minimize it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30447518@N04/3188216154/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.intowindows.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f01%2f115.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>5. Next insert your Windows7/Vista DVD into the optical drive and check the drive letter of the DVD drive. In this guide I will assume that your DVD drive letter is “D” and USB drive letter is “H” (open my computer to know about it).</p>
<p>6. Maximize the minimized Command Prompt in the 4th step.Type&nbsp; the following command now:</p>
<p>D: CD BOOT and hit enter.Where “D” is your DVD drive letter.</p>
<p>CD BOOT and hit enter to see the below message.</p>
<p>7. Type another command given below to update the USB drive with BOOTMGR compatible code.</p>
<p>BOOTSECT.EXE /NT60 H:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30447518@N04/3188222246/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.intowindows.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f01%2f14.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Where “H” is your USB drive letter. Once you enter the above command you will see the below message.</p>
<p>8. Copy your Windows 7/Vista DVD contents to the USB flash drive.</p>
<p>9. Your USB drive is ready to boot and install Windows 7/Vista. Only thing you need to change the boot priority at the BIOS to USB from the HDD or CD ROM drive. I won’t explain it as it’s just the matter the changing the boot priority or enabling the USB
 boot option in the BIOS.</p>
<p>Note: If you are not able to boot after following this guide means you haven’t set the BIOS priority to USB.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 takes FOREVER to load the select user&#47;switch user screen</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today I turned on my Toshiba laptop (Satellite P855-S5200) and got some sort of error screen, and then it brought me to a screen asking if I wanted to do a system repair or start windows normally. I chose system repair, but then it seemed to get
 stuck in that process (It was taking forever and nothing was happening), so I turned off the laptop (I know, big no no), booted in safe mode, and did a system restore to a restore point from about a week ago. The "starting Windows" screen came and went, no
 problem.&nbsp;Everything seemed fine till I got to the User Selection screen (the default blue one with the little hummingbird or whatever). Then it just sat there on that screen. I could see the hummingbird and the little squiggly lines, but there were no buttons
 to click my user. I just let it sit there, and after about 5 minutes, the user names popped up, and I was able to continue using the computer without any problems, no other speed issues whatsoever. It now makes me wait every time, always about 5 minutes, before
 the user names pop up. It does this when I restart the machine and when I try to switch users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a Pentium Core i7</p>
<p>2.3 Ghz</p>
<p>8 GB RAM</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any other specs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

    <title>Counter Strike&#58; Global Offensive Keeps Freezing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Counter Strike&#58; Global Offensive Keeps Freezing</h2>
                    <p>Go down to the list for a summary if tl;dr.<br />
<br />
Randomly while playing csgo, I will find my self unable to move, shoot my weapons, or use my mic. I can still look around, and when I see other people, they aren't moving either (which is on my side only). The sound loops over and over, but the strange thing
 is I can still hear people using voice chat, usually saying something like "Well, that's a bad time for someone to get lag." So far, I disconnect from the server and reconnect immediately, as to not get a cooldown, meaning that I can access the pause menu,
 the in game overlay, and other things of that sort.<br />
<br />
I recently ran IntelStressTest (not crashing at all, even on the highest settings and overclocked), updated all of my drivers (I will see if there are any more to update), stress tested my gpu using multiple platforms, ran both IntelStressTest and gpu stress
 testers as to test my psu, ran multiple memory checkers, and other hardware diagnostics (for a separate reason), and found that not only are there no hardware problems, but it runs amazingly well and the overclock that I sometimes use is completely stable.<br />
<br />
I also ran multiple sfc scans, ran multiple antivirus programs, uninstalled those antivirus programs, installed GeForce Experience, optimized csgo and checked for any updates, yet I still have this problem.<br />
<br />
There are similar questions on steam and different sites about this, but none are really the same. I will try some other stuff, like deleting csgo.exe and verifying the game cache and some other tricks and whatnot, but unless that does not fix the problem,
 this will be my primary method of solving this issue.<br />
<br />
Just a side note, this only happens in csgo competitive, no other game, even though I play games such as watch dogs 2, a much more cpu and gpu intensive game, with no errors.<br />
<br />
Another side note, in my opinion, the problem is a network issue. I use a wireless connection and not Ethernet, so that could be a problem. I probably will buy a Ethernet cord, but I'd just like to make sure first.<br />
______________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
For tl;dr:<br />
<br />
Basically, csgo keeps freezing only in competitive, but I can still hear other people talking and whatnot, but the game audio loops over and over. Here is a short list of things I tried:<br />
<br />
- Running Stress Tests (all passed with no errors whatsoever)<br />
- Tested other hardware (windows memory diagnostic, etc.)<br />
- Ran multiple sfc scans (nothing wrong)<br />
- Updated all of my drivers<br />
- Installed GeForce Experience to optimize csgo<br />
- Ran Antivirus programs &amp; deleted them once passed with no malware found<br />
<br />
Things to note:<br />
<br />
- I use a wireless connection (as of now), not Ethernet<br />
- Other resource intensive games, such as watch dogs 2, are perfectly fine and do not 'misbehave' in any way<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm 99% certain that it is a network problem, but any other suggestions are welcome and will be implemented, unless it is something like "Install virus.exe"<br />
<br />
I know that this isn't the best place to post this question, but it isn't a game specific problem. It, as far as I know, happens to other people and games, and if it is a networking issue, then I certainly get help from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding with the issue on CS GO, it's best to get in touch with CS Go support to check as the issue is specifically isolated to a single game mode. It's probably a known issue with CS GO.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype doesn&#39;t recognize my microphone these last few months</h2>
                    Everything used to be fine with Skype however for the last couple of months it doesn't recognize my microphone. It says '<strong>Device not found</strong>'! Yet, when I am on Zoom conferences or GotoWebinars everything is fine so my microphone
<strong>does</strong> work. Why isn't Skype recognizing it all of a sudden?

<p>Thanks for your assistance however it didn't help. When I checked my microphone was on for Skype and for loads of other unnecessary apps which I switched off. I restarted the computer and it's still the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could uninstall Skype and start again I think it would be better however because it's part of Windows 10 I can't which is stupid.</p>

            <p>Hi Engelsen,</p>
<p>I have tried the process you described above with Safe mode and Networking, but the Wireless part of the networking in Safe mode is not available, thus the option to manually connect to a wireless network is not available.</p>
<p>See attached screenshots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts of next steps?</p>

            A wireless or WiFi network provides all the functions of a wired network, while also giving you the flexibility to be in different locations within the radio-signal network. You can remain connected to the Internet, a printer, and share the network with
 more than one computer while enjoying the mobility of your notebook computer.<br />
1. Start the computer, and turn on the wireless device.<br />
2. In the toolbar notification area, locate the <strong>Wireless Assistant</strong> icon.<br />
3. Now that the wireless device is turned On and Enabled, locate the available wireless networks icon in the toolbar notification area. If there is no wireless icon, but the network cable is connected, unplug the network cable. The wireless network icon will
 display.<br />
4. <strong>Right-click</strong> the wireless network icon, click <strong>Open Network and Sharing Center</strong>, click
<strong>Set up a new connection or network</strong>, and then select<strong> Manually connect to a wireless network</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>Next </strong>to continue.<br />
6. Enter the required network security information. This is the information you used when you set up your home network.<br />
7. To verify the wireless connection is complete, click the available network icon to display a list of available wireless networks.

            <p>Hi Giovanni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the explanation.</p>
<p>Regretfully, the process is clear but does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After selecting <strong>Manually connect to a wireless network</strong>, the window that I showed above
<strong>opened for a split second and closes immediately.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn’t easy screen capture it as seen above, but when I did, you see that it
<strong>does not offer to set up a wireless connection</strong> and that is probably the reason it closes immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the reason for not offering me to set up a wireless connection?</p>
<p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are receiving error messages on startup and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What problems are you facing with C:\Users\HoustonSign\AppData\Local\BackgroundContainer\Background Container.dll?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Did you recently upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8?</li><li>Which operating system was pre-installed when you bought the computer?</li></ol>
<p>igfxpers.exe belongs to software <strong>Intel® Common User Interface</strong> and is sometimes used by nVidia graphic cards drivers. It is responsible for enabling display resolution settings to persist when a monitor is disconnected or turned off. Although
 it might not be essential for desktop computers, many notebook devices might require this process to run on startup. This process can easily be stopped from running on startup from the msconfig and is not essential to Windows 8.1 operating systems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Typical file (disk image) location: </strong></p>
<div>C:\Windows\System32\igfxem.exe</div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to start the computer in safe mode and then place the computer in clean boot state.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Start the computer in safe mode</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>

 works best vertical. Everywhere I look I find "Horizontal so it doesnt tip over" and "vertical so it doesnt overheat". I dont have overheating issues, and where it is, it shouldnt tip over at all (very high shelf, very stable, and if it does fall/tip over,
 a scratched disc is the LEAST of my worries).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So Im wondering this, I know disc drives werent really built to be vertical, but other than "if it tips" scenarios.... which is better? Just wondering, because if the vertical position constantly adds tiny scratches to the disc, Ill go back to horizontal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As said above there are not many problems but... </p>
<p>A spinning disc (of any sort) will always try to make its self horizontal, that's just a fact of physics and even though on something as small as a dvd there is a small amount of flex as it try's to do so and 'rarely' enough flex can happen to scratch the
 disc. Also with that flex it will weaken the integrity of the disc its self (your safe enough with a game disc but a cheap copy disc can peal apart from the constant flex involved). So any spiny disc is best horizontal :)

<p>Really there is no definitive answer. The console was designed to be able to be places either way. So it's mostly up to personal opinion. I have one set up vertically and the others set up horizontally. I prefer horizontal because of the risk of being tipped
 over, but I've never had any problems with the one I have vertical.</p>

<h2>            Winbook TW700 does not have enough memory to install Windows 10 upgrades</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased Winbook in 2015. It came with Windows 8 which I sucessfully upgraded to Windows 10 &nbsp;thrn within few month and it is running well even now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting constant reminders from Microsoft to install Windows 10 updates. When I started doing that I got a message that I should free up memory. Further the message said that I need to free up about 8 GB. I presumed that it means C: drive must
 have atleast 9 GB free space before upgrade can proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently C: drive on my tablet size is 14.3 GB and 11.7 GB is used and now only 2.6 GB free memory. I tried out cleanup but it did not free any sizable chunk. I also removed old restore points but that also did not free much memory. I have a 32Gb SD card
 as D: drive in which about 29 GB is free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently my tablet has only Windows and Office 365 ver 2013 installed. In addition there is chrome browser installed. There is no document or pictures which I can delete to make space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using File Explorer I checked the space taken by most folders and found that C:\Windows folder takes about 8.9GB. Other folders do not occupy significant memory space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Uograde Assistant and Update assistant software in C drive with shortcuts on desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have following questions:</p>
<p>1.Is 8.9 GB size taken by Windows folder normal? </p>
<p>2. Does C: drive must have 8.9 GB free to upgrade?</p>
<p>3. Can I not use D: drive to download upgrades or to be used for temporary storage during upgrades?</p>
<p>4. Do I have to make hardware upgrades from 16Gb C: drive to may be 32 GB?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows Defender as anti-virus, its definitions are updated and tablet is virus-free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Prakash, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first thing that you need to consider when upgrading from one Windows version to another is the system requirements including the hard disk space.
</span>For some devices like yours with either little free space available or smaller hard drives, it's normal that you may have little free space available after upgrading.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may free up disk space and easily delete files like temporary files or your previous version of Windows within the Storage system setting. In addition, you can only use the internal storage like the C: drive when upgrading.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're planning for a hardware upgrade, we suggest that you contact your device manufacturer. Manufacturer contact information can be found on the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/oemcontact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Information page</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know.</p>

<h2>            Starting a program ALSO starts windiws installer on three different programs</h2>
                    <p>I have three programs which, when activated, begin a tedious 3 minute or longer long series of Windows Installer "gathering information" like panes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually the program starts. But each time thereafter I go through the same process. These programs were "installed" and running about 6 months before this issue began. The original problem started with a program called satpc32.exe. One day after a week
 of use, that program also first started the win installer issue before it actually ran</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, two of the programs it talks to via DDE also need to go thru the long and boring windows installer panes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I noticed dozens pf "Restore Points" set up each time I start one of the affected programs. The Restore Points are setup by Installer. Yet if I cancel Installer immediately then the program finally runs.</p>
<p>I hae run every known FixIt about this from MS and still, the installer starts every time I start one of the programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other new programs since then have installed correctly and the installer does not subsequently run for them.</p>

</p><p>This MicroSoft FixIT snap-in Fails with error. That error tells me to check that I must make registry entry HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework]InstallRoot point to the .NET Framework install location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, it does point to Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a screenshot.&nbsp; However this forum does not take attachments.</p>

</p><p><strong>http://tinyurl.com/lezksgd </strong>may work to view it, I just made a temp acct</p>

</strong>
<p>you last , social technet ,&nbsp; link sends me back to previous non-working FixIt link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current issue then is tht I am unable to repair or fix the .NET data on the disk. That may or may not be the&nbsp; problem with Installer.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox One X shuts off During State of Decay 2</h2>
                    <p>This is weird because i have never had this problem before, and I have had the console since launch. I purchased State of Decay 2 on Release day, and when I go to the community tab the fans kick in hard. At first it would get pretty loud, so I would get out of that tab, but now if I go to that tab for 10 seconds my xbox just shuts off. Once i received a message saying t overheated, but I have proper ventilation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Normally I would just avoid this tab, but in co-op this is the only way to switch out characters when in someone else game. I stopped playing the game for fear of damage to the console. I wrote about this on reddit, and someone responded that they had the same problem, and they just so happen to be in a preview program. He submitted an error report, a week later he received a message saying  they found the Xbox was experiencing hardware failure and the box needed to be sent in.</p><p><br /></p><p>I really hope this isnt the case with mine.<br /></p>

    <title>USB Mass Storage and my video camera - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron v  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB  Mass Storage and my video camera</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp; I am hoping someone can help me.&nbsp; I have done the following, uninstalled the USB Mass Storage in Device Manager, using the view all hidden devices.&nbsp; I have deleted all the universal host controllers and had windows reinstall everything after rebooting.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is the problem.<br />
<br />
I have a video camera that uses USB to connect to the computer.&nbsp; I can plug it into any USB in the back of the computer and it will recognize it as a Canon Camera/USB Mass Storage Device and I can browse and copy files.<br />
<br />
However, when I plug it into any of the two USB ports in the front of my computer, it tries to install it as a Mass Storage Device (sometimes it will say video camera).&nbsp; After searching for drivers for 2-3 minutes, it will come back as failed (error code 10
 when I look at the description in detail).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The following is the maddening part:<br />
I can plug in my iphone to any of the front USB ports (bingo, works and syncs)<br />
I can plug in my regular canon digital still camera to the front USB ports and it works and I can browse files<br />
I can plug in my WD Passport Drive to the front USB ports and it works immediately and I can look at all files.<br />
<br />
IT GETS BETTER:<br />
<br />
I can plug in a USB HUB into any of the front two usb ports and it recognizes it IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; Then when I plug in my video camera to the HUB that is connected to the front USB ports, it RECOGNIZES THE DARN THING and WORKS.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I do not want/nor should I have to plug in a usb hub to the front usb just so I can use ONE electronic.&nbsp; It's ridiculous.&nbsp; I mean, the hub is plugged into the same front usb port that refuses to recognize the video camera!<br />
<br />
Any idea what is going on??? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            You are over thinking. Powered ports work better but also have limits. Forget the thinking and just always use
<br />
a Powered Hub for ALL your devices and its best you can do.<br />
<br />
If you totally figure it out the bottom line is to use Powered Hubs.<br />

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the info.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried all the above options and none seem to work. I am also struggling to find the bluetooth driver update for my computer, the dell inspiron M5030.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I try to add device the computer just continues to search and search not even recognising the device. No error messages appear.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Whilst researching I have read quite a lot of info about the Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator. Is this something that you think would help and do you know where I would find it?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is the security software installed in your system?</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Install the driver after downloading the driver, and reboot your system. Now, try adding the bluetooth device.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that does not work, try disabling the Anti-virus installed in your system and then try to add the bluetooth device.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>

    <title>Sound not working after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spinacho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound not working after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, so I just did the Windows 10 update (from Windows 8.1) and the sound stopped working. The computer pops a message when I try to play some audio file that says:</p>
<p>"We couldn't find your audio device -etc...", and I get error 0xc00d36fa.</p>
<p>I already tried running the troubleshooter for sounds, updating the drivers, and connecting headphones, but nothing seems to work, what should I do?</p>
<p>Thanks guys, hope to fix this or I'll have to go back to Windows 8.1. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to installing this update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Edit:</p>
<p>I entered the sound card settings, right clicked on the speakers and selected the "configure speakers" option. I clicked next a couple of times in the configuration panel (even though the Test Sound button didn't work), and after I finished the sound seems
 to be working perfectly. I hope that these instructions may serve someone who has the same problem. Good luck guys!</p>

<p>Is next generation is releaved of limitations that 360 has?</p>
<p>Thinking about no brightness, contrast, gamma and saturation settings to get perfect fit to display you are using.</p>
<p>With these few general setting I never got it right.</p>

<p>My simple DVD player has it all to adapt to any display device looking perfect.</p>
<p>I never quite got into playing 360 games because of it's limitations.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>That is a great question.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of things that the Xbox One must be able to do because of its ability to loop through video from a set top box and overlay graphics. Firstly, it must be able to genlock onto the incoming signal to match its exact timings. Secondly, it must
 accept a multitude of input resolutions. Thirdly, it must accept both YCbCr and RGB for input. It should have settings for output color space and resolution like the Xbox 360, and hopefully they'll work correctly.<br />
<br />
This means that they must do a much better job handling video output than they have with the Xbox 360. Or let's say, they have to do as good a job or better than they did initially with the Xbox 360. Before they botched its video output, it handled things correctly.
 The big problem was game developers using poorly calibrated TVs and monitors in development, working in environments that weren't light controlled, and not understanding the difference between sRGB and the piecewise linear gamma approximation used by the Xenos
 GPU.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to settings,&nbsp;the only thing that should be needed is an in-game or global gamma adjustment, and brightness. Everything else should&nbsp;follow spec. In YCbCr at 8 bits per channel, black is at code 16, white is at code 235 with "super white" being
 able to extend up to code 254. In full range RGB at 8 bits per channel, black is at code 0 and white is at code 255. There isn't any room for pumping up contrast or saturation without clipping. In xvYCC there is, but will that even be used by devs? I think
 they will stick with targeting 24-bit sRGB and having the Xbox One convert it to whatever the display expects.<br />
<br />
Adjustments for brightness, contrast and saturation would add on top of those of the display and potentially make things worse. The source component should follow spec, allow for the display to be calibrated to match those specs, and the content should be designed&nbsp;following
 those specs. Adjustments to compensate for deficiencies in the viewing environment should be fairly strategic. Valve are the only ones this generation who have&nbsp;done&nbsp;fairly correctly.<br />
<br />
In plain English: Many current games are too dark even if the settings are correct. It's because of developers, developers, developers, developers doing things wrong. If they don't, things should work.<br />
<br />
There's more though. Because of the analog sunset, the Xbox One doesn't have any analog AV output. Thus they don't have to worry about NTSC,&nbsp;YPbPr&nbsp;or&nbsp;VGA, only HDMI and HD. That might help both Microsoft and developers get things right.</p>

<p>Interesting comment, thank you.</p>
<p>But are we not hoping for too much - that all developers should calibrate in the same way.</p>
<p>Nobody expect film industry to do that - so DVD players have a couple of standard settings and then a custom to setting too if these fail.</p>
<p>A game console cannot expect to be the only source for a display device - but 360 really is made that way, as I see it.</p>
<p>What I would like to see is:</p>
<p>a) a built in test display with all nuances of gray - and color span as well maybe as televisions broadcasts had in the early years.</p>
<p>b) settings like in 360, and also a custom one to calibrate to test picture if none of standard settings work.</p>
<p>This would allow both developers and gamers have the same reference - everybody is happy.</p>
<p>As of now in 360 most games are too dark. This was also the case for all comparison tests I saw with PS3 - 360 were always darker.</p>
<p>If that happends for Xbox One - at least one could adjust that with the custom settings. With 360 you can do nothing - or change your TV settings every time you are about to play - result is not much gaming.</p>
<p>It's a mystery to me that a test image wasn't there from start to calibrate towards - so simple.</p>
<p>God forbid that Xbox One is assumed to be media center and rule your TV and not considered a gaming console anymore.</p>

<p>Personally I believe that only display devices should have picture controls. There is no reason for output devices to have them. In the case of gaming, consoles should output video adhering to a certain standard and games can implement their own controls
 on a per game basis.</p>

<p>It's alot "output devices should" and "developers should" etc.</p>
<p>We better be able to handle reality - not fiction.</p>
<p>So sitting there with a game with no ingame controls - and it's not according to standard - what do we do?</p>
<p>My tv has a built in DVB-T box and that governs what display settings need to be to look good.</p>
<p>Then XBox looks not fully as I expected - what do we do?</p>
<p>So there are plenty reasons to implement the customs controls - we do not live in utopia.</p>
<p>And it's simple to do as well - especially when designing new hardware - get the chips that blueray/dvd players use.</p>
<p>It can be done with a firmware update as well even on Xbox360.</p>

<p>You're right, things don't always work as they should. In my experience every single consumer level DVD/Blu-ray player I've used has output video properly according to the standard selected (RGB, YCbCr, full/video range, etc). It seems like the 360 is really
 the odd man out in not outputting a signal that adheres to a standard for displays to properly handle. Even the PS3/Wii/WiiU gets it right!</p>
<p>The idea that there should be picture controls on each device through the signal chain seems very redundant.</p>

<p>I think these controls are due to that theory is not reality.</p>
<p>I had a PS3, and also having DVD and TV as Sony I never had to adjust anything. I don't know if this is due to that Sony knows video very well - having created standards as Betamax etc very early on - or if that is due to that it is the same brand per se
 on the devices I have.</p>
<p>I don't know what good it will do sitting and whining over that Microsoft did not do it right, or developers did not no it right. Every device that can be considered not be the main device for the display should have custom setting for the ordinary controls.</p>
<p>Computers have both such adjustments for display and to printer as well if using color printer - for everything to turn out as expected both on screen as printed.</p>
<p>A gaming console cannot consider itself as main device. It's no buy of Xbox One for me if not having all the expected controls. I'm not doing the same mistake twice.</p>

<p>Sony probably does have more dedicated video techs involved in designing software and firmware. The update for the Xbox 360 which broke its handling of video levels back in the day&nbsp;seems like it was the result of having people inexperienced with video handling
 things based on API's already written.<br />
<br />
Color management in computers and printers is a necessity because of limitations in technology and differences between additive and subtractive reproduction. It's been a must have, whereas television has been the Wild West since the beginning.<br />
<br />
Reproduction gamma for instance is not standardized very well at all. Set-top boxes and tv's don't handle things correctly. This has become ever more apparent to me lately in designing a new test pattern for Swedish Television - in developing it&nbsp;we set out
 knowing standards were being followed very poorly, and came out realizing they were being followed even more poorly than we had imagined. Things such as set-top boxes converting&nbsp;the output&nbsp;to RGB and causing banding, instead of leaving it in YCbCr (SD to HD
 requires a color space conversion from BT.601 to BT.709, but it's a different story).<br />
<br />
I don't know what is going to happen with the Xbox One handling the output of a set-top box that flags its output incorrectly, or what additional deterioration could happen as it overlays graphics. But I'm dreading it could be a mess.<br />
<br />
And gamma is a big&nbsp;issue in itself.&nbsp;Control for gamma&nbsp;is certainly needed for game graphics, but what is reference display gamma? The EBU has tested professinal monitors (such as&nbsp;Sony's BVM range with Trinitron CRT's) and found that their display gamma roughly
 equals 2.35, and regards that as a target display gamma. This is undercompensated in cameras according to BT.709/BT.1847, with a the Opto-electric Transfer Function or OETF&nbsp;that&nbsp;roughly equals 0.51.<br />
<br />
The result is a system gamma - a difference in between display gamma and encoded gamma - by 1.2. This system gamma and display gamma assumptions are met by the OETF&nbsp;specified in BT.709/BT.1847.<br />
<br />
However, modern displays and other CRTs but the Trinitrons used in Sony's BVM range may have very different reproduction. Screens are bigger, we watch tv in brighter rooms, and people are divided on whether display gamma should be considered this or that. Some
 swear by 2.22, some swear by 2.35. I consider the latter to be more appropriate since that's what production monitors use, and compensation for the viewing environment should be done relative to that. But I'm far from an expert on gamma.<br />
<br />
So in essence, games must have a gamma control unless they're bright enough that variations in gamma are not a problem. Games with darker environments need a gamma control, and potentially a brightness control to compensate for the dip in the darkest shades
 on many displays.<br />
<br />
But unless developers adhere to standards,&nbsp;such controls may themselves turn out useless as they will&nbsp;alter gamma and brightness&nbsp;in&nbsp;a way that doesn't help.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Have you been working on Teracom or something?</p>
<p>A built in test pattern generator in xbox graphics engine would really be helpful. Developers could calbirate towards that - and us gamers as well. No browser or anything in between. It's there for both parties - producer and user.</p>
<p>Then the custom controls for brightness, contrast, gamma and color saturation, and I think there were a sharpness in my DVD player as well.</p>
<p>If meeting S:t Claus in person ability to possibly save a setting for every game - and nobody would ever have to be disappointed. At least one each for the different color formats. Mandatory from within each game - wow that would be something.</p>
<p>How far from christmas are we when released - not so far?</p>
