    <title>Transfer account balance money to family members. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valerieangell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer account balance money to family members.</h2>
                    <p>My children have accounts under my account (as family members). My two sons both received XBox gift cards for their birthdays. I added the gift cards to my account, which added the money to my account balance. I have $45 in my account and cannot transfer
 money to either child account -- instead, my only option is to add more money with a credit card. I do not understand why I cannot use the money added via their gift cards to add to their accounts. I've tried this before and the "account balance" option is
 always greyed out when trying to add funds to their accounts. Every time someone gives them a Microsoft gift card, I cringe...because it costs me the same amount of the card value out of my own pocket. Is there a way to transfer account balance money to family
 members???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>VA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also --&nbsp; find it odd that there is no category here for microsoft account. There is also no option for Microsoft account when attempting to use the Virtual Agent to eventually arrive at a human being.&nbsp;</p>

            Now even adding money, I can only do so to one child an not the other. When attempting to send money to the second child, I receive the error message: Check your sender name It contains a prohibited word. JFD-InvalidProperty. The sender name is not visible
 to me (I'm logged into my account and JUST sent money to one child (by buying more with my debit card)). The sender name should contain the same information when I send money to the second child. It fails repeatedly though.&nbsp;

            The problem is with my Microsoft family account -- I tried contacting Xbox support and they directed me here. Seems like I will be stuck in this endless loop. :/ I guess I should just put the word out: No XBox gift cards for my kids! Every time they get
 one, I have to spend the same amount in cash because Microsoft will let me redeem them only to the parent account and I cannot transfer the money to the kids. I guess, if you think about it, this is pretty clever of Microsoft. For every Xbox gift card they
 sell, the parents of the recipients have to shell out the same in cash. Double dipping at its finest. I suppose we should have bought a PlayStation instead :)&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Hey there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the run around </p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately, it isn't possible to transfer account balances to other accounts. If the gift card was for your children, then you wanted to redeem the code to their account. Make sure to sign in with their&nbsp;account, and then&nbsp;redeem the code. That would then
 add the funds to their account. If you had issues with that, then there may be a billing issue on the account or you have purchases turned off for the child account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have redeemed the code already what I would advise on doing is purchasing a game with has a gift from your account. Most games are available too buy has a gift in the Microsoft store.

            That's a system folder and shouldn't be renamed. I don't even know if you <em>
can</em> rename it, but if you try you might corrupt the operating system.

<div>The question is,&nbsp;</div>
<div>have a pre installed OEM license is a pre requisite?</div>
<div>or just applying the product key (MUU-00005) to a wiped device and then activate is sufficent?</div>

            I fixed this problem by logging into my child's account and setting up personal information like the age.&nbsp; Once I set the age, it registered it as a child account, let me log into my account and then automatically joined them into the family account.

            You can try reinstalling Quickbooks 2013, but I should let you know, Quickbooks 2013 is not certified compatible with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Its probably better to rollback if using Quickbooks 2013 is important.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

            Let's see if I can cut through this.<br />
<br />
You wrote:<br />

Is the box to "Use Windows to configure my wireless network settings" checked or unchecked? There is no such box.
<br />
<br />
I have connect using - it says belkin. another box saying this connection uses the following items. then underneath there are 3 tabs - install, uninstall and properties. if i press properties it says name service provider and in that box it says windows locator.&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
It seems that you did not click the "Wireless Networks" tab after you opened the Properties for your wireless adapter.&nbsp; From your description, you are looking at the "General" tab:&nbsp; click
<a href="http://screenshots.modemhelp.net/screenshots/Windows_XP/Network_Connections/Wireless_Network_Connection/Properties/General/Index--1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a> to see the "General" tab; click <a href="http://screenshots.modemhelp.net/screenshots/Windows_XP/Network_Connections/Wireless_Network_Connection/Properties/Wireless_Networks/Index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a> to see the "Wireless Networks" tab.<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>There are 5 columns: name, description status, start up type, and Log On As.&nbsp; The values for the last 3 columns should be Started, Automatic, and Local System - on my screen there are 4 tabs at the top - general, log on, recovery
 and dependencies. <br />
</blockquote>
<br />
You skipped a step ... the 5 columns are in the initial "Services" window ... you get to the "4 tabs at the top"
<br />
<blockquote>service status which has 4 boxes start. stop pause and resume. the button highlighted in start
</blockquote>
<br />
Just to the right of the words "Service status" you should see a word.&nbsp; On your system, that word probably is "stopped."&nbsp; The 4 buttons (boxes) are how you control the service.&nbsp; Because you said that the highlighted button is "start" that means that the service
 is currently stopped, and you need to click that "start" button in order to start it.<br />
<br />
I strongly suspect that you had been using the Belkin utility to control your adapter -- and now you have also started WZC.&nbsp; As I wrote earlier, you can't have both running at once.<br />
<br />
When you click on your "Belkin icon," do you get a screen that looks something like this:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/img/2006/belkinn1/08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/img/2006/belkinn1/08.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If so, you need to go back to the Services utility and "Stop" the WZC service.&nbsp; Or, if you want to use WZC
http://en-us-support.belkin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/40/related/1</a><br />
<br />
I'm not familiar with the Belkin Wireless Networking Utility, but many wifi manufacturer utilities can be used to switch your wifi on and off, so perhaps yours has been turned off (the adapter in your computer -- not the router).&nbsp; If you identify the model
 of the adapter you have in your main computer, I'll see if I can find the User Manual on the Belkin site, and perhaps give you a bit more information.<br />

                    I have been having problems with the mouse during this game.&nbsp; It seems to slow the mouse down quite often and also often while moving a piece, the pointer lags behind and transfers and drags the main puzzle or some other piece instead.&nbsp; Anyone else have
 this problem (I am on windows 10)

            Hi Arham.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The message can mean that a Volume License Key was used to activate Windows, which is only used by large business and organizations and require reactivating by their IT dept regularly.  
<br />
<br />What does it say at the top of the page at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Activation about the version you're running and Activation.  If it's Enterprise it must be reinstalled to a consumer version and activated with a retail key.  If it's Pro version it needs reactivating with a retail Windows key.  
<br />
<br />You can also still get the free Windows 10 Upgrade of a Clean Install by activating with any retail Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key.  You may need to clear out the VLK first by installing the Generic Version Key from <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>, or by running from an elevated Command Prompt slngr -upk.  Then install the retail key. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Home or Pro versions follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />If you buy a key be sure to buy only from large retailers who back their purchases, or directly from Microsoft here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Give this a try:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: slmgr.vbs /rearm
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Exit, restart then check if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not
<br />
<br />Enter the Windows 10 Home/Pro default key. (see list below)
<br />
<br />     Win 10 Home: YTMG3-N6DKC-DKB77-7M9GH-8HVX7
<br />     Win 10 Pro: VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T
<br />     Win 10 Home Single Language: BT79Q-G7N6G-PGBYW-4YWX6-6F4BT
<br />
<br />Warning: please ensure you use the right product key for the right edition.
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />he copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core will install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro will install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />To find out if you have the right edition installed:
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Edition.
<br />
<br />
<br />More information:
<br />
<br />I notice some of these errors are occurring in mostly on computers running Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions. Both Pro and Enterprise are licensed to large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Volume License clients such as Pro and Enterprise (as they are technically known), can also use different methods of activation. 
<br />
<br />For mass activation, KMS licensing (Key Management Server) provides centralized management of activation requests for each client. This is also used to handle activation because KMS clients are not setup for permanent activation, since they expire every 180 days (6 months). This requires client computers to maintain in contact with organization server in order not go into reduced functional mode and result in errors like the above.
<br />
<br /> Overall, this reduces piracy of organization keys that was common in the past and also gives organization the right to reassign licenses easily. The problem is, organizations will sometimes list their organization keys on their websites for employees to copy to upgrade their clients to a organization supported edition. In fact, Microsoft even publicly list these activation keys where anyone can find and use. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj612867.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj6...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />So, this can occur depending on how Windows 10 was setup on your computer.
<br />
<br />    If you took your computer to a repair shop, they might have installed a non-genuine Windows 10 license. Either the repair technician didn't know which edition originally came preinstalled or made an assumption; or installed a copy that bypasses Windows 10 activation technologies.
<br />
<br />    You copied a Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise key off the Internet (usually a volume license - organization key) and changed on a Windows 10 Home or another edition. Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise are not free. If this is what you did, you will need to reinstall the previous edition or version you were running. You inadvertently installed the wrong edition.
<br />
<br />    The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from should often correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />     Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core will install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro will install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br /> To find out if you have the right edition installed:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Edition.
<br />
<br /> If the edition of Windows 10 installed does not correspond with the edition of Windows 7 or Windows 8 you were previously running, then you need to reinstall the right edition.
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Home Edition also Reports Organization Activation Service
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Home is not immune from the organization key errors too.
<br />
<br />The error can occur for a number of reasons. It is possible, the OEM vendor might have used a OEM volume key to mass activate each machine imaged at the factory with Windows 10 Home. Users can try recovering the OEM Marker key embedded in the motherboard then use it to update the product key values.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10, try chat support:

<h2>            Hoping FM4 isn&#39;t too easy.</h2>
                    
<p>I deleted my career and restarted FM3 probably 6-7 times. I know "Sunday driving" has been said a thousand times, but it fits. I'll be playing the game, I love to race. I'm just hoping for some heart pounding, adrenaline packed racing... not joyriding. This
 is a racing game at it's heart. I wanna race like it's the BTCC! "Black flag that guy, excessive use of the course".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S2U went too far with the AI's aggressiveness. However, the game is exciting and you actually have to tune a car to perform well. Any thoughts are welcome.</p>

<h2>            How can I convert genuine 32 bit windows 7 to 64-bit windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I bought lenovo laptop with genuine windows 7 last 6 months before, but at the time of purchase i didn't know that it wasn't a 64 bit OS. Later i knew that it is 32 bit operating system. My&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;is intel i5&nbsp;processor&nbsp;with 4GB RAM. Due to 32 bit
 OS i am unable to use full RAM (Usable RAM is 2.99 GB).<br />
Is there any to change the 32 bit windows 7 OS to 64 bit windows 7 OS.
<div><br />

<div>Please let me know if this is possible. Waiting for your reply.</div>

            <p>You will need to contact Lenovo and request a 64 bit recovery disc set, they might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>If Lenovo is unable to provide a 64 bit recovery disc set, you will just have to purchase a retail upgrade license and use that.</p>

<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
</p>
<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 shut down if Audio Device is enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nebula64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 shut down if Audio Device is enabled</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS K52F with 64-bit Windows 7. I didn't buy the laptop myself, it's a used one that I was given after the previous owner got a new one, I've had it and used without any issues for a few months now. There was one thing about it that was upsetting,
 the internal mic didn't work, I assumed that perhaps there wasn't one at all, but then a day or two ago I found out it was simply disabled, I enabled the mic, everything worked fine, shut down the computer for the day. Today I turned it on, everything went
 as usual, choosing the user, loading windows... but then after that, the screen went black with just the mouse icon on it and eventually a few pop ups about certain things not working. I entered Safe Mode, tried recovering, that didn't help. After some time
 of trying to figure the situation out I remembered the only change that was recently made, enabling the mic. I disabled the Audio Device while in Safe Mode, restarted into normal and Windows functioned normally, except, well, there was no sound. If I enable
 Audio, same thing happens all over again, it freezes, eventually shuts down or restarts. If I enable playback but disable recording it still goes wrong. Only with Audio disabled Windows works properly. I've had no issues with this before. Is there something
 I could do about this myself or should I take the laptop to a specialist?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incompatible audio device drivers are known to operate against the method that Windows follows. First, uninstall the audio driver, then follow these steps to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the name of your PC at the top of the list of devices in <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Select <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> to reinstall the device driver, or download and install the latest version from the manufacturer’s website.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer to the steps provided on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15048/windows-7-update-driver-hardware-not-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how you can update your device driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we may need to do further investigation to identify the cause of the issue and to come up with the appropriate resolution. A screenshot of the black screen error message will be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop.</p>

<p>The good part is you know how to "fix" it when it is afflicted so you can get going again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing you want to do is get hardware driver (video, audio, network, printer, etc.) updates from Microsoft or Windows Update.&nbsp; Microsoft is notorious for sending wrong or incompatible drivers and that could be how the system became afflicted in the
 first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might help to know more about the "few pop ups about certain things not working" like what the messages say about those certain things whatever they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you do this so we can see what you have - there will be three things to paste back in your next reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>lick the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This seems to be the link on the ASUS Support site for drivers for your model:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before updating any drivers make a manual System Restore point so if something goes wrong or things get worse you can undo the adjustment.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello, thanks for the answer. So to update on the situation, I tried what the previous person had suggested. Removing then reinstalling a new driver. I tried different options, I let Windows find one automatically, then I tried both of the ones provided
 by ASUS. Letting Windows choose results in getting the same one as I originally had. With the ones from ASUS no error messages appear, however, it freezes just the same as before. I guess I might've rushed a bit with the installations based on your message,
 but it is as it is. I'm including the information from msinfo32.exe</p>

</p><p>I wasn't able to trigger the error messages that appeared at first. I did take a photo of one of them, but there were atleast 2 different ones.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a20455d9-291e-477d-8c72-7e21af402704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a20455d9-291e-477d-8c72-7e21af402704" /></a></p>
