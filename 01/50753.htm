<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade caused boot time to go to 20 minutes</h2>
                    <p>This problem is with&nbsp;Windows 10 (not 8, not 7, not Vista). After upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7, which Microsoft said was good to do, boot time has gone from a minute or two to over twenty&nbsp;minutes. Microsoft caused this problem. Microsoft needs to
 fix it. Now. </p>

            <p>My suggestion is to restore using the full system image backup you made (in addition to your normal backups) right before you did something as extreme as changing the entire base operating system that allows you to communicate with the hardware in and connected
 to the computer as well as use the software installed on the system. &nbsp;This will be the cleanest way to get back to working order. &nbsp;You seemingly have claimed and activated Windows 10 now - so it is yours forever on that system - you can try again later once
 you investigate more for compatibility issues and driver updates, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something happened to your backup, you could try this:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Beyond that - attempt to figure out what is causing the delays on your specific system. &nbsp;Sounds like possible hardware device drivers (shooting from the hip) and you may be able to remedy it by locating and installing the Windows 10 approved ones from the
 manufacturer(s) of such.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, I didn't know about restoring a full system image backup so I just went ahead and installed Windows 10.
<br />
I am VERY UNSATISFIED With it! Like the other person, it takes forever to boot up and freezes up a lot.<br />
I also can no longer access my FreeCell card game which really makes me angry!!!</p>
<p>Doesn't let me get into the internet easily either.</p>
<p><br />
Very difficult to get any help for anything .. at least, I can't find any place to get help like you could with previous versions of Windows which I didn't like either. Take me back to 0 &amp; 1 &amp; let me decide where to put things on my computer!!!!!</p>

            <p>You mean you didn't know about backups? &nbsp;Fairly operating system agnostic mechanism that helps restore one from unwanted situations (data loss, operating system changes, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given you definitively (by your own admission) do not have a good set of backups to restore stuff from in case something (anything) goes wrong - you can try the method I gave to rollback your system to the previous OS. &nbsp;Note that in the linked instructions
 - they suggest (for safety and such) you make a backup of current state of the system as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unsure what you mean by, "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can't find any place to get help like you could with previous versions of Windows." --&gt; can you give some specific examples/describe what you are missing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As for, "...&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">with previous versions of Windows which I didn't like either. ..." --&gt; then, might I ask, why are you bothering to run Windows
 at all?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Truly - rollback and see if your issues go away...</span></p>

            Still unresolved on my Sony VPCF1. Boot up time is 20 minutes. I even resorted to paid Microsoft support and after several hours and days, they concluded that the first Intel 7 processors, or at least the one in my machine, can't handle Windows 10 boots
 in a timely manor, sorry. Mine doesn't crash and works fine after boot up, so I use Sleep a lot.&nbsp;

            <p>My first upgrade to Windows 10 was my old laptop, with the same gen CPU as yours, only at a lower clock speed. &nbsp;It booted just fine. &nbsp;That's such a cop-out answer from Microsoft. &nbsp; I have a Windows 10 Tablet, that is far slower then my desktop and it boots
 in 12 seconds. &nbsp;I've upgraded many machines to Windows 10 that all work fine. &nbsp;The one that takes 25 minutes to boot has by far the fastest hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has to be hanging and timing out on something. &nbsp;I just don't know what that is. &nbsp;I was hoping that somebody else had figured it out by now.</p>

                    Ok listen, this is a repeat offense by windows update to "install" updates for an hour, reach 99% then claim its rolling back updates for over 2 hours. This has happened multiple times and I've had to completely reinstall windows to fix it. I cannot access
 the desktop, safe mode never worked, and I do not want to reinstall. This is windows 8.1. Please help me someone.&nbsp;

            <p>Set it up so it authenticates when sending the email just like it does when receiving - likely like the instructions for your Email Service Provider instruct you to do.</p>
<p>You even quoted a web page in the error that you could have used as a starting point.&nbsp; I used it, then did a search for "email" and went to this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB401570&amp;cv=803&amp;title=Email+server+settings+(POP+and+SMTP)#fbid=7A2eRsYcC99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB401570&amp;cv=803&amp;title=Email+server+settings+(POP+and+SMTP)#fbid=7A2eRsYcC99</a></p>
<p>Which shows that your inbound server is 'wrong' at this point (although may still work thanks to them forwarding it, etc.)<br />
"<strong>Note:</strong> AT&amp;T's POP/SMTP settings have recently changed to <strong>
inbound.att.net</strong> and <strong>outbound.att.net</strong>. However, if you are using the old settings, they will continue to work."</p>
<p>Assuming (because I have no choice other than asking and waiting at this point) that you are using Outlook Express (you are using Windows XP, the only mail client that _comes with_ XP is Outlook Express), you may want to look at these instructions:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB401573#fbid=7A2eRsYcC99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB401573#fbid=7A2eRsYcC99</a>&nbsp; (particularly steps 16 and on...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Backup drive stuck at 100&#37; active time but 0 transfers when trying to back up files with File History &#40;Solved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to set up and run File History the first time. The drive I want to use for the backup is in a USB dock (shown in device manager as USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Mass Storage Controller). The drive has enough space left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the backup, it seems to start out normally for a few seconds, then the backup drive shows 100% active time but both read and write speed are 0. At this point, I cannot read files from the drive either - it becomes unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same setup worked with my previous computer, which also used Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I have found the problem. The files I wanted to back up included a cracked game. I assume the anti virus (Windows Defender in this case) took issue with this. The drive also locked up if I tried to copy the game manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the game files which solved the problem. Presumably, the problem could also be solved by turning off the anti virus if one really needed to copy such a file.</p>

    <title>How to spend &#36; converted from points when... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laconic bomb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to spend &#36; converted from points when...</h2>
                    
<p>How do I use up the remaining money in my account (which has been converted from Microsoft Points) when what I want to buy costs more than the amount I have?<br />
<br />
After the update yesterday, I have $1.32 in my account (previously 60 points).<br />
<br />
I want to buy the "Mass Effect 3 Firefight Pack" DLC which costs $1.99.<br />
<br />
I want to use up my remaining $1.32 credit so that I will no longer have to deal with the annoyance of odd amounts of funds left over after every transaction as it has always been with the points system.<br />
<br />
But I have a suspicion that the payment system has been designed to prevent me from doing this.</p>
<p>At the checkout, payment method is set to PayPal.<br />
<br />
In the "Change Payment Option" menu, "Microsoft Account: $1.32" is greyed out (non selectable). I presume this is because there isn't enough in it to make the purchase outright with existing funds.<br />
<br />
If I go ahead and make the purchase, will the $1.32 already in my account be used, with only the 67c remainder charged to PayPal?<br />
<br />
OR, are the funds in my account locked from ever being used unless what I am buying is conveniently equal to or less than $1.32 in value? (i.e. 60 points). Because that is probably never going to happen. There has never been any content worth buying at 60 points,
 and I'm not an idiot who wastes hard earned $ buying stupid doll clothes for some stupid avatar.<br />
<br />
Answer please.</p>

<p>It works the same as with the points system. You can't make a partial payment. You would have to add more currency to be able to make the purchase.</p>

<p>For now, the only way I can see is by adding a prepaid card. They haven't fully updated the website to work with currency and even on the console I couldn't find a way to directly purchase currency.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind, that just like the points system, you won't be able to just purchase 67c. You'll only be able to purchase the set amounts that they provide.</p>

<p>Actually, I take my answer back. I had read something before that said you couldn't split payment, but it looks like you actually can. Sorry about that. Although, I can't find any specifics on how it works.

<p>Yes, when your local currency balance is not sufficient to pay for the content, you can charge the remainder to your credit card.</p>

<p>Thanks, that sounds like it will be an addressable problem. Not yet though unfortunately.</p>
<p>I just bought the DLC to see if the split method worked and it didn't. It all went on the card and I still have the $1.32 balance remaining. There are 2 more DLCs I'll be buying in the future so assuming the split pay method is enacted by then it'll be OK.</p>
<p>Though an official word from a support team member as to why the "Points Retire FAQ" is telling us we can do something a certain way when we clearly cannot yet would be appreciated. As it stands right now "you can split payment" is - technically - a lie.</p>

<p>When you bought the map pack or whatever you did, did you have to go to Change Payment Method and select the Microsoft account or did it just do it for you? IO'm having this same problem. Does it show the difference on the Confirm purchase screen or does
 it show you the balance between the two?</p>

            Hi Bryan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For USB drive not detected issue, first try steps here:  <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-recognized-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay, see if the Device is listed.  From it's dropdown menu change it to what you want it to do when plugged in.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br /> Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi. BryanHenson1
<br />
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />	To help you a little more with this bug, what kind of error it shows as information since what you indicate may be that a corrupted or malicious file damages your USB flash drive.
<br />
<br />	In the same way, you can use the error checking tool, this tool integrated in the Windows system to check and correct errors of the device.
<br />
<br />	If you have access problems on your hard drive, USB, SD card or file folders, you can follow the steps below to correct the "Access Denied" error on your device now:
<br />
<br />1. Connect an inaccessible device, such as a hard drive, an external hard drive, an SD card or USB with a PC;
<br />
<br />2. Open this computer&gt; Right-click on the file folder or your inaccessible device and select Properties;
<br />
<br />3. Select Tools&gt; Click Check&gt; Browse drive.
<br />
<br />	If your problem is already resolved, you can access your device and directly open the unit.
<br />
<br />	Another option is to obtain permissions to Hard Disk, USB, SD Card or Inaccessible File Folders:
<br />
<br />1. Right click on the hard drive, USB, Micro sd or file folder and select Properties;
<br />
<br />2. Go to Security&gt; Edit;
<br />
<br />3. When opening a new window, click on your user name in Group or user names;
<br />
<br />4. Check all the boxes in the Allow column and click OK, and then click Apply to obtain permissions and access your inaccessible device.
<br />
<br />	If these two quick repairs still do not help you, relax!
<br />
<br />	We offer you 2 options and you can choose one according to your own case.
<br />
<br />1. If you have important data on this device, you can try Method 1 below to solve this problem without losing any of your data;
<br />
<br />2. If the data is useless, try Method 2 to fix 'Access Denied' error of your storage device (such as USB, sd card, internal or external hard disk) or file folders through formatting.

            Both methods did not help me, the problems still exist. My problem is with the Sider Solitaire game only. The game is totally useless to me. I do not want the four suit game. I want my one suit game back. I have made no changes to the computer since purchasing
 it a&nbsp;several months ago. I have followed all of your recommended advice to no avail. The problem began when I was playing a Spider game in the Daily Challenges which gave me a four suit game. Today's Daily Challenge gave me a one suit game which I was unable
 to complete because I could not draw from the stock pile after I had made all my moves. It was inoperable. Further I cannot get the unfinished four suit game off of the collection. When this problem occurred, the one suit game was working fine for me. What
 else do you suggest? I do not want to uninstall the app and loose the games I have won already with the other solitaire games which are running just fine unless there is a way to uninstall just the Spider game and reinstall it.

            Hi ttasneem08,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Is this a laptop or a desktop?<br />
What version of Vista are you using?<br />
Are you using a wireless keyboard/mouse?<br />
Are the batteries fresh?<br />
Is there something in the room that might be creating radio interferance with the wireless keyboard/mouse setup (like a wireless router)?<br />
<br />
If wired, have you gone to the manufacturers website and checked for updaed drivers?<br />
Have you tried to use a different mouse on this computer to make sure the mouse isn't defective?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />If its an external web cam and you have it plugged into a USB Hub, that will not work. You need to plug your web cam directly into the USB port on your system unit. USB hubs are not necessarily powerful enough to power devices like web cams. 
<br />
<br />Option 1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or right-click empty space on the toolbar.
<br />Open “Task Manager” and go to the “Processes” tab.
<br />Carefully analyze what programs are currently running in the background of the system.
<br />If you found an app that uses Camera, for example, Skype running in the background, click it, and select “End Task.”
<br />
<br />Option 2. Try a Clean Boot
<br />Click “Windows key” and type msconfig.
<br />Click “System Configuration” and open “Services” tab.
<br />Mark “Hide all Microsoft services” box and select “Disable all.”
<br />Open “Startup” tab and click “Open Task Manager.”
<br />Click on each startup item and select “Disable.”
<br />Close Task Manager and click “OK” on the System Configuration window.
<br />Reboot the system.
<br />
<br />If Clean Boot helped to fix error, we would recommend you to enable apps one by one. After each enabled app, check if the Camera is working. This way, you will isolate the problematic application.

<p>Hi Sameen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having multiple desktops allows you to organize your tools and applications in Windows 10. Based on the information that you've provided, may we if you're using keyboard shortcuts to close your applications or windows on the second desktop. If yes, which
 keyboard shortcuts are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not using any keyboard shortcuts, then this issue could be due to software conflicts on Windows which demonstrates this unusual behavior. Were there any changes made prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the concern, we suggest that you perform a clean boot to eliminate the software conflicts. You can follow the steps provided
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps, refer to the section, <em>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</em>. Check if the issue will persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. </p>

<h3> displayname13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu broken&#59; Programs missing in search</h2>
                    <p>For weeks I'm having the problem that my Start Menu doesn't show all programs. The shortcuts are in the Start Menu, but not showing up in search.</p>
<p>I studied a lot of questions here and elsewhere and NONE of the advices are working.</p>
<p>- It doesn't depend on where the shortcut is located (ProgramData/.../Start Menu&nbsp; ||&nbsp; [user]/AppData/.../Start Menu)</p>
<p>- I've tried to rebuild the index several times</p>
<p>- I have the impression now that Windows doesn't add new programs to the search index</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried to validate that last point by installing Notepad++ and it didn't show up in search. Plus all programs I could think off to have them installed since the problem occurs and the search can't find any of them. Then I uninstalled Adobe Reader
 and it still shows up in search, but there is no shortcut anymore!</p>
<p>After restarting my PC it said indexing is turned off. After several minutes it reports "Indexing complete" again...</p>
<p>So I'm not 100% sure it's newly installed programs, but it surely looks like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what the problem could be and I'm starting to become really angry about Windows... How can it be that such problems still occur after years?! I'd be really thankful if Microsoft decided to delay the next big version update and just fixed all
 of the damn bugs it's still having....!!</p>

<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved. 
<br />
<br />Try to add your secondary drive in the indexing options.
<br />
<br />Type in the Indexing options in the start search box and click on Indexing options from the search bar results.
<br />
<br />Click on Modify on the Indexing options window. (Enter
<br />
<br />Check the secondary drive (which you need to fetch the results from the search box) and click on OK button. (If the secondary drive is not visible, click on Show all locations, enter the administrator credentials if prompted))
<br />
<br />Now, try to search and check if you are able to fetch the results.
<br />
<br />Also make sure you take ownership of all the folders on the second drive.
<br />
<br />Restart then it should hopefully start working. 
<br />
<br />If none of the above work, perform a repair upgrade:

<p>I tried the troubleshooter in the past, didn't work. But tried it again, still doesn't.</p>
<p>I have installed all available updates and restarted it several times, doesn't help. Resetting my PC would be my last resort, don't want to do that just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also already tried the repair with dism and sfc; says the PC is doing fine.</p>
<p>Creating a new local admin doesn't help too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will adding the second drive to the search index solve the problem? All the shortcuts are in the two folders I've listed above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I tried to create a local admin a while ago and make my user that's connected to a Microsoft account a normal account without admin rights, but then I couldnt log in to that account anymore. I
<em>think</em> the search problem existed before, but I'm not 100% sure about this or if it's connected to the problem.</p>
<p>Is it possible to set my Microsoft account to a normal account and have a separate admin account for administrative tasks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>second edit: I have another local account on that machine and the search for that account works perfectly. So I'm going to save my files and create a new account like suggested in the link provided by Sumit Dhiman2. Hope that works.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release significantly flawed. Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade loses functionality.

<h2>            Uninstalling the NEW &#34;NEW&#34; Skype.  DONE.</h2>
                    <p>Done.&nbsp; Loaded the Android app.&nbsp; NOT that that is the answer, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "NEW" "NEW" Skype is above and beyond the ABSOLUTE WORST Skype foisted on us in DECADES.&nbsp; PERIOD.&nbsp; FULL STOP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(TECH at the BOTTOM, RANT at the TOP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>NONE of the updates since Summer have done ANYTHING, (NOTHING!), to restore the functionality of the "OLD" Skype.&nbsp; Prettier, more "Facebook" and "BOT" and "GAME" friendly, yes.&nbsp; You know, CRAP that doesn't matter ONE IOTA to those of us who have been using
 Skype as a COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM for TWENTY YEARS, (I guess younger folks NEED to have EVERYTHING in their LIVES path thru F/Book, else they're LOST), but, ADULTS don't NEED that stuff.&nbsp; But, what the heck...WE are the ones PAYING THE BILLS at Skype.&nbsp; Sort
 of the way things work ALL over, these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the PRETTY and "interactive" NEW SKYPE can work with F/book and BOTS and GAMES.&nbsp; Sure is PRETTY!&nbsp; Okay, so it now has FIVE PROCESSES that SLAM ALL FOUR cores of my processor, (remember, old folks, the way it used to suck up RAM with only TWO processes?&nbsp;
 Not anymore!), RAM is at 3% but my CPU is SLAMMING the needle and the FAN is ROCKIN'!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT in the HOLY HECK is going on at Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>M/S MUST be wanting to sell it off at a SOG to intro some OTHER PLATFORM that they want us all TO BUY, (even those of us who have paid for SKYPE for YEARS and have already paid for MANY MONTHS in ADVANCE...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a proponent and a defender of Skype for YEARS.&nbsp; DECADES, even.&nbsp; NO MORE.&nbsp; DONE.&nbsp; OVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be porting my number as quickly as I POSSIBLY CAN.&nbsp; The very first opportunity I get.&nbsp; Sorry, Skype.&nbsp; Sorry, M/S.&nbsp; A DEVOTED USER since W-3, I QUIT!</p>

<p><span>I appreciate you for using Skype for quite some time now. I’m glad to know that Skype has been part of your daily life. Reading your feedback

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know that you do not like the new Skype app, and its new features. I totally respect that. No worries, I’ll take note of your feedback and let
 our developers know about your thought. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.</span></p>

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll tell you the same thing I told Julia...none of this is aimed specifically at you.&nbsp; But you'll forgive me for not having any, (ANY?&nbsp; Hmm...need a stronger word...), confidence in what will happen after you pass this on.&nbsp; Except, well,
<em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmmm...what's wrong...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not an APP.&nbsp; It's a PROGRAM.&nbsp; Well, at least it used to be.&nbsp; Some time ago in Windows pre- v.4 we ran into some snags at the program level.&nbsp; Every patch that came down to fix those snags created other snags.&nbsp; It was vicious!&nbsp; But we got through it.&nbsp;
 I was on board both in the Windows and Linux forums.&nbsp; (my Lx username was revloum and my windows is different).&nbsp; When the sale of Skype to MS came about, the uproar from the Lx community was deafening!&nbsp; (THE same community that clamored for the changes you
 just made)&nbsp; So you catered to all their anti-Redmond vitriol for an APP.&nbsp; With "shiny things".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't work.&nbsp; It's a WRECK.&nbsp; You made their dreams come true about MS ruining Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>GONE are the vast majority of controls.&nbsp; The out-bound voicemail greeting.&nbsp; The voicemail notifications.&nbsp; Look, ALL you need to do is peruse the commentary here by so many others.&nbsp; Follow my previous posts.&nbsp; You did add, though, enough changes from program-to-app
 to make processors scream in pain and smart-fans howl like the mythical banshee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all this isn't bad enough, forcing an end of service with such little notice and then forcing a version that
<em>SHOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE TESTING BENCH</em>, as well as pretty much demanding that people refit their equipment, (32 to 64-bit), like I said before - read almost any thread in which I'm a participant. Well, except the immediately post MS Lx versions.&nbsp;
 In those I defended both Skype and MS as vehemently as I knew how.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; Not so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not in a position, yet, to totally uninstall the W-version, as&nbsp;<em>IT IS MY PHONE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As far as mobile, I am opting for other clients.&nbsp; In Linux, well, I give up.&nbsp; Let the freebie kids have it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.&nbsp; I'll check in from time to time just to see if, by some stoke of the hand of G-d they get their "stuff" together.&nbsp; Maybe you can then welcome me back into the fold.</p>

<h2>            Probleme mit Gold Family Pack</h2>
                    
<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p>
<p>leider ist es seit Wochen nicht möglich ein Gold Family Paket ab zu schliessen.</p>
<p>Auf der Konsole erscheint "Kann nicht mit einer Kreditkarte gekauft werden" und online im Web "Das hätte nicht passieren dürfen". Nach zwei Anrufen bei der Hotline war immer von Umstellungen des Zahlungssystem die Rede. Erst zwei Tage warten, dann ab dem
 31.Mai geht alles wieder.</p>
<p>Es ist erstaunlich, dass Microsoft mein Geld nicht haben möchte ;-) Ich möchte jetzt keine Punkte kaufen und dann geht es doch nicht ;-(</p>

 the new Intel 23.5.2 drivers that&nbsp;require the use of POWERSHELL to implement teaming as Microsoft is removed the Windows interface properties in 1809.<br />
<br />
This brings me onto the issue in my question is it now seems that the windows properties&nbsp;interface implementation of wake-up on LAN&nbsp;now seems to not work&nbsp;as it did previously on 1803 with the same BIOS configuration and standard setup as before like disabling
 fast start-up in the power options et cetera.<br />
<br />
I would be grateful if somebody could confirm that they've got it working on their motherboard with our without an Intel NIC's in Windows build 1809, and if so how?
<br />
<br />
MSI support recommend going to a older Intel driver that is not supported in Windows 1809 and would require me roll them back to 1803. Also Intel support has also not been helpful as they also require me to also roll back to the earlier version of Windows and
 the older MSI Intel drivers which is no solution at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total qualify this doesn't seem to be my implementation as I followed the steps I previously used that worked but it seems to be that Microsoft and Intel haven't coordinated the testing of this functionality which was also the case with the&nbsp;teaming issue
 that required them to bring out a new 23.5.2 driver that you can read about in this Intel

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The feature completely depends on the device hardware and the drivers. As the MSI suggests going to an older version of Intel driver, which is not supported with Windows 10 version 1809, I would suggest
 to install the driver in compatibility mode and see if it works., </span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest to check if wake up on LAN is enabled in BIOS. Kindly refer to the following article.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also want to get in touch with Intel to have a check if the new device driver (update) supports the feature on Windows 10 1809.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8ee7c678-dc4f-4d6f-b903-e2146a4a959a" title="Peer_Sam">Peer_Sam</a><br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestion and I will continue to prompt MSI the release and up to date version their network current drivers as I feel this is the only solution that will allow me to keep the functionality of NIC bonding in a teaming scenario as I believe
 Microsoft has removed this functionality in Windows 10 1809 requiring MSI to implement a powershell solution.<br />
As this is the priority above wake-up on LAN I would rather leave things as they are as I'm pretty sure the compatibility mode would not solve the teaming issue but it might solve the wake-up on LAN issue.</p>
<p>What makes this even more frustrating is that Intel have confirmed that there latest network drivers, being generic, may not have the wake-up on LAN functionality I need so I have to wait for MSI to update their drivers.</p>
<p>All in all nearly 6 months after Windows 10 1809 build release a lot of third-party don't seem to have been ready for its implementation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thanks for your speed reply this</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. You can imagine my amusement as I realise that you had linked to my MSI thread,&nbsp;I was the original OP that started that thread so you can see I've been dealing with this issue over many builds of Windows 10.</p>

            A &nbsp;post 1/2019&nbsp; 1803&nbsp;(and beyond)&nbsp;update broke Wake On Lan on all 88 of our network workstations of varying makes.<br />
<br />
With 1803 and before, we had no issues using WOL even if the machine was fully shut down by the user. As long as there were no power outages WOL would bring all of our units ouf of full shutdowns.<br />
<br />
Now the magic packets are being received by the workstations but they are not woken by those packets.<br />
<br />
And yes, Fast Boot is disabled, PME is enabled, etc. etc. etc....<br />
<br />
It is not a BIOS, Driver, Setting or Network issue. The problem is with Windows 10.<br />
<br />
These machines are all using the native NIC drivers provided in the Windows 10 release which has a fairly old date as issued by Microsoft. Updated Intel NIC drivers for Windows 10 are not available from Intel's site.<br />
<br />
The issue also occurs with non Intel Nics.<br />
<br />
If I install WIN 10 1803 and only apply updates issued up to about 12/2018 or so, those same machines will work properly. I have been unable to find the single offending update.<br />

<p>Hi Optical10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if you've been able to resolve this yet but I've recently had a similar issue with a windows 10 tablet not wanting to WOL post update with and Intel I211 NIC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you've done, I've been though my BIOS settings with a fine tooth comb, nothing exceeds S3 sleep state. Fast startup is disabled, energy efficient Ethernet etc are disabled in the network driver settings in the device manager as well as enabling wake on
 magic packet. Yet still I couldn't get this tablet to WOL after a shutdown. It would wake from sleep mode though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end my problem was resolved when I installed the Intel proset configuration utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reviewed the adaptor settings from within this app, I had an extra setting "Wake on magic packet from power off state" which ISN'T available through the advanced tab of the network adaptor properties in device manager. When I enabled this option,
 WOL started behaving itself again from a shutdown state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As your symptoms and network adaptor were the same as mine I thought i'd share this nugget in case this resolves your issue too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using network driver version 12.15.181.1 which was released on 11/01/2019</p>
<p>

<p>As the others already stated, make sure that the Xbox 360 game disc you're inserting is actually backwards compatible, as not all Xbox 360 games are playable on the One yet!</p>
<p>For a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list of backwards compatible Xbox 360 titles</a> check this list here. If the game is not on the list, it won't work on the One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Xbox 360 game discs are based on the DVD format, try to play a DVD movie disc on your console. If the movie DVD disc isn't recognized either, it might be that the red laser of your Xbox One console is defective, and the drive has to be serviced.
 In that case, sign up your console for repair at <a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Having the exact same issue with my Xbox One X.&nbsp; Tried several different&nbsp; 360 and Original Xbox games over the last couple of days, and the console will not acknowledge that they are in the tray. Even if it is already installed, selecting the game will only
 cause console to instruct that I insert the disk already in the tray.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, all are confirmed compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox One and Movies play without issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already attempted several power cycles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power mode is Energy Saver, Not Instant-On.</p>
<p>Confirmed with several Xbox 360 and original Xbox games, including RDR 1, and Fallout 3, Lost Odyssey, Mass Effect, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I thought the issue was related to the 360 issues on the Support Status page, but those have been resolved.&nbsp;</p>

There are a few limiting factors including the size limits imposed by your ISP. You could also<br />

    <title>Problems with reinstalling the Network adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agi73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with reinstalling the Network adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My computer is Asus E200HA, Windows 10 Home, 64 Bit.</p>
<p>Since yesterday I had a problem with connecting to Internet.</p>
<p>At some point the wireless icon in the notification area indicated that there are no wireless networks around me - a red circle with white cross.</p>
<p>(Other devices in the same place connected well.)</p>
<p>I opened the Device Manager/Network adapters, and saw that my adapter (Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377) is not in the list.</p>
<p>I clicked to show hidden devices, and it reappeared.</p>
<p>But it was written in the properties that the adapter is not connected to the computer (Code 45 error).</p>
<p>Actualization of the driver (and other simple tricks) didn't help, and so I decided to deinstall/reinstall the adapter.</p>
<p>So I chose "deinstall", then performed&nbsp;"Scan for hardware changes", and rebooted.</p>
<p>I expected to see the adapter in the Device Manager in some way, but it disappeared totally - I don't see it when i ask to show the hidden devices or when I scan&nbsp;for hardware changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'd like to ask for help:</p>
<p>What should I do in order to reinstal the adapter?</p>
<p>And what should I do next in order to "connect it to the computer"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I am assuming that you were using Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><span>You may be able to selectively recover the deleted folders using the Previous Versions component. You will need to know the name of the folders that were deleted. Here is the step by step procedure.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>1.</span></b> You will first need to select the
<b><span>Show hidden files</span></b> option.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Open <b><span>Windows Explorer</span></b> and click
<b><span>Organize</span></b> / <b><span>Folder and search options</span></b>. Click the
<b><span>View Tab</span></b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Place a <b><span>check mark</span></b> in the
<b><span>Show Hidden files, folders and drives</span></b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b><span>Apply</span></b>/<b><span>OK</span></b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <b><span>Close and restart Windows Explorer</span></b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>2.</span></b> Open the <b><span>WLM Store folder</span></b>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Navigate to the following folder.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\your name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail
<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Where '<b><span>your name</span></b>' is the name of the account that you use to logon to Windows 7)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. In this folder you will see all of the WLM storage folders. Each email account will have its own group of folders.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Any general storage folders that you created will under the main
<b><span>Storage Folder</span></b> item.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>3. </span></b>Make a copy of the<b><span> Windows Live Mail folders</span></b> previous version.<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.<b><span> Right click </span></b>the <b>
<span>Windows Live Mail folder</span></b> and select <b><span>Properties</span></b> /
<b><span>Previous Versions Tab</span></b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. After the list populates, <b><span>select a version</span></b> of the folder with a
<b><span>date and time</span></b> prior to when the folders were <b><span>deleted</span></b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Click the <b><span>Copy Button</span></b>. In the
<b><span>Copy dialog</span></b> box, select the <b><span>Desktop</span></b> as the
<b><span>location</span></b> to place the copied folder.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>4.</span></b> Move the previous versions of the deleted folders to the WLM store folder.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Go to the Desktop and open the copied WLM folder.
<b><span>Locate</span></b> the folders that were <b><span>deleted</span></b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <b><span>Right click</span></b> the folder and select
<b><span>Copy</span></b>. <b><span>Go to the current WLM storage folders and paste the folder into the</span></b>
