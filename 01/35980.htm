<h2>            Windows 10 1511 &#40;pre-anniversary&#41; install media</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling with frequent 'freezes' since installing the anniversary update (please refer to
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-may-freeze-after-installing-the/5a60d75d-120a-4502-873c-8bfec65c82d0?page=1">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-may-freeze-after-installing-the/5a60d75d-120a-4502-873c-8bfec65c82d0?page=1</span></a> for some details).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found many claimed fixes all over the internet, but so far nothing worked for me. Therefore, I'd like to revert to a clean install of windows 10 version 1511 (well, at least give it a try - it&nbsp;worked fine before... ).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any install media for this version on Microsoft websites... The USB tool automatically downloads &amp; installs the latest version (1607). Can someone please point me to a download of windows 10 - 1511 install media?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bart</p>

            <p>Hi Bart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the media creation tool is updated with 1607. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the anniversary update again with the help of the link provided by Andre Da Costa. Refer to the specific error codes or error messages that you might encounter while upgrading.</p>

            <p>Hi Joy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I could install the anniversary update just fine, and I did a clean install with 1607 before. However, it didn't fix my issues (frequent disk freeze/reset with event 129).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished a fresh install with 1511 and this problem seems to be gone - I have again pretty much the same situation as before the update (when&nbsp;everything was fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this issue gets resolved soon&nbsp;so I can go back up; 1511 feels a bit old even after only one week of 1607 :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, however, please do put some official install media for the previous version for people to download. Now, I had to get the files from the wild web - not really nice as a service from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards,</p>

<h2>            Kodi windows 10 port 8080 link connected but internet not connected</h2>
                    <p><span>I have an issue with the Kodi not internet connected. I even connected my laptop running windows ten directly into the router and it still shows when clicking on System Info that the Link is connected but Internet is
 not connected. I am stumped. I have now idea what to do. In my case the computer firewall is controlled by Norton antivirus and is off because of that. Does anyone have an idea what to do about this internet connection?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So that there is no confusion I will repeat that this is a laptop Kodi is installed on the laptop. When I open Kodi to stream it does not work. The issue is when I click in Kodi on System info it shows that the Link
 is connected and on Kodi home page weather and time is indicated correctly. In system info it shows internet not connected.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Connect Xbox one to Samsung to</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to connect to my Samsung LE22B541C4W to and all I get is no signal coming up on the screen. I know the leads work because as soon as I connect to another to it works! I have followed every bit of advice so far including switching lead
 round, cold booting, holding down power and disc drawer button at the same time, factory setting the to etc. Is there any more advice to get it working? I know that it is connected correctly! I get the impression that it is a Samsung issue but on all the forums
 I have read they don't seem to have an answer which is why I am asking the Xbox community for advice.</p>
<p>I hope that someone can help as a desperately want my little to back in my bedroom and the kids to have the other tv!!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like your console is outputting at a resolution your television cannot display can you please try resetting the graphics output on your console using the instructions below taken for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/tv-or-monitor-screen-is-blank-while-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this Xbox Support webpage</a> and set it to 720P when prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reset your display settings. Here's how: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>If there's a disc in the Xbox One console, eject it. </li><li>On the console, press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button &nbsp;for five seconds to turn off the console.
</li><li>Press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;and the <strong>Eject</strong>&nbsp;button until you hear a beep to turn on the console. You will hear&nbsp;one beep right away and a second beep 10 seconds later. The power light will flash on before the second beep.
 DO NOT LET GO until the second beep occurs.
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;This will boot your console in low resolution mode (640 × 480). To reset this setting, go to
<strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> in the guide, select <strong>
Display &amp; sounds</strong>,<strong> Video options</strong>, and then <strong>TV Resolution</strong>.
</p>
</li><li>If you are required to complete these steps on every boot-up, you will want to change your TV connection to HDMI as shown in step 3 in the next section, "Your screen is blank and you use an AVR in your setup." For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/adjust-display-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to adjust the display settings on your Xbox One console</a>. </li></ol>

<h2>            Credentials Manager</h2>
                    I am trying to view my stored passwords on my personal PC in my home with&nbsp; only me living there. I have tried Credential Manager and when I try to view the password, it prompts me for a user name and password.&nbsp; I have tried every combination I can think
 of for this stupid box and nothing works.&nbsp; I tried following instructions to go to appdata\roaming\Microsoft\Credentials but it says this folder (Credentials) is empty.&nbsp; While I understand the need for security, this is carrying it too far.&nbsp; I cannot possibly
 remember all my usernames and passwords so I have written most of them down.&nbsp; However, not all and I am afraid if I continue I end up bald tearing my own hair out..&nbsp; I am using Windows 10 latest update and Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; Is there any way I can view my stored
 passwords????

<p>It doesn't matter how many people live in your home. As soon as you connect your computer to the internet you are living with millions of people all over the world. Don't rely on Credentials Manager. You need a password manager, like the rest of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of great password managers you can read about on the internet, and many are free. One very popular - and free - password manager is LastPass.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro updates for 1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnjohnsonyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro updates for 1709</h2>
                    Windows 10 Pro updates for 1709<br />
My grandsons computer, running Windows 10 Pro with 16 GB of memory, has not been updated since early 2017. The message is now indicating that the computer must be updated to a new world version of Windows 10. My understanding is that in order to receive the
 new upgrade, there are updates required. I have been working on this thing now for several days. I'm using the latest edition of Update Troubleshooter. It listed 0X800705b4 and 0X80070490 and indicated that they had been repaired. I also uninstalled Bit Defender
 and Malwarebytes and updated Windows Defender.<br />
As of now some of the updates are installing and some are listed as fail to install. My understanding is that all of the updates must be installed before Fall Creators 1709 can be installed.<br />
I certainly would appreciate all the help that I can get. Thank you
                </div>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there's a lot of updates missed is is usually normal for this kind of results that some of the updates fail. Just repeat the automatic updates if in case the update ends with some updates fail. However please do read the update log for the reasons
 why the update has failed. Always remember to run the <strong><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows update troubleshooter</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a certain update is needed, it is usually accompanied by its KB file. Copy the KB file if automatic updates cannot proceed, and download the update manually. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Once you have the KB number of the update, go to: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS Support.</a></strong></li><li>On the <strong>Search </strong><strong>for </strong><strong>help </strong>bar, type the KB number.</li><li>Usually the first result is where you can find the correct KB. However you can use this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>to go to the KB article and manually search for the KB number.</li><li>Once you've found the corresponding KB, scroll down and look for <strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong>.</li><li>You should be able to download the update files from there manually and install it to your PC. Note that your PC might require to restart from time-to-time.</li></ol>

<p><span>Thank you very much for your concern!</span></p>
<p><span>I'm afraid I'm still having the same problems, even though I have followed all the rules that you have laid out. I must say that I have gone further. I have checked out many of the leads that
 seems to be legible intelligible and comprehensible. I really mean the ones that are not so misleading that it would be just too impractical to try and follow.</span></p>
<p><span>Because of the absent time of updates, I really believe that must of been a pretty big registry problem created. Now I am 90 years and seven months old and is just too much wear and tear on my
 nearly worn out system to continue as I am going now. Because it is necessary for the computer to be updated, I believe it is best for me to go and fight Clean Installment. The computer was originally updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Pro during the free
 upgrade period. It is Activated. Now if all that is possible I don't quite understand. I did a couple of HP notebooks but their license are written into the motherboard. This one my grandson and I built. What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            First of all our like thank all of you for your contribution in your job to help me solve my problem. All of the information that I received seem to have helped me to go a step further than it was before, but apparently the system had acquired so much
 baggage full of errors that it just could not completely rectify the problem, although it was able to get up to 99% before stopping. That is after attempting to do the inplace upgrade using&nbsp; the Windows 10 Creation Tool.<br />
I went to the Windows 10 Upgrade Folder and accessed the Log File. There was information that dated all the way back to November 2017 and it continued through my last attempt using the Windows 10 creation tool. All of the information was long enough to probably
 complete a fiction novel. One thing that I found interesting was the last Windows 10 Build was 10240. I don't remember the version that was.<br />
I tried to find information on deleting that folder and starting over, but there was information about attempting to do so might cause further problems.<br />
I then decided to download the Windows 10 creation tool to a flash drive. That is the way to go. You don't have to worry about burning ISO file to a DVD, or if the DVD is large enough.<br />
After process was completed, I restarted computer. Forgetting about the fact that I should have checked bios for boot order, but it rebooted to the flash drive. To make a long story short, I went through all of the procedures of a clean install. After the installation
 completed, I accessed activation procedures in settings and the information was, This Computer Is Activated through Windows digital licensing.<br />
Problem Solved:

<h2>            Two windows 10 systems on two drives &#40;one ssd one hdd&#41;</h2>
                    I can see that this was discussed before but I don't get it.<br />
I've tried it for the last 14hours and now it's time to go to bed.<br />
I just hope I find a solution when I wake up again :)<br />
<br />
It's an HP Pavilion 590 p0512ng with a 256MB SSD (M2.0)<br />
I've also installed a 1TB Toshiba SATA drive<br />
<br />
On my old PC I've used the SW boot-us but this seems not two work with windows 10 (used it with three windows 7 installations,).<br />
<br />
I can install windows 10 on the SSD but once I c install a second OS on SATA drive it can't boot anymore.<br />
The SATA drive is not visible in the BIOS/UEFI but during the installation it is.<br />
<br />
How can can I install two windows 10 on this machine.? Is there a special boot loader I need to install after the first installation on SSD?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to have this config to ensure my OS is not infected when my wife downloads some crap :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for help

            Hi PeterPan,
<br />
<br />It's my understanding that you need a license for both copies of Windows, it'll *technically* be two computers. At any rate, it is indeed possible. You'll need to create a new partition that meets or exceeds the minimum required for the other Windows installation. Here's a thread that includes helpful information in this regard: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/installing-multiple-windows-10-on-same-computer/77e3e33e-4faa-42cb-b4e3-69f893dd9384">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Best of luck.

            Hi,
<br />it is possible but you need a separate license for each Windows instance.
<br />See EULA: Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device.

<p>Hi CrushedSpartan1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not recommended to change your region to another region your not.&nbsp; USA have a different currency than yours and also the address, have to match the region your in.&nbsp; The same goes when using a credit/debit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the game doesn't show up in the Xbox store of your region then the game isnt available in your region. Sorry about that.</p>

            Hello thank you for your comment.<br />
I am from the netherlands, we have a different banking system, no credit cards, we usually just have our own bank card and we can directly buy things online. What i did was i bougth a gift card worth of 100 euro, its directly tied to my account, the money is
 on the xbox, and theres no way to take it out. So i searched up forsaken destiny, it doesnt appear it says currently not sold. When i changed the location to spain, it says i can use a gift card, but that means buying another 40eu gift card to write it directly,
 what i did wrong was i just went to the xbox store and directly put the gift card on redeem code. That's what i did. Do you know a way of reaching xbox officials to just take the money and put the game in my xbox. i would appreciate that so much!

<p>Hi again&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/21de6dc0-6b72-4cac-935b-9558c3823335" title="CrushedSpartan1">CrushedSpartan1</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you ran into this problem is because you can't gift a game to another region other than yours.&nbsp; And even though now you have a balance on your account from the gift card&gt;&gt;you can't spend that balance in another region neither.&nbsp; It has to be
 used in the region you brought that gift card from and what it is set to on your Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I am from the USA.&nbsp; If I have $20 left on my Microsoft an lets say I move to the UK.&nbsp; I would still have to spend my balance in USA region&nbsp; because the balance wont cross over if I change my region to UK.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do I reinstall &#8220;Calendar App&#8221;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Calendar app - accidentally uninstalled?&nbsp; How do I restore it?</p>
<p>When I first upgraded, I thought the Calendar app only worked with Hotmail calendars. Now I realize it can also use&nbsp;a Google calendar.&nbsp; However, I cannot find the app anywhere. Since I have personalized&nbsp;the Windows 8 Start menu, I don't want to have to reinstall
 Windows 8 just to get the Calendar app back.&nbsp; Is there a simpler way to restore/re-install this app?</p>

<br />
Thanks for the suggestion. I fixed my problem a different way...and for some reason I did not see the options you describe in your instructions.<br />
<br />
1) How I fixed it:<br />
&nbsp; - same as a) above:&nbsp; - <b>Start scree</b>n then I clicked on <b>Store</b> tile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - when in Store, I moved cursor to the upper right corner and did a <b>Search</b> of the
<b>Store</b>.<br />
&nbsp; - the "trick" is to search for "<b>Mail, Calendar, People and Messaging</b>"&nbsp; Searching for simply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calendar" will NOT find the Windows 8 Calendar app (Someone needs to fix this!).<br />
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Clicking on the "Mail, Calendar, People and Messaging" app, it installed fine and I was back in business.<br />
<br />
2) re: your instructions:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - in step b) of your instructions, you say then when I open the store, under Spotlight, I will see "<b>Got apps?</b>".&nbsp;&nbsp; I never did see this prompt, even right-clicked or going to the right margin.<br />

<h3> lucello  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blu-Ray Player doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t display Closed Captions.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok -- I'm trying to get Closed Captions to display. &nbsp;To be clear - Closed Captions ARE NOT SUBTITLES!</p>
<p>I have a DVD that has Closed Captions on it, BUT NOT SUBTITLES, and I cannot get those Closed Captions to display on my XBox One.</p>
<p>When I insert the DVD into my PC, playing it using Media Player, I can right-click on the screen and select "Turn On Closed Captions (If Available)" then the Closed Captions display like they should. &nbsp;So I know that the Closed Captions are definitely on
 this disc.</p>
<p>On the XBox One I have gone into Settings and then Closed Captions and I turned on Closed Captions. &nbsp;Yet they won't display in the Blu-Ray Player app. &nbsp;It appears that the BluRay Player App is ignoring the XBox One's Closed-Captioning settings. &nbsp;That app
 *will* allow me to turn-on subtitles (on a disc that has subtitles) but this disc only has Closed Captions and not subtitles. &nbsp;There are quite a few old-school DVDs out there that have Closed Captions, but not Subtitles. &nbsp;It would be nice if the XBox One would
 show these Closed Captions the same way Media Player on my PC does.</p>
<p>Is there a different app I can download that will actually follow the Closed Caption settings on the XBox One?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>
<p>L.</p>

<p>Hi Lucello,</p>
<p>The Xbox One does support Closed Captions on supported DVDs, Blu-rays and stream services. Instructions below to enable/disable this option:</p>
<p>1. Press the Xbox button on your controller to return to the dashboard.</p>
<p>2. Press the Menu button and select Settings.</p>
<p>3. Select Closed Captioning in the Console settings column.</p>
<p>4. To turn closed captions on or off, or to customise how captions appear, select Closed captioning on and use custom styles.</p>

<p>I already did that... &nbsp;Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to affect the Blu-Ray player... &nbsp;It only will do Subtitles off the disc, and this particular disc doesn't have subtitles.</p>
<p>The subtitles do work if the disc has subtitles, but if the disc only has Closed Captions, the Blu-Ray Player will not display them.</p>

<p>I can confirm this for you. &nbsp;I have a dvd that has closed-captions and subtitles in French and Spanish. &nbsp;Turning on the closed-captions options only gets me the French and Spanish subtitles.</p>

<p>This may sound dumb but I might have an answer, even though this post is old, I feel like others might find this problem. I had the same issue so here is what I did</p>
<p>1: I turned on the feature from the Xbox ones menu.</p>
<p>2: I went into the Movies menu and from there is show play, features ect. Then I chose the option setup/languages, and from there you can find the subtitles option.</p>
<p>3: I turned it on while the movies itself was playing from the pause/play menu.</p>
<p>You have to do all three of these for subtitles to show, it's a pain but I think this is the answer.</p>

This thread is a bit old. I suggest keeping an eye out for more recent users that are posting these types of issues and seeing if you can get them sorted out, too! We love seeing you guys help out your fellow gamers, and look forward to seeing more helpful posts from you! :D</p>

<h2>            drivers for gateway nv53</h2>
                    
<p>I have gateway NV53 series laptop and i'v got the driver problem with it...the device manager shows a little yellow mark on many hardware drivers &nbsp;like audio..LAN...wireless..USB..and others...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the error message it displays is...""windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware.the driver may be corrupted or missing(code 39)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i try to update the driver it says driver for your device is up to date...but the yellow mark is still there and the problem still remains...i downloaded the driver from the gateway support and help...and installed it...it gets installed successfully
 but the hardware doesn't work...and the device manager still continues to show the error..</p>
<p>i don't have LAN or wireless driver too so i cannot connect to the internet with my gateway to fix my problem....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please somebody help me to solve this.....</p>

<h2>            Start Menu Button in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Does Microsoft really believe that a "Start Button" that takes the user to the "All Apps" screen is actually a substitute for a functional menu?

            &nbsp;I would download Start8 and Modern Mix from Stardock. They have a thirty day free trial and are priced reasonably (under $10.00). These make a big difference
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allows you to boot to desktop and you never have to use or see&nbsp;the start screen ever again. but can still use the apps you like. I use both and looking at my desktop you would have a hard time telling that I was running Windows 8. Hope this helps and
 if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.</p>

I don't have a problem with Windows 8, and using the
 tiles. It just takes sometime to learn it. Of course the ability to put a shortcut on the desktop to find control panel, device manager, and any number of things is option. Must people want was easy to find to still be easy to find. Hitting the Windows button
 and searching for what you want is easy it's just knowing to hit the Windows button and the Q key?

</p><p>Can you try to uninstall Skype, reboot the device and install the application again? Let me know this helps. If not, kindly provide me the Skype version that you were able to download.<br />

    <title>Windows Login&#58; Sporadic issue - keyboard not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Login&#58; Sporadic issue - keyboard not working</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 on an HP notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I started getting a sporadic issue on waking from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I cannot type into the password box. The keyboard just does not work, although the focus is on the password (ie. flashing cursor in box) and it has been fine before on previous wakes from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many of the supposed cures for this - pressing ALT repeatedly, unplugging mouse and plugging back in, etc. - everything I could find by searching on google. None work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to reboot; very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are up to date.<br />
</p>
<p>How to resolve this?</p>

            If you access Power Options in Settings &nbsp;and click <strong>Require a password on wake-up
</strong>you can check a box before <strong>Don't require a word&nbsp;</strong>and dispense with the need to enter a password.

            <p>Well, yes, but that only works if I don't want to require a password, in which case I would have already switched it off and not needed to ask this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I want to be able to enter a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems a pretty important issue for anyone requiring basic security.

            Test it again several times. There seems to be a problem with the NUM lock key switching off on some computers. Perhaps your computer has this problem.

<p>

            <p>You can test by shutting down overnight and seeing if it occurs the next time the computer is booted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two identical keyboards. It happens on one computer but not the other. The two computers have identical versions of Windows 10 but the hardware differs. One computer was upgraded from Windows 7 and the other from Windows 8.

            <p>Doesn't seem to be any problem with my num lock key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it happens if I click my mouse. Replugging makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, it is sporadic. It doesn't happen on start up. It's from sleep or hibernate, but only sometimes. No pattern.</p>

<p>Have you checked to make sure the slot the M.2 drive is in does not interfere with the other two normal SATA drive ports?&nbsp; I haven't checked your board specifically but I have a Maximus X Hero and certain configurations may interfere with normal operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try turning off Fast Startup since that comes into play during a cold boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</p>
<p>Appreciate your efforts in trying to resolve the issue by yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em><strong>I</strong><strong> am not to clean cache for the store neither is it allowing me to update or install any app on my computer.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens why you try to update or install any app?</p>
<p>Do you receive any error code or error message? If yes, What is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try this fix and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you are not running a proxy connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the (third party) antivirus installed on your computer as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note : Make sure you re-install the antivirus once done with the troubleshooting.

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/13133-store-cache-clear-windows-8-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked.............but when I restarted my computer.......it gave me a completely blank screen..................even though explorer.exe was showing in the task manager............I tried restarting explorer.exe but it did not work........I had to restart
 my computer several times............and then it got back..............now its working good............but again I am facing another problem.......when I type anything on start search...............it does not search any application on my computer(not even
 run or cmd) rather just gives me dots running on the top.......................again I ran through Microsoft website...............but no help..........ultimately had to follow some other website which helped..</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://superuser.com/questions/947392/windows-10-search-cant-find-any-applications-even-calculator</p>
<p>
</p><p>...so&nbsp;I am&nbsp;using windows 10..............but I am thinking of going back to windows 8.................this is&nbsp;my new laptop and&nbsp;it&nbsp;was coming with windows 10..................but I specially requested the&nbsp;dealer to&nbsp;provide me with a windows 8 laptop because&nbsp;I
 was not getting that good of reviews for windows 10 and so that I have the option of going back to windows8 if windows 10 does not work...............and&nbsp;now I take it as good decision&nbsp;..............windows 10 is 10 on 10 In looks but there are lot of minor&nbsp;issues
 which together become annoying.....................for example there is an automatic option of switching to tablet and computer mode...............but once I don't know what happened.............it got reversed.............ie when I was using my laptop as
 tablet it switched automatically to computer mode and when as computer It automatically switched to tablet mode...............although when I restarted the laptop it got corrected..................and infact its a minor issue there are many other as well.............which
 sometimes not always becomes annoying...............I think I cannot keep troubleshooting my computer&nbsp;rather&nbsp;windows 8 is good for me...........</p>

</p><p>Hit Windows key + X and click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>
</p><p>When DISM runs, the cursor drops down one line and it may appear as if it failed, but eventually you'll see ================ 20% appear and then ============ 100%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it finishes, right click a blank part of the desktop and go to View and click desktop icons to checkmark if it isn't already and then reboot. Check it again and provided the tools worked, it should still be checkmarked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can also do is right click the taskbar and go to Toolbars. Click "Desktop" and you'll see that appear on the right near the clock with an arrow facing right. If you click that arrow, you'll see all your icons on vertical menu. That allows you to
 hide all the desktop icons and access them that way instead which is what I do. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<em>-- %systemroot% is the environment variable for your Windows directory. For example, C:\Windows.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all .DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop, create a new folder on the Desktop to put these .DMP files in, and then zip the folder. You can then either use a 3rd party tool such as 7-Zip/Winrar, or you can use Windows'
 default method of zipping folders.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compress-uncompress-files-zip-files#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compress and uncompress files (zip files).</a><br />
<br />
 the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the .ZIP containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel Memory Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel Memory Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel Memory Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel Memory Dump is
 the best choice. Do note that Kernel Memory Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong>
</em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
