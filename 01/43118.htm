<h2>            Windows media player and Epson Scan&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does windows media player (12.xxxxx) interfere with Epson Scan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While scanning and listening to music (from hard drive),&nbsp; my Epson Scan app will lock. Restart scanner &amp; app and it will work for a few scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Optionally (?), recommend a different media player?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />

<h2>            Blue screen after Windows 10 update 1709</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my PC tries to install the Feature update for Windows 10, version 1709. After all is downloaded and installed it asks me to restart the PC.</p>
<p>After the restart i get the BSOD:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f808e3e9-ec3f-4321-8fb8-71a4a09a99f9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f808e3e9-ec3f-4321-8fb8-71a4a09a99f9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Only option that helps after is the "Esc" option, this gets me to BIOS where i just exit without saving and get back to Win10.</p>
<p>But the update is not installed.</p>
<p>As it is not installed, the installation process starts over and over again with the same result.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Pro, if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>There seems to be some issues with version 1709 for specific systems. What I recommend is to hide the update.</p>
<p>When the update is offered, hide this update using the following troubleshooter tool:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows 10 Updates Troubleshooter Tool from Microsoft</a></span></p>

<p>Click on "<span>Hide updates</span>" option and you'll be able to hide desired update given in the list.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You should upgrade to 1803 when it releases in March/April.</p>

    <title>Bcdboot removes &#34;recoverysequence&#34; and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bcdboot removes &#34;recoverysequence&#34; and &#34;recoveryenabled&#34; from bcd</h2>
                    I have testing this for about 5 days when I began by quest to dual boot Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;I already had Windows 8.1 installed on the computer so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal to install Windows 7 onto another partition. So I go and do that. After its done you get the "Legacy" boot manager (the standard black and white screen with your boot
 options) and be being the picky person I am I decide to change it to the new metro boot manager. So I look into how I can do that.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The most popular option I found is using bcdedit and changing the bootmenupolicy from Legacy to Standard but it would seem that it already is on standard. So I do a ton of testing and discover I can get it to show the new loader if I open up the command prompt
 from advanced startup options and use bcdboot and rebuild it. But I soon discovered that it over rights all the settings for the Windows 8.1 bcd and removes the two lines stated making it where if you open up the advanced startup options under trouble shooting
 it only shows one button "Startup options" (Basically the equivalent of pressing F8 while booting) and won't let you use the refresh your pc or reset your pc options at all.<br />
<br />

(These are both are the screen after clicking the troubleshoot button)<br />
<br />
I then went and installed Windows 8 (not 8.1) and 7 (in that order) on the same system and used the bcdboot fix and it worked fine as it didn't remove those lines.<br />
<br />
So if someone could tell me what is going on here I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can install a newer version of Windows on a separate partition and keep the earlier version of Windows on your computer. What I meant is that first try installing Windows 7 first and then try install Windows 8.1 on a different partition and check. This
 is what I tried and it gave me the Metro Advanced boot page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!!!</p>

            Yes I was already aware of this fact; I must have forgotten to mention it. But this seems to be a flaw in Windows 8.1<br />

    <title>HOMEGROUP PROBLEM IN WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> burtonallan  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOMEGROUP PROBLEM IN WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    I have a 3-computer homegroup. I have a folder on one of the desktops with a combination of PDFs and Microsoft WORD documents that is shared. I want all 3-computers to dip into that folder and locate a file and open it and possibly make changes to the
 file and save the changes. Everyone can access the documents, but, when it is a word document and someone clicks on it to open it, it won't open and when I have a Word document open and I try to save it to the desktop, it is fine, but, when I try to save the
 new Word document and put it into this shared folder, it freezes and won't save the file to this folder. Can you help?

<p>Since Homegroup is being removed globally from all Windows 10 computers in the next few months, I would really not invest any significant time in troubleshooting this issue.&nbsp; This spring, Homegroup will be disabled and removed from all Windows 10 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I'd recommend you therefore go ahead and turn it off now, and use regular old reliable Network sharing instead of the buggy homegroup function that's being retired anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you familiar with finding shared folders through the "Network" section of your file explorer?<br />

<p>Thanks for responding. I'm at the end of my rope. I feel like returning my brand new Dell I7 with 16mb ram and Windows 10 and just going back to MAC. This is a nightmare. An absolute nightmare. Let me start at the beginning. There are (2) computers. One
 is a Windows 7. One is a brand new Windows 10. I successfully created a homegroup. It works. I put a shortcut to a folder on the desktop of the Windows 7 that has dozens of WORD.docx and PDF and JPG files, etc. I right clicked at set it at full control on
 the security settings. I can open the folder on both computers. Both computers are running Office 365. Sounds great, huh? Well, I can open the PDFs and JPGS without a problem, but, I cannot open the WORD or Excel files at all when I go click on the file. Only
 the PDFs and JPGs. I found a workaround to open the Word files, but, this is not a fix, either. When I open WORD and I go to the folder through browse and locate the file, I can get it to open. However, when the file opens, I can't save it. It locks up and
 I have to close Word and lose the updates to the file. Also, I can't create a new WORD document in Word and then "Save as" and put it into that folder. I have put Share everywhere I can on these folders. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK! I can see the homegroup and in
 Explorer I can see the drives of the other computers. I have put share on everything I can and I have no solution. But, that's not all.</p>
<p>As a further experiment, I bought a Western Digital My Passport Wireless Drive to try to be a server and I put this folder with lots of docs, pdfs and jpgs on it. It's extremely slow, but it works and is not an answer for that reason.</p>
<p>The final part of this is something else. Ultimately, I need to have this 1-folder full of documents, jpgs and PDFs accessible to both computers to read and write and create new Word and Excel files and both computers to be able to pull off and open and
 change the files and create new ones to put into the folder. But, the one other thing, I have a very lightweight file that is an ACT software file which is a .pad file and not .xls or .docx or .jpg. The file is very small. But, when I put that on the desktop
 it won't open, either. It won't open in the Western Digital wireless drive, either. I get a screen popup when I right click to change the security permissions that ACCESS is DENIED. It comes up with Permission/Special and not inherited and every time I click
 around to edit it or create a new "EVERYONE" it denies me access. THIS SHOULD NOT BE SO COMPLICATED!! Microsoft is not protecting anything. People can hack into this crap if they want anyway, as they've proven over and over, so, it is not helping anyone. Hackers
 can get in, but I can't set up my network. It's successfully making me hate Microsoft and not securing anything or protecting anybody. Oh, and yes, I've shut off the firewalls and there's no anti-virus or anything else blocking anything. I am smart and literate
 with computers, but this security setting stuff is a nightmare. I just spent over a thousand dollars on a computer and new software and I'm just about ready to end using Microsoft. I shouldn't have to pay several hundred more at $60 per hour to a Microsoft
 certified tech to do a couple of right clicks to fix this simple network, either. It's not a big sophisticated setup.&nbsp; I AM FURIOUS! I apologize for venting on you, but, I'm just pretty much done. Another work-around that I haven't tried which sounds great
 would be to use One Drive. It says you can put the files on One Drive and Click Share and then both computers can access the files and update them using One Drive as my network, basically. I'm thinking this would be slower to use because it means the computer
 accessing all the files in the cloud, but, then, would it work at all?? Could I put that folder in One Drive and then have both computers access the Word, Excel docs and jpgs and PDFs and open and work on the files and save them and also create and save new
 ones all with that master folder in One Drive? And, if I got that part to work which also works on this Western Digital Wireless Drive, would it still have a problem opening my PAD file for ACT so the computers can share that file in One Drive, as well. I
 get it that you are not an ACT guy, but, this is supposed to work, too, where the 2-computers can share this pad file. I'm thinking that somehow in the permissions that a .pad extension is not recognized or something and that's why I can't read and write to
 it. I have share set on the file and the folder. A lot of stuff here, but, when all is said, this should be a simple easy networking thing for 2-computers and one folder and one program. I have to make a decision about this. Either it's going to work or it's
 not. I'll return the new Dell computer to the store and just go back to using a MAC. It may cost more for the hardware, but, everything works! I can run ACT through bootcamp as I know someone else does. Thanks for listening. I don't know if you can help. I
 started by writing to you about a homegroup, but it doesn't work as a network, either. It's all those damn security settings. It does not give me access to change them in many cases and I'm the damn administrator! Anyway, if you want to tackle this long note,
 it would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>Yes indeed, OneDrive is the best way to do it.&nbsp; Or Google Drive, or Drop Box, or Amazon Cloud, or Apple iCloud -- they all work the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then no matter what computer you sit down at, your files are all identical and the same, right at the left side of your folder window.&nbsp; Plus you can get to all your files from your phone, or literally anywhere in the world you go.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OneDrive does not make extra copies of some master file stored elsewhere.&nbsp; This isn't about duplicating files in extra places, it's about storing it in one single place and having it take care of all the work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no setup required, all you need is your password and you're done and ready to use this.</p>

            Wow! You are awesome for responding so quickly. Thank You. Okay, based on what you said, I'm on board but still not clear. I already have and use Dropbox. I signed in and I transferred my PAD file and a few docs to a new shared folder in Dropbox. But,
 I'm in a browser. When I open programs on the computer, I can't browse or save directly or find the dropbox file and folder. I'm not getting it. I'd want to keep the folder and file in dropbox, so, both computers are accessing it. I don't want to download
 a copy and use it on my desktop and then stick it back up there in the dropbox folder. What am I missing here? Thanks.

            Hi, "Cmdr"....I just opened Dropbox. I uploaded a simple Word document. I doubleclicked on the file in Dropbox and it won't open with my copy of Word on my desktop. Now, I opened Microsoft Word on my desktop, created a file and when I go to "Save As" I
 can't browse to the dropbox folder to save it there or go there to open a file. I can only browse to what's on my hard drive. As I said the dropbox is in my browser. What am I doing wrong?

<p>Cool, DropBox is great too.&nbsp; I haven't used it in years but they are innovating and do some things that other companies are only just now starting to catch up to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're nearly there - but as you observed it's a pain in the neck to use the browser to grab a file, use it, then upload your changed file back to the site.&nbsp; You want it to just work directly without the hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need is the DropBox program installed to your computer.&nbsp; OneDrive is built-in, but the drop box is just a quick download.&nbsp; Once you have that, there will be a "DropBox" folder on your computer, similar to the picture I posted, and everything stored
 inside it will be continuously and always synchronized with the DropBox website.&nbsp; So you can open a file directly (for example, in Word) and make changes as if it was just a regular file on your computer (because it is), but as soon as you close Word, the
 dropbox program will sync your changes to the site in the background.&nbsp; That way your files are always backed up, and if your computer burned in a fire you'd still not lose any files (as long as you stored them in dropbox).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to get that download, just go to <a href="http://dropbox.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
dropbox.com/install</a> and hit the download button.&nbsp; From there you'll just have to click a few times to install, put in your dropbox username/password, and you're done.</p>

<p>Hi, "Cmdr"</p>
<p>we are almost there. I will try One Drive, also. But, I had Dropbox account. Anyway, thanks for the link. Set up dropbox on the computer and YES, IT WORKS for the word, excel files. I'm still having an issue with the pad file which is from a program, but,
 while I know it is a 3rd party program, ACT, I get this error on my network and the homegroup, as well, when I try to open programs as opposed to jpgs and excel and docx files. This is where I was losing my mind. I get this same error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"computer could not be reached because the port "1434" may be blocked. Opening the port or reconfiguring your firewall settings may resolve the issue"</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I get this error (just as before using dropbox) I click out of it and then try to mess with the security settings and I get stonewalled eventually in the dialog boxes telling me I don't have access to make the changes and it won't let me add "everyone"
 or anything and I have to close the dialog boxes without any changes. Again, firewall is not on. Nothing is blocking it and user account setting is down to zero and I am the administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get it that maybe homegroup is only for sharing mp3s or simple files and not programs. But, people connect programs through networks. I've googled tutorials, but, I can't find answers. You have been my best resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'd bet we can get it to work, although I don't think homegroup is the right avenue to take (even if homegroup features weren't getting removed globally in a few weeks).&nbsp; To be honest I think we could probably be better served by first turning off the homegroup
 function and just using more straightforward home network setup to proceed.&nbsp; This may not be absolutely required, but I think it'll just reduce issues.&nbsp; So here's what I'd suggest first:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On each computer, open the homegroup settings and choose to "Leave the homegroup". It'll popup and ask if you'd rather change what you're sharing, but ignore that and just leave it entirely.</li><li>Right-click Start and choose Run.&nbsp; Type services.msc and then click OK.</li><li>In the list, find "Homegroup Provider" and double-click it.</li><li>In the popup, click "Stop" and then set the Startup type to disabled, then click OK.</li><li>In the list, find "Homegroup listener" and do the same thing (stop and disable it).</li><li>Close the services list.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now for your software.&nbsp; I'm not really familiar with the software, so I think I need to ask some questions to better understand what you are trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like the ACT program is installed on both computers, but you want to use it to open files that are only stored on one computer (open the files over the home network).&nbsp; Is that right?</p>

<p>You are awesome. I'll do exactly what you say. I'm going to do this in a couple of hours and I'll update you. I'm also going to use One Drive, as well, instead of Dropbox as a permanent option since we already have Office365 and we are paying for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, per your instructions, I will end Homegroup and set up a traditonal network. To avoid errors, can you point me to a step tutorial or just list steps so I don't screw up? Basically, I go to the Networks and&nbsp; Sharing Center in Control Panel, and the first
 option, then set up an ad-hoc computer to computer network? (or that will disconnect me from the internet??) please advise so I set it up properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the network is set up and One Drive is setup, I assume I will have no problem with that one folder I have loaded with docx, excel, pdfs and jpgs since it already works on Dropbox and that solves that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leaves ACT. I tried this before and it didn't work, but, it should. With the new network set up, I will re-install ACT, but, in theory once the network is setup, won't other programs (not just files) work, be it Photoshop or just other software?? Anyway,
 with ACT, I will have the program set up on both computers, (2-seperate copies/seats per ACT's requirement) and all I want to do is share this one simple small file/database simultaneously so both guys/computers can work on the same database at the same time.&nbsp;
 In case you are interested to learn for your own knowledge, these links to ACT tutorials should confirm that the program should work seamlessly without any hassles, but, we will see. I had trouble before with security permissions, etc and stuff like that in
 Windows But, we were in a homegroup. (even if homegroup is supposed to work)</p>

<p>You bet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the network setup part, you don't really need to do much setup.&nbsp; For the most part, you can just go to each of your computers, open any folder and then click "Network" on the left.&nbsp; It should show you your other computers on the network (although it may
 ask you to turn on network discovery so it can find them).&nbsp; If you don't see them there and no message about turning on network discovery, just let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a quick tip on the OneDrive.&nbsp; If you click the white cloud near the clock, it will show you what's recently been changed in your OneDrive.&nbsp; For example, here's mine:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ad5509b-9e02-4830-aa93-611fce014258?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ad5509b-9e02-4830-aa93-611fce014258?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went as far as telling Windows to store my Desktop folder inside my OneDrive folder, so that any temporary scrap files I toss on my usually-nearly-empty desktop are still safely backed up and available on all my other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've read through the instructions on setting up the shared database for ACT, I see what I'm sure is the trouble point --&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>To set up a </em></span><em>shared</em><span>
</span><em>database<span> correctly, all workstations must have full read/write access to the
</span>Database</em><span><em>folder and the Supplemental Files folders.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably already know where your database folder is (although they link to
<a href="http://kb.act.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13660/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNTE4MDMwODg2L3NpZC8tT0ZhaEtFbg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this info about how to find it</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp; They don't give me any real clues about where it would normally be, but I'm guessing it's in a location something like C:\Users\Allan\AppData\Local\Swiftpage\ACT (just taking a guess here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like to me, you'd want to do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the server computer, go to the folder where the database and supplement files are, and navigate to the folder just above it (so in my fake example path, it'd be the "Switftpage" folder, so that you can see the ACT folder).</li><li>Right-click the ACT folder and go to properties.</li><li>On the Sharing tab, click Share.</li><li>Type "everyone" into the box and click OK (this means you're sharing the file with everyone inside your home network, not everyone in the world)</li><li>After it's shared, you may also need to use the "Permissions" tab of the properties and add "everyone" as being allowed to the folder too (the effective access a network user has is determined by both the sharing permissions and the security permissions
 rolled together).</li></ol>
<p>At this point, if you go to your other computer and look in the "Network" folder, you should see the server computer listed, and going inside that you should see the database folder available to you remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes,</p>

    <title>Acer Aspire display Adapter prolem after upgrade to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Acer Aspire display Adapter prolem after upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Laptop is Acer Aspire R13 Hybrid .</p>
<p>It came with Windows 8.1 and was working fine until I upgraded to windows 10. at beginning it was working fine until I guess there was a windows update auto installed. After that when I started Laptop I had a black screen before logging in and with just
 the mouse arrow showing on the screen and system not responding to any keys.... After further rebooting and some web research someone suggested to uninstall driver in low resolution mode which I did and system started properly until after few days the same
 problem reoccurred. I repeated the same steps and the same issue reoccurred after some time. What I found out this time is that if I leave the system untouched for few minutes with just the arrow showing, the screen will reappear normally.</p>
<p>Any sugestions to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have experienced this problem when installing win updates and I am unsure how to proceed. When I check the update history it tells me that there was an error 80070005. The progress is always the same when I shut down or restart the
 computer, it attempts to install the update, gets stuck at around 25%-30% progress, then shuts down/reboots, tries to perform the update operation, then flashes the "Fatal Error 0000000022" cannot apply update in literally half a second before it says could
 not install update, reverting changes. Then it takes me to login screen and I go back to desktop.</p>

<p>Quick update, I tried using the troubleshoot function within windows to try and repair the windows update process, and it came up with as successful. I thought that would fix the problem so I clicked on the "Solved my problem" button following KristyM9's
 post. Unfortunately that was a bit premature, downloading and installing the updates resulted in the exact same outcome, getting stuck at around 30%ish, then fatal errorr 0000000000022, "undoing changes" then back to desktop.

<p>Hello, </p>

 not install update, reverting changes. Then it takes me to login screen and I go back to desktop.</p>

I have had the exact same problem even down to the point of employing Bitdefender scan and get the same repetitious result. I thought I was alone with this, but now think it is a Microsoft issue. Please Microsoft, "step up" and throw some light on this.

<p>I also have much the same problem.&nbsp; Tried to install KB4022726 on Win 8.1.&nbsp; It seemed to install ok, but then on rebooting, Windows crashed and the PC restarts a second time.&nbsp; On that second restart it comes up with the message "Failure configuring Windows
 updates, Undoing changes...", then starts up ok.&nbsp; If I check the update history it shows KB4022726 as installed, but it is clearly not installed because if&nbsp;I search for updates again, it comes up again as being needed.</p>

<p>It looks like everybody with 8.1 is having the same problem. It sure would be nice if MS would fix their buggy operating system. It has the makings of Vista.

            It might be a MS/Bit Defender issue! I needed to renew my Bit Defender Total Package so i ended up going with AVG. When i uninstalled Bit Defender my computer did a massive update and hasn't had an issue updating since or the Fatal Issue come up. I'm hoping
 that was the problem. Will post again if it happens again!!

<p>I was informed by Bitdefender to disable all Total Security components (anti-virus, firewalls etc) then try the updates but no success. The problem continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us informed of whether or not you have success with uninstalling Bitdefender then trying the updates. My computers are one and a half months behind on updates. The issue is affecting two computers and I need a solution that does not involve Windows
 refresh, restore or reset which means removing and then reinstalling all data and software. A very time consuming solution!</p>

<h3> willthepi11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 keeps turning off by itself even after repair.</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason my 360 won't stay on for more than a few seconds to minutes at a time. It'll often switch from 1080p to 480p after a few self shutdowns making me have to reset these settings frequently. It'll sometimes work after 4 or so shutdowns but It's
 not worth going through the hassle every time I want to play a game. It's not the power supply as I've tried using a brand new one from a friends 360 and I get the same thing (yes it's plugged directly into the wall.) So I sent my 360 in for repair and it
 almost took a month to get it back (Sent Jan,11 received Today Feb,4). I'm disappointed to say I'm still having the same problem and it seems as if the Xbox service center just took a month to clean my 360 and send it back with no significant repairs. I've
 been a huge Xbox fan/user for 10+ years and even picked up the One on launch but this kind of service is unacceptable. If someone can offer a solution it would be greatly appreciated. I've searched through the forums a bit and haven't found any solid solutions
 to this well known problem.</p>

<p>I figured out that it was flex cable that connects the power button sensor to the console. Upon disconnecting the flex cable all of the problems went away. The only small downside is until I order a new cable I have to use the controller to turn the console
 on/off and eject games.</p>

<br />
<br />There is one change in directions though as above article uses previous version of Skype not default Windows 10 Skype. In this version, you need to click on 3 horizontal dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Scroll down to Network &gt; Change proxy settings &gt; Now, you can use instructions from above link to set up proxy.

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>Testing win8 Enterprise as multiboot on above Hardware.</p>
<p>Have had some issues with NVIDI GeForce GO 6150 drivers which seem to have been largely overcome.</p>
<p>Device manager notes drivers for Other devices&gt;coprocessor are not installed.</p>
<p>Notice performance rating for Graphics far lower than when running win7..assume related to coprocessor driver issues..also screen occasionally goes black / fickers.</p>
<p>Have tried auto update of drivers..no joy.</p>
<p>Ideas anyone?..can I copy the drivers from my win7 installation and run in compatibility mode?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<h2>            USRobotics USR3453C Courier 56K V.92 Ext Modem driver</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I need the extracted x64 bit Driver for the USR3453C modem as there is no driver from US Robotics only the default Windows driver.<br />
How do I extract this default driver from W2K8 R2?<br />
<br />
Reason is I need this driver to be installed in a Guest VM SBS2011&nbsp; (Hyper-V).<br />
<br />
Thanks to Hyper-V and COM ports still not working. I am using http://www.eltima.com/products/serial-over-ethernet/<br />
have telnet connection working fine but I need to install the USR3453C on the VM so the Fax Server on SBS 2011 is working fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch<br />
Peter<br />

            Peter,
<div>The modem should install via Plug and Play.</div>
<div>You can try using the Vista 64 bit installer from the support page. It contains the same driver as 2008/2011 inbuilt.<br />

    <title>Wireless Network Adapter&#47;Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahfuhs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Network Adapter&#47;Updates</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a hp pavillion dv6000 laptop with the WIndows vista home premium package. Here's my problem: my internet was working just fine, I did not change drivers or uninstall anything, however one day when I started up my computer the wireless light on my lap
 top stayed orange indicating it was turned off. Either way I put the switch it stays orange, so..<br />
<br />
I did the diagnose and it says that i need to install wireless networking hardware and verify the correct drivers are loaded. So I go to the device manager, open the network adapters-NVIDIA nForce Networking Controller, and it says the driver is working properly.
 Then I go to hardware driver recovery and check the Broadcom 802.11 Network Adapter Drive (I'm not that skilled in computers so I am guessing this is to do with my problem) and I reinstall it, it says it works, restart the computer, and the problem is still
 there. And then I try the next possible problem..<br />
<br />
I check for updates to see if that is my problem, that I might need a new update. It says I have 5 new updates, looking at them none really that I can tell have much to do with the internet..but I try to update them anyways. It then tells me that those 5 updates
 failed and gives me an error code. (80246005) And of course this code is not listed on Microsoft's error code update page. The get help section doesn't tell me anything. Maybe it can't update because I need an internet connection? I have no idea.
<br />
<br />
I had to replace my battery on this latop once before on warranty, and i am having the same problem again (not holding charge at all, stays at 0%) and I can only use the computer when plugged in. So..every time I unplug it the computer dies, so I'm also unsure
 if this is causing any of my problems. I am so frustrated because I cannot find a solution to this! Thank you for anyone who can help!

            Well it sounds like you may have a hardware failure inside your computer.&nbsp; Laptops can often be problematic because the components are very close together and can exhibit a lot of heat.&nbsp; If a fan fails, or venting is interrupted, the laptop can cook and
 fail.&nbsp; Batteries, for instance, can often fail if exposed to high temperatures as a safety precaution.&nbsp; So, if you left a laptop in the sun in the car, for instance, it might give you a failed battery.<br />
<br />
At this point, your machine sounds like it is having a host of problems.&nbsp; Battery, Networking, and possibly patch maintenance.&nbsp; At this stage, I'd recommend taking it into a computer shop and having them diagnose the problems and make suggestions as to what
 the issue is.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<p>Hi! I'm having similar problems too. Can you tell, have you downloaded a new service pack recently? I too am having the same Broadcom product problems where it won't install. It seems there are many people on this board with the same problem. Can you still
 connect ot the internet via an ethernet cord?<br />
<br />
I also had a problem with the battery but when I purchased a new one it became fine. I was told they only last for about 8 months.</p>

            There is one service pack that says .NET Framework service pack that needs to be updated. I'm not sure what that is..<br />
And I haven't tried an ethernet cord. Do you know if yours works? <br />
I am hoping I don't have a hardware problem but that sounds like it may be it.<br />
I didnt know the batteries dont last very long but that is about the same amount of time that mine has lasted. :/<br />

            Batteries don't expire due to an arbitrary date.&nbsp; They generally have a maximum number of charges, but typically they just lose capacity.&nbsp; So at one point a new battery might give you 3 hours of useful life, and then over time it might only give you 2
 hours, and then 1 hour, etc.&nbsp; If the battery goes to zero, this is typically a sign of failure.&nbsp; Again, it may have failed due to heat, or even a possible short.&nbsp; Batteries have some fail-safe circuitry in them to prevent them from exploding or catching fire.&nbsp;
 So if something isn't right in your machine, the battery can potentially trip one of these fail-safes and they then cease to function.<br />
<br />
In most cases, with batteries, with average use, they can last for years.&nbsp; With heavy use, they can expire, but I've never seen them just sit at zero charge status unless the battery had failed.<br />
<br />
Your network drivers being fouled by a security update is potentially possible but unlikely.&nbsp; Again, I'd really suggest taking it into a shop and having them run diagnostics on it.&nbsp; There's a lot of potential for problems.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the money right now to take it in.&nbsp; You could try a system restore.&nbsp; Restore back to an earlier point to when you knew the wireless network was functioning and see if that works for you.<br />

            Ok thank you, I will try the system restore. <br />
And then take it in to a shop when I can. <br />
Do you think its best to stop using it all together until I can get a new battery and the other problems fixed?
<br />
I feel like the problems keep popping up, probably from the heat like you said. <br />
Thanks again!

<p>I know this is belated, but hopefully it will help others like me. I tried everything to fix this problem. I also have an HP Pavillion dv6000 running Vista. Having worked through this twice, I now know that the problem is related to the battery. Both times
 this happened to me, I had been running on battery power (battery in poor condition). I used every Microsoft tool, called HP (who wanted me to ship it back to them to be repaired for nearly $400), re-installed drivers and software, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Here's what seems to work:</p>
<p>Make sure that you have re-installed the wireless network drivers using the <strong>
Recovery Manager</strong>: don't reboot until you have re-installed it (mine were the<em><strong>Broadcom 802.11 Network Adaptor Driver</strong></em>, and the
<em><strong>Broadcom Wireless LAN Driver -- Vista</strong></em>). Make sure that you are running on AC. Pull out the battery and leave it out then reboot. You should come up with Vista reloading everything and recognizing your wireless adaptor and be back in
 business. Don't know what will happen if I put the battery back in but will try it.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if just removing the battery and rebooting would have worked as well. Oh well, if you're like me you'll be happy just to get the damn thing working again.</p>

<p>How you activate Windows 10 after reinstalling it depends on how Windows 10 was originally installed on your device.
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Windows Store, you have a digital entitlement for your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a digital entitlement
 for without entering a product key. During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, select Skip. Windows 10 will automatically activate online after the installation is complete.
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>If you previously installed and activated Windows 10 using a product key, you’ll need to enter the product key during reinstallation.
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Select the Start Start button icon button, then select Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation. If Windows 10 isn’t activated on your device, see Get help with Windows 10 activation errors for more info.</p>
<strong>
<p>　</p>
<p>Get help with Windows 10 activation errors:</p>

<h2>            Paypal and Xbox Live Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I'm having a pretty frustrating issue with respect to using paypal with the xbox live marketplace. I have added the payment account on xbox.com, its been all comfirmed etc BUT; when i try the 2 for $2 xbox live gold deal - i get the error Status
 cod: 80190126. I have also tryed buying regular $10.95 for one month through paypal and still does not work. Even purchasing MS points - its the same deal. Well, I have tryed all the sticky notes on this forum (yes the resetting of cache, and marketplace stuff
 in console settings), i have even gone as far as to make another account and test it on that. Still the same issue. I have added/removed my paypal account numerous times over a period of 5 days or so, still doesnt work. There is a sufficient amount in my paypal
 account to purchase what i desired, and yet still nothing. PLEASE HELP! I dont wish to miss out on the $2 deal, plus if paypal worked on my live account it would be epic. Thanks anyway - Hectic</p>

<p>A lot of people have been getting that error when it comes to Paypal, but I haven't seen an absolute solution. The only suggestion I've seen is to remove paypal as a payment method and then re-add it and try again.</p>

<p>I was told that this issue should have been resolved. Try recovering your profile and/or clearing your system cache and try purchasing again.

<h2>            runtime error logonUI.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I'd like to say I know there is several topics concerning this issue but I already spent hours going through them all and, either the solution proposed did not work for me or I was simply unable to apply it. So here I am.<br />
<br />
long story short: my computer was working very well until, one day, it went off due to a lack of battery and when i started it again the message appeared before the login screen:&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft visual C++ Runtime Library<br />
Runtime Error!</p>
<p>Program: C:\Windows\System32\LogonUI.exe<br />
This program has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.<br />
Please Contact the application's support team for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good thing is: I am able to access to safe mode and login into my account (the logon screen appears normally and i can type my password) but most of the services are disabled (more than what should be disabled, it seems to me) and i can't even access to
 settings. The windows button is not even responsive when left click on it.. weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, I tried the most common solutions (disable CGI, chekdsk and sfc scannow, bootable usb disk, etc) but none of them worked for me.. I even tried to reinstall windows but, to my surprise, it did not have the single effect on the problem..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I missed something or tried things in the wrong order so I am now ready to "start over" with some help from you, if you are willing to give me some.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a laptop running on windows 10 creators update (not the fall creators update !, the issue appeared before it was out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much to whoever might be able to guide me or provide me with new insights on a potential solution to fix this issue.</p>

            Hi Florian,<br />
<br />
<br />
The runtime error logonUI.exe may occur if the system files associated with the logon are either missing or broken. Just to verify, when you mentioned that you reinstalled Windows, did you perform a clean install? Since you already did an SFC scan, were you
 able to perform a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
DISM </a>as well?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think I did do a DISM when I performed chkdsk and sfc scan but maybe not in the right order. I will retry to do it this evening and let you know what I get (that was a while ago and I tried so many different things that it is getting a little confusing..).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Windows install, I'm not sure it was a clean install but i did it from a usb with the windows 10 iso provided on microsoft website. And now i got the Windows.old folder so i'd say it was ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I'm already starting to backup all my files so if you think the best solution is to wipe out everything and start from fresh I'm willing to do it since I already spend so much time on this problem.. The thing is I had windows 8.1 when I bought this laptop and
 I upgraded to windows 10 when it was released but i'm not sure I will be able to upgrade again to windows 10 if I do a factory reset/total wipe out of my laptop ?<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.<br />
Thanks very much.</p>

            Thank you for providing us the information. Since you mentioned that you are willing to start fresh, you can refer to this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
link </a>on how to perform a clean install. If you would still be getting the same issue, you could have a failing hardware already. In that case, you may need to get in touch with your device's manufacturer for further assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have other Windows concerns.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running DISM: ScanHealth and RestoreHealth both failed with error 605 (the specified buffer contains ill-formed data).<br />
I also tried to do sfc /scannonw : failed at 11% (windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, any other advice ? Or maybe some instructions regarding doing a clean install of windows 10 ?<br />
Thanks again in advance.</p>

<p>Hi everyone.<br />
So I want to do a clean install so I downloaded windows 10 on microsoft website and made an usb that i used to boot onto. This part works fine.<br />
After selecting language and all, I get to the screen where they ask me where i want to install windows and that's where I would need a little bit of advice. Here are all the partition that are detected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Free space&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Type</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive 0 partition 1: SYSTEM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100Mo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 70Mo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System</p>
<p>Drive 0 partition 2: Recovery&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 900Mo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 580Mo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recovery</p>
<p>Drive 0 partition 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;128Mo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 128Mo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MSR (reserved)</p>
<p>Drive 0 partition 4: OS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 372Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;303Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Primary</p>
<p>Drive 0 partition 5: Data&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 537Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;153Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Primary</p>
<p>Drive 0 partition 6: Recovery&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recovery</p>
<p>Drive 1 partition 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22Go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OEM (reserved)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A bit of a mess...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved everything that is on Data but if I can left it untouched It would be nice.&nbsp;<br />
Otherwise, what should I delete (if not everything) and what should I absolutely left as is (I'm kinda worried about the "reserved" ones) ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your kind replies and well-advised words :D&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can run the System File Checker tool. It is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. To run the tool, please refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. After that, run the DISM tool. Windows updates and service packs may fail to install if there are corruption errors. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix
 some Windows corruption errors. To run this tool, click on this link. </p>

            <p>Basically, I am simply suggesting for you to check your computer to see if Fast Startup is
<strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, disable it and then check your STARTUP SOUND.</p>

            That sounds like he may have had a subscription in the past and they were unable to charge him for the recurring subscription and he may have a balance that is owed. If so, the balance would have to be paid with a credit card/Paypal before the account
 funds can be used. You can check to see if he owes a balance at&nbsp;<a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://commerce.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;or contact support and speak to billing.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>

<p>Hello DPS4,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue isn't on your end. The Xbox game pass can't be purchased with currency. It will need either a debit/credit card or paypal. Just recently Xbox live subscriptions were made available to purchase with currency just not the game pass.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Здравствуйте! Сегодня, это было неприятно удивляться, что каждый месяц на карты была списана стоимость для Xbox Live уровня Gold с декабря 2017 года, хотя я купила ребенку абонемент только на один месяц. После того, как сумма была списана сегодня 17.03.2018. Если есть возможность я бы хотел отменить подписку и вернуть деньги. Спасибо заранее.</p><p><br /></p><p>[Translation: Hello! Today, it was unpleasant to wonder that every month on the card was written off the cost for Xbox Live Gold level from December 2017, although I bought a child subscription for only one month. After the amount was written off today 17.03.2018. If there is a possibility I would like to cancel the subscription and return the money. Thank you in advance.]</p>

                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;How do I duplicate a video project made with Windows 10 photos app? </p>
<p>There's no mechanism to copy and paste a project. Where is the project file stored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backing up to onedrive just stores a copy of the video clip within the project, not the actual project itself so there's no way you'd be able to restore the original project from just the clips alone, you'd need to backup the project file too</p>
<p>
</p><p>what am I missing??</p>

            Hi Anna, you are not missing anything . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft has not given us the ability to locate the Video project file, so we cannot copy, backup, move or duplicate that project file.
<br />
<br />A lot of users are asking for this functionality, so hopefully Microsoft intends giving us this ability in a future update . . .       
        </p>
