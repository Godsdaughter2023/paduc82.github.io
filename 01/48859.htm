<h2>            Windows 10 updates wipes out application settings in the registry</h2>
                    <p>Currently on Windows 10 V1803.</p>
<p>2 days ago a windows update came out that wiped out the regisry settings for Cisco VPN.</p>
<p>In previous feature updates we've had AS400 and even symantec AV wiped out by the installation of feature updates.</p>
<p>How can we avoid having our applications registry settings removed when we update windows 10?</p>
<p>It didn't happen in windows 7.</p>

<h2>            View recently used programs in start menu in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;<br />
</p>
How do you get <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>recently&nbsp;used</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not frequently used</span></strong>) programs to show up in the Windows 10 start menu?? &nbsp;I really hope that one can accomplish this by standard settings otherwise it's yet another reason to start use "Classic
 Shell" again...&nbsp;<br />

Thanks in advanced!<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is very simple. With the new Windows 10 you can access a lot of Windows functions and&nbsp;features by simply typing in the search bar or asking Cortana.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here's how you can personalize it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Type '<em><strong>recently</strong></em>' in the search bar and click on '</span><em><strong>Show recently opened items in jump list on Start or the Task Bar' .</strong></em></p>
<p><span>On clicking on it, it&nbsp;should take you to the personalization Window and from the
<strong>start</strong> category,&nbsp;&nbsp;you have to turn on &nbsp;</span><span>'</span><em><strong>Show recently opened items in jump list on Start or the Task Bar'.
</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You're good to go.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Hope this post is helpful. Get back to us with the results. We are happy to help.</span><span>&nbsp;

            Love the new windows, but this is a miss. &nbsp;Seems like it would easy enough for them to add this feature back in. &nbsp;Searching isn't the same has having it appear like the other lists. &nbsp;Microsoft....please consider adding this feature.

            <p>This was not helpful,</p>
<p>The current build of Win 10 removes features that had been constant for many generations of Windows. Even going to the Settings / Personalization / Start shows that the items were removed and replaced with mostly worthless toggles, Used to be able to set
 number of items to show and let the menu grow automatically.</p>
<p>Please correct so that this can be useful again.</p>

<p>This is not the same...<br />
<br />
The Start menu can show, at the top, "recently added apps"...<br />
What we are looking for (and would simplify work for many users) is a "recently used apps" instead&nbsp;</p>
<p>(or with - before or after) of that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not having the option for recently used apps, is not just a feature missing - It's a BUG in Windows 10!</p>

<p><span>Hello Pcopeland,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>Please provide us more information.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since from when you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which operating system is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happen when you try to install the printer software?</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you getting any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How are you trying to install the printer software, is it from downloaded media or the media provide by the manufacturer?</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround let’s try to perform disk cleanup and remove all temporary files and then try to install and check if it helps. To do so, please
 follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The following procedure cleans up files associated with your user account. You can also use Disk Cleanup to
 clean up all the files on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button . In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then, in the list of
 results, click </span></span><span><span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>Drives</strong></span> list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span> dialog box, on the <span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span> tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the message that appears, click
<span><strong>Delete files</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, please refer the link mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to install the printer software in clean boot and check if it helps, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background
 program or any of the third party service is interfering with your program.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform a Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start on your Desktop<br />
</span><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue.
<br />
</span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
</span><span>4. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
</span><span>5. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
</span><span>6. Click OK.<br />
</span><span>7. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>After you restart the computer, try to install the printer sofawarel. Once you finish with the installation, put your computer back to the normal
 startup, please follow the steps below: </span></p>
<p><span>To return your computer back to normal boot:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start on your Desktop<br />
</span><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue.<br />
</span><span>3. Click the General tab.<br />
</span><span>4. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
</span><span>5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Problem accessing network shre on home network</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 Windows 10 pcs that have their drives shared using user authentication. This was working fine&nbsp; until about 3 months ago. After that, the user password on the machines started to expire after 30 days and after resetting the Microsoft account password
 of the user the shares would work again until the passwords expired again in 30 days. As these are Windows home machine,&nbsp; password policy is inaccessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like for the passwords not to expire so my shares work. Yes I realize&nbsp; the security risks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify my shares would be accessed via 
\\computername\computershare using user account of \\computername\usern</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

<p>Hi Masten,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>You are being prompted for network credentials, it means that the computer that you are trying to, needs authentication for you to be able to access. You need to contact the network administrator for the credentials. If you are the administrator, you can
 remap the network and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, any files and folders you share from Windows 10 are secured behind the Windows login information on the sharing computer. This means that to access the shared items, the user will have to log on with their Windows user name and password as used
 on the sharing PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable password-protected sharing (<strong>not recommended</strong>), navigate to below file path:</p>
<p><strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> &gt;
<strong>Change advanced sharing settings</strong> &gt; <strong>All Networks</strong> &gt;
<strong>Password-protected sharing</strong> and change the radio button to <strong>
Turn off password-protected sharing</strong>, before clicking to <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view everything that is shared with the <strong>HomeGroup</strong> in your network, open
<strong>File Explorer</strong>. Then, expand the "Homegroup" section. Here you will see all the user accounts sharing from computers that are part of the Homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of accessing Network files and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To update this issue I use the same Microsoft account log in for all of my Windows 10 Home pcs. Being that the machines are Home edition there is no access to the group policy editor. I also am not&nbsp; using Homegroup, just the user authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that disabling password protected sharing is not a good idea so do not want to do that. When I changed the password on the Microsoft Account page I made sure that I did not have password expires checked so I am at a loss as to why my shares report
 the expired passwords yet I can still sign on to the computers without any error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. The shares are still not being accessed and as I have stated, I am not utilizing HOMEGROUP. I am still getting message that the password is expired on the Microsoft account credentials. The only other idea I have is to unlink the
 Microsoft account from the local account&nbsp; and reshare it using the local account which I believe does not have a password expiration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To update this issue I use the same Microsoft account log in for all of my Windows 10 Home pcs. Being that the machines are Home edition there is no access to the group policy editor. I also am not&nbsp; using Homegroup, just the user authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that disabling password protected sharing is not a good idea so do not want to do that. When I changed the password on the Microsoft Account page I made sure that I did not have password expires checked so I am at a loss as to why my shares report
 the expired passwords yet I can still sign on to the computers without any error messages.</p>

Hi</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Long story ... I have a Samsung laptop. Bought it years ago. I went over to Windows 10 when it just came out. After a while it started acting up, so I assumed it was old ... But then on a day on start-up it gave a black screen - nothing else. So I had someone
 look at it and it seemed to be fixed when it came back, but apparently what this guy did was to open a 'new user account'. Which was fine, because I didn't loose any data and the computer was going again. Then I bought a new computer and transferred my data
 and wanted to give the 'old' one to my son. So I did a factory restore on it. Switched it off and when I wanted to switch it on again it kept giving me this message ... The windows logo will come on in the centre of the screen then it givesthe message . Preparing
 Automatic Repair andthen a balck screen follows and I can do nothing, I cannot switch on or ctrl alt delete, no options. ... When it switches on I can see those things on the screen and hear the computer starting, but the moment the black screen appears the
 'air' that you would normally hear is also gone. so there is a light behind the black screen so I can see the computer is on but nothing else.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Is there any way to restore or reset this computer now? I have tried taking out the battery, pressing and holding the power button, everything on google I could find, short from opening it or throwing it ... Can you please assist me.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

            Hi OdeaB 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your Preparing Automatic Repair question.
<br />
<br />One option you can try is to reset Windows 10 keeping your files and apps if you want or starting fresh . . . 
<br />
<br />To do this
<br />1.	 Start your PC as Windows attempts to load and the spinning dots appear, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds.  This is known as a Hard Shut Down
<br />(Do this twice )
<br />2.	Turn on your computer for the 3rd time and it should come up in the Recovery Environment
<br />3.	You will be prompted for System Repair/Safe Mode/Command Prompt
<br />4.	Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows 
<br />5.	If this is unsuccessful, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps,
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<h2>            Does xbox really suck this bad or do I have a lemon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I got an xbox one for Christmas. We have two ps4''s in the house, but decided we wanted an xbox on for games exclusive only on the xbox.</p><p><br /></p><p>So I unwrap the xbox on on Christmas day and install gears of war. Hours later and it's only 25%, but it says I can play now. So I click on play now and the whole thing starts over. So for the next few nights a set the timer to shut down 6 hours later and go to bed. So after 30 hours of downloading it's still not done but it says I can play it now. I figure since it's 75% downloaded that this means the files from the disk are done and the only thing left are any updates from online. So I try to play again and guess what.. nothing. Now it's frozen at 75% done for the next few days. Finally after another 2-3 days it gets up to 100% completed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now I try to play the game and it has to install. I get **** and turn the xbox off for 3 months, just never have once used it. Finally I turn it and let it do its thing for

            <p>Sorry to hear you're upset. &nbsp;You said that you're using a disc version of the game. &nbsp;Odds are any updates to the game are interfering with the disc install. &nbsp;I would suggest taking the console offline for the duration of the disc install before going back online to install any updates.</p>

    <title>Real-time Activity Reports on Child Accounts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher7x7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Real-time Activity Reports on Child Accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just installed a fresh, new install of Windows 10 on my computer. I signed in via my Microsoft Account, and then I created a child account for my 11 yr old son.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was three days ago. Every day my son spends hours surfing the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every day I sign into my Microsoft Account via a web browser, click on my account, click on Family, and I click on "Check Recent Activity" beside my son's name. So far nothing is reported. Under Web Browsing it still says, "When your child browses websites
 they'll appear here. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my son spends hours on the Internet surfing everyday. I see him constantly online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He uses Microsoft Edge as his web browser. I know that he does not use any other web browser because ME is the only browser installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Activity Reporting" is enabled on the account. And I checked the box beside "Email weekly reports to me."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the third day. And nothing is reported. It still says, "When your child browses websites they'll appear here. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>How often are reports updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it real-time reporting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it actually take this long to see what your child has been doing online?</p>

            <p>Ok. That is clear. That is not what my questions were about. I know that I will receive weekly emails. This post is not about that.
</p>
<p>Let me be as clear as I can be: My questions&nbsp;were not about the weekly reports that are emailed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are concerning the "recent" activity reports on the Microsoft website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read this carefully. Notice, I said, carefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I take:</p>
<p>1. I log into account.microsoft.com/family. </p>
<p>2. I click on "Recent Activity" next to my child's name.</p>
<p>3. I am directed to a page that supposed to show me my child's recent activity. But it appears that there&nbsp;was no activity, when I know there was. I have attached a screenshot of what I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case you can't see the attached pic: I see NOTHING reported. Just a few lines such as "When you child browses websites they'll appear here." and "When your child uses apps or games they'll appear here." etc...etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I know my child has spent at least 40 hours browsing and playing games. I watch him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is going on the 5th day. Every day my child spends at least 8 hours browsing and playing games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it really take 7 whole days for me to see what my child is doing????</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing on the Microsoft website that even hints that the "Recent Activity" will not show until a week later. There is nothing that says that the so called "recent activity" is in fact not recent at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an attached screenshot:</p>

            <p>Ok. It's been over a week now. And no activity is showing at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially thought that the reports were 1 week behind. I thought that somehow after a week of surfing, and playing games, the activity would show up in the reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I was wrong. It is worse than I thought. This reporting tool does not work at all. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son uses only Edge to surf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Activity Reporting is set to ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Windows 10 PC.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For the 6to4 adapters :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Right Click on both - UNINSTALL&nbsp; - REBOOT<br />
<br />
Nothing else to do, Windows will do the rest. And you can ignore the errors altogether if you wish and<br />
on some computers it will always be there but cause no problems.<br />
<br />
On a Windows Vista-based computer or on a Windows Server 2008-based computer, the Microsoft<br />
ISATAP adapter appears with a yellow exclamation mark next to it in Device Manager, and you also<br />
receive an error message. <br />

    <title>Burning Files to a Dvd RW - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesjoey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Burning Files to a Dvd RW</h2>
                    
<p>This is a new syatem not an upgrade.</p>
<p>Why, when I burn files to a dvd on Fri 8/27, amd boot up the next morning at 6:00 AM 8/28 the ballon pops up- saying I have fuiles to burn to disc????? Earlier last week I posted concerning my problems burning files to a dvd in windows 7. I thought my problems
 stemmed form not having enough disc space on the disc which&nbsp;was a&nbsp;cd.</p>
<p>So, I though the problem was solved when&nbsp; I purchased NEW DVD-RWs&nbsp; but apparently not. When I want to burn files I go to explorer and drag my data folder to the disc, after erasing the disc if there is data on it.. Yesterday it said it was finished burning
 but I noticed only half of the folders under my data folder was burned. I erased again and dragged and dropped and this time it appears to have been succesfull (with Windows 7 I can't be sure).</p>
<p>When I booted up this morning (12 hours later)&nbsp;there's that damn balloon telling me I have files to burn. WHY? Doesn't Windows 7 know when to remove the temporary files?</p>
<p>I've re-checked the disc I burned to and the files are there.</p>
<p>In my post earlier in the week I got much usefull unformation but the only info I require here is how to burn FILES to DVD-RW iun Windows 7. Not pictures, music or movuies or anything else. Seems even after a week I still&nbsp;too stupid to figure it out.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are many ways in which you can burn a CD/DVD in your system. I would suggest you to follow the articles mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Burn a CD or DVD in<span>Windows</span> Explorer</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regarding the temporary files that are to be removed once the burning process is completed, you will get an option when you burn the DVD, whether to delete the files
 once you have done burning. You should check that box in order to automatically delete the files after you have burned the files on the system.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you and Regards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>The example is a bit different than what I see.</p>
<p>When I drag the folder(s) I want to burn to the right pane and drop it I then see a info box saying it is copying from (OS) C: to (DVD/CD) F:. I wait, and then I click the Burn to disc button.</p>
<p>Why the 2 procedures (Copy and Burn)? I don't see 2 perocedures&nbsp;in the examples.</p>
<p>And again&nbsp;the next time I boot I'll see that balloon telling me I have files to burn.</p>

<p>Although I don't believe it matters what type of file(s) i'm burning it's many different types. I drag my "DataFiles" folder which has all the data I wish to save... txt, jpg, accdb, rtf, shouild I go on?</p>
<p>Just wondering why when I burn folowing the same procedure in the example i see the copying info box and i don't see it in the example.</p>
<p>I am able to burn the selcted folders to the dvd.&nbsp; But I need to double check.</p>

            You will not be starting in Safe Mode or any other kind of mode with that error (as stated earlier).<br />
<br />
Tell us what your antivirus/antimalware situation is since that is usually the cause of missing system files.<br />
<br />
I suggest the Hiren's Boot CD instead of the Recovery Console since depending on your configuration and hardware, you may run into some quirky issues with RC.&nbsp; These things do not manifest themselves with the Hiren's CD.&nbsp; Hiren's also has a friendlier interface
 that you are already used to using.<br />
<br />
If you can't find a copy of kdcom.dll to replace your missing/suspicious one in either of these two locations:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
From a working system, download one from my SkyDrive, copy it to a floppy or USB thumb drive and
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sneakernet</a></i> it to the afflicted system and copy/replace it into this folder where it belongs.<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in this folder (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\inf<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>kdcom </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>kdcom.dll</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to copy/paste the downloaded file in the correct folder on your system.<br />

            ElderL says "Do or do not.&nbsp; There is no try!"<br />
<br />
You could follow that advice from ElderL, but it is a little outdated and now ElderL has some better idee-ers.<br />
<br />
If you mean you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start because of an error in the software.<br />
Please report this problem as :<br />
load needed DLLs for kernel.<br />
Please contact your support person to report this problem.<br />
<br />
...and when you choose to boot in Safe Mode (do try and confirm), the last thing you will see loading is:<br />
<br />
...system32\BOOTVID.dll<br />
<br />
then you will see the same message as before:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start because of an error in the software.<br />
Please report this problem as :<br />
load needed DLLs for kernel.<br />
Please contact your support person to report this problem.<br />
<br />
The meaning is that this file is probably missing or corrupt (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\kdcom.dll</b><br />
<br />
Since that is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection cares about, it should never be missing.&nbsp; If it really is missing, it was probably quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus/antimalware application.<br />
<br />
There are likely to be good copies of the file on your system here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
or perhaps here depending on your configuration:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
There is also one on my SkyDrive that you can download to a working machine and sneakernet it using a floppy or USB memory device to the afflicted machine and copy it to where it belongs.<br />
<br />
Tell us a little more about your system...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
You are going to have to boot on something to fix it, so you should make a Hiren's Boot CD and then you can see about replacing the file.&nbsp; The Hiren's Boot CD will sometimes be easier than using the XP Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />

<p>Is your console a Xbox 360 Original, S, or E?</p>
<p>Can you please be more specific? Is it only one line, two, three or four. Four is that the entire power button is creating a circle. I will post what these mean and tell me if any applies to you.</p>
<p>One light: System Error. &nbsp;You can try removing the cables and reconnecting them, removing the hard drive, or disconnect memory units or USBs. (Do you see a error code that says E74 or another error? Or nothing at all?)</p>
<p>Two light (Half circle): Your console came be really close to other items, make sure the area where the Xbox 360 is clean so it won't over heat. If it is clean, let it cool down for an hour or so.</p>
<p>Three lights: Either your Xbox 360 or power supply is experiencing a hardware failure. (What's color of your light on the power supply? Tell me.) Cool down your Xbox 360 and power supply and try a different electrical outlet. If it doesn't work... you might
 need to replace it. </p>
<p>Four lights: (Full circle): Possibly a problem with the AV cable is plugged in. Turn of the tv and xbox 360, unplug the cords then plug them in. Then turn both things on. If that doesn't work try a different AV Cable. &nbsp;If that doesn't work.... sadly... you
 will need to have it fixed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>(Looks like it's four light)</p>

<p>Xbox E version. It's a solid light in the middle. Starts off green then as soon as the cable is plugged in there's a green ring but the middle turns red. Middle remains red.</p>

<p>"There is a solid red light on my console and the screen is blank."</p>
<p>Try the following steps:</p>
<p>Let the power supply cool for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Plug the power supply into a DIFFERENT WALL OUTLET.</p>
<p>Disconnect and reconnect all accessories.</p>
<p>Check the power supply.</p>
<p>Remove the hard drive.</p>
<p>*If the above steps don’t solve the issue, order a replacement POWER SUPPLY from the Xbox Online Service Center.*</p>
<p>The XBOX 360 is not the problem, it's the power supply that is faulty. </p>

<p>A solid red dot is unlikely to appear if the power supply is faulty.</p>
<p>The red dot is the same as the red ring of death on the older consoles.</p>
<p>Without an error code it could possibly be a hard drive error or a faulty cable.</p>
<p>Try removing the hard drive and restarting it and try some other cables if you have any.</p>
<p>Other than that it will need a microsoft repair.</p>

Enable NumLock, hold the ALT key and type 6 and 1 on the numeric key pad. Then let go of the ALT key and the = should be there.

<h2>            State of Decay 2 won&#39;t let me go fullscreen</h2>
                    As stated above, SOD2 does not allow me to go Fullscreen. It only allows me to go Windowed or Windowed Fullscreen. Resolution said 1920x1080 but when I check, it was only 1280x720 on the GameUserSettings.ini. Can anyone help?

<p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replicate this issue on my end and it seems that it's an in-game issue that we need to address to the game developers. To give you an idea, there are players who also have the same problem in the game wherein they can't play the game in fullscreen mode.
 I recommend that you address this concern to the game developers so that we can have this option available in the game and get this issue fixed. They have the available tools needed to make adjustments and add features in the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need clarifications. We'd be glad to further assist you.</p>

            As players, we have tried to communicate to the game developers this issue. They are adamant about it being the Windows App fault. Please relay to the game developers whatever help you can hand them! This game is toast with this issue

<p>
</p><p>Means: When windows goes to sleep on my command the computer stays totally unprotected on the next wake up. no matter how long since sleep was initiated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>P.S.: That update/upgrade took around 3 hours, was totally not worth it and introduced more bugs and slowness... Also 1511 resets some security settings, again!</p>

            <p>So i solved the problem myself. i would call it a security bug, but whatever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem: With windows 10 you should never use a Screen saver or any option in the screen saver menu in combination with the Sign-In feature. They bite each other like a retarded dog biting its tail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case i had it configured to always Require Sign-In and having a Blank Screen Saver configured to go on after 5/30 Minutes (Battery/AC). The Screen Saver Requiring a password on login. Sleep mode after 30 Minutes of inactivity on battery, AC without
 sleep mode.</p>
<p>Sane configuration? Only if you don't use a patchwork OS with features that bite each other. Can't lock the computer in the time the screen saver did not activate.</p>
<p>The screen save configuration disables/overwrites the sign-in feature completely, it should be the other way.<br />
</p>
<p>So to have Sign-In work all the time: Disable a screen saver completely, no password check in the screen saver dialog and the time to 0/disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this means that you can only use the sleep after x minutes feature to get windows turn off and lock automatically, i have found no configuration to make it just lock but continue running (not sleeping)...</p>

<p>the easiest solution is to run a phono (RED AND WHITE) cable from the back of the T.V into your surround sound output unit! &nbsp; then any sound that is emitted from the T.V will be heard on the additional speakers as well! &nbsp;I did this with a simple HI-FI unit
 and when I switch to AUX input I can hear the t.v&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes thats true but that can be done with a system that would be like 5 channel stereophonic sound, &nbsp;it works good with surround simulators. &nbsp;But lets just assume the question of surround sound is asking if Netflix plays movies with more than two channels.
 &nbsp;Netflix actually produce's digital signal for 5.1 Dolby Digital. &nbsp;Or just digital I'm assuming. &nbsp;But In my case it works with 7.0 bass through the mains. &nbsp;I even pick up the DD lock.</p>

    <title>How do I get rid of OSRSS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lightingmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get rid of OSRSS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, now that my computer has restarted twice, dumping things that I was working on and taking hours (not to mention a bunch of blood-pressure meds) to reconstruct, I am trying to remove&nbsp;Windows 10 Update Facilitation Service, aka OSRSS. It won't respond
 to a netstop command, I can't manually disable it from Services.msc, and (more interestingly) when I try to remove the update that supposedly installed this worthless thing (KB4056254) I am told that update in not installed on my computer. So, my question
 is: How do I remove OSRSS from my machine? And,&nbsp;tangentially, how did this thing get on my machine in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any and all assistance that may be rendered.</p>

<br />
<br />This is a update facilitation service that cannot be easily removed. 
<br />
<br />The best option would be a repair upgrade which would reinstall the current version of Windows 10 you have to its default state.

</p><p>Hope that helps, as I have no desire to do any type of reinstall- way too many programs and settings to have to restore to get back up and running. At that point, it may as well be new laptop time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, not sure how it got onto my machine as the documentation only mentions 1703 and before. Arrgg!</p>

            Thats why the repair upgrade would be best, it would reinstall Windows 10 1709 to build 16299.15 while keeping your apps, files and settings.

<p>K. Will you walk me through it? I see the reset and the clean install options, but not the Repair Install you are mentioning- maybe I'm just confusing it with something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recent system image if it doesn't work, so I'm down to try. Again, I appreciate the help.</p>

            <p>Hi.. I tried you Method nbr. 1. and got Error. ox80070005 and Context restricted.&nbsp; Hate this win 8 stuff.&nbsp; I had to buy a win 7 button so I would have a task bar. Now&nbsp;can use either use win 7 or 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure how to get the error off you method nbr 1.&nbsp; Guess
 can't use that idea.</p>
<p>So tried your Method nbr 2&nbsp; and it cleared App caches.&nbsp; Went to ck my App's to make sure I still didn't have the card game. " Hearts Deluxe"&nbsp; Then went to store and now it not listed in Card game?
</p>
<p>Must of got taken off now.. I use to have it a few months ago, but lost it. Noel &amp; Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> mrucci85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to Brother MFC-240c network printer from Windows 7 computer</h2>
                    The base computer of my network that is directly connected to the internet and my router is a Windows Vista (32bit) machine. My computer is connected through the network to access the internet and the printer connected to the base computer. My computer
 was also running Vista and the networking worked fine.<br />
<br />
I have installed Windows 7 (64-bit, not by option, did it automatically) on my computer, and now I cannot connect to the printer on the Vista machine. I can access the internet (although it is substantially slower than when I had vista) and the shared files
 on the base computer, but I cannot setup the printer. The printer is a Brother MFC-240c<br />
If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

<p>To share a network printer being hosted by a computer running a 32 bit operating system with another computer running a 32 bit operating system, Vista or XP, you would go to Control Panel
 &gt; ‘Printers’ &gt; ‘Add Printer’ &gt; ‘Add a network printer’.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apologies if you consider that I am stating the obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharing a printer being hosted by a computer running 32 bit Vista or XP with a computer running 64 bit Vista is not obvious, because if you use the above method, it will not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how? First, you need to know the name of the computer which hosts the printer, and the name of the printer to be shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sitting at the host computer: The procedure is the same for Vista and XP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Computer Name tab &gt; Change button. Write down the name that you see here because this is the computer name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Printers and Faxes &gt; Right click on the printer to be shared &gt; Properties &gt; Sharing tab. Write down the name that you see here because this is the printer name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK. Now sit in front of the Vista 64 computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Printers &gt; Add printer &gt; Add a local printer &gt; Click on ‘Create a new port’ &gt; ‘Local Port’ &gt; ‘Next’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The port name will look like this:
\\Computer name\printer name</p>
<p>So enter the names already retrieved, ensuring that you use the same format, then click ‘OK’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, you will be presented with the ‘Add New Hardware’ process. You can either select the make and model of your printer from the lists or insert your printer installation disk
 if you can’t find yours. The printer will be added, and you should be able to print a test page.</p>

            I am assuming you are getting an error stating that the print driver for 64bit is not installed in the Vista machine.&nbsp; You can either install a 64bit driver that has the same name as the x86 print driver on the Win7 machine and reattempt the connection,
 install the 64bit driver that has the same name onto the Vista machine (for other 64bit machines) but this is more difficult.<br />
<br />
You can also configure the machine to check on Windows Update for a print driver that has the same name as the 32bit print driver.&nbsp; If gpedit.mcs launches for the Windows version you have.<br />
Computer Configuration<br />
Administrive templates<br />
Printers<br />
Extend point and print connection to search windows update<br />
<br />
If there is no matching driver name, you cannot make an RPC connection but you can create an SMB connection.&nbsp; Search for Local Port.&nbsp; There are many posts on this.<br />

<h2>            Error code 0x80073cfe when trying to add an account</h2>
                    <p>When the xbox one&nbsp;is turned on, the account that is set to sign in automatically is not doing so. This account&nbsp;has disappeared from the 'who are you' sign in page when I tried to sign in manually. When I tried to re-add the account I got the error code&nbsp;<strong>0x80073cfe</strong>. I've reset the xbox a few times now and no luck.</p>
<p>Also, when I select to report a problem, it returns the error "database disk image is malformed
<strong>0x87af000b</strong>".</p>
<p>Also had 2 other error codes:</p>
<p><strong>0x80240024</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>0x87e10008</strong><br />
</p>
<p>But I can't remember what caused these..</p>
<p>I can't find anything online about how to resolve these codes! :( The only forum posts I have found are about the errors on windows 10.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
