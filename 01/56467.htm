                    My Compaq PresarioCQ40 Laptop is using Windows 7 32 bit. In the Device Manager I found two items with an Exclaimation Mark right next to "Bluetooth Peripherial Device" under Other Devices. From the properties I found that those two items with problem are
 located on "Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator".&nbsp; I tried to perform Windows update to get the driver but it says no update available. And I can't find this driver online. Can anyone help me to solve this problem? Many Thanks

            Unless you tell us the make and model of the computer and your video card there is little we can do but guess. &nbsp;Two things that can affect installation are third-party anti-malware programs (you should uninstall) and SD cards (you should disconnect).

            <p>As you know from the driver download page for your HP Pavilion IQ506t, the latest drivers are for Windows 7. &nbsp;That does not mean that Windows 10 wont run, but if there is an incompatible device you are unlikely to fix it. &nbsp;You need to check for the exact
 name of the video adapter by when you get video back. &nbsp;You can see it by expanding the Display Adapter entry in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a Windows 7 Installation Disk? &nbsp;If you do you can boot into it and instead of installing use the Repair options to see if you can repair Startup. &nbsp;If not, do you have a recent system backup and a rescue disk to boot into and do an offline restore?</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>

</p><p>You can start the computer with the dvd and choose the repair options instead of Install Now to see if you can repair the installation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have your files and folders backed up on a usb flash drive or in the cloud? &nbsp;If you do you could just do a clean install of Windows 10 by inserting the dvd and then turning the computer off and back on. &nbsp;When you get to the Product key page, click
 the link "I don't have a product key" at the bottom of the page. &nbsp;Windows 10 will activate when the installation completes.</p>

            Hi kavithap
<br />
<br />DeliveryOptimization is a folder where Windows stores the Windows Update Cache
<br />
<br />Windows Updates are delivered as a Peer to Peer operation (file sharing very similar to how films are shared on the Internet), you download the updates form many computers all over the world and in turn, other computers around the world get the updates from your computer
<br />
<br />You can safely empty that folder, but do not delete that folder
<br />
<br />To control the size of that folder, and indeed the data used by Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Advanced options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced Options

    <title>Ghost keyboard layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m.m.m.ac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ghost keyboard layout</h2>
                    When I attempt to build a keyboard layout inside MSKLC 1.4, I get this message: "The keyboard name 'xxxx' is already in use on this machine".<br />
But there is no longer such keyboard layout. I can't find it in program &amp; features, the registry or in the c:\windows\system32\ folder. Yet it pops up in Region &amp; language setting, when adding a keyboard. I have had this problem (with various keyboard layouts)
 on and off many times, without any apparent cause. Usually, I am forced to change the name of my keyboard layout slightly before it works.&nbsp;

            The problem with the partitions started when I first clean installed windoes 7 64 bit professional and still there 2 months later.
<div><br />
<div>I have two drives a 160 gig drive for my windows and a second drive 1 terrabyte partitioned into two.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>No I haven't asigned a drive letter to the third partition on the 160 gig drive and I cannot access it, I'm pretty sure it's a duplicate entry of the second partition on the partition table.&nbsp;although it's not meant to be there my windows drive should only
 have two partitions the system reserved and windows partition and it should only report that I have around 160 gig drive with both partitions not the 290 plus gigs it says now (physically impossible) and definitly not 3 partitions.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can't use any third party partition tools as they all report corrupt partition table and cannot even select windows partition when I put my install DVD and select repair mode.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only good thing about it all is windows boots and runs fine.</div>

            Since no one replied I bit the bullet and backed up, &nbsp;formatted my hard drive. Done a new install with a new terrabyte harddrive and Nvidia graphics card. this time the partitions were correct and have no problems until i went to activate my windows 7
 pro x64 which told me that my product key was invalid so after getting the run around from support i had to purchase a new product key. now&nbsp;everything s&nbsp;fine. Microsoft should allow for upgrades!!! What if a hard drive fails?, what about if you wanted to buy
 and install the latest graphics card? and i hate to think if the worse case&nbsp;scenario something happens to my motherboard. Paying for a new product key&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;a problem for me but what gets me is that i I've only activated my old key once.

            Microsoft <strong>does</strong> allow for hardware upgrades. Windows uses some kind of algorithm that calculates a key based on the motherboard, the CPU, the hard disk and various adapters. If you replace few things (e.g. a hard disk or a network adapter)
 then the licence remains valid. If you change too many (e.g. the motherboard) then the licence becomes invalid.

            You see all the storage devices connected to your motherboard (internal and external) using Computer Managerment. This is also where you can assign and reassign drive letters, Name your drives, format, partition, etc. Type Computer Management in search
 to quickly find or look for it on the Control Panel.

<h2>            Code 8008005 Windows Update encountered an unknown error</h2>
                    <p>Running on Windows 7 Ultimate, updates started failing a few weeks ago, then when I looked at the laptop just before Christmas I noticed ALL updates have been removed, even though it is still running SP1. If I try to check for updates I get the above error.
 Similarly if I try to go to IE10, that fails because of missing updates, if I try to install them manually then I am told they are not relevant for my computer.</p>
<p>I have run the MS Fixit utility, which identifies a problem, tells me it has fixed it, but in reality it does not make any difference</p>
<p>Norton 360 is the AV product, hav etried turning this off but it makes no difference</p>
<p>iTunes has been removed as I read this may cause issues, makes no difference</p>
<p>I have searched the various forums over the last few days and tried all options found, nothing works</p>
<p>Hardware is a Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop, with 4Gb RAM</p>
<p>I thought I may fix it by going to Windows 8, but without the fully updated Win 7, the upgrade fails</p>
<p>Any helful suggestions will be much appreciated</p>

            Hi Mahesh B G
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response. As mentioned in my original post, I have tried every solution I could find, however, let me address your questions specifically:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 1 - a clean boot has been tried and makes absolutely no difference, in fact it has been tried a few times in the hope that something may have changed to make it work, however it does not</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2 - MS Fixit is useless unfortunately. It tells me that "Windows update components must be repaired" and flags it as succeeded, however this is not the case as &nbsp;the update still fails in exactly the same way as prior to running the Fixit utility</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 3 - chkdsk has been run, it did offer up some errors which were allegedly fixed but it makes no difference to the problem. Windowsupdate.log file is zero bytes which does concern me, as does the fact that updates used to work, then failed and all
 updates seem to have disappeared, except for SP1</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 4 - This would be quite an onerous task given the laptop reports no updates are installed, so I guess it would be a case of trying to do everything from SP1 onwards. However, selecting random security updates and attempting the install, I find that
 WUSA (Windows Update Standalone Installer) goes off "searching for updates on this computer" and gets no further</div>
<div><br />
<div>May I also add that the MS malicious software removal tool has been run, Norton 360 scans have been run (in addition to the product being disabled) but all have failed to help</div>
<div><br />
<div>I cannot reinstall Win 7 from dvd as I am told that my current installation is more recent than what is on the dvd (suggesting some type of update is actually installed), and of course I cannot upgrade to Win 8 as the installation of Win 7 is not fully
 updated. Also, IE10 will not install as the prerequisites are not met, but attempting to install any of them meets with a "not relevant to your computer" error</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am at the point of backing up what data and applications I can and reinstalling the whole machine, which is my absolute last resort, but it seems nothing else is going to work</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once again, my thanks for looking into this - and if I can upload any log files that will help, please let me know. I have checked the legitimacy of my Win 7 install and it passes the MS test for being a legal, so I have discounted that as a possible issue</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rob</div>

            PS - I should also add, for total clarity - there are no updates reported as installed, any more despite them being automatically installed until a short while ago (I cannot be more specific as the laptop is used by my 11 year old son)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>There have been no recent hardware changes, however I have removed some games my son installed, mainly because the disk capacity was down to 10Gb free, there is now nothing on there which is newer than my best guess of when the updates were last working</div>

            <p>Your computer is quite old and Dell only provide drivers for your model for Windows XP and Vista. You can update your BIOS from version A04 to A09:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/inspiron-1520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/inspiron-1520</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flashing the BIOS is not without risk so you should backup your data files as a precaution&nbsp; Follow all instructions extremely carefully. Read the service manual:<br />
<a href="http://search.dell.com/results.aspx?s=dhs&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=19&amp;k=how+flash+BIOS+Inspron+1520&amp;cat=sup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://search.dell.com/results.aspx?s=dhs&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=19&amp;k=how+flash+BIOS+Inspron+1520&amp;cat=sup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I think you need to update the BIOS</p>

            <p>Thanks for the information. I have carried out the BIOS flash and found that updates appeared to start working, in fact the laptop downloaded 19, shut down, then downloaded a further 1.</p>
<p>However, whilst viewing history showed the updates installed today, searching for installed updates reported nothing was installed, and going searching for further updates just searched and searched and searched, returning nothing and never stopping.
</p>
<p>I ran the MS Mr Fixit utility which reported a couple of issues resolved and I was assuming all would now be well, but in fact it has cleared the database of installed updates and I am now totally back to square one, with the laptop thinking there are no
 updates installed and generating the same error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have further uploaded the alllogs file generated by Mr Fixit, where lots of errors can be seen in the .txt files, I just do not know how to fix them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My research on the other two errors indicates they are difficult issues to resolve. One error goes directly to installing Windows Updates and the other concerns Roxio updating. This is the eror that concerns me.</p>

<p>KB959077 relates either to the error or something similar. Are you able to check the Registry entry mentioned in the Article?</p>

            <p>I have followed the article, the only thing I am unsure of is whether on point 6 I entered the values as user TrustedInstaller or as myself, I did not see how to check. Other than that my error messages (at the DOS box) and entry values were exactly as per
 the example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uploaded sys and app event logs with todays date on them. Even my inexperienced eye tells me there are still events being generated, and yes, the updates no longer work, as I mentioned they did earlier when I received 20 updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did attempt earlier to see if there were any Roxio updates available but there was an issue with that web site, it is something I will try again</p>

            <p>The degree of difficulty in implementing the resolution&nbsp;detailed in KB959077&nbsp;gives me some cause for concern. How did you copy the folder name in step 5?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to locate the folder with some dificulty. I right clicked on the Folder and selected Properties. On the general tab I&nbsp; placed the cursor on the name, right clicked selecting Select All, right clicked and selected Copy. This is the result I pasted
 into Word:</p>
<p>amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7601.17592_none_672ce6c3de2cb17f</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Window 7 Ultimate 64 bit with SP1 as do you, which&nbsp;does not appear in the Applies to List!&nbsp;I am querying the omission with Microsoft as Feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is probably too early to determine whether Event ID: 12 has been resolved. The error has repeated many times but not on a daily basis.</p>

            Does that means that I can't use my new computer to print labels or envelopes. &nbsp;I'm really mad if that is so. &nbsp;I can't believe you would take away such a basic feature. &nbsp;I typed a letter and now I was about to print may name and address as well as the
 addressee on an envelope and I can't how stupid is that. &nbsp;I'm so so so mad. &nbsp;why would you do that? to force people to buy Word program? This is unacceptable.

<p>StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 Repair Disk
<br />
when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed how to make a Windows 7<br />
Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made on any computer with a CD burner running
<br />
XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a pre-installed Windows 8 pro and therefore do not have system disks. It won't boot up but I get a message from the "Windows Boot Manager" with the message "Windows failed to start.........", etc, etc and says to contact the "system administrator
 or computer manufacturer...." then provides the information:<br />
File: \BCD<br />
Status: 0xc0000098<br />
info: The boot configuration data file doesn't contain valid information for an operating system.<br />

How can I recover? Can I get a system disk or what can I do?<br />

            <p>You are welcome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Installing Linux generally isn't a problem, just Ubuntu and Linux Mint.&nbsp; There is a bug in those distributions that results in corruption of NTFS drives under certain circumstances.&nbsp; It does not hit everybody, but if it hits you, all sorts of havoc can result.&nbsp;
 Chkdsk actually will try to fix the damage and erase your files in the process with one form of corruption I saw while testing.&nbsp; You and I both just got lucky to be among those affected by the bug, it would seem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Should you decide later to install another distribution of Linux on another partition, you should give Windows control over booting.&nbsp; I have found that it prevents a myriad of problems in Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The easiest way to do that is to install Linux first and Windows afterward.&nbsp; You will then need to add an entry to the BCD to boot Linux.&nbsp; There is a program that is free for non-commercial use, called EasyBCD, that you can use to add boot entries without
 use of the command line.&nbsp; If you want cutting edge, Fedora Linux is a good one.&nbsp; You will have to add codecs and Flash to it yourself as the distribution does not include it.&nbsp; But, I have never had it corrupt an NTFS partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But, if you have a system recovery partition and Linux has to be installed last, you just need to make sure the partition for Windows is active and the boot code in the MBR is the one compatible with Windows.&nbsp; If you do a custom install with Fedora you can
 specify during installation that you&nbsp;want the boot code to be placed on the Linux /boot partition.&nbsp; EasyBCD then can be used to create a boot entry in Windows Boot Manager to boot to Linux's Grub2 on that partition's boot sector.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But, if you are going to do Linux Mint or Ubuntu, a VM is a very, very&nbsp;good idea.&nbsp; I also have heard that there is a workaround that allows you to boot Linux in a VHD after installing it there but have never looked into it.&nbsp; (I have it on a separate hard
 drive so there was no need to do it that way).&nbsp; That is a safer way to install Linux and it will&nbsp;run on your native hardware that way.&nbsp; That is what I did with Windows 8.1 Preview.&nbsp; It runs off of a VHD but runs on the native hardware.&nbsp; Your mileage may vary,
 however.</p>

<h2>            Getting Live Mail to Work Several Gmail accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have several gmail accounts I would set up to work in Windows Live Essentials 2012 (Mail)..... I am currently running them in Office 2003 (Outlook) OS Windows 7 and they are POP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to input one it in so many words it told me to go to my Google email account and change it to IMAP I did that with no luck. I am not very Computer savvy and not sure where to go next \..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a web site I can go where it tells me step by step how to do it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not right now but eventually I will want to set up the emails to work on a Tablet with win 10 (after July 29th)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.....</p>

<h2>            Cannot load windows error 0x80070002 on login</h2>
                    The computer in question was not (as far as I know) in connection to the internet for a few weeks. When connected at my house again on startup it comes up with the 80070002 error whenever login is attempted, even in safe mode with networking.<br />
Safemode without networking works.<br />
<br />
Checked disk in windows XP recovery Console with no problems, of course the console also has no network access.<br />
<br />
My friend had the computer at his house and it was apparently working fine for him. He said the same error came up a couple times on login, however after hitting "ok" it still booted in fine, and worked fine.<br />
<br />
Attempted to boot into last working configuration, no dice, same problem.<br />
<br />
Then booted into safe mode several times to attempt a System Restore to various previous points, with no success. When logging into safe mode getting the message that the restore could not be completed.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not format the hard disk on this machine as it has some not-backed-up-data on it.<br />
<br />
The only solutions I've found mention performing manual system updates, this is not possible without a network connection.<br />
<br />
Is my only solution? Do I have to reinstall windows?<br />
Do I have another option I have not explored? It's kind of hard to do much without being to log-in.

<h2>            Why did my Sticky Notes increase in size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just updated Windows 10, PRO, 32 bit to version 1607.&nbsp; Now my Sticky Notes have ballooned in size to where they are an unmanageable clutter.&nbsp; This is not a screen resolution problem;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is exclusive to Sticky Notes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happened when I updated my Dell Laptop Windows 10 PRO, 64 bit to version 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care about the font.&nbsp; It is the size of the Sticky Note that I am referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reduce the size of these new style Sticky Notes to something that is manageable?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had the 1607 version installed for several days and have restarted the computer many times with no improvement.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In addition to the Sticky Notes problem, I have noticed the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My lock screen and my sign-in screen are superimposed on each other at startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Random print jobs fail to print (such as USAToday crossword puzzle).</p>
<p>My legacy PDA software was disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this leaves me with the opinion that this update is not ready for prime time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have just rolled back my PC (Boxed Win 10 PRO 32 bit) and my laptop (Boxed Win 10 PRO 64 bit) to the 1511 version and will wait for the dust to settle.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The symptoms were present in both devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noted your suggested steps and will archive them for any future attempts with version 1607.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have the option of reverting to my old reliable Windows 7, if Windows 10 continues to be a pain.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, This PC, how do i include folder into my user folders. &#40;like win7 libraries&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Got windows 10 working smoothly after upgrade, then doing a clean install. now im settling in and trying to customize things to my liking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do i include my videos/pictures/music from my second hdd (2TB) into my user folders (music/pictures/video under This PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can set things to be included into a library, but the libraries link does not persist (if i close the explorer and open it later the libraries thing is missing from the hotbar on the left.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>am i doing something wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>instead of having things in my Libraries i'd love to be able to do something similar in my user folders because i like having access to those folder when i open explorer, nice and easy right there above my drives. is there a way to do this?</p>

            <p>ive since been tinkering and have yet to find a good solution to this. what i did find is that you can right click on the folder (music/pictures/videos etc) and select properties &gt; location tab, and set where the folder points to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this doesnt help me with my videos however because i have over 600GB or video in 5 separate folders (Anime/Documentary/HD Movies/Movies/Tv Shows) and i can only include one folder in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>im really disappointed that the library feature seems to have been phased out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also kinda perturbed at the lack of useful support options. by useful i mean something other than contacting microsoft and waiting 3-6 hours for a open chat, or having them call you back in order, only to place you on hold upon calling you back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what happened to the good old days of IRC? microsoft too good for freenode/EFnet? this whole upgrade proccess feels really rushed and clumsy. for isntance, i know for a fact (as i have helped numerous people on irc) tht including the option to "reset this
 device" while neat and useful for phones im sure, is going to immesnly complicate things for microsofts support department. it would have been more advisable to have PC users run an activation program to determine the uneque device id, thus activating you
 PC to your microsoft account, then install fresh from USB/DVD-R.</p>

            <p>here it is just 3 weeks later, not a singly reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have managed, though nasty registry hacks, and curiously undocumented methods, to get things working acceptably. and by acceptably, i mean it annoys me every single time i want to access my media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i left a "chat with support" window open for 3 days on my second monitor, if anyone was curios as to if it actually does something. i was having my morning coffee on the third day when finally a MS 'tech', and i use the term extremely lightly, started the
 chat. so it does work. it just may take a few days to get through to a person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so then i spent the next 2 hours explaining, over and over and over, exactly what my problem was, trying at the same time to be both clear and concise, and also not to lose my temper. its a rather simple thing i wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the file explorer now opens to the page with your drives, and has your "public folders" on top. i wanted these to point to a library, because i have almost 2TB of videos, all in folders respective to their content (Movies, HD Movies, Cartoons, TV Shows,
 etc etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>firstly, i knew how to add a folder to a library, that worked just fine, but the lady i was chatting with insisted on linking me to "how to" videos and tutorials for setting up my library folders. so as i wade through a dozen or so pages on how to set up
 libraries in windows 7, 8, and 10, tat she linked i see that she mentions the issue beng resolved, and asks if she can close the chat. im like, nope. i am not done yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after explaining for a further 45 minutes that what she is referencing is not what i am trying to do, she finally just calls me, and proceeds to walk me through setting up a library, talking over me whenever i try to tell her that is not the problem i have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so after waiting patiently for her to finish i ask, yet again, how i can get my libraries mapped to my public folders, explaining that i had already figured out that i could remap the individual folders to a full file path (Pictures to D:\Pictures for instance)
 by right click &gt; properties &gt; location tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but what i wanted to do, was point the location of C:\users\blaine\Video to Libraries\Video, and i began to explain to her that it appeared to be a symbolic path, not an actual file path, and she appeared to have an epiphany. so after ~2 1/2 hours we were
 on the same page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>she says "oh. you cannot do that. does this resolve your problem with microsoft windows."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i ask about how i could get my library folders to persist, on the quick access pane to the left of the file browser, and after a mountain of links from her, i finally figure out, funnily enough on my own, that its as simple as right clicking the quick
 access pane, and selecting "show libraries"</p>
<p>
</p><p>so.</p>
<p>/rant</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope somebody finds this useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and MS, please for the love of god, stop trying to shove quick access **** down my throat. i want my libraries back, the quick access menu is horrible and completely obtuse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please make a feature option to disable quick access from the side pane, it is taking up unnecessary space, and please, please add the ability to remap public folders to libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am absolutely in love with the way the file browser looks to work, but its implementations screams out " hey, i look snazzy, but guess what? im not going to do anything useful for you! no, you cannot change me to what you like."</p>
<p>
</p><p>im one more inconvenience from going full time linux.</p>

</p><p>Well thank you for this response!&nbsp; It's been driving me crazy too....I was able to figure out how to stop things from getting onto the quick access list every time I opened something....that was an option on quick access as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question on your comment about 'show libraries' on quick access before I actually do it - does that option show the folder with the correct path (such as Pictures or Documents) or does it move the physical folder and contents there?&nbsp; I asked because I was
 trying to get this fixed by disabling OneDrive (which displays Pictures and Documents for OneDrive under My PC) - again drives me crazy as I would prefer my local document and picture library for quick access.&nbsp; I was thinking you might be able to get your
 libraries there.&nbsp; I was going to change the PATH on the One Drive folders (Documents and Pictures) however when I went to apply the change it said it was going to move all the files from my Users\Name\Pictures (or Documents) to that location.&nbsp; What I really
 wanted was a pointer to \Users\MyName\Pictures (or Documents) so I have easy access without having to drill down thought the C: Drive to find pictures or documents.&nbsp; I don't care if it's in Quick Access or under My PC.....just wondered if you knew.&nbsp; I have
 to decide which way will work best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with you on Quick Access - wasted space and shoved down our throat whether we want it or not.&nbsp; I'd like to restore how File Explorer worked in 8.1.&nbsp; But given we can't we need another way to do it.&nbsp; I also don't like One Drive - takes extra space
 (with extra copies of things), costs me money because I have more than 5G of items and eats my bandwidth (which I don't have alot of here) so I disabled it.&nbsp; But the folders persist - they sit there empty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANy help or guidance you could give would be great.&nbsp; Sounds like you have been playing with this for a while.&nbsp; I just got my new PC and am just starting to figure it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Since someone bumped this old thread, might as well address this post even though it's quite old now.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>ive since been tinkering and have yet to find a good solution to this. what i did find is that you can right click on the folder (music/pictures/videos etc) and select properties &gt; location tab, and set where the folder points to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this doesnt help me with my videos however because i have over 600GB or video in 5 separate folders (Anime/Documentary/HD Movies/Movies/Tv Shows) and i can only include one folder in there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see what the big problem is. I have a folder setup quite similar to yours and I simply pointed the Videos folder to the
<em>parent folder</em> of the ones holding all my Documentaries/Movies/TV Shows etc. So now Videos points to E:\Videos, which in turn has E:\Videos\Documentaries, E:\Videos\Movies and so on under it. So no, you can't treat the user folders like Libraries and
 aggregate multiple locations there, but I personally have no problems with the way I've got things configured right now.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>im really disappointed that the library feature seems to have been phased out.</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, they've de-emphasized it in Win10 but as you found out eventually it's still there. View tab in ribbon &gt; Navigation pane &gt; Show libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>what happened to the good old days of IRC?</blockquote>
<p>Hah, in this day and age when hardly anyone even knows what that is? Get with the times (no offence) and if you want to get in touch with MS devs or PMs then some of them at least are accessible via Twitter or hang out on reddit and even ask for user feedback
 regarding the latest builds there.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>it would have been more advisable to have PC users run an activation program to determine the uneque device id, thus activating you PC to your microsoft account, then install fresh from USB/DVD-R.</blockquote>
<p>You severely overestimate the ability of the average user to create Windows setup media, tinker with the BIOS/UEFI to modify the boot order, then successfully boot in the correct BIOS/UEFI mode and install the OS. Reset is BTW not new to Win10 and was introduced
 in Win8, and makes perfect sense for a certain category of users at least.</p>

<p>If you don't want OneDrive then simply <a href="https://techjourney.net/disable-or-uninstall-onedrive-completely-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall it</a> and hide the navigation pane icon. Under This PC you'll directly have your user folders such as Documents, Downloads, Videos etc. visible, and they're the exact same folders as C:\Users\<em>username</em>\Documents etc.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I looked at the instructions to uninstall OneDrive and sadly it won't work for me as I have Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; I don't have group policy (so can't change it) nor do I have GPEDIT or REGEDIT where I can manually make changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So
 best I could do was stop it from being a started task and exit it from from notification area which stops the syncing but the OneDrive folders till persist in File Explorer.&nbsp; I can live with that for now but my documents and pictures folders under My PC still
 point to the OneDrive location.&nbsp; On Pictures I can see where I change the location but there is no option on the Documents folder to do so (whichis odd).&nbsp; And when I go to change location in Pictures on the location tab it wants to move everything from C\UsersMyName\Pictures
 to that folder.&nbsp; All I really want is pointer to my local version - does it mean I have to move it all there too?&nbsp; I just hate having to drill down 15 clicks on the C Drive to get to my documents and pictures....driving me crazy. &nbsp; This is a friggin pain in
 the **** and I hate that they shoved it down our throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; ANy idea how to do what I am asking?</p>

            <p>Simply copy them into the respective folders in my documents and when you open apps set these directory as the default to look into. This way you will get a stable link.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; Do you mean you want to restore to your previous Windows version? When did you upgrade to Windows 10? If it is within 30 days, you should have the option to restore to your previous version of Windows. Open the Start Menu and go to "Settings" &gt; "Update
 &amp; Security" &gt; "Recovery". If the option is not there, then it must be beyond the 30-day restore period.</p>

<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 10, I can no longer import photos direct from my Nikon camera.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Does not 'see' camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the answer to my problem?? &nbsp; After 'upgrading to 10 from 8.1 I found many problems most of which I have managed to get sorted.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The one I am left with is that I can no longer import photos direct from my Nikon camera. I can import using a card reader but the computer simply does not 'see' the Nikon. &nbsp;I have other cameras and they are fine, it is just the Nikon.</p>
<p>I have done all the usual things such as checked that the drivers are up to date, and that the camera firmware is the latest version.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When I ran the Windows update troubleshooter it came up with 'Service registry missing or corrupt' Being a mere human and not any sort of 'geek' I have no idea what this means or how to fix it! or even if it is the cause of my problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have contacted Nikon and they gave me a few things to check and concluded that it is a problem with the Operating system in my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone can help I will be grateful. &nbsp;I have had a few replies from this site but none have been much help as I am not familiar with the language spoken &nbsp;(As I would suspect is the case with the vast majority of computer users!!).</p>
<p>

    <title>Game audio through headset without adapter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game audio through headset without adapter</h2>
                    
<p>I apologize if I overlooked a thread where this has already been answered, but everything I found dealt with the adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my living room with all of my consoles is right next to my room mate's bedroom. As I am usually awake pretty early, it would be great if I could use headphones for game audio. Unfortunately, I just can't seem to make that work. The settings I've found
 on the console only seem to affect chat audio. Any solutions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More info: My controller does have the 3.5 mm jack, so I'm hoping to avoid buying the adapter. Also, I've been trying to use my Bose QC15 headphones (though I've tried a few others.)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>When headphones are plugged into the controller, there should be an option to adjust the "headset volume" (which is the game volume through your headphones).</p>
<p>When headphones are plugged into the controller...</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-tap the Xbox Guide button. </li><li>Go down to the "Settings" icon (picture of a cogwheel). </li><li>You should see a bunch of volume slider settings underneath the "All Settings" option.
<ul>
<li>Headset mic (on/off switch) </li><li><strong>Headset Volume (slider)</strong> </li><li>Headset Chat Mixer (slider) </li><li>Mic Monitoring (slider) </li></ul>
</li><li>Adjust "Headset Volume" to the desired volume level. </li></ul>
<p>If you don't see all those volume options, your Xbox might need a simple <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a>. Then you can try the steps above again.</p>
<p>The game audio through the controller works just fine with my pair of Bose QuietComfort 25 (QC25) headphones.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps!</p>

<p>Other suggestions to think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a fresh change of batteries? Vibration and game audio gets disabled when the batteries run low.
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check for controller updates.</a>
</li><li>On "Headset Chat Mixer" slider bar, ensure it is set to at least (or at most) 50%. This balances game audio and chat audio from 100/0 to 0/100.
</li><li>Ensure the 3.5mm audio connector is firmly connected into the controller's audio jack.
</li><li>Test if your headphones aren't broken by connecting it to another audio source, like a laptop or MP3 player.
</li></ul>
<p>Hopefully it's one of these things!</p>

<p>Tried all of the above and still didn't get any audio. I finally broke down and bought the adapter today, and it worked like a charm. Hopefully that helps you narrow it down a bit. Even though I've already bought it, it would be nice if someone else could
 avoid it in the future.</p>

            <p>Gaming headphones typically have there private audio input that assosiate them directly to the console. Not sure about the Turtlebeach headphones, but my Trittons have a little amp/receiver with an optical input.</p>
<p>If you already have headphones though, it may be cheaper to get an adapters so they work with the 360. Just get something like <a href="https://bestreviewsbase.com/best-gaming-headsets/#Wired_Headsets_for_Xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a></p>

            <p>Any other tips regarding this?&nbsp;It's pretty straightforward on my PS4, I plug a headset into my controller and all audio is sent to my headset and audio to the TV/Soundbar is muted. Then there are separate settings for adjusting the game volume and chat volume to your hearts content.</p><p><br /></p><p>Just received my Project Scorpio, and I can't figure this out. Turning the Headset Volume slider to the max brings the volume to acceptable levels, but&nbsp;still sends audio to my soundbar. Additionally, I'm having problems mixing the game/chat audio. I want game audio at like 100 and chat at 75; is there any way to do this? I can barely hear chat if it's at 50 let alone 25.</p><p><br /></p><p>Currently i'm using 100% chat and just blasting my TV, so I can still hear the game audio over my headphones. Any help or tips would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Fault in .NET clr.dll once running on newer windows 10 version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron carlson dupage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fault in .NET clr.dll once running on newer windows 10 version</h2>
                    <p>We have some older custom .Net applications, which have been running on both windows 7 and windows 10 just fine for many years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The newer batch of machines we have been rolling out have a slightly newer windows 10 install, which is causing application crashing in the CLR.dll. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I've tried migrating the application up to the newest framework versions.&nbsp; And even under .Net version 4.7.2556, it still yields this same exception at various times.&nbsp; Its intermittient but always seems to happen on these newer windows 10 machines. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only error message the user gets is application has stopped working.&nbsp; But looking at the windows event log I've found the following..</p>
<p>When the application crashes its in the CLR.dll with the following information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting module name: clr.dll, version: 4.7.2556.0, time stamp: 0x59b8358d<br />
Exception code: 0xc00000fd<br />
Fault offset: 0x0000000000033a68<br />
Faulting process id: 0x1e94</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't have visual studio installed on any of these newer computers, and we can't reproduce the error on the development boxes as they are older. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm wondering how best to debug or resolve this issue with the framework .dll</p>
<p>

            I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to MSDN ,NET Development forum also as there this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and MSDN.

            Hi Volodymyr .... 
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<br />
<br />Your issue sounds similar to that in the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/browsers-email/20589-cant-unpin-microsoft-edge-taskbar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/browsers-email/20589-...</a>
<br />
<br />In the link is a link to a .bat file to "Reset and Clear All Pinned Apps on Taskbar" which you could consider.
<br />
<br />You would have to re-pin all apps you want pinned.

            I am not sure if you are up to resetting your PC because this is an annoyance I agree but I think if you wait it out for updates it will fix itself.
<br />But if not then a reset of PC or running a repair upgrade might fix it.
<br />See link by Andre to run  a repair upgrade.

<br />Or you can create a new account to use and move your files to the new account.
