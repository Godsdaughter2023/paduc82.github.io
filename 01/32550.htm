                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 running - Ver. 14.7.7 and Skype. I have updated the telephone number for a contact in Outlook, but when I select the same contact from the Mac contacts in Skype it shows the old telephone number. How do I sync my contacts
 in Skype with updated contacts in my address book in Outlook?</p>

    <title>Solved&#58; Windows 10 Facial Recognition Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanawful  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solved&#58; Windows 10 Facial Recognition Not Working</h2>
                    <p>After nearly half a year of looking for solution, I found it. There are other post related to this issue, but they are closed and the accepted answers did not resolve the issue for me and others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10, domain joined. Facial recognition worked for over six months. Then some updates were pushed out and it stopped working. I came across a post that indicated to remove
<strong>both</strong> the PIN and the facial recognition in the sign in options page. Issue was there was no remove button for the PIN. This proved to the 'brick wall'. I finally located a post that showed how to remove the PIN from Windows 10 without the remove
 button. Once I had the PIN removed I was able to create a new facial recognition profile and add a new PIN. After that, facial recognition was working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted a version of this elsewhere for removing the PIN. Here is the revamped version for resetting facial recognition.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>!CAUTION!</span>&nbsp;Proceed at your own risk. Ensure you have your system backed up. This worked for me on multiple systems. It does not mean it will work for you or not cause any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use your password to log in to Windows 10.</li><li>Go into Settings (click on start and select settings).</li><li>Select accounts.</li><li>In the left pane select Sign-in options.</li><li>Under 'Face Recognition', click remove.</li><li>Under PIN, click 'Remove'.</li><li>At this point, reboot and again add facial recognition. However, if there is no remove button, which likely why you are reading this, then proceed to the following steps.</li><li>Open Control Panel.</li><li>In Control Panel open 'File Explorer Options'.</li><li>In the View tab under Advanced Settings, select Show hidden files and uncheck 'Hide protected operating system files'.</li><li>Open File Explorer and browse to this path:&nbsp;<code>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft</code>.</li><li>Right click&nbsp;<code>Ngc</code>&nbsp;folder and choose Properties.</li><li>Navigate to Security tab and click on Advanced button.</li><li>Locate the Owner section at the top and click Change link.</li><li>In the 'From this 
<p>
</p><p>I have now applied this to several systems with success on all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps others who have run into this problem. Hopefully MS will fix this at some point or provide an easier method to fix it when it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers :)</p>

            <p>Hi Durgesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on this forum. I will try my best to assist you with this query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A service can be dependent on one or more other services on the computer. If the dependency services are not working properly, then the dependent service also may not work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know some information regarding this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Which service are you trying to start on the computer?</p>
<p>2) Does this happens only with a particular service on the computer?</p>
<p>3) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4) If this issue has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>5) Did you try any troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue can be resolved by restarting the dependency services of the service that you are trying to start and check if that resolves the issue. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>R</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard to open the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box.</p>
<p>b) Type “<strong><em>Services.msc</em></strong>” in the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c) In the “<strong><em>Services</em></strong>” window, search for the service that you want to start.</p>
<p>d) Right-click on the service and then click on “<strong><em>Properties</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>e) Click on the “<strong><em>Dependencies</em></strong>” tab.</p>
<p>f) On the “<strong><em>Dependencies</em></strong>” tab, click the plus sign next to the service to view all its service dependencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make a note of these services and then try restarting them one by one from the service console. Once after restarting all these services, you may check if you are able to start the service that you had this issue with and let us know the status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the result.</span>

    <title>Network sharing tab randomly disappeared Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fai bee yun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network sharing tab randomly disappeared Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I was sharing my laptop internet with my desktop for around 4 hours and suddenly it stopped sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to check on my laptop and the internet was disabled for a few seconds for some unknown reason. I went back onto the network properties and the sharing tab was missing....?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though the network still says sharing, there is no internet connection available for my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could this randomly happen?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>On my pc now (when I connect it directly to the router) it says 'network 2', surely this should say network 1? What is causing this...?</p>

<p>And not sure what you are actually stating besides show 2 networks, which can happen if you created a new one or maybe upgraded from a previous Windows OS to a new OS.

<p>I've tried all of that on the link you sent to no avail.<br />

<p>After resetting my network settings it is no longer 'sharing' but the issue still occurs that I cannot see the sharing tab.</p>

<p>That is allowing access to the internet. Not for sharing files over the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that will be on by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that is for if you want to add like a wireless printer on your PC, and then allow others to access it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you have 3 PC's connecting to the internet wireless, then the router will control it. Such as SSID to discover and the encryption key to connect from each PC.</p>

<p>Yes I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that I can no longer share my laptops internet connection with my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have WiFi on my desktop nor an Ethernet cable long enough to reach it so I started sharing my laptops WiFi with it via an Ethernet.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you both for your suggestions. I wimped out and went to my local office supply store.</p>
<p>They took out the battery and put it back in and it worked. Sometimes the simplest solution is best. What caused the problem, according to them, was that during an update there was a hiccup with the wireless service (not an unusual issue) and the up date
 got stuck. Who knew?</p>
<p>Again many thank 's for your offered solutions.</p>

            <p>Fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was with the backup TARGET disk, not the source disk.&nbsp; Reformatted the target disk, and now it is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message was slightly helpful, in that it led me to use VSSADMIN to look at the shadows.&nbsp; Could not remove the troublesome one, recommended going back to the backup program.&nbsp; That was the clue I needed.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps below to set the speaker as default sound device:</p>
<p>1. Right click on <strong>volume icon </strong>in the right lower corner of the desktop.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>playback devices</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>speakers </strong>and set it as <strong>default</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For plug, I suggest you to refer the speaker&nbsp;user manual guide and connect accordingly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Revert to us with the results, will be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>SLI option gone after Windows 7 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeanius1  say:</h3>
<h2>            SLI option gone after Windows 7 upgrade</h2>
                    I'm doing a fresh install of Windows on my comp.&nbsp; After installing Vista and setting up MB and vid drivers, I check the NVidia control panel to make sure SLI is available, and it is.&nbsp; I install Windows 7 upgrade, and install new drivers for vid cards,
 and the SLI option is gone, only the PhysX toggle is available.&nbsp; Funny thing, when I install the vid drivers in Win 7, the SLI option is available before I restart, but is gone thereafter.&nbsp; Here's specs:<br />
<br />
920 Core i7<br />
6gb RAM<br />
EVGA x58 SLI<br />
3x GTX275<br />
<br />
Please help, this is driving me crazy.

            Problem still persisting.&nbsp; If I install new drivers over the old ones, windows will not ask me to restart.&nbsp; SLI option does show up.&nbsp; If I enable it and restart, I get BSOD with an IRQ less than... problem, and will consistently BSOD on startup until I
 restore to a previous point.<br />

            I have something very similar; and still trying to find answer.&nbsp; New computer build and decided to go with Windows 7.&nbsp; Spent many hours dealing with black screen - and hanging on load.<br />
<br />
Somehow I got it to work last night, then this morning it reverts back to the same old ****.<br />
<br />
That Apple commercial comes to mind right now, and if it wasn't for the no return or refund policy on software - Microsoft would get this one back.

            Hi Jeanius1,<br />
<br />
No help except to let you know that I have the exact same problem as you - down to the IRQ less than ... BSOD and rollback.<br />
I'm using a P7P55D motherboard, i7 860 CPU, 4GB mem and 2 identical nVidia GTS 250 video cards.<br />
<br />
I had a lot of problems with the system due to a really flaky PSU but the SLI function worked then - interestingly enough. Having changed out the PSU and reinstalled Win 7 (32bit) I can't get SLI to work.<br />
<br />
I've tried increasing some voltages but I'm beginning to wonder if I need to decrease some. Just an idea.<br />
<br />
Please post more if you find anything.<br />
<br />
Thank you

            Hi Jeanius1 &amp; Tuanlane,<br />
<br />
I've been playing around with this little by little. Adjusting bios settings or more correctly reverting to the default and trying to think about what was different when it did work for me before. I never loaded Vista on this machine so I can't say if that
 OS worked or not but I can say that SLI did work OK under Windows 7 before.<br />
<br />
So keeping that in mind I've been looking for the difference. Today I remembered something that I thought was insignificant but . . . .
<br />
<br />
My video cards (identical) have a HDMI port (for TV's, monitors, etc.) and have internal connectors for&nbsp;S/PDIF&nbsp;audio connection so that audio can be included in the HDMI signal. Anyway, I had this connected before when the SLI worked so I connected this up
 again today and . . . the SLI option is back.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it yet as the roll-back is really harsh but it has stayed through a few reboots so it seems to be stable.<br />
<br />
As a side note - to get the S/PDIF wire (really 2 wires) connected I had to take out the second video card (tight squeez). When I put the video card back in I forgot to install the SLI bridge and booted my machine. Nothing specific noted and everything booted
 OK. I realized I'd forgotten the SLI bridge and shutdown the machine right away, installed the bridge and rebooted.<br />
<br />
The 2 points I thought about were - did something get reset when the SLI bridge was off and is there a correct/incorrect orientation for the bridge connector as I'm pretty sure I didn't put it back in the same way I took it out.<br />
<br />
As soon as I feel the SLI feature seems stable (when I get the guts) I'll try turning it on and let you all know.<br />
<br />
Hope this will be of some help.<br />
<br />
Thank you

            Hello all.&nbsp; Im about to try my 1st clean win7 pro 64 install and going to attempt sli.&nbsp;
<br />
However I am installing one card alone, updating to latest drivers , <br />
then after reboot and all good adding the second card to (try to) get the new sli detected prompt like in xp<br />
<br />
any previous sli problems ive had were resolved by doing one card a time like this with the original driver cd, then updating<br />
otherwise would result in screen flashing/un-synched sli.&nbsp; my high hopes r 7 can do it w/ new drivers<br />
<br />
will let you know how it goes, if i can find the message board again after reformatting.&nbsp; respond anything so it sends me an email ;)

<h2>            WOW mmo gaming mouse steel series button 4 and 5 not working properly</h2>
                    <p>After the recent window update "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1809" my mouse's windows buttons 4 and 5 are no longer working properly the Steel series software no longer recognizes the buttons when pressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These buttons work on a windows browser but as forward and back between pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A work around that I found and it is tedious to do is going to computer management uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling the drivers again then the steel series software recognizes the buttons again but after a restart the same problem comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using mouse and keyboard center but says that there is no supported hardware connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again before the update the mouse was working properly.</p>

<p>Currently using a software called Mouse Manager which lets me map these 2 specific buttons to whichever key I want. But if someone is able to find an actual fix so I don't have to use an additional software that would be great.</p>

            Just another update. I downgraded to WIN 10 Version 1803 down from 1809 and mouse buttons are being recognized with no issues and no need for a 3rd party application. I guess I will stay on that version until I'm forced to update...

 their firewall. the other day I logged in to Windows and some of my shortcuts had changed to being different icons. I clicked them and got errors saying I did not have permissions to the executable. tried opening outlook but same error. Lync and VS10 would

<p>Hi Robert,<br />
<br />
Windows boot manager may show upon startup if there are other entries present in <strong>
msconfig</strong> or if there are other operating systems installed on your computer. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you installed any other Operating Systems on your computer?<br />
</li><li>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

            i have Reason Core Malware. i did a scan there were 2 medium level threats add ware i believe, nothing out of the ordinary. they were quarantined, i hit dispose, after emptying the can a window opened from reason core saying to complete removal i needed
 to restart in safe mode required. gave me instructions, here they are: click restart button, click arrow, click restart, press and hold the key F8 as the PC restarts, when windows boot manager opens, open advanced boot options, hit safe mode with networking,
 press enter, start reason core run a quick scan. i did all that. and then after i was stuck in safe mode, i managed to get out of that, and when i restart now the windows boot manager opens every time, and stays open for 30 seconds unless i click windows,
 then it starts right away. i have contacted reason core support about this matter , however im yet to receive any correspondence. However any help with this matter would be appreciated. Thanks.

<p>There could be some system conflict triggered after the said changes. To help you with your concern, we suggest that you perform a clean boot. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will help to determine what is causing the issue on the Windows boot manager. To do this, click on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and scroll down to the
<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong> section then follow the steps listed..<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note</strong>: If the installation is successful and the issue has been resolved. Please go through the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual” to reset your computer to the normal startup.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the suggested steps.</p>

<p>Since performing a clean boot was not able to address the issue, we suggest that you disable your antivirus temporarily. This is to check if the program is causing the Windows boot manager issue. To do this, please follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Locate your antivirus program's icon on the right portion of the <strong>Taskbar</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Once the antivirus program has been located, right-click on the icon and select
<strong>Disable</strong>, <strong>Stop</strong> or something similar. <br />
</li><li>If you were not able to do this on the Taskbar, you may need to open the program and disable it using the program's menu.</li><li>Try to check again if the issue persists after disabling the antivirus program.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
If you're not getting the same issue with Windows boot manager after disabling the antivirus program, you may need to contact the program's support directly for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

                    Initially, I thought that I had lost my virtual drive when upgrading to Windows 10. Yesterday I discovered that the virtual drive was still on the machine; all I had to do was attach it. Now that I've attached it, how do I add it back into my programs
 in the start menu. The menu now doesn't list the virtual drive, so I need to know how to launch it. Thanks for any help.

            <p>Thank you for your reply. Your instruction describe the method of creating a new VHD. I don't want to do that. I have gone through the process of attaching the hard drive I already have on my computer with all the programs installed. I have renamed the drive
 and can see it in Windows Explorer. However, I don't not see the virtual drive listed in my start menu, nor do I see any way of launching the virtual drive. I would appreciate a work around for these specifics. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Wifi connection problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Windows 10 I am having strange frustrating problems with wifi and other things that I did NOT have problems with before. I am unable to contact Tech support - there is no chat available and no call backs available (thanks Microsoft for the
 dodgy non existant tech help)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERY time I start my laptop I am unable to get wifi unless I immediately re-boot.</p>
<p>Also, if the screensaver cuts in or if the laptop goes to sleep, I loose connection to the wifi and it tells me there are no connections available. The ONLY way to get back onto my wifi is to reboot the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also constantly getting a box on the screen telling me McAfee is disabled. When I click on the enable it does not change.</p>
<p>If I go to the task bar and click or double click on McAfee it will NOT open on the screen. The ONLY way I can open it to see if I do have protection or to check on scans etc is to right click on the McAfee icon and select 'open McAfee Security Centre".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also often getting a little message appearing from the right hand side at the bottom of the screen that simply says Virus Protection and it has a X next to it. I have no idea what that is it has no instructions. I have ignored it . This morning I clicked
 on it and nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody give me a heads up about these problems? &nbsp;It is extremely frustrating and I am getting sick of having to re start my laptop all the time . Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Sahil</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions.</p>
<p>I have now tried everything you suggested in your reply but unfortunately nothing has helped and I am still having problems, including a new one. &nbsp;The Wifi will be showing that I am connected (with full bars or 3/4) but I won't be able to connect to the
 internet and Windows will tell me that I am not connected as there are no connections available... confusing and frustrating !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SFC revealed there was no problem.</p>
<p>I checked for driver updates and it showed I was up to date.</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled McAfee and I did a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing these things you suggested, it then took me approx 20 mins to get the internet as I was being told I could not connect as no connections were available yet my wifi was showing I was connected with strong connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also found that sometimes my wifi won't connect and it tells me that there are no connections available at those time I have to restart the laptop and then it will connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problems before installing windows 10.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try?</p>

            <p>To be honest, my suggestions will probably not solve your problems but take a look at the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Maybe your Ethernet adaptor is connected via USB. Go to device manager, USB Serial Bus controllers and for each USB Root Hub, go to properties-Power management and be sure to turn off the option to turn off the device to save power. I never had a problem
 with my Ethernet adaptor getting turned off but did have a problem having my keyboard and mouse controller getting turned off.
</p>
<p>- At about the time I upgraded to Win 10, I also downloaded the latest version of BOINC and allowed it to install Oracle Virtual Box. Virtual&nbsp; Box created an Ethernet adapter. I had a problem getting my wifi to automatically successfully connect until I
 uninstalled Virtual Box and got rid of that Ethernet adapter. While you are in device manager, take a look at the network adapters to see if there is something unexpected there.

            <p>I&nbsp; had all of the internet problems that you stated and got quite fed up with my laptop being in airplane mode whenever it was turned on. I spent hours trying to get wifi working. My McAfee Security Protection was all over the place and seemed to be stuck
 in a loop at one stage, doing scan after scan after scan until I stopped it.&nbsp;When I eventually got the internet working I&nbsp;also kept having warnings that just about every website I went on was 'risky' (including the Microsoft website). Then when Airplane mode
 took over again and wouldn't allow wifi to run, I decided enough was enough and restored my laptop back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since tried 'upgrading' to Windows 10 again, but lo and behold, I got the same problems. Airplane mode was immediately active and my laptop was reluctant to let wifi start. So I have restored to Windows 8.1 again and am not going to try Windows 10
 again until someone can convince me that it is working properly. I refuse to waste any more of my time messing about with it.</p>

<h2>            In Windows Live Mail, why are the headings, new actions, respond, delete, and tools greyed out on my toolbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On the upper toolbar in my windows live mail the actions entitled New, Delete, Respond, Actions, and Tools are greyed out.&nbsp; Should they be that way?
</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t backup one drive folder with Backup &#38; Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan carlton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t backup one drive folder with Backup &#38; Restore</h2>
                    <p>It seems that after the most recent Microsoft update to OneDrive, my previously working daily backup using "Backup &amp; Restore (Windows 7)" in Windows 10 has stopped working. I have a separate internal hard drive specifically for my OneDrive folder. I noticed
 my backup was not working properly so I went into the settings and found that the listings under this separate hard drive contained no "OneDrive" folder. OneDrive seems to be working properly in every other way, I just can't run a "Backup &amp; Store" backup job
 including my OneDrive folder because it does not appear. I've tried other backup programs and they see the folder just fine but I would like to use my Windows backup because I still like it the best.
<br />
<br />
P.S. I am NOT talking about Windows 10 file history. I DO NOT want to use this backup.</p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more information regarding your concern. Which OneDrive update are you pertaining to? Which version of Windows 10 are you using? To check, type
<strong><em>winver</em></strong> on the search bar, then press the <strong>Enter</strong> key. In the meantime, we suggest that you set up your OneDrive account again. To do so, you need to unlink your account first by following the steps under&nbsp;<strong>Unlink
 OneDrive</strong> in this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-off-or-uninstall-onedrive-f32a17ce-3336-40fe-9c38-6efb09f944b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turn off or uninstall OneDrive</a>. Once done, sign in with your account, then set up your OneDrive again. After that, check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p>
        </p>

<p>Windows version is: 1709 (OS Build 16299.248)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneDrive update I'm referring to is what I ASSUME was an update because when I got on my PC a couple of days ago, several OneDrive elements had changed. These are the two things that I noticed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This window had never come up after boot up.&nbsp; And my OneDrive folders' status appeared in a column instead of an overlay on top of the folder icons.</p>

<p>Sorry for the odd placement of these pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously tried unlinking/relinking and uninstalling/reinstalling. I tried it again just before sending this to you and there was no change.&nbsp;The issue still persists.</p>
