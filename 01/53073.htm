<p><span><span>Hello bo tandy,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Were
 you able to scan before or are you connecting it for the first time?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 is the complete error message you get when you try to scan?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Did
 you check if the scanner shows up in the devices on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you try the below steps to fix this.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the scanner shows up in the devices connected to your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on start and type Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Devices and Printers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the list of devices check if you can find the HP scanner listed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the device is not listed, then the scanner is not recognized by your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I also see that some of the users were able to fix this issue by reinstalling the drivers and software for the printer. I suggest that you reinstall
 the </span><span>drivers and </span><span>software and check if you have the same issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is a thread I found at the HP website that talks about the same issue:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printer-networking-and-wireless/HP-6500-on-Wireless-prints-but-won-t-scan/m-p/88587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printer-networking-and-wireless/HP-6500-on-Wireless-prints-but-won-t-scan/m-p/88587</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also download the latest drivers and software from the HP website following the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4062&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=3795406#N717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4062&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=3795406#N717</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>I also suggest that you post your question at the HP forum for a better response to this issue. Here is a link you can follow to post your question:</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Gary W.R,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. Why do you think so?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Are you facing any performance issues after setting up DEP?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a security feature that can help prevent damage to your computer from viruses and other security threats.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information, you can refer to the following articles:</span></span></p>

            <p>1. I don't know. I was asking, not stating.</p>
<p>2. No performance issues. I just want to push every last bit of speed possible out of my system for gaming purposes. Therefore, I wish to turn it off, not on, and was asking if doing so would speed up my machine any. I have searched the FAQ, no answer is
 available. I have already preformed all other performance enhancements also, so this is the only question I need an answer for. Thanks, Prasetha.</p>

            Would be nice to have an actual answer to the question after 4 years. Does DEP affect performance or does it not?

<h2>            Windows Store won&#39;t let me sign in&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I'm running Windows 8.1 on my desktop and I'm struggling to download apps from the Windows Store. Each time I try to buy or download an app, it comes up with an "error code 0x80070426". After looking it up, I found that it was a sync error and that
 I had to sign in. However, when I try to sign in, I click on the designated button and nothing comes up. I see the swirling dots for a split-second and then they're gone but there's no sign in available.&nbsp;

<p>Yes, that's what portforwarding is. Guess you have it configured then. </p>
<p>DMZ is the demilitarized zone which describes a part in your network between the Internet (or better your public IP) and your firewall. So if putting a device in the DMZ you put in outside of your firewall protected home network. This is useful for servers
 which need to be accessible from out of the Internet. And for your gaming console as it needs to be accessible from there, too. By portforwarding you make certain pinholes in your firewall pointing to a certain device, by putting the device in the DMZ you
 place it outside the firewall so it will get all ports without forwarding them. </p>
<p>So it's easier to setup the one in the DMZ as you do not need to configure portforwarding then and especially you will never have to add certain ports if a new released game needs ports you have not forwarded yet.

<p>the problem isn´t only on xbox one, its also on my 360. when he tried to join my party yesterday on 360 he eventually ended up in a party on his own just like if he started his own one. the same happens vice a versa.</p>
<p>on the one i will try it out today and i will try to set our xbox both on the dmz

<p>Please try to restart the modems before testing, too. </p>
<p>Years ago we had a problem with a German provider, where it was impossible to join parties each other when being on different segments / ip ranges of this provider's network. Could be fixed sometimes with a modem restart. (Meanwhile the provider fixed this
 issue.) </p>
<p>Please be also aware that using a Xbox One and a 360 simultaneously may cause problems, too. If using DMZ you may need to switch between the One and the 360 depending on which one you use.
</p>
<p>But as it turns out it seems not to be a problem related to the One but to (I guess) the network of your friend.

<p>One drive letter can't be associated with multiple drives/partitions. Look at it as a simple matter of substitution - the partition assigned C: under Windows gets assigned X: in the recovery environment. You should be able to tell what's what by looking
 at the partition's contents.</p>

            I made the wrong assumption (again) that C: held everything, except for the recovery D: and any external drives, and had the crazy idea X: might have had something to do with RAM. &nbsp;How do you view the partitions and their contents, through Disk Management?

</p><p>In the days of DOS drive letter assignments was strictly defined and unmovable but with NT came the introduction of some flexibility which can be a bit confusing. Windows Recovery Environment is a mini operating system in it own right and it is that you
 are working in in your original post. Note in your last screen grab Volume 3 is Windows RE so you have an entire O/S in a 980MB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;MSDN article is (obviously) a bit technical but it explains UEFI drive partitioning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/configure-uefigpt-based-hard-drive-partitions?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/configure-uefigpt-based-hard-drive-partitions?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The section "<strong>System Partition"</strong> has a line to point out <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
"The device boots to this partition"</span> . In other words contrary to earlier operating systems Windows does not initially boot to the C drive which instead of Boot Drive should really be called Operating System Drive. The Command "<strong>SET"</strong>
 shows the system variables which includes Systemdrive= and therefore being a variable can be something different.</p>

            Hi AilsaJones 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot - Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and let me know whether you are able to login?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />This would help me to isolate whether Skype client is the reason or is there a problem with Skype services or some other reason.

                    I'm getting Windows Update error 0x80070003 while installing my Windows 10 upgrade from windows 8.1. I've run troubleshooter it resolved the issue to the extent that windows 10 was successfully downloaded but now it gives me this error when it tries to

            <p>Thanks I was finally able to upgrade my Windows 8.1 to windows 10. But the solution wasn't that simple. Apparently when I got my PC I partitioned my hard drive using Ease Us and it damaged my Recovery Environment option completely so I was unable to rebuild
 BCD unless I repair my Windows Recovery Environment. Luckily I found this link which restored my partitions and recovery environment. coz I also had Lenovo though a different model but it worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://amigotechnotes.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/recover-lenovo-one-key-rescue-after-resizing-partitions/comment-page-3/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I made a backup file for my system in USB and booted from there and finally I could see the option "troubleshoot" in advanced start up options which wasn't there before. From there I followed the steps described in the link below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>And then when I upgraded Viola!! I got windows 10. But it took me one sleepless night and a day. Coz I' no computer tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sis has a Dell Inspiron 5320 and her recovery environment is also damaged I tried my solutions but it didn't work for her Any suggestions???</p>

    <title>Win10 print-to-PDF &#40;Adobe Distiller&#41; and Print-to-Windows-PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bewilderbeast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 print-to-PDF &#40;Adobe Distiller&#41; and Print-to-Windows-PDF do not correctly print fonts&#59; NOT the &#34;graffiti&#34; problem that was occuring, this is different.</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1+ year old Win10 installation that works fine. &nbsp;As near as I can tell, this problem also existed in Win7. &nbsp;I use a number of font managers, and a typical use for one of these is to print font exemplars. &nbsp;So, you add several fonts to a folder, in
 the font manager, then print-to-PDF, and voila!, you have font exemplars to send to a client. Except--for whatever reason, when I try to do this, even to the point of trying to print a font from within the Control Panel--&gt;Fonts, any number of the fonts get
 corrupted. &nbsp;I am NOT talking about the Graffiti&nbsp;issue that's been problematic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do--try to print font exemplars, in a set, from one of the font managers, or, try to print a font directly from the CP--the file seems to become corrupted between the font file, Acrobat Distiller, and the printer. If you open the resulting
 PDF, and view the fonts panel, you can see that the font is never embedded. &nbsp;(n.b.: &nbsp;I should add, this doesn't happen with all fonts, but it happens 75-80% of the time.) &nbsp;It doesn't matter if the font is installed, or not. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if I'm going
 through the font manager, or not. &nbsp;(the font managers I use the most are Suitcase Fusion, from Extensis, and High-Logic's Main Type, both reputed, respected font managers). &nbsp;Nor does it help, if I switch from "print to adobe PDF" to "print to MS PDF." &nbsp;Same
 thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clear that as I said, something, from the font files themselves, to the interface/font manager, if present, to Distiller (or whatever Windows PDF handler is being used) to the PDF is being waylaid. &nbsp;I've searched the Net, and found precisely zero references
 to this. &nbsp;When I discussed this with Extensis, they are easily able to recreate it on their Win10 box, and given taht it also happens with NO Adobe product or Font manager in the midst, it's obviously a Windows problem. &nbsp;I believe, as I said, that this may
 go back to Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas, as to how to fix this? &nbsp;I'm an experienced user of fonts, and I've checked and gone through all the usual steps. &nbsp;I picked "Devices and Drivers" because that seemed to be the closest area to the topic, but Mods, feel free to move
 this post if it's in an inappropriate area. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, Paolo:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry--managed to lose this page, had to go back and track it down in Chrome's history.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used several programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensis Font Suitcase;</li><li>High-Logic Main Type, and,</li><li>Another Font manager, the name of which I can't recall, sorry.&nbsp; I stopped using it a while back, believing it was faulty--because it couldn't print font exemplars.&nbsp; (!!)&nbsp; (Possibly it was named
<em>Typograf</em>?)</li></ul>
<p>Have I tried printing other documents?&nbsp; Yes, <em>of course,</em> I do this all day and every day.&nbsp; I own and operate an eBook and print book production company, and we send PDFs of completed books to clients multiple times per day.&nbsp; I probably use print-to-PDF
 (Adobe) a few hundred times in any given week.&nbsp; Possibly as few as 100x, but not a lot less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no issues whatsoever</span> in printing documents (from Word, Excel, Adobe InDesign, MS Publisher and myriad other small programs) to PDF.&nbsp; Distiller works fine.&nbsp; I've also used MS Print to PDF on occasion.&nbsp;
 That works too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, printing <strong>FONTS</strong>, whether through a font management app, or, even trying directly from the Fonts folder (the system folder) will cause the crap results I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what the Haboro font, in Normal Demi, actually looks like, from a screen capture (taken with Snagit 13):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/191ea099-79bc-4123-8927-bc0167b37e4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/191ea099-79bc-4123-8927-bc0167b37e4c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And here's what it looks like, when I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
print to PDF</span> (I have the PDF, but apparently, I can't share that here in the forum; this is a screen capture of the PDF, and the PDF itself is at the Dropbox link shown here:&nbsp; https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4mpxgj6eoblu9x/Haboro-NorDem%20%28OpenType%29%20.pdf?dl=0&nbsp;
 ):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92584398-1686-4510-8129-7d09ad622660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92584398-1686-4510-8129-7d09ad622660" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may have noticed that<strong> they are different.</strong> This happens when I print multi-font exemplars, or a single; it doesn't happen with EVERY font, but it happens.&nbsp; Other symptoms are that the&nbsp; font is NOT, repeat, NOT embedded in the PDF, as
 it should be, for it to display correctly.&nbsp; See third image.&nbsp; This ONLY occurs when I try to print fonts and font exemplars.&nbsp; It occurs at no other time.&nbsp; I believe, but am not 100% sure, that I had this same problem in Win7, but again, I thought it was the
 fault of the font program I was using at the time, and now, obviously, it wasn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eee6ecc2-8e3c-43f9-86fe-a3c9bcee5741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eee6ecc2-8e3c-43f9-86fe-a3c9bcee5741" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as you can see, I need help.&nbsp; I've discussed this with Extensis, with High-Type, and we all agree that it appears to be a Windows issue, since the problem appears when I attempt to print the font directly from the Windows font folder; whether I use Microsoft
 print-to-PDF or Adobe Distiller's version; and occurs constantly and without fail, no matter what font management program I'm using or not using.&nbsp; You should also note that I did not, in any way, use Courier.&nbsp; The Segoe is, I believe, the font that's used
 for the name of the font at the top of the PDF, so that explains why that is there. Courier seems to be the default "go to" when the font printing fails, repeatedly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance that the good font folks at Microsoft could chime in here, to explain why the fonts are NOT being passed to Distiller?&nbsp; Because as near as I can tell, that's what is occurring--the Windows font handler, or ?, is not passing the fonts to Distiller
 (or to the MS print-to-PDF option).&nbsp; I should add that if I use the MS Print to PDF, it seems to work, IF I am only trying to print the font directly, from the font file itself, one at a time.&nbsp; But the moment I try to print more than one font, or through any
 font management program, it, too, fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I've provided enough information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KAH<br />

</p><p><span>I already </span><em><span>know</span></em> that it is <strong>not</strong> being caused by a corrupted user profile, because when I complained to Extensis (Suitcase Fusion) and High-Logic Main Type, the two main font manager profiles,
<span>they were able to replicate the problem, on their own Windows 10 machines, at their own locations with their own fonts</span>.&nbsp; Repeatedly, and without any issue.&nbsp; Obviously, it's not a "corrupted user profile," as it's duplicating the problem at two
 other companies, wholly unrelated to me, on their own computers--which obviously, have nothing to do with me or my user profile.&nbsp; Can we all agree on that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>On the 18th, in my original post, I told you:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"When I discussed this with Extensis, they are easily able to recreate it on their Win10 box,..."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with me, personally or individually, or my user profile, or my specific computer.&nbsp; I had this problem, as I mentioned,
<span>in Win7</span>, as well.&nbsp; At the time, I thought it was the fault of the Typograf font manager software, but I was wrong.&nbsp; It wasn't the Typograf&nbsp;software.&nbsp; I stopped using Typograf, over this very issue--that I couldn't print font exemplars--and moved
 to Suitcase Fusion.&nbsp; Now, I had some other reasons to move yet again, to HighLogic, but a big part of it was this--the inability to print font exemplars, and now, it's nothing to do with any of these software packages,<strong> it's Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>It's
 not my user profile, it's not my computer, it's not remotely connected to me, individually, other than
<span>I'm the person reporting it</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to confirm that Extensis was able to reproduce the problem, I'm happy to give you their names and phone numbers at their business.&nbsp; Or, go to their website, call Tech Support, and ask to speak with Scot.&nbsp; But with all due respect, I'm not going
 to jump through some hoops with a new user profile, yadda, <span>given that other businesses are easily able to reproduce the problem.&nbsp; It's illogical to think that it's in any way connected to me or my computer.</span>&nbsp;
<strong>Do you agree?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please advise as to the next steps you are taking to solve this?</p>

                    I just want to say thank you Microsoft. &nbsp;I have been a LOYAL Microsoft customer since 1995 and I am also a Microsoft Certified Professional. &nbsp;I THOUGHT Windows 10 would be THE ONE. &nbsp;I downloaded it and used it for about a month and soon found out that
 this was also..... a true flop........AGAIN. &nbsp;Since then, I went out and bought an Apple MacBook Pro and now I really do understand now why Apple commands so much money for their products. &nbsp;Are you ready for this? &nbsp; &nbsp; THEY WORK ! ! ! &nbsp; &nbsp;I have since turned
 off the PC and put it in the closet and have no plans of EVER having to use that thing again. &nbsp;This is really a sorry O/S this Windows 10. &nbsp;You clients have told you and told you and told you that they do NOT like the tiles as found in Win 8, yet you won't
 listen. &nbsp;You have not gotten rid of them but rather found a way to &nbsp;incorporate them into the start button....You people just won't let go will you. &nbsp;My computer slo

            lol, this post is funny! &nbsp;I can relate to your frustrations. &nbsp;I finally have Windows 10 working on my Dell desktop (no thanks to MS support, all they do is follow some written script, can't think or troubleshoot anything for themselves), but the upgrade
 on a Lenovo G500 laptop failed miserably!! &nbsp;Had to do a factory restore back to Win 8. &nbsp;I suspect a clean install might work better than a upgrade. &nbsp;Who knows. &nbsp;My biggest problem was the "runtime broker" using all my cpu and making the computer un-usable.
 &nbsp;Finally found a fix for that. &nbsp;MS completely broke IE11 and yes I know they have Edge but it stinks. &nbsp;So, Chrome it is on Windows 10. &nbsp;

            I was Hesitant to Upgrade to W10 because my W8.1 was working 100% perfect since day 1. I finally recieved the Invitation through Windows Update and everything went 100% perfect!!. I have a much faster machine now (Dell Inspiron 15 i3 Laptop), My W10 is
 functioning perfectly. All my Programs and Appl work Perfectly. The only little problem was with the Wake up fron Sleep and I solved that. I will have to say: Thank You MICROSOFT for a GREAT Upgrade and FREE experience!!. I Hope things continue to be Hassle
 Free with time!! &nbsp; Aaron

 Yep, couldn't believe it myself. &nbsp;Also, the Mac will save you money in the long run too as it doesn't require virus protection. &nbsp;Sure you may use it if you want and Macs can get viruses and are not totally immune, but generally speaking, a UNIX based system
 is way more secure than the epitome of insecure platforms (NT based) that Windows has been written on since its inception.<br />

            I did not want to get a new computer but I don't think I have much choice. I don't want an apple product but I sure don't want to have another computer brick on me like this (with all my files). The support is bad hence using community help. Other than
 losing everything, I think I'm more upset that I upgraded based on window's recommendation. There was no warning that the upgrade might cause me to lose everything. I can only hope that in the coming moths some sort of legal action gets started. I just feel
 so screwed over by ms.&nbsp;

            <p>:-)&nbsp; They have been using computers forever and have not yet heard of backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do blame Microsoft for not informing people that they should have a good back up before attempting the upgrade, but only because they know that complete novices are doing this, and there is always a chance that something might go wrong.&nbsp; For the life long
 "experts" I have no such sympathy.&nbsp; They should know that at anytime something might happen and they need to be prepared for it(and that includes on their Mac), let alone something as complicated as an operating system upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more these people are now Apple novices, and they may well find in time that not everyone upgrading their operating system has had no problems.&nbsp; But in fact Macs to have a big advantage, Apple controls the hardware and as such doesn't have the extremely
 complicated task to support all the different hardware that might be on a Windows machine.&nbsp; The users also don't have that flexibility either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Apple "free" upgrades, and Microsoft charging.&nbsp; I hardly call upgrades free if I had to first pay 3 times the price for my machine.&nbsp; Microsoft most likely didn't sell your the hardware, so clearly they can't charge like they did.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with you that Microsoft has done a very poor job in teaching users how to prepare to upgrade their operating systems. Given how desperate Microsoft is to have Windows 10 succeed, one would think they would go out of their way to help people
 upgrade.</p>

</p><p>Instead, they lead lambs to the slaughter and send third-party script headers to help them.</p>

            I am sorry you had problems. I have Windows 10 on three computers, an XP, Vista, and Windows 8. Now all three computers are running Windows 10 with no problems. I am glad you are happy with your new MacBook Pro. One day I may purchase one but only to be
 able to have one with that OS. I am totally happy with my three Windows 10 computers.

    <title>Uncontrolled mouse movement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neilarnold1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uncontrolled mouse movement</h2>
                    <p>After a recent update of windows 10 my mouse pointer, for no apparent reason, jumps to the top left-hand corner of my desktop and activates programs that are sitting there.&nbsp; When I try to move the pointer back to where I was working it immediately returns
 to the top.&nbsp; This is quite frustrating as I seem to be fighting with the mouse pointer to hold it in position.&nbsp; This will go on for a short time and finally it will stop and everything will be alright for a while and then it will start again.</p>
<p>Has anybody got any clues on solving this problem?</p>

            Hi Neil.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  choose the Mouse, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back driver.  If that isn't available then choose Uninstall driver, restart PC to reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If nothing else helps you can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4

<br /> 
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out

<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            I have a similar problem. My cursor will intermittently go to the top right corner of the screen and then all my open windows will minimize. It's extremely frustrating because then I have to go to each window and maximize it. I believe it's the cursor
 that starts this process but it could also be the movement of my notebook. I've messed around with my mouse settings, turned off Aero Shake, and other things.&nbsp; Not sure what to do at this point. Can anyone help?&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Blue Screen of Death when restarting the computer after installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hill-a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen of Death when restarting the computer after installing updates, error &#34;Operations are in progress, please wait&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Operation in progress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early October I upgraded to Window 8.1 from Windows 8.</p>
<p>All seemed to be running fine. In mid November I noticed that on a restart after an update my computer stayed on a blue screen saying, Operations are in progress, please wait. The machine will be turned off automatically after operations are complete. (I
 was out of town and I was using TeamViewer to remotely access my computer.&nbsp;Two days later when I returned home&nbsp;I finally had to power off my computer and restart it. The same thing happened today. I have updates set to install automatically so I am not sure
 if it has behaved this way after all updates to Microsoft products have been installed.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>The computer does reboot normally.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As it will reboot normally, except after some updates, I skipped method 1 and 2.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 3 - Updates did not fail prior to blue screen and operation in progress...........</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did try a clean boot but got the operation in progress method. After 40 minutes I powered off the computer and then powered back on. All worked fine. When resetting the computer to normal start mode I noticed that in msconfig under Services the Hide All
 Microsoft services was already unchecked and the Enable All button was already activated. Computer performed a normal restart.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p>Ainsley</p>

            <p>I stuck with this few days and finally found the solution. In my&nbsp; case issue is with a driver. Follow step mentioned below,</p>
<p>1. once you come to Blue screen, press Alt+X and select Command prompt (admin) from the list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. use Alt+Tab buttons to select the command window.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. type taskkill /f /im restoreoptin.exe&nbsp; and press enter. make sure to leave a space before each /. Even if you can't see commence window due to blue screen, you can type on command window. (to make sure you have typed correctly, use Alt+Tab.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Blue screen should be closed. Then update your driver. MY compater is HP and HP has assistant to update drivers.</p>

</p><p>I bought it in December 2013 and promptly updated Windows 8.0, which came installed.&nbsp; I was then prompted to Upgrade to 8.1, which I did and used it for a day or two without incident, only to be confronted by the blue Please Wait screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a few of the workarounds I found on various threads here, but was either too computer-illiterate to do them or was confronted by the Please Wait screen after I did the workaround.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the computer was brand new, I solved the problem by uninstalling 8.1 and rolling back to 8.0.&nbsp; It has worked flawlessly in 8.0 since then.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I very much appreciate&nbsp;your suggestion that I try a workaround that seems to have resolved the issue for other people, I (and many other users) simply cannot risk loading 8.1 until we know for sure that this bug has been identified and crushed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have read here, the problem can appear to be "resolved" by one or more of these workarounds only to recur later, for example, after Windows 8.1 updates or after NVidia updates its drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is this risk&nbsp;- the risk that the problem will recur -&nbsp;that I cannot afford to take.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computer for live presentations in the courtroom, so I absolutely MUST be able to count on it starting when I need it.&nbsp; If I get the Please Wait screen at that time, no judge is going to give me five minutes - much less an hour or more - to try
 to work around the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not that I am lazy or unwilling to try various workarounds.&nbsp; It is that I simply do not have the luxury of having the time to do that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of that, I am sitting on 8.0,&nbsp;waiting for Microsoft to announce that it has discovered why this happens and&nbsp;that it has&nbsp;eliminated the issue with a patch.&nbsp; Barring that, I would need a workaround that Microsoft has tested and can tell me with confidence
 will resolve the issue permanently before I can risk loading 8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I am expecting too much and maybe Microsoft will never really understand why this bug exists.&nbsp; If so, the risk of using 8.1 and getting the Please Wait screen far, far outweighs the benefits of upgrading to the "better" OS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something Microsoft is likely to fix with a patch and, if so, what is the best way for me to find out when that happens?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again, for replying.&nbsp; We all appreciate the support you provide.&nbsp; </p></span></span>

</p><p>As grateful as we are for the generous assistance provided by other users who have found a way that SEEMS to resolve the issue - at least for them and&nbsp;at least for right now&nbsp;- many of us simply cannot afford the risk that the problem may suddenly return.&nbsp;
 AH would not be able to access his files remotely when he needed them and I would not be able to make my presentations when I needed to make them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As great as the community here is (and we do appreciate all of their help), I have not read anything posted by anybody that explains why this occurs.&nbsp; Several people have posted workarounds that seem to have worked for them and some have provided their thoughts
 on why this might be happening, but nobody seems to know for sure what causes the problem or why any given workaround seems to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why many of us have rolled back to 8.0 and are waiting and hoping for a definitive solution from Microsoft.&nbsp; Do you know whether&nbsp;Microsoft likely to do that?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

    <title>An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Code 80244018 Windows update encountered an unknown error.</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate at home on a stand alone PC.&nbsp; I am not part of a network (other than connecting to the Internet) and I do not have a server.&nbsp; My Windows Automatic Updates stopped working on August 21, 2010 and has not worked since.&nbsp; The error
 messages says, "An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Code 80244018 Windows update encountered an unknown error."</p>
<p>From the research I've done, this error code pertains to something called Windows Server Update Services, which is used in a client-server setting.&nbsp; I don't see how WSUS pertains to me, and/or why it would be enabled on my computer.&nbsp; I do install new software
 from time to time, so maybe WSUS was enabled my mistake, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>According to my Control Panel, on August 21, 2010 (the last time Windows Update worked), I installed three programs that day:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; ffdshow (DVD utility);&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; WinPcap 4.1.2 (packet capture and filtering engine);&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; PlayFLV (utility to allows Windows Media
 Player to play FLV formatted video files).&nbsp; Of these 3, the only potential culprit would be WinPcap, I think.&nbsp; So, I uninstalled WinPcap and tried running the update again, but I got the same error message.</p>
<p>Also, I have disabled my firewall and tried the update again, to no avail.&nbsp; And I am not running a proxy server.&nbsp; Any help I can get would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a new computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />

<p>2. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; I've had this computer for about 3 years, and originally I was running Windows XP Professional.&nbsp; I was unable to do a direct upgrade to Windows 7, so I did a fresh install about a year ago.&nbsp; Automatic Updates worked fine up until August 21, 2010.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit </li></ul>
<p>2.&nbsp; No, it is a generic PC from a discount retailer, but it has 4gb of memory and a quad core Intel processor.&nbsp; It may be capable of supporting 64-bit processing, but I installed the 32-bit version of Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am running the current version (5.0.677) of Avast anti-virus.&nbsp; I don't use any anti-spyware other than Windows Defender, and I use&nbsp;Windows firewall only as well.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; No, I have never used Norton or McAfee on this system.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; No, there was no operating system at all on this computer when I bought it.</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; I am certain that something happened on August 21, 2010 that caused my Automatic Updates to stop working.&nbsp; I did install some software on that date (see my original post for details), and the event log tells me that some services were installed on
 that date as well (SMServer, GSService, DrmRAudio, and NetGroup Packet Filter Driver).&nbsp; I believe these were part of the WinPcap software mentioned in my origianl post.&nbsp; I have since uninstalled WinPcap, and I do not see any of these services running on my
 system at the present time.</p>
<p>However, I'm thinking perhaps that Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) somehow was enabled, or partially enabled, on my system due to the WinPcap installation.&nbsp; The error code 80244018 pertains to WSUS, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; But I cannot find any info
 on how to remove and/or disable WSUS, if in fact that is the problem here.</p>
<p>I did find a DOS-based WSUS Client Diagnostic Tool.&nbsp; When I run the tool,&nbsp;it&nbsp;tells me that "UseWuServer is disabled".&nbsp; I could not find any such&nbsp;UseWuServer&nbsp;key in my registry or in policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Thank you for you assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Ditto.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I ran the FixIt tool in Default mode, rebooted, and tried to run Windows Update again.&nbsp; It still fails with the same error message as before.&nbsp; I want to try a few more things before I run this tool in Aggressive mode and wipe out my Update History.&nbsp;

            If your computer hasn't installed any updates since 25 August, you're almost certainly seeing the effects of a "hijackware infection" (especially if KB981852 isn't listed in Install Updates).

<p>I ran the FixIt tool in AGGRESSIVE mode, rebooted, and tried to run Windows Update again.&nbsp; It still fails with the same error message as before.</p>
<p>Then I went to the web site, <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a>, and tried letting it do the update for me.&nbsp; This attempt failed with the following message:</p>

<p>I have run all the anti-spyware programs I can imagine, and my system comes up clean with all of them.&nbsp; I am a systems engineer and fairly familiar with most hijack problems.&nbsp; But I am completely stumped with this.&nbsp; My next try would be to re-install Internet

            These procedures are not too complex at all.&nbsp; I've done this kind of thing for many other people in the past.&nbsp; I do have Avast anti-virus running all the time on my system, and I never go to questionable sites, and my system is not experiencing any problems
 at all other than this one, so I'm a bit surprised that you are certain it is malware.&nbsp; Also, I ran HijackThis and I don't see anything unusual there.&nbsp; But I will go through all the steps you suggested and post my reply in the next few days.&nbsp; Thanks, again,

<p>I ran the Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (Full Scan), and after about 3 hours, it completed with no errors or threats detected.</p>
<p>I tried to run the Windows Live Safety Center’s Protection scan, but I got this inaccurate error message:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>We're sorry. This version of the Windows Live OneCare safety scanner doesn't work with your Web browser or operating system.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>So, I searched the Windows 7 Forums and found this comment:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>OneCare has been discontinued and is not supported by Windows 7.&nbsp; The replacement is Microsoft Security Essentials, which is free.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials is Anti-Virus software.&nbsp; When I tried to install it, I got a message telling me that I already have anti-virus software running (Avast), and asking me for permission to remove it.&nbsp; I like Avast and I’ve used it for a long time,
 so I cancelled the MSE install.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, I ran full scans with Malwarebytes, Spybot Search &amp; Destroy, AdAware, and Avast.&nbsp; All completed with no errors or threats detected.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to think that malware is NOT the cause of my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been researching this issue on my own, while continuing to work with your suggestions.&nbsp; All indications point to something called Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).&nbsp; The actual error code translation is:</p>
<p>0x80244018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUS_E_PT_HTTP_STATUS_FORBIDDEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Http status 403 - request forbidden</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is a permissions issue, I’m certain.&nbsp; WSUS is intended for Network Administrators to perform Windows Updates for multiple workstations in a client/server environment.&nbsp; It does not pertain to me at all.&nbsp; However, I may have accidentally installed
 WSUS on August 21st when I installed software called WinPcap 4.1.2.&nbsp; This is a Packet Capturing and Filtering Engine.&nbsp; I was experimenting with this software to gather low-level network statistics and perform other operations that bypass the protocol stack.&nbsp;
 The WinPcap software was not what I was looking for, so I uninstalled it, but I’m thinking that some components of WSUS remain, and this may be the cause of my problems where with Windows Update.&nbsp; Remember, August 21st was the exact date my Windows Update
 stopped working, and I'm not a big believer in coincidences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran regedit, and I discovered that in my registry I have a key called HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE--&gt;Software--&gt;Microsoft--&gt;Windows--&gt;Current Version--&gt;App Management--&gt;Publishers--&gt;WSUS Publisher.&nbsp; THIS LOOKS LIKE A SMOKING GUN TO ME!&nbsp; I looked at the permissions
 for this registry key, and even Administrators have only READ access.&nbsp; When I tried to grant FULL CONTROL permission on this registry key to Administrators, I got an “Access Denied” error message.&nbsp; The value contained in this key is 85074451-173D-4091-8648-C0E196BB363E.&nbsp;
 I am hesitant to delete this key until I learn more about WSUS and how if may be affecting my system.&nbsp; I&nbsp; just joined a WSUS forum so that I can learn more about this feature and how to disable it and remove it completely from my system.&nbsp; In any event, I really
 think WSUS is the culprit, albeit resulting from my own carelessness in software installation.</p>
<p>I hope this info helps, and thank you for your continued assistance.&nbsp; Please let me know what you think about WSUS.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I will continue with your suggestions by starting new threads in the other forums.&nbsp; Thanks, again.</p>

A1. The Windows Live Safety Center 'Protection' scan is for WinXP only. You're running Win7 and should use this online scan:&nbsp;<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</a></p>
<p>NB: While related, the Safety Center online scans have nothing to do with the now-discontinued security suite named (Windows Live) OneCare.</p>
<p>A2. You did not install WSUS, trust me. The error translation is a red herring. A more apt "translation" in your case would be "connections to Windows Update have been forbidden because something's wrong with the computer" (i.e.,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;infected).</p>

<h2>            Can you undo a trim from the Xbox DVR trim option or is it permanent once the trimming&#47;trimmed clip is applied&#63;</h2>
                    I had a clip that I wanted to post, but there's this clip I want to omit a section of it. The trim option looks suspicious and weird, so I tried the "Save Copy" option and it save a different file but in it has the clip that I wanted to omit. Also, I made
 another copy of from the omitted video and trim it once again, and I have no idea if there's like an undo option if I ever wanted to go back or not lose the original video.

<p>You cannot use a retail key with an OEM disk.</p>
<p>A genuine Windows 7 license comes in its original packaging, along with certificate of authenticity, product key and documentation.</p>
<p>If you purchased Windows 7 through a Digital Download at the Microsoft store you should also obtain access to download it through that medium.</p>
<p>How did you obtain your product key? If its through a Subscription/Evaluation Program such as MSDN, TechNet, your right to use that software is only by the terms of the license agreement. If someone gave you a key from their subscription, they are out of
 compliance and you are not suppose to be using it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 compatible IntelliType and Point  upgrade</h2>
                    I was able to update my Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 5000 drivers so that the mouse and keyboard now work under Windows 10, but I cannot find upgrades to my IntelliType and IntelliPoint Pro 5.3 software that will enable all of the hardware’s features
 to work under Windows 10. &nbsp;Does anyone know if and if so, where I can find a compatible upgrade?

                    <p>Yesterday, I noticed that suddenly my desktop and the my documents folder are shared folders. I have not done this. I have been trying to remove this without succes. RIght clicking the file or folder and go give access to-&gt; remove acces does nothing. It
 pops up a screen that says it's removing the access, but nothing changes. The icon still say it's shared, and so do the folder properties-&gt;sharing</p>
<p>What can I do to fix this, and how could this occur. My files are not safe like this.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kray_65
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Can you give us a screenshot of the share?
<br />That way we can see if this is a operating system share or a share that was made by an app.
<br />See link on how to add a screenshot.
<br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />Let’s have a look at all of your shares and remove the ones you don't want. 
<br />
<br />a. Click Start, right click on Computer and choose Manage.
<br />b. This will open the Computer Management window. On the left pane, find System Tools and then under that Shared Folders
<br />c. Select Shares. This will populate a list of all the shares on the right. Find the share you're trying to remove, right click it and choose Stop Sharing
<br />d. Say yes to the pop-up and the share will disappear 
<br />
<br />Note: Do not delete any shares ending in $. These are admin shares and are very important.
<br />You may also have a look below which would help you to unshare the folders.
<br />
<br />a. Click Network
<br />b. Mark the folder 'Users' (Or any other folder for that sake)
<br />c. Right click the file and mouse over 'Share with'
<br />d. Press 'Advanced Sharing', from there it opens up another share User Interface
<br />e. In that there is another button with 'Advanced Sharing' and it has a kind of shield, press it
<br />f. Uncheck 'Share this folder.'
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            That's not shared that compressed.
<br />one of the updates that came out is automatically compressing folders if you are low in disk space.

                    <p>Dear&nbsp;All,</p>
<p>May I get help&nbsp;per the following details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SONY VAIO SVE1513ACN _ core i3</p>
<p>WINDOWS 8 pro 32&nbsp;bits (x64 based processor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>with NON- FUNCTIONAL <strong>Vaio care / assistance / services </strong>as got the system reformatted (the saved 'system image' and 'recovery media DVD' also not able to get back the Vaio features_ media was prepared through Vaio as well through Windows)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problems&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>1) Windows 8.1 update assistance telling - unable to update&nbsp;as minimum qualifications are lacking - volume licence issue, though

Current Product Key </span>both are <strong>available</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Windows Update no. <strong>KB2976978</strong> is repeatedly being offered for installing but
<strong>not getting configured </strong>after installation resulting in removal of certain file of
<strong>Bluetooth</strong> making it <strong>non functional </strong>and switched
<strong>off </strong>under wireless devices, the icon is also getting <strong>disappeared</strong>, causing
<strong>frequent restoring </strong>of the system _ this cycle is getting repeated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Windows Update&nbsp;is repeatedly offering certain other updates&nbsp;but <strong>not getting configured&nbsp;</strong>after installation, even when chosen manually to download and install thru' WU _ help says more current version is already there -
<strong>hiding of updates </strong>also not helping&nbsp;to avoid the update offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The&nbsp;<strong>history </strong>of update installation is also getting <strong>
deleted </strong>with switching over and cycle -&nbsp;entrapment--- it&nbsp;shows that updates have never been installed, or searched for,&nbsp;though 244 updates are installed</p>
<p>

<strong>/</strong> ) that is <strong>special signs </strong>are getting <strong>switched over
</strong>due to <strong>switching over of users</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SEEK HELP and SUGGESTIONS:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) for <strong>feasible </strong>Update to Windows 8.1 and subsequent <strong>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time and effort.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are trying to upgrade the computer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Troubleshoot problems with an app</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer the link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Perform the troubleshooting steps in the link below.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2777330/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2777330/en-us</span></a><br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Temporarily disable anti-virus and check if this helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Shubham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help extended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with &nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apps troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;- it started with troubleshooting of internet and came up with _ internet is not&nbsp; connected - though I am working on / through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I checked Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, one by one it gave satisfactory results</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my Windows Update automatic option&nbsp;- over there it is searching updates _</p>
<p>how come troubleshooter is not identifying the connection - I disconnected and again connected twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening with the&nbsp;Windows Store too,&nbsp;telling that I am not connected to the net, in spite of browsing all over through IE 10 _ Windows as well on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried number of times, not moving ahead _ what to do?</p>
<p>

            Sorry for the rather late reply, but I wasn't referring to Xbox One Console. I meant that there is no Upload button on the Windows 10 Xbox App when there should be, as it is present when I sign in with my laptop.
