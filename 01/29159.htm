    <title>Cannot install drivers for Bluetooth Dongle - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot install drivers for Bluetooth Dongle</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I came back from vacation, I found out that my bluetooth dongle was not working and that I could no longer connect bluetooth devices to my PC. Prior to this, I had never had any issue with bluetooth on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I uninstalled the drivers from my bluetooth dongle in device manager and restarted my PC. However, when I tried to reinstall the drivers I received two messages. The first one said that the drivers could not be installed because the drivers for
 the dongle were already up to date. However, device manager says that there are NO drivers installed. The second message said that there were compatibility issues, which is odd seeing that up to a few days ago I had never had problems with this bluetooth dongle
 on the exact same PC with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers I was trying to install are called BCM 920702 Bluetooth 4.0. The dongle model is the Kinivio BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter. I tried installing the drivers both from Kinivio's website and from the disk that came with the dongle. I am using
 a home-bult PC with an ASRock motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I didn't known which subforum to post this in, but I hope hardware is OK.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the issue description you are unable to install the Bluetooth drivers and getting compatibility errors. So, there might be a chance that there is some compatibility issue. There might
 be a chance that some security software or startup items/application is restricting it to get installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, try to
<strong><span>perform clean boot</span></strong> and
<strong><span>disable security software temporarily</span></strong> and then try to install the drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable anti-virus&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em><span>Antivirus software
 can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're
 connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong><br />

    <title>Scale down the size of start menu tiles depending on screen resolution - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Scale down the size of start menu tiles depending on screen resolution - possible&#63;</h2>
                    <div><a href="http://i.imgur.com/k9GoQ.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Picture of my start menu</a></div>
I've spent a fair while customising my start screen (using various apps and third party programs) to my liking. Unfortunately, it goes to **** when I view it on anything with a resolution lower than 1920x1080. I'd love to have the ability to scale it down instead
 of just having all the tiles move out of order. Is this even a possibility? I know it's a pretty obscure problem, and it's certainly not a high priority. The lack of customisability in the stock start menu for win8 is a crying shame. :( Apps I used to customise
 the menu: Custom Tiles Maker from the Windows Store, The Windows 8 start screen customiser - https://www.box.com/s/w5r1ed17bmbp6pnonwxq I also use start8.

            <p>I'm having a problem that is in some ways opposite to that of the original poster.&nbsp; On a Surface Pro 2, I see the following on the Start screen at various resolutions (in units of the smallest tile):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1920 x 1080: 6 rows, big size</p>
<p>1600 x 900: 8 rows, small size</p>
<p>1280 x 720: 4 rows, big size, with lots of wasted space</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It would be good to be able to choose an intermediate size and control the amount of unused space.&nbsp; it would also be good to be able to control the font size.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are these results optimizations that Windows choses for us and we can't change them, or are there ways of tweaking these choices?</p>

<p>This boilerplate answer did not address my question, which was about the size of "medium" and "small" icons, and as a result the number of "small" icons that fit in a column.&nbsp; On 1600 x 900 I'd prefer to have columns that are 6 "small"s high, rather than
 8, which is hard to read.</p>

            Microsoft Support Engineers often do read posts, and then tell you to send feedback to Microsoft, which requires you to downgrade your privacy settings.&nbsp; Sometimes it is important to send Microsoft a data dump from your computer when discussing a question,
 but often it isn't, but Microsoft insists on the data dump regardless.

    <title>How do I isolate my &#39;System Reserved&#39; partitions from one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cookymonzta  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I isolate my &#39;System Reserved&#39; partitions from one another&#63;</h2>
                    I have both Win7 x64 (64-bit retail) and Win7 x86 (32-bit OEM) installed in one machine.&nbsp; My configuration (with the 64-bit OS active) is as follows:<br />
<br />
<b>Drive 0</b><br />
[System Reserved]<br />
C:&nbsp; x64 (64-bit Win7)<br />
<br />
<b>Drive 1</b><br />
[System Reserved]<br />
F:&nbsp; x86 (32-bit Win7)<br />
<br />
<b>Drive 2</b><br />
G:&nbsp; Data Primary (logical drive)<br />
<br />
<b>Drive 3</b><br />
H:&nbsp; Data Secondary (logical drive)<br />
<br />
<b>Drive 4</b><br />
X:&nbsp; Master Backup (logical drive)<br />
<br />
My first 4 drives (0-3) are 500GB each; my Master Backup is 2TB.<br />
<br />
My setup is such that, if I boot into my 64-bit Win7, that drive will be C, and my 32-bit Win7 drive will be F.&nbsp; If I boot into my 32-bit Win7, it is assigned as C, and my 64-bit Win7 is assigned F.&nbsp; Both of my 'System Reserved' partitions are hidden in both
 of my host operating systems...<br />
<br />
...But for some reason, I think that is where the trouble lies.&nbsp; At this very moment, the used space in both of my 'System Reserved' partitions is 29.8MB, both equal, right down to the last byte.&nbsp; Once in a while, the capacity for one changes; but after a system
 dump (or a file dump, whichever it is), they usually end up the same capacity, despite the fact that I have 60GB of files stored in Drive 0 (x64) and 35GB in Drive 1 (x86).<br />
<br />
Which leads me to suspect that, in one case or another (probably in cases where a System Restore point is created in either host OS), one of my hosts may be dumping system info into the wrong 'System Reserved' partition.&nbsp; My suspicion is due to the fact that,
 on two occasions (out of dozens of successful restarts), my 32-bit Win7 boots to a BSOD, and restarts.&nbsp; The restart is successful, but I don't take any chances; I run a disk check, which usually shows nothing unusual.<br />
<br />
Is it quite possible that my 64-bit OS is dumping system info into my 32-bit 'System Reserved' partition, and/or my 32-bit OS is dumping system info into my 64-bit 'System Reserved' partition?<br />
<br />
Should I consider assigning drive letters to my <i>inactive or non-corresponding</i> 'System Reserved' partitions?&nbsp; Since the active OS accesses the corresponding 'System Reserved' partition (or, at least, I think it is supposed to), should I assign the letter
 B (or any other letter) to the non-corresponding 'System Reserved' partition?&nbsp; That is, if my 64-bit Win7 is the active OS, should I assign a drive letter to the 'System Reserved' partition from
<i>Drive 1</i> (the inactive partition, corresponding to my 32-bit OS), and vice versa?&nbsp; My assumption is that, since the active OS accesses a hidden partition to dump or retrieve system info, it will bypass the 'System Reserved' partition that has been given
 a drive letter.<br />
<br />
Or is there another way entirely?<br />

Here is my system configuration with Win7 Pro x86 (32-bit) as my active OS:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56fa0166-9a4d-4af8-a37a-549993d5e5fe" /><br />
<br />
My x64 partition is assigned the letter F and my x86 partition assigned the letter C.<br />
<br />
What I want to make absolutely certain is that my x64 OS is <i>not</i> accessing the x86 System Reserved partition, and my x86 OS is not accessing the x64 System Reserved.<br />
<br />
Does the active OS know, automatically, which System Reserved partition corresponds to the OS?&nbsp; Or should I be concerned enough to assign a letter to the System Reserved partition of the
<b>inactive</b> OS?&nbsp; For example, if I have my x64 OS open, should I assign the letter B to the System Reserved partition of
<b>x86,</b> so that my x64 OS avoids it because it is no longer hidden?&nbsp; I assume I cannot rename the System Reserved partitions, because either Win7 OS would not be able to find its corresponding System Reserved partition.<br />

            My current configuration now looks like this:<br />
<br />
64-bit (x64) Windows 7 as active OS:<br />
Drive 0 (active)<br />
<b>Hidden:</b>&nbsp; System Reserved<br />
C:&nbsp; x64<br />
<br />
Drive 1<br />
<b>B:</b>&nbsp; System Reserved<br />
F:&nbsp; x86<br />
<br />
Drive 2:<br />
G:&nbsp; Data Prtimary<br />
<br />
Drive 3:<br />
H:&nbsp; Data Secondary<br />
<br />
Drive 4<br />
X:&nbsp; Master Backup<br />
<br />
[D:&nbsp; Blu-Ray burner; E:&nbsp; DVD burner]<br />
<br />
32-bit (x86) Windows 7 as active OS:<br />
Drive 0<br />
<b>B:</b>&nbsp; System Reserved<br />
F:&nbsp; x64<br />
<br />
Drive 1 (active)<br />
<b>Hidden:</b>&nbsp; System Reserved<br />
C:&nbsp; x86<br />
<br />
[Drives D, E, G, H and X, same as in my 64-bit setup]<br />
<br />
Quite simply, my intention for assigning the letter B to my <i>inactive</i> OS's System Reserved partition is to prevent my
<i>active</i> OS from either accessing info from, or dumping info into, the inactive System Reserved partition.&nbsp; I assume the active system
<i>always</i> looks for the <i>hidden</i> System Reserved partition, yes?&nbsp; Therefore, with my current setup, my active OS will always seek its corresponding System Reserved partition, which will be the
<i>only</i> one hidden in the active boot environment.&nbsp; The inactive System Reserved partition will be visible (assigned the letter B) and hopefully avoided by the active OS.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding System Reserved Partition I would like to inform you that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Reserved partition are the partitions created by OEM while windows installation.&nbsp;<br />
If you want to delete the System Reserved Partition, you have to contact the System Manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 100MB partition is a system partition and contains boot files. Disk Manager will not allow you to remove this partition because removing this partition could cause the system to not boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the link given below:</p>

Thank you.</p>

            I don't want to <i>delete</i> these partitions; I want to keep the <i>inactive</i> System Reserved partition from being accessed by the
<i>active</i> OS.<br />
<br />
For example, if I have my <i>32-bit</i> Win7 OS booted up, I want to keep it from retrieving files from, or dumping files into, my
<i>64-bit</i> System Reserved partition.&nbsp; The only possible solution that I know of is to make the inactive (or non-corresponding) System Reserved partition
<i>visible.</i><br />
<br />
So, I assigned my 64-bit System Reserved Partition the letter B, and kept my 32-bit System Reserved partition hidden.&nbsp; The idea here is that my 32-bit Win7 will see my visible 64-bit System Reserved partition as just another visible partition or just another
 drive, and will avoid that partition and automatically look for the <i>hidden</i> 32-bit System Reserved partition, the one that corresponds to my 32-bit OS which is open.<br />
<br />
As for my 64-bit Win7 setup, if that is open, I will have my 32-bit System Reserved partition
<i>visible</i> and my 64-bit System Reserved partition <i>hidden.</i><br />
<br />
Am I correct, in assuming that the corresponding System Reserved partition must <i>
always</i> be hidden in order for the active OS to access it?<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to give you an information regarding Duan Boot Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a Dual Boot scenario, the boot files will automatically be located to the Active partition that is on the system. Assuming that System Reserved Partition contains the boot files, performing changes to the System Reserved Partition might make the OS unstable
 or even put the computer in a No Boot situation.<br />
</p>
<p>Ideally, boot files are copied to the System partition which also has the earlier version of Windows that was installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the articles given below for further information.</p>

            A word with regard to the BSOD errors I mentioned at the top of this subject; and this is something I should have mentioned earlier:<br />
<br />
The BSOD errors upon boot were confined to my 32-bit Win7 setup.&nbsp; I assume the BSODs were caused by my 32-bit OS's attempt to access my 64-bit System Reserved partition.&nbsp; Both of my System Reserved partitions were hidden in both my 32-bit and 64-bit OS setups.<br />
<br />
After running the System Recovery procedure to clean up whatever mess the BSOD caused, I rebooted into my 32-bit OS setup to find that my 64-bit System Reserved partition was made visible and given a letter.&nbsp; The same partition is still hidden in my 64-bit
 OS setup.<br />
<br />
It is because of the results of the System Recovery procedure that I came to the conclusion that the inactive System Reserved partition must be made visible in the active OS, while the active System Reserved partition remains hidden.&nbsp; So far, I have had no
 boot problems that might be System Reserved-related.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 in constant repair loop. Unable to recover</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 3 (Windows 8.1) died catastrophically. I have a USB recovery drive but am unable to get beyond the repair loop. The error I get is "the drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again." I haven't the foggiest how
 to go about this or how it could become locked in the first place. I am something of a beginner so I would be grateful if someone could talk me through, in the simplest language, how to deal with this. I have been struggling for three days and am now rather
 desperate! Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are trying to run automatic repair from your USB recovery drive and it gives you error "The drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again" and it goes on loop.
 this might be because master boot record may be corrupted during the crash and the drive might be locked by windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestion below and check if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot from USB recovery media</li><li>Click “Repair your computer” in the lower left corner.</li><li>Click “Troubleshoot”.</li><li>Click “Command Prompt” and run following commands.</li><li>bootrec /fixMBR</li><li>bootrec /fixBoot</li><li>bootrec /rebuildBCD&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Restart the system and check whether it boots to Windows.</p>

<div>i have been experiencing a problem with my hp computer. when i turn on my computer the monitor doesnt respond, and the keyboard and mouse do not turn on</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div>background info:&nbsp;</div>
<div>about 3 weeks ago i was experiencing the same problem which had never happened before. (computer worked fine for 3 months) then i started getting blue screens and finally my computer couldnt boot because it was not able to find 1 boot file. i had system
 restored 3 times before the final error popped up. </div>
<div>i went to best buy to see if they could help me but since the computer was less than a year old, they had to send it to hp. after about 2 weeks i got it back (yestrday) and they had replaced the motherboard and the cpu.</div>
<div>&nbsp;everything worked fine. i used the computer for about 4 hours and then my keyboard and mouse shut off, along with my monitor cycling through analog, digital and hdmi and after a while just going to sleep because it couldnt find anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div>i dont know whats wrong and as i said earlier when i turn on my computer the monitor, mouse and keyboard do not work/do not respond to the computer turning on.</div>
<div>sorry for the bad formatting, writing this on a phone, thanks!</div>

<p>I have the same exact problem, running windows7&nbsp;</p>
<p>keyboard, monitor and mouse do not turn on. power supply turns on computer lights, fan, dvd/cd drives... everything but monitor, mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>The computer has nothing on the monitor screen - it doesn't turn on.</p>
<p>Cannot boot to desktop.</p>
<p>Only lights that come on are inside the tower itself... no lights on keyboard, monitor or mouse.</p>
<p>I plugged keyboard and mouse into three different ports, all with no luck.</p>
<p>Please reply with viable options. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            My multiplayer privileges are not enabled... but I have a working Xbox live account with membership.</h2>
                    

<p>When I sign into Xbox it tells me that I'm online. I can send and receive messages but cant join or make a Xbox live party. Then when I get onto Halo 5 or Black ops 3&nbsp;and try to play a multiplayer game it tells me that my multiplayer privileges are not enabled,
 &nbsp;but the day before I was playing multiplayer, no problems. I have already tried to purchase a new month of Xbox live, &nbsp;and it told me I can only have one subscription at a time. Is this some sort of ban ? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Base from your account showing here, you're subscribed to a gold subscription. Even if its just a month free trial, there's no difference with other paid subscriptions. Everything should be usable for you. Unless, your privacy settings is set to disable
 your multiplayer privileges. Then that could cause you to unable to play any multiplayer games online. If you're suspended or banned, you should get a prompt immediately when signed in.

</p><p>Make sure your Laptop is powered by the mains.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will take ages for it to download all updates depending on laptop configuration and build&nbsp; / internet speed.</p>
<p><strong>Whilst updates are in progress DO NOT power your computer off as this can cause further problems.</strong></p>
<p>My suggestion is to let it run until it completes all updates.</p>
<p>Once it has finished installing all updates it will ask you to reboot.</p>

<p>I have run into this problem myself many times.&nbsp; The solution that worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds until the system goes quiet.</p>
<p>Start the system again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience, the startup will be quite different as it completes the updates and will pretty quickly be ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst case is you need to do the install all over again.&nbsp; Not that big a deal, actually.&nbsp; This actually worked for me every time I have had this happen.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Touchscreen Driver - HP 2310ti not seen as touchscreen device</h2>
                    <p>
I have installed Windows 10 on my computer and have all of the latest drivers for all of my products.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On the monitor however, "<span>HP 2310ti 23 Inch Widescreen",</span>&nbsp; even though it is a touchscreen model, it doesn't not show up in Windows' "Pen and Touch Devices",
 AND there is not option to turn on the touchscreen in the HID driver section of the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Is this monitor touchscreen compatible with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Which driver could I be missing?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The display itself is working flawlessly, only issues with touch.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Any and all help is greatly appreciated and I will be glad to add any additional information that is needed.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>
vrtech</p>

            Really HP is the only company that can tell you if it is compatible with Windows 10, since HP built it. &nbsp;I tried to check the product page directly on your behalf (here:
<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-2310ti-23-inch-widescreen-lcd-touchscreen-monitor/4184767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-2310ti-23-inch-widescreen-lcd-touchscreen-monitor/4184767</a>), but it sure appears that it stops at Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Still it's been my experience that you can install an older driver into a new version of Windows.
 I did that with my Asus laptop's internal nVidia card--I used the Vista driver in 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 (Asus nor nVidia ever published anything newer). Of course that's not official, but you can give it a try from that link.

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already been through all of the HP drivers and the ones that are pre Win10 won't even install because of compatibility issues. I even tried running it as an admin with win7 compatibility and nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I posted here is because the touchscreen drivers that seem to be working now are actually made by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cannot see how a touchscreen capable monitor is not able to have touch capabilities on Windows 10, it seems to ridiculous to me and also I am sure it is possible to make it work.</p>

</p><p>Best that we could suggest is to keep posted for any new updates from HP for available software for your laptop. Without a working driver that is supported by your laptop's OEM.</p>

    <title>Youtube Restricted lock questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Youtube Restricted lock questions</h2>
                    <p>I have a question related to Youtube restricted mode after Win 10 upgrade from W7 and with the new family safety enabled.</p>
<p>On my administrator account (MS login, not local) I can turn YT restricted mode on or off, and I can lock it in either mode in any browser including edge with my google account login.<br />
</p>
<p>However, on my child accounts (Standard user, MS login again) YT restricted mode is always on, but off can be selected and saved for one session. If the browser is closed and launched again, restricted mode is on once again, can be turned off. However any
 attempt to lock restricted mode "on" with my google account login does not work? Why can it not be locked? Is it an issue with standard user accounts, or child accounts or both?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, but we don't want to turn family safety off. We use the features of family safety on our child accounts (ie, filtering etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that we can't "lock" YT restricted mode "on" if we use MS family safety for filtering?</p>

    <title>How do I keep the Cortana window open&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tammiday  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I keep the Cortana window open&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I open Cortana's Notebook, Packages and enter a tracking number. So far, so good. Then I switch to another application to copy the next tracking number (I want to track multiple packages). When I try to switch back, there is no window open for Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to open Cortana again, go to Notebook, scroll past the titles of sections I already turned off, (e.g. "Getting Around" and "Health and Fitness") to get to Packages again, and paste the next tracking number. Repeat this for each tracking number! It
 is not unusual to have five-ten packages that I am watching at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any way to annotate the tracking numbers, for instance, one is going to Aunt Sally, another is coming from Ebay. Not even inbound/outbound!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

            <p>Hello Tammi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching to other application will shift the focus to that particular window. In view the same, the Cortana will close automatically when the focus shift to other window, that it is to make sure it wouldn't disturb the focus of that opened&nbsp;window. I mean,
 if it stays as it is even after switching the window, then it will overlaps on the screen and will disturb the focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you can only do this manually by opening it again after switching to another window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Have windows 8 key, from where to download soft itself&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had installed Windows 8 RC on my laptop, tried to update it to Windows 8 Pro. I&nbsp;purchased, got key but download didn't start. I called MS support and they suggested do downgrade to Windows 7 and try again. I did but Windows 8 upgrade assistance doesn't
 have an option to download windows, when you already have a key.</div>
<div>Do you have any suggestion from where I can download Windows 8 pro and install it with my key? Currently I have windows 7 home addition on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>You have to go here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mswos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mswos.com/</a></div>
<div>after filling this fields, you will be redirected to your control panel, from there you can download Setup tool, which is the same upgrade assistant without purchase option. I installed it yesterday.</div>

<p><span><span>Bluescrren errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other oprtions and explanatons of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, to to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information. Just do what you can given the state of your system and we'll see if we can figure
 it out from there even lacking the rest of the information.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible:</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you
 should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies
 of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
HAL initialization failed usually is hardware so have you added any new hardware&nbsp;lately? If a PC<br />
maybe a card has become unseated. It is possible though not likely that is it driver related so have<br />
you added or changed any drivers lately? Check in Windows Updates to see if any drivers have<br />
updated (assuming you can get in). Also it is possible the problem is antivirus or other software<br />
related though rare.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Try StartUp Repair from Recovery Options and/or a Vista disk.<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

<p>If you can't boot normally, can't boot into any of the safe mode options, and can't use to the disk to run the procedures it is normally&nbsp;capable of doing (and I assume it can't do a re-installation either without getting the blue screen), then you have a
 hardware problem and need to take the computer to a reputuable computer repair shop for service, diagnosis, and repair (and/or replacement).&nbsp; There's nothing we can do to help you without any access to the system.&nbsp; You can try hardware troubleshooting on your&nbsp;own
 to some degree: <a href="http://elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot</a>, but this is very basic and without the spare parts and the special tools, you really can't do very much to find the problem.</p>
<p>I'm sorry it has come to this, but it appears to be the only vialble alternative remaining (and is llikely the root cause as well).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>As far as this thread goes, if you have a suggestion on how to get into the system if it won't boot normally, won't boot into safe mode, and won't boot to disks then by all means please enlighten us.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>

            <p>After some troubleshooting trying to get the system running again, the step that worked was to roll back to a prior version of Win10. Currently my S3 shows I'm on version 14328.1000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to get my S3 this morning, the battery was completely dead, the PC didn't sleep then hibernate as it should. My WiFi network passwords needed to be re-entered.</p>
<p>

<p>Restarts didn't work for me. I was in a class and tried at least a half dozen times.</p>

            <p>I updated too and so far haven't had this problem again but didn't spend much time using it.
</p>
<p>I am seeing other issues, the PC is getting warmer than normal and battery drain is worse. Also seeing my wifi showing connected and normal but apps (edge, outlook, store, etc.) can't connect to the internet. This is similar to a long term problem i had
 that was fixed in the beginning of the year. Hopefully it was just a one off issue. Im using the S3 LTE.</p>

<h2>            ibtsiva file in system32</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I found this file when I was looking through my task manger this morning. I googled it to see if its meant to be in there and according to some links its a virus, I'm really confused by this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the digital signature and it was signed twice , once by&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher and the other time by&nbsp;Intel(R) Wireless Connectivity Solutions</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so lost, is this actually a malware? Can someone please clarify for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>again this file is in system32 and is called&nbsp;ibtsiva. Any help would be great.</p>
<p>

            Hi Fredrick
<br />
<br />That is a legitimate process, it is not malware, it is the Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth Service.
<br />
<br />Most processes, if you Google them, you will find websites stating they are malware, all they are trying to do is sell some sort of security software, which itself usually contains some sort of malware or pup, they thrive on peoples fear of malware. . .

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm it isn't a malware in disguise, the websites are saying that the process is legit but if its in system32 (which it is) then its most likely a malware. Can you confirm from Microsoft's end that it's legit then?</p>

            Hi Fredrick
<br />
<br />I do not work for Microsoft, I am just a user like you, as are most everyone on Community . . .
<br />
<br />I suppose one way you can prove to yourself it is legit is to uninstall Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth Service from control panel
<br />
<br />Another way, since it is an Intel file rather than a Microsoft file,  would be to ask over on the Intel Forum for official confirmation that it is in fact their legit file . ..
