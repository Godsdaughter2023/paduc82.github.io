<h2>            KB3189866, KB3193494 and KB3194496 cause problem with Chrome and Firefox with authenticated proxy &#40;SQUID&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problem with Chrome and Firefox accessing proxy authentication after KB3189866, KB3193494 and KB3194496 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I had the problem was with KB3189866: after installation and restart Chrome (Forefox too) was not able to connect to any website with error ERR_INVALID_AUTH_CREDENTIALS, but the problem is that the popup asking for credentials is not prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling KB3189866 and it worked.</p>
<p>During the following days I had to uninstall KB3189866 because it kept installing with every windows update check.</p>
<p>All this until last thursday (21/9) when KB3189866 disappeared from windows update and was apparently replaced by KB3193494.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I wen back to my client with Authenticated Proxy, I found the same exact problem.</p>
<p>Uninstalled KB3193494&nbsp;and all worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last try was to activate Windows Insider Program-Release Preview and install KB3194496.</p>
<p>Now I have Windows 10 version 14393.222, KB3193494 IS NOT installed, KB3189866 IS NOT INSTALLED but I have the same problem: I cannot use Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already wrote on Google forums, but the issue is not only for Chrome, also for Firefox, and happened with all three KB listed before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have WIndows 10 x64 and the authenticated proxy of my client is Squid (dunno the version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paolo</p>

            <p>I'm experiencing the same issue with a company proxy McAfee Web Gateway and a Windows 10 client, after the abovementioned update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've traced the connection and discovered that the problem is related to Google Chrome not completing the 3-way handshake of NTLM authentication (in particular, step 3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is very weird considering that, from a comparison between MS Edge and Chrome, step 1 and 2 are the same. Then Edge completes the procedure with the authentication message (step 3) and Chrome stops the sequence returning to the user ERR_INVALID_AUTH_CREDENTIALS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there is something in the KB code that breaks the NTLM authentication

            <p>My issue only is with Chrome, Firefox et al work fine. Started about a month ago after a Win 10 update. Of course one cannot stop or choose updates any longer something I and others have complained bitterly about Win 7 is still fine in that regard. I had
 issues with Chrome not being able to update any longer for some months now, but it won't even connect to any web page now and tells me I should check my internet connection, which is fine. Uninstalling doesn't work because the regular installer, which was
 part of the error 7 that had been occurring also doesn't connect, and now using the Chrome standalone installer, while it does install Chrome, doesn't repair the problem. The update problem has been affecting many users for months now, and has escalated to
 being unable for many to use Chrome at all. Again, for me, all other internet browsers that I have, and all other programs that need to connect, all work fine, it is JUST Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to be able to uninstall specific updates, or better yet have SOME control over the update process, but no, Microsoft will not relent. Only thing I found that helps even a little is to set the connection to a metered connection, which at least allows
 me to initiate the update process so I can watch it, but I still must install all updates, even if unwanted.</p>

    <title>Will Microsoft ever add native support for ext2&#47;3&#47;4 to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will Microsoft ever add native support for ext2&#47;3&#47;4 to Windows&#63;</h2>
                    Greetings, currently running a dual-boot setup with Windows 7 &amp; Linux and having done some research into filesystems there are two sub-optimal solutions:<br />
<br />
First is to use ext2/3/4 as the data partition and a 3rd party tool like ext2ifs or ext2fsd to access data partition. Benefits is low fragmentation, fast file system, versus frequent BSOD's and poor integration with Windows and no journalling. Alternative is
 to use ntfs as data partition and ntfs-3g as data. Benefits is excellent ntfs integration in linux, drawbacks is slower filesystem and more frequent fragmentation.<br />
<br />
I've been looking online for any discussions from Microsoft about ext2/3 and now ext4, to see whether they have any plans to support them. With the news that google is switching its servers over to ext4 it seems a pretty good indication that ext4 shall be an
 important file system for the years to come. And with more netbooks coming installed with ubuntu (now defaults to ext4) consumers will want to be able to network these low powered machines with their more powerful desktops, which will still tend to be running
 windows.<br />
<br />
So what do you think... what have you heard / read. Will Microsoft ever support ext4? If you don't think so, why not?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,
                </div>

            I would actually like to see this added to Windows 10 as this would make it much easier to integrate into server setups. &nbsp;Between using BTRFS, Ext4, and NTFS, I think this would make Windows on-par with what Linux OSes are capable of. &nbsp;At least having
 the capability to activate capability as an option during or after installation in the Program Settings would be beneficial in my opinion.

            <p>My battery functions fine, I have excellent charge time and it lasts about as long as it should, but the software itself always says "until fully charged", sometimes with 2 minutes or with no number at all (Like right now), but I have never actually seen
 an accurate number. My battery is also not easy to access and I am very hesitant to open up my expensive laptop just to solve what I am considering a graphical glitch.</p>

            <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem. After windows 10 update my laptop hardly went on "sleep" when I was finished with the laptop and closed the lid, if I came back to it I struggled to get it to turn on I eventually had to take the battery out and carefully put
 it back in (standard laptop battery that comes with a (its 1 years old) HP Pavilion i3) I've rechecked and checked again that they battery is in properly and it is and has been. I've never touched the battery before or for other laptop I've had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find any settings to fix it. I feel with a lot of the settings on your laptop you have to be an IT technician just to figure out what settings do what and which ones are the ones your looking for. Not easy most of the time to figure out how
 to change settings and getting changes you don't want.</p>

<h2>            Connect to Work or School account not working for me</h2>
                    <p>Hi,,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 Surface Pro 3 (running the fully patched 1703 version) won't let me add my work Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seemed to start when I changed my password for my Office 365 account. I did this through the www.office.com portal. I have Office Multi-Factor Authentication enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after I changed password I tried to open a Word document from the company SharePoint page. This failed several times - it just wouldn't load in Word, but it does show in Word for Web.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled my MFA status but that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disconnecting Word from the Office 365 Service with a plan to then reconnect, but when I try to connect it just doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go through the Settings app, Access Work or School page and click "+" Connect, it asks me for an email address. I type that in and hit enter. Then it goes straight back to the page with the "+" Connect, without asking me for a password, or adding
 the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another machine to try on or another account to use, so I can't tell if the problem is with my account or my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

 router. I do think I know what the problem is though I just don't know how to fix it. So here we go. I did my system restore about 2 days after we switched from the tv/internet provider "Comcast" to the tv/internet provider "Verizon". what I believe happened
 is that I restored &nbsp;my computer back to the point when we didn't have Verizon so it couldn't find the network. Now since we don't have Comcast anymore it won't identify that network either ,so maybe some of yours out there could help me. :D</span>

            <p>You should have Local Area Network (LAN) cable and modem and you may try use it to connect directly to internet instead of connecting through Wi-Fi, basically it is connection through wired network.</p>
<p>If not, use one of the PC which is able to connect to internet and visit your PC manufacturer's website and search for model of your PC and download latest network or wi-fi driver and save it in external storage (e.g. flash memory) and then move it to your
 own PC and run and install it.</p>

                    <p>In a previous version of Skype when one of my Contacts would initiate a Chat Session, the Chat window would open automatically.</p>
<p>Seems with this new version I only get two hints... One the little pop up that only gets my attention if I happen to be sitting at the computer (or the screen is not otherwise busy with something else... And (I think) the Skype Icon in the Notification area...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to find an Option that controls this..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what its worth, I am using "Split View Mode"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other symptoms that may or may not be related... Open Chat Windows (quite) often just disappear after some period of inactivity (Mostly I notice this in the morning... Chat Sessions that were "open" the previous day are no longer "up"... And I need to open
 the Skype Main Menu to get the (Business) Contact back up...</p>

</p><p>The feature which is incorporated with the Skype 7 version is not yet integrated to the new version of Skype which allows to open the window automatically of the conversation that you have a new message in. Nonetheless, I would highly suggest to post this
 suggestion to our user voice site in order for our developers to integrate the feature to the new version.

                    So i have a new wired xbox 360 control other one bit the dust (dog chewed &nbsp;wires). So new one installs and does not work when it installs it says Xbox 360 controller installed. The Software from microsoft does not pick it up but in my device manager it
 shows up picture and all. Also under device manager this line is missing Microsoft Common Controller for Windows Class...any help?&nbsp;
<div>Im running windows 7 64 bit &nbsp;on a quad core laptop. Everything is updated fine the issue is after i restarted my computer. Neither my wired or wireless controllers now work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i Tried using this guide here&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/908888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/908888</a>&nbsp;and a few others but im missing a key Line Microsoft Common Controller for Windows Class i do not have this and when
 i uninstall and reinstall drivers it does not give me 2 lines of installed drivers just the 360 controller now... Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also these controllers work fine on my xbox.&nbsp;http://i558.photobucket.com/albums/ss28/sicextheo/Untitled.png
 Shows up identified and like normal under devices however it does not get picked up by xbox accessories 1.2 and the controller only lights up when the computer is started for a brief moment. UPDATE: if i double click the controller from device list it opens
 up the games installed and allows me to run them from there. However the controller still does not light up this leads me to beleive something is still wrong</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The controller’s light isn’t always on while it is plugged into the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To be sure check if it shows up in the list under Devices and Printers.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site mentioned below for steps to open devices and printers:</span></p>

<p><span>If it is seen in the devices and printers then check in the device manager if it is working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>To check in device manager:</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>In the <b>General</b> tab check if the device is working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also open a game that supports the controller and test.</span></p>

<h2>            &#8220;How do you want to open this file&#63;&#8221; I messed up</h2>
                    <p>Hey All, </p>

<p>Hoping that someone has a fix for me. </p>

<p>I was having issues opening a few exe files so followed some online instructions to fix the issue.</p>

<p>CMD&gt;registry editor&gt;updated exe default to “% 1” %” </p>

<p>The last bit should have been * instead of “ and then I reset my computer.</p>

<p>Now when I try to literally open anything it asks “how do you want to open this file” this is also occurring when attempting to open CMD or registry editor.</p>

<p>Does anyone happen to have a fix for this or is a system restore my only option at this point?</p>

            Hi Alex
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />System Restore looks like your best option right now or rebooting in Safe Mode then execute the command again with the right syntax. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click the Boot tab
<br />Check 'Safe Boot'
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Sign in
<br />
<br />Run the command again then restart into Normal mode.

            Try doing it through the recovery environment:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />**********************************************
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Click the link below, on that page scroll down to Option 2, then in the table, find EXE
<br />
<br />Select that to download a reg file, when that downloads right click that and choose Merge and confirm the merge
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC

<p>This is support for the installation (clean, upgrade, etc.) of Windows 10 itself as well as its activation.</p>

            Oh I already know how! Try to go to the "settings" and then&nbsp;"accounts" section and then click on "sign in with the local account instead". You may have to fill out necessary information about the user and you'll be asked to have your password changed and
 add a pin. And it's done! Admin changed. But the account is just a local account. Then if you want to change it into a Microsoft account, then click the sign in with the Microsoft account. Then again, just fill out necessary information. I hope this helps.

 and it keeps asking her to switch her password which she does. what to do about that???

            What about the <em>other </em>way around? When I signed in with Microsoft account I was classified as limited account, and I want to change to admin so I can install programs myself. How to do so (without signing out if possible)?

    <title>Recurring Task Not Working in Task Scheduler unless Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reid culp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurring Task Not Working in Task Scheduler unless Internet Explorer is Open</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recurring task that used to run ever night, overnight&nbsp;on Windows 7 through the Task Scheduler. The task was to download information off the internet. The task stopped running automatically when I upgraded to Windows 10. I could manually initiate
 the download and it would work, but it would not work otherwise. On the automatic attempts, sometimes the task would run and then never complete, or simply not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then recently I accidently left Internet Explorer open overnight and the task completed automatically overnight and all the information downloaded correctly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this is the case? The developer of the application said that it was developed with Internet Explorer originally. Do you think it has to do with Edge now being the default browser? Is there a way to set Internet Explorer as the default
 browser for this task?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>removing Microsoft family features&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> milica_eee  say:</h3>
<h2>            removing Microsoft family features&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    My kids accidentally set up this feature on their computer because they wanted to use an xbox game from an older sibling.&nbsp; They used the parent account that we don't have access to. I would like to completely get rid of family features on this computer,
 but I can't. Now the kids can't use Chrome or Firefox. I tried to access services.msc but I can't find Microsoft family features or WIndows live under either Extended or Standard tab. I see a little icon that looks like three people next to each other&nbsp;on the
 bar on the bottom of my screen&nbsp;and when I hover over it, I see: "Your family is using Microsoft Family Features". The computer runs Windows 10.

            hi again, found out the problem, the hard drive needed to be reformatted as it was set to MAC OS, to change it you need to plug it into the MAC, open up DISK UTILITY, open up the hard drive, go to PARTITION, go to drop down box and select partition to
 reformat (in my case 1) then on the right had side go to drop box and select the format you want, on my MAC only had the MS-DOS (FAT) - hope this something else to add to all the other stuff everyone has on here as it has all been helpful

<h3> nhart5150  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DisplayPort audio issues, NO OPTION IN PLAYBACK DEVICES</h2>
                    <p>I have searched far and wide for a solution, but I cannot wide one specific to my problem.</p>
<p>I recently purchased a DisplayPort &gt; HDMI adapter (Insignia) for my laptop and TV. When I connect to my TV, the picture is crisp, but audio only comes through my laptop.</p>
<p>I have explored options in "Sound", "Playback Devices" for a simple fix, but my laptop tells me ONLY my internal speakers are connected. It tells me there is a Digital Audio(HDMI) option with a TV icon, but it says it is not plugged in, even though I can
 see the picture on my TV screen.</p>
<p>I've changed defaults to no results, made sure all devices for audio were enabled and visible, and have done several plug/unplugs and shut down/restarts, and yet audio will only play through the laptop, not the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Lock Screen locks in 60 seconds with no activity.</h2>
                    <p>I currently have Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 1709 Build 16299.192 and I am having a problem with the lock screen that I have tried to remedy with various fixes with no positive result.&nbsp; If I am playing a game, a video, or have any application running it
 doesn't matter.&nbsp; If I have no activity from an input device (keyboard or mouse) for more than roughly 60 seconds the computer will fade to a black screen and then will require the user account password to be entered before returning to the desktop.&nbsp; I have
 adjusted advanced power settings for the PC to be always on and never to hibernate or sleep.&nbsp; I have edited the Registry to include settings for "system unattended sleep timeout"&nbsp; and&nbsp; " console lock display timeout" and set them each to 10 minutes which has
 been ineffective as the time is still roughly 60 seconds.&nbsp; I have adjusted the account settings of the user to Never require sign-in after being away, which has also had no effect.&nbsp; I have even used the gpedit to change the group policy for the display to
 "not display the lock screen"&nbsp; under personalization.&nbsp; None of these things have worked.&nbsp; Beyond this, I have also used the Netplwiz to auto log in the specific user on this system which is an administrator account and is the only account that exists on the
 system in question.&nbsp; This has made it so that the PC doesn't require a password on initial boot-up to enter windows but it still requires the password to get out of the lock screen.&nbsp; Another error has also presented itself which is on the Lock Screen settings
 the message "*Some settings are hidden or manged by your organization" has appeared.&nbsp; The computer has all current windows updates as well as Microsoft certified drivers.&nbsp; There are no viruses or other issues present.&nbsp; These issues have developed within the
 last round of updates for the PC including the Fall Creators Update.&nbsp; There are hundreds or possibly thousands of others out there that are having the same problem in many different groups and message boards.&nbsp; Some of the things I mentioned above have helped
 others but none of them are working for me.&nbsp; This is a problem caused within windows and as such I am looking to you for answers as to what is being done to fix it.&nbsp; are there any other things I can try to fix this issue that anyone is aware of and a system
 restore isn't a viable option as there is over 6tb of data on this system that is "mission critical" so I won't be doing a system restore to fix an annoyance.&nbsp; It would however be helpful if this issue could be resolved for us who have it.</p>

            The error had nothing to do with my bios settings or timing within advanced power options as some others have mentioned.&nbsp; It was fixed with a windows update however that was applied last night.

            If you have multiple monitors attached to a Windows 8 device it will show the Windows Start Page on one screen, and the classic desktop on the other screen. This is by design, as modern apps were designed for single screen use only.
<div><br />
<div>In short, no. Windows Store apps can only be on one screen if the desktop is extended to multiple monitors. You can however, mirror your modern start screen.&nbsp;</div>
