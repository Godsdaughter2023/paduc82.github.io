<h2>            Surface Pro Nightmare at Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone had a nightmare with the microsoft store like I have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I purchased a Surface Pro 128GB, from microsoft certified reseller, received it with a refurbished box, it looked brand new, and I thought all was great. &nbsp;I teach classes on new technology at my own computer shop, and thought, what a wonderful way to
 finally learn Windows 8. &nbsp;When I received the unit, I connected to my wireless network and download crystal disk info, a utility I use to diagnose hard disks and solid state disks to see if they have any use, and to see if they have any problems. &nbsp;We do this
 at my shop for every machine we take in for diagnostic purposes. &nbsp;The crystal disk program said that my disk in the unit was only 96% good. &nbsp;When I stopped by at a local microsoft store (Bridgewater, NJ), and asked two microsoft store employees, young guys
 that were by the samsung tv if I could have them look at it they asked how long it had been since I purchased it, I said about a week, they said bring it in and we can take a look. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following weekend I stopped by on a Saturday and when I arrived with surface pro box in hand, all accessories in the box(I was secretly hoping they could just swap the unit out), I was greeted by another young man who asked me if I had an appointment,
 I said I did not, and never thought to make one before. He offered an appointment that was roughly in 40 minutes and although I had plans to spend with my girlfriend, I chose to wait it out. He also offered me a free bottle of water which was nice. &nbsp; &nbsp;I actually
 got served by Maria a few minutes early, which was great! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I explained the situation to Maria, she said she could have an in house tech look at the device and run some "tests". &nbsp;I said ok, and asked when and if I could just leave it there and come back the following week, she seemed to be bothered by that
 and said, no, just wait around for about an hour, it should be done quickly. &nbsp;I asked if I could walk away at least and maybe do a little shopping, that I could leave my cell and they can call me when they were done. She seemed perplexed by this but scrambled
 to find a piece of paper and wrote my cell number. &nbsp;I thanked her and left the shop feeling hopeful that this extra time was going to end up with me a fully functioning unit in my hands. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only wish it would be that easy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So about 45 mins pass and I decide to pop my head back in, anxious to see if they got the same results. &nbsp;I walk up to Maria and I see her plugging a surface pro into power, it turns out to be mine and she said, aw man, it looks like I lost the results of
 the scan, but it passed. &nbsp;I asked if I could speak to the tech, and guess who comes out, no one other than one of the two original young men who I met earlier that week. &nbsp;He recognized me and said "hey man". &nbsp;I asked him what tools he used, and he rattled
 off the name of a tool which I can't remember. &nbsp;He said that the tool passed and asked what tool I used. &nbsp;I told him I used crystal disk and he said " I love crystal disk, I use it all the time at home, but I can't use it here, and my tool says the surface
 scan passed 100%". &nbsp;I asked him if his tool is compatible with solid state disks, he said he wasn't sure how it really worked. &nbsp;I told him that my 96% good solid state disk was 4% bad. &nbsp;He seemed to think that 96% good was "fine" and that I shoudn't expect
 any better for a refurb unit. &nbsp;He kept agreeing with me that crystal disk info was a great program, but he didn't want to go any further than that. &nbsp;I asked to speak to a manager. &nbsp;He said ok, and promptly brought Heather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heather asked me if I just wanted to get a refund for the unit. &nbsp;I said sure, unless you can give me what I originally wanted which is a "fully functioning" unit. &nbsp;I told her that I didn't want to use the unit with the faulty solid state disk. &nbsp;She tried
 looking up the unit to manage an exchange, she couldn't find it in the system. &nbsp;She asked me for the receipt, I told her I had an email of the receipt and showed it to her. &nbsp;She said, wait a minute, you didn't buy this from a microsoft store! &nbsp;I said, no,
 I bought it from a microsoft certified seller and the unit ships with the same 1 year warranty. She tried looking it up on the system and said "I can't find it in the system, I can't prove that it's under warranty, I think you'll need to return it to the original
 seller, perhaps they can warranty it, since I have no proof". &nbsp;I asked if she could show me how *I* could look up the warranty on the unit, she said "OK" and took me to a website, when she logged in she asked" Did you ever register it?" &nbsp;I said "no, I didn't
 realize I had to, I've only had the unit for less than two weeks." &nbsp;She looked annoyed but went ahead and registered my surface pro. &nbsp;Then she looked it up and said "Ok, NOW I can see the unit in my system!" &nbsp;I said "great, so now what?" &nbsp;Well, I can send
 the unit out to microsoft. &nbsp;I asked why they couldn't just replace the faulty ssd here in the shop. &nbsp;"We can't open the units up in the shop, we are not tooled for it, we have to send them out." &nbsp;I asked why she couldn't just replace the unit with another
 one. &nbsp;"We don't keep these models in stock, we only keep new units in stock." &nbsp;So after all of that, she agreed to ship the unit back to microsoft, she printed a sheet of paper I didn't even look at and I took it and walked away, 2.5 hours and I felt like
 I finally won something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3 weeks passed and I had my secretary contact the microsoft store because I had NO notifications or news from microsoft. &nbsp;They determined that the unit hadn't even been shipped out yet! &nbsp;I was thinking about teaching a class with this unit the following
 week and they hadn't even sent it out yet... &nbsp;So they finally produced a tracking number and the unit was shipped to Texas a week or so ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally received a package yesterday. &nbsp;It came in a brown box with a fed ex label on it. &nbsp;No charger. &nbsp;No pen, no nice box, no instructions, just a surface pro unit in a white bubble wrapped bag With a white label with blue writing "Surface". &nbsp;I opened
 the bag, noticed a few scratches on the back of the unit which didn't really bother me. &nbsp;I connected to my wireless network and quickly downloaded Crystal Disk Info and ran it, 94% Good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had my secretary contact the microsoft store today and apparently the girl on the phone was appalled that they didn't just replace the unit. &nbsp;And so I called them just 2 hours ago to see what the next step was. It was Maria, she remembered me from the
 original time. &nbsp;Maria claimed that I could go there and they would give me a charger and a pen, but that I would have to send the surface pro unit *AGAIN* to microsoft since I wasn't happy with the disk being 6% bad. &nbsp;I asked to talk to the original manager,
 she put me on hold for 5 mins and said "That manager has already gone home". &nbsp;I asked to speak to another manager and Maria said that there was no point, that this other manager "Tiffany" would just tell me the same thing that she did. &nbsp;I told her I would
 call Microsoft and she said I could do that and I promptly hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the 877 number that microsoft had on their website. &nbsp;I spoke to a filipino woman who transferred me to the surface support team. &nbsp;At this point I haven't gotten permission to post from that individual what we spoke about, he heard me typing this
 as we were talking on the phone and promptly said "I do not give you the permission to share any information about me". &nbsp;And so I asked to speak to HIS manager and his manager told me that he could set up another replacement for the unit. &nbsp;When I asked about
 my missing charger and other accessories he said "it typically takes 1-2 weeks to ship your accessories back, and they are sent separately". &nbsp;He suggested I go back to the microsoft store and see what they could do for me. &nbsp;When I pointed out that I had already
 been there twice, spoke to them 3 times and they wouldn't even let me talk to the manager at the store, he agreed that perhaps I should go through him to replace the unit. &nbsp;When I asked what guarantee I had that the 3rd unit wouldn't have 92% good on it? &nbsp;He
 said that he couldn't guarantee it but assured that Microsoft does not send bad disks with their refurbished equipment, that they have strict standards for the refurbishing process and that I had just been unlucky. &nbsp;I asked if there was a way he could contact
 the microsoft store himself and see what they could do for me. &nbsp;He agreed to do it, put me on hold. &nbsp;Then he said he was waiting on hold some more. &nbsp;Then he said "you know what, this is taking too long, what do you say I have my technician give you a ring
 tommorow, we will contact the microsoft store and then get back to you. &nbsp;I said "OK".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the adventure continues...</p>

            I was advised to go to a Microsoft Store yesterday. &nbsp;Now, after reading your story, I just want to cry. &nbsp;I spoke to a woman at technical support who I doubt seriously knew anything about what I was asking her, much less a solution to it, I'm wondering
 if the standard response from Microsoft technical support is go to the store. Maybe I should just get a refund, chalk it up to experience and go shopping.&nbsp;

    <title>Child to Adult Promotion-Netflix-Account Removed from gold family plan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rabidmaggot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child to Adult Promotion-Netflix-Account Removed from gold family plan</h2>
                    
<p>I am the primary account holder for my XBL Gold Family Plan where there is my 2 kids and myself who play between multiple consoles ...the 4th account I created strictly for Netflix on 1 specific console so if my wife wants to watch movies the kids or myself
 can go play on the other console we have.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now I created the live account-no problem.&nbsp; Migrated my Netflix subscription to that account-No problem...but when I promoted the account from child to adult...I got a message that said my gold account had expired and I no longer have Xbox Live on that account.</p>
<p>So I logged out of my 4th account and logged back into my primary account, went to add the account back and I am told that because
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"I removed that Xbox live account"</span></b> (which I did not) and now I have to wait 5 days to re add it.</p>
<p>So...with that happening, now my wife has to wait 5 days to use Netflix or I have to give up my gamertag for 5 days if she wants to watch Netflix...This is an issue that need to be addressed!!!!</p>
<p>Can it be fixed or am I screwed and do I have to wait out the 5 days?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Got my answer form Xbox Support on Twitter! &nbsp;When you promote a child account into an adult account within the Xbox Live family plan the account will be removed from the plan once promoted. &nbsp;And with that being said, any account that is removed form the
 Family plan will have to wait 5 days before re-adding to the plan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I truly wish I had known this before hand, I would have promoted it before originally signing it up to the Plan.</p>
<p>SUGGESTION: Maybe have a pop-up warning or put it in a disclaimer somewhere on a help page for promoting accounts!!!!</p>

<p>Unless they changed it, that still won't work. They told me to do it and it didin't work. I tried everything they told me after hours online with xbox support and nothing they said worked. I finally dropped my adult son from my family plan and put him back
 into his own account to solve the problem. There used to be a HUGE forum topic with hundreds of posts of people having similar problems but it's now gone along with the old fourms system. If this suggestion thay gave you actually works for you, please post
 it here so we'll know if they fixed this issue. Unfortunately, I think your next post is going to be that after waiting the five days and adding the account back into the family you'll find it demoted back to child again.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After the 5 days </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I was able to add the other account back to my family plan without issue</span>...it's retarded that when you promote a live account from child to adult
 it removes Live from said account, honestly whats the real reason for that?&nbsp; What's even more stupid is the fact that when you create a "brand new" account it automatically assumes it's a child account, even though it's listed on my console as an adult account.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, after you added the secondary account BACK into the family plan AFTER the five day wait, did you go into the account settings to VERIFY the promote option is NOT there again? IF the promote option is there, it defaulted the sub-account
 back to child again. If it's not there, they've finally fixed this bug and please let us know, because when most of us followed those directions, the sub-account was demoted back to child again. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Crucible Restrictions &#40;UNFAIR&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Been playing destiny from day one now and never had an issue log in <br />today only to be informed my account has been restricted due to unstable<br /> internet connection. this game should have a warning telling people <br />2mb connection is not good enough.</p>

<p>I never lag on any other title<br /> except this particular game. I would say it has more to do with there <br />service than my connection. i am a year one player that has never been <br />kicked then i get this.</p>

<p>it is completely inappropriate to issue a ban without justification. my nat type is always open and this makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>is<br /> there anything I can do my end i have a adsl2 running at 2mb and <br />550kbps upload. i think it should be added to the game box the minimum <br />required internet speed so i dont buy destiny 2 and have the same issue</p>

<p>has anyone else suffered from this injustice.</p>

            <p>So, I too am a year one player, who has not swayed to other games, then came back to Destiny. I play a lot, and often. I just recently reached rank 102 in Crucible, and often complain about the folks that 'ride their wifi' or flat out lag switch. Right as the Dawning dropped, and SRL made its return, I was met with a restriction as well. I&nbsp;have a dedicated line to my Xbox, 50MB up/5mb down. I as told that I was restricted for an unstable connection.</p><p><br /></p><p>I just do not see how it is possible. But, with their peer to peer set up, is it really possible, when running as a random, if you continue to get paired with folks with bad connections...bad wifi, you show as unstable? If you message someone to tell them you have reported them for suspected cheating, if they report you, will it appear the same?</p><p><br /></p><p>I am curious, and can become furious when trying to find out any answers to this. I spent two years working my way up to a recent average of 1.33 k/d, but my overal

            <p>are you sure you have adsl2 ? Adsl2 is upto 20mb but shouldn't really be lower than the max 8mb for adsl ? Also it does state that xbox live requires a minimum of 3mb download and 0.5mb upload for gameplay, its more likely your upload speed causing problems though as more often than not you are probably red bar with your connection, just because you don't see yourself lagging doesn't mean other players don't even in other games but i do agree you shouldn't have been banned for it unless they detected that you were limiting you network traffic pursposely for example (not saying you were)</p>

<br />To find that go to search and type system information.

            Hi Richard,
<br />
<br />A laptop screen should not degaus that is only for the old CRT monitors which became magnetically charged . . ..
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is a workaround to play XP free cell on Windows 7 computer. There is<strong> no guarantee</strong> that it will work.<br />
<br />
To run XP freecell, try these steps.<br />
1. Click Start, click Run, type %windir%\System32 and click ok on XP computer.<br />
2. Copy the following files to a flash drive.<br />
a. Freecell.exe<br />
b. Cards.dll<br />
3. Connect the flash drive to Windows 7 computer and do the following.<br />
a. Click Start, click Computer.<br />
b. Open the C: and right click on the empty space and click New -&gt; Folder.<br />
c. Copy Freecell.exe and Cards.dll files to this folder.<br />
d. Try to launch Freecell.exe file and enjoy the game.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Encarta 2009 Premium for windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a copy of Microsoft encarta premium suite 2005; and I tried to download this edition to my new HP laptop with windows 7.
</p>
<p>Now, I really feel so frustrated that this copy of MS encarta doesnt match on&nbsp; my laptop - MS encarta 2005 is not compatible to windows 7.</p>
<p>I'd like to purchase&nbsp;an encarta&nbsp;premium 2009 but&nbsp;I cannot&nbsp;find any&nbsp;trusted online retailer that sells this - can&nbsp;anyone from microsoft please help?</p>
<p>What do you suggest I need to do? I can't afford to buy another laptop&nbsp;and&nbsp;upgrade my system to windows 8 as I just recently bought a new laptop - hoping I could install my encarta on. So frustrated that&nbsp;they are not compatible to each other! :(</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth adapter unavaidable after Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have had no problems with my Surface since purchase and dutifully update regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last&nbsp; firmware update though has caused multiple problems:</p>
<p>- the surface didn´t wake up from sleeping mode the next day.</p>
<p>-the surface has no connectivity with the mini sd card and USB.</p>
<p>- Update failed and I got a bluscreen with a little keyboard logo in the right corner. After a while it restarted but</p>
<p>the keyboard doesn´t work any longer. So it should be a connection problem with the bluetooth adapter.</p>
<p>The problemsolving-tool for Bluetooth says that there is no Bluetooth device installed.

<p>
</p><p>In the device Manager there are also no bluetooth conections, also in the hidden view. I made a sreenshot with a german describtion of the Problem. But in the UEFI Mode the Bluetooth conectivity is on. The Firmware SURFACE ME might be the problem. The driver
 should be the newest but it is not able to start (CODE 10). Actually the Divers aren´t the newest because it´s version 11.8.56.3522 fom November</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems, as you can see in the device manager, can´t fixed with new or reinstalled drivers. I get the message that these are the newest. But i</p>
<p>I tried the surface diagnostic tool two times and reinstalled drivers again and again. The Microsoft Support (thank you, Izabel) made the final advice to reboot the computer, so i did... After saving my documents. No succsess. No Bluetooth but a rebootet
 surface ;-(. I`m a little bit nervous (really nervous) because I have to write my Masterthesis ... now.... And I need my surface. It worked perfect before this update. Please Microsoft, do you have an idea how to fix it? I don´t know where the problems came
 frome but for me it´ts a really bad time.</p>

<p>Thank you. I was in contact with the customerservice and they had the last advice to recover the system with an usb Stick. I created a stick with an Image and tried to recover the system from the Stick. But it doesn't work. In uefi i had choosen the usb
 storage for booting. Then i tried to boot. After choosing language and key layout - Options- usb storage the display becomes black, the surface Logo comes up and after a while, the screen becomes blue again and im back in the menue where i have to choose the
 language... What's wrong with you, surface.</p>

<p>Hello Abygaille,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the nice manual. I did it step by step like in the video and downloaded the file:
</p>
<p>SurfacePro4_BMR_155_11.347.0 , extract it on the Recovery stick and started my surface. After choosing language, keylayout and Troubleshoot i get to the Menu for further options. Here i can´t choose RECOVER FROM A DRIVE. There are six options and it looked
 like this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5df8873-4c86-4d81-b010-20c734e1f562?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5df8873-4c86-4d81-b010-20c734e1f562?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;When I tried the SYSTEMIMAGERECOVERY I get an error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried another option with the media recreatin tool from here: </p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reset the surface with this recovery stick, the Windows Setup starts but the Keyboard, Mouse or Touchscreen don´t work so I´m not able to go further:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12b836d2-2383-401d-834a-3b915a751d0d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12b836d2-2383-401d-834a-3b915a751d0d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try it another time and thank you very much for your help.</p>

<div>- note that he edited it on February 7, 2019 to include that an update was</div>
<div>released to prevent the ME issue. I'd recommend that you contact support AND</div>

<p>Just a short Update. I brought the surface to the store where I bougtht it, they´ve got a technical service, where they told me, that they tried it like youre manuals do but no succsess. When he came to the Windows installation&nbsp; setup can´t use the touchpad
 or the keyboard. In his view i´ve got just the opportunity to contact the support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just thought about the USB connection. Is it possible that this device has a USB 2.0? Inside the USB it´s white instead of blue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Barb Bowman. Thank you very much. in my point of view there`s a context to these problems with an update. I also lost the Blutooth adapter but the hardware should be fine. And I also have these alerts on the Firmware Windows ME.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m al ittle bit upset because i lost a week for nothing. I´m writting from the device of my girlfriend and she´s scared because her surface also want´s to update</p>

<div>once you have that issue, it cannot be fixed. your best option is to focus on</div>

<h2>            OneDrive once again... Always looking for updates&#47;Updating nnn files with high CPU usage</h2>
                    <p>Still trying to get OneDrive to behave. Running Windows 10 Pro (64 bit), updated to October 2018, and still, this problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've Unlinked, relinked... killed..&nbsp;deleted and redownloaded and installed OneDrive but nothing seems to make an impact. I completely wiped our second system and did a clean install of Windows 10 Pro (64 bit), relinked to the existing OneDrive for that system
 and it IS ok!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to have to wipe my system also as it is highly customized and is my daily use system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There MUST be an answer to this as I see it mentioned often but so far Microsoft has not been able to give me more than "Try This" via eMail conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any hints, suggestions I'll be willing to take a look&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; %Systemroot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall<br />

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran CMD as Admin... Killed the process and did uninstall. As forecast,&nbsp;there was no confirm/deny as to whether&nbsp;the uninstall was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then Downloaded a new copy of OneDriveSetup.exe from the link provided by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to install it, using the directions given and was told that there was a newer version installed and I needed to uninstall it before installing another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Date of the version of OneDriveSetup.exe in sysWOW64 is 4/11/2018, not today's&nbsp;date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The uninstall did not seem to have succeeded&nbsp;and I can not delete the existing<br />
&nbsp;copy in sysWOW64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess more handholding is needed here.</p>

<p>A critical Windows Media Center process has failed. Restart the computer and try again. If the problem persists, contact your hardware manufacturer for assistance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The mother ship is a windows 7 64 bit system. I get this error while I try to watch live TV or to view the recorded programs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I searched the web and tried the following troubleshooting but was not able to fix it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. uninstall and reinstall WMC.</p>
<p>2. uninstall and reinstall xbox as an extender.</p>
<p>3. reset the workground switch (it is hard wired).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Nothing seem to help. Once again this was working just fine until couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>any help is highly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Bahmani,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This could be caused by an outdated driver or a loose USB port. Kindly tell us if this is the first time that you would connect the camcorder to the computer? Is the camcorder detected under Device Manager? To check, press
<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X</strong> on your keyboard. Choose <strong>
Device Manager</strong>. Look for the camcorder driver under <strong>Imaging Devices</strong>,
<strong>Universal Serial Bus Controller</strong>, or <strong>Other Devices</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Have you tried connecting the camcorder to another device? Was it detected?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>, and then select
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Updating the camcorder driver could also help. You can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to update driver in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you with more answers.</div>

<h2>            Sound Cutting Out</h2>
                    <p>Hey All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some help.&nbsp; Can barely even play using a headset cause the sounds cut out and my controller disconnects(not all the time on the disconnect).&nbsp; I have the Xbox Day One Edition.&nbsp; I'm using the stereo headset adapter with my headset....&nbsp; the sound
 in any game I play cuts out all the time.&nbsp; Yes my controllers are updated.&nbsp; Is the adapter bad?&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; I'm more than willing to get new controllers but I want to make sure they are the problem.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated....</p>

<p>Thanks for the guide but that didn't really have anything to do with my sound issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears as if I plug my controller in the issue went away.&nbsp; With that said I'm sure the next question would be.&nbsp; Is my controller charged?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; When I started to play last night it was full.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some kind of issue when its not plugged in that the sounds cut out.&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp; I guess to solve my problem is always play tethered to my Xbox.&nbsp; Not what I wanted to do but until I can figure this out or someone has an idea of why this happens
 I guess thats what I need to do.</p>

<p>Can you try to power your controller through a USB powerbank without having the controller tethered to the console?</p>
<p>Does the issue still happen, when you power the controller through an USB powebank or an USB power supply from your wall outlet?</p>

            I can try that.&nbsp; I have to let my controller die a little bit as its charged pretty good now.&nbsp; Yesterday morning I was on for maybe an hour and it didn't give me any issues.&nbsp; However my controller was probably pretty charged up from the night before.&nbsp;
 So that's why I am leaning towards a battery issue.&nbsp; Or a low power issue if you will......<br />

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade, unable to discover wifi network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m bosacki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade, unable to discover wifi network</h2>
                    <p>I've recently upgraded 2 machines around the house with little or no problem. The final device, a Dell laptop, wouldn't upgrade, wouldn't download the reserved upgrade. I did the upgrade manually. Now while it is able recognize wifi connections from the
 various spots around us, the one it doesn't recognize, the one that doesn't show up on the list of available connections is the one its sitting on top of, the household connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point one: there is no issue with a vpn</p>
<p>Point two: it's not a adapter problem since it easily recognizes other wifi connections</p>
<p>Point three: its not a windows firewall connection. I turned it off and still no wifi spot. It's not an antivirus issue. Same deal. Turn it off, still no wifi.</p>
<p>Point four: I can connect to the internet using an ethernet cable.</p>
<p>Point five: nothing's amiss in in the device manager. Even uninstalling and reinstalling the device didn't correct the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not sure what the issue is. I suspect it has something to do with settings regarding search parameters. Perhaps the wifi is only searching for public networks and the household is a private network. Perhaps the reverse. I've noticed, for example, that
 this computer defines the network as a public network, but connecting the other machine by cable says it's a private network. Not sure were to look. Not sure were the problem in the update is.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear about your problem with the dell laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming the other 2 machines you upgraded successfully are able to see your Wi-Fi network just fine? one thing to look at would be to see if any of the networks you can see are of the same security type and radio type as yours.&nbsp;&nbsp; you can do this from
 a cmd prompt by running "netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid".&nbsp; this will show you all the networks the adapter can see and some info about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; based on that info you can compare it to your Wi-Fi network.&nbsp;&nbsp;My thought here being is that some adapters have
 settings that can filter networks out.&nbsp; Such as Wireless Mode.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>let me know what you find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you could share the adapter hardware id and driver version that would be helpful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>in&nbsp;a previous version of Skype, i could leave my PC sound system on mute and if a skype call came through it would override the mute to alert me to the call.&nbsp; Now, the current version does not work like that.&nbsp; Skype does not override the mute button and
 so remains silent unless i am lucky enough to be looking at the screen when a call comes in.</p>
