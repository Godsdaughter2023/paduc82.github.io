            <p>I know how the rep system works perfectly well.</p><p>&nbsp;Your rep does not go down instantly,it goes down over a period of months depending on your behaviour online.</p><p>&nbsp;Getting a thank you message because someone was suspended because of a report you filed has nothing whatsoever to do with it.They are just standard messages sometimes sent out by the enforcement team.</p><p>&nbsp;There's over 50 million people on xbox live,if it's as flawed as you think then there's be a lot more people complaining about it.</p><p>&nbsp;I really wouldn't take much notice of what you read on another site.</p><p>&nbsp;No one here can do anything,only you can improve your rep &amp; you've been told how to do that.</p>

<h2>            These programs need to be uninstalled because they aren&#39;t compatible with the upgrade - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Every time when I try to upgrade Windows 10 to the latest 1607 version, It says some apps needs to be uninstalled because they are not compatible with the upgrade. But, no apps are displayed in that page and when I click 'Uninstall and Continue', We couldn't
 uninstall these apps displayed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest me a solution to upgrade to the latest version. Find the screen capture of that page.<br />

            <p>Microsofts heavy handed approach to third party apps will back fire on them. In my day job, I am about to upgrade 1000 computers to Win 10. We have over 300 third party apps that are required for people to do their work. If MS thinks they can just ask us
 to stop using them, they will have a big surprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my issue, the 1607 upgrade originally complained about Apples iCloud. I need iCloud but believe there is a workaround to reinstall after the upgrade. So, I removed iCloud for Windows, rebooted and started the upgrade again. This time I get the message
 incompatible app but now name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried cleaning the registry too looking for remnants of iCloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this time, I will run the previous build until it stops working and then replace with a mac.</p>

            <p>Any new information on this. I just used Revo, uninstalled everything Apple including iCloud which the update originally complained about. I found another tip that was flagged "The Answer" that said do clean boot, disable all non-Microsoft services and startup
 items. 2 hours into this again and I still get the useless message complaining about an incompatible app yet it does not identify it.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to let anyone who still has this problem know that I solved it by installing the most recent version of my anti-virus (Kaspersky Endpoint Security 10). I then rebooted and everything went smoothly after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is still stuck on this, I would recommend uninstalling your anti-virus to see if that lets the upgrade complete. If it does, download and install the most recent version afterwards.</p>

            I do not think I explained the issue properly.&nbsp; The start menu appears fine if I click on the Windows key, but there used to be an icon in the system tray that would have the same function as clicking on the Windows key and this icon in the system tray
 is no longer available on my 2 PCs.<br />

                    <p>So, what's up with not offering Backwards Compatibility for&nbsp;L.A. Noire?&nbsp; I have the game from the Xbox 360...I even have the Rockstar Pass with all of the add-ons.&nbsp; It's now a Xbox One game, but not a BC...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know they've done this a few times like Minecraft...and then Minecraft: Xbox One Edition...or State of Decay and then&nbsp;State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition.&nbsp; But there's nothing about this in regards to LA Noire...anyone know?</p>

Are the photos in the .JPG or .BMP format?<br />
<br />
Something to try...<br />
<br />
Open Movie Maker 2.1 and go to...Tools / Options / Compatibility tab...<br />
left click the "Restore All Defaults" button / OK.<br />
<br />
You mention Pictures and Audio? What is the format of your Music file?<br />
The most reliable format for Audio/Music would be .WMA or .WAV.<br />

            Hello J,
<div>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I followed your instructions, but the problem wasn't resolved. The pictures are .JPG and audio is MP3. &nbsp;I made over 100 videos using these file types and hadn't experienced trouble. For what it's worth, the first problem was that
 I couldn't save completed video projects to my computer. Soon afterwards, no photos appeared on the preview pane when dragged and dropped onto the video timeline or when the timeline was activated to move forward. The audio component of the movie maker works
 well and was never an issue. &nbsp;If you've other ideas, please let me know.</div>

<br />
======================================<br />
You have been lucky...MP3 files have always been <br />
problematic in Movie Maker. And...sometimes .BMP <br />
will work when .JPG will not.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is go to...Tools / Options / Compatibility <br />
tab abd uncheck all the filters / OK.<br />
<br />
My only other thought would be that your Video Driver <br />
requires and update.<br />
<br />
One way to troubleshoot this would be to reduce your <br />
Graphics Hardware Acceleration.<br />
<br />
The following article explains how :<br />
<br />
(272193) PI: How to Troubleshoot Graphics Issues<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=272193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=272193</a><br />
(scroll down to "Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP")<br />
<br />
If you reduce your Graphics Hardware Acceleration <br />
and realize an improvement, it's an indication that you <br />
need to update your video driver.&nbsp; Improvement or <br />
not...be sure to return the acceleration slider to Full.<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

========================================<br />
Did reducing the Graphics Hardware Acceleration make <br />
any difference?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but if none of my suggestions have improved the <br />
issue...I have no idea what else to offer.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, someone else will have some ideas.<br />

            <p>It could be one of many windows updates that has caused the problem, or installing/uninstalling&nbsp; other programmes.</p>
<p>Are you saying that when using .bmp and wav instead of your jpeg and mp3 that you get exactly the same problem?</p>

            Thanks for your feedback skier-Hughes. &nbsp;I've only made videos using JPEG and MP3 - over 100 of them without problems. &nbsp;Suddenly, wmm stopped working (I don't recall a specific action associated with the shutdown). I wasn't permitted to save a video I'd
 completed creating, and then the video components ceased to function. &nbsp;I probably have only a handful of bmp and wav files. &nbsp;Thus far, what I wanted to use in my videos were jpge and mp3.. The audio works fine. &nbsp;I wonder why Microsoft issues windows updates
 that cause problems? &nbsp;Then again, hindsight is 20/20 for such things. &nbsp;All the fanfare that accompanied the presentation of Vista didn't last long. &nbsp;Bill Gates smiled (or grimaced) as one blue screen after another appeared during the launch. &nbsp;I also like to
 embrace a conspiracy theory occasionally, and windows updates are as ripe a target as any. &nbsp;Admittedly, doing so doesn't solve my wmm problem.

==============================================<br />
I was thinking you could post your question in the Movie Makers <br />
Forums and not just search the archives. There are some learned <br />
volunteers who post there and they may have a solution for you.<br />
<br />
Personally, I still think your source files are at the heart of this <br />
problem but you have made it clear that you do not agree. <br />
<br />
If you convert your JPGs to BMP and your MP3s to WMA or WAV <br />
before importing into Movie Maker and still have the exact same <br />
problem...I will happily stand corrected. No doubt I could be incorrect <br />
and it certainly would not be the first time.<br />
<br />
Not only that but sometimes files become corrupted and one <br />
corrupt file can easily derail a Movie Maker project.<br />
<br />
I don't think safe mode or a clean boot will have any effect on <br />
this issue.<br />
<br />
I hope you find a satisfactory solution.<br />

            Thanks for your continued interest and suggestions. &nbsp;How do I convert JPG to BMP and the MP3 to either WMA or WAV? &nbsp; I'm clueless as to why the original file types worked flawlessly for over 100&nbsp;videos, and why the MP3s continue to work fine.&nbsp; Why would
 they suddenly prove to be unusable?The glitches are in the monitor (preview pane) and trying to save a video to my computer. &nbsp;A new computer is likely the only solution, but I can't budget an upgrade. &nbsp;There is life after wmm, so I'll get used to it.

<h2>            Free Game &#38;quot&#59;The Maw&#38;quot&#59; With Summer of Arcade Purchase</h2>
                    
<p>I couldn't find the actual like, but I've been hearing that if you go through the Microsoft store and purchase any game hosted in the Summer of Arcade, you will get a free download for The Maw. Is this true? Also, I've heard this may only apply to Bastion.
 Anyone verify? I haven't bought anything from the MS store yet... does this download to your queue on your Xbox???</p>

<p>"As Joystiq points out, the Microsoft Store website mentions that you get The Maw for free with any Summer of Arcade game, but with a footnote that it's actually only valid for Bastion. However, this is due to a deal with Machinima who hand out the free
 game with every Summer of Arcade title. Hence the Machinima logo on the page.</p>
<p>The offer is for the U.S. Microsoft Store only and Paypal is not an option. So if you are not a U.S. resident, or if you aren't one but still use an American Xbox Live account to get cheaper games through the magic of exchange rates, this deal will probably
 not work for you without a valid U.S. address and matching credit card." &nbsp;-destructoid.com</p>
<p>I bought mine for $15.99 and The Maw was $0.00 (as it showed up on my cart) aswell i paid with credit card... they emailed me my codes and ta-da... Enjoy!</p>

<p>Eew... "Any Summer of Arcade Game," but only valid for Bastion? Suck. Lol, I already bought Bastion. Perhaps because the others aren't out yet? Hope things change by tomorrow, as I'm planning on getting From Dust. Thanks for the cliffnotes, Dark.</p>

<p>Okay, so I was a little bummed about not getting it since I already downloaded Bastion.--But I was getting From Dust anyway, so I decided to wait until it was hosted as the next Summer of Arcade title starting today (27th), and surprise.--It works. Just
 downloaded From Dust from the Microsoft store and got The Maw for $0.00. Just to let everyone know. But it doesn't look like you can go back and do it with Bastion or any of the previous Summer titles. So jump on them when you can.</p>

<p>This offer is available with ANY summer of arcade game and if you buy all 5 summer of arcade titles you also get a free game called crimson alliance.</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion with the maw, i believe it is only available through the microsoft store using a credit card and i also heard rumours that it is only available to US gamers.</p>

<p>Not "any" Summer of Arcade game... but it looks like you can do the deal with whatever current hosted game of Summer. Last week it was Bastion, but I had already purchased it off XBL Marketplace. This week, it was changed to say *only valid with From Dust.</p>

<p>How can you write a thesis on Windows policy and security if you are not familiar with the concepts? I recommend you check out the Microsoft Knowledge Base - you will find a wealth or technical articles there dealing with policies, policy editors, security
 and also on the registry. This is not something that can be dealt with in a ten-line reply in a user forum. If you don't know where to start, type the words</p>
<p>windows policy</p>
<p>into a Google search box. If the links you find there look confusing, attend a course on Windows Server Management.</p>

<p>sorry, Pegasus</p>
<p>my thesis title is network security management using mobile agent</p>
<p>the idea is as follow:</p>
<p>agent is migrating to hosts and gothering information from them (like&nbsp; password policies and other task).</p>
<p>I searched on password policy and i found that there are two methods</p>
<p>1- by group policy editor . this method is work good , but i can't read these settings by mobile agent</p>
<p>2- by registry editor . this method is not work but i can read thesee configurations by mobile agent</p>
<p>in general i want to set the password policies and read these settings by java program</p>
<p>sorry and thanks</p>

                    <p>I was playing World of Warcraft when it happened. The game froze and showed no sign for responding anytime soon. So I opened Task Manager and ended the program. I tried to get back into World of Warcraft after a minute, only for the game to flash me an error
 message and crash. The error message was "World of Warcraft was unable to start up 3D acceleration."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was odd, but I restarted my computer to see if that would resolve the issue. It didn't. I ran different troubleshooting scans and made a few setting adjustments with no improving my situation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked online, the first 'solution' was to enable 3D acceleration in the display settings, there isn't anything there that let's me do that (and yes, I checked).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next 'solution' came from this site. The guy asked for help, got a reply from a moderator that asked for some more details and offered a fix to the problem (odd since he just asked for more details for the guy's problem). The guy gave more details as
 well as the details he gave before, and never heard back from the moderator. The method the moderator offered was to check if the graphics card was up to date, and if not, update it. I tried this, and it didn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for other solutions, but found only the same thing from employees of Microsoft, a reply asking for more info followed by never responding again, I even saw someone misunderstand the customer entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am not misunderstood, or have no solution for my problem, I will answer other questions asked to customers by Microsoft employees to make sure I've got everything covered in one go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: What happens when you try to play the game?</p>
<p>A: Games. They fail to start. World of Warcraft crashes after closing the error message it gives me, in almost the same for most Blizzard games. I then went on to Steam games to see if anything else is playable, and only games lacking 3D models and other
 such things were playable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: Are you getting any error message?</p>
<p>A: Yes. For World of Warcraft, I get "<span>World of Warcraft was unable to start up 3D acceleration." For the games on Steam, "</span>Failed to initialize Direct3D. Make sure you have at least DirectX 9.0c installed, have drivers for your graphics card
 and have not disabled 3D acceleration in display settings. InitializeEngineGraphics failed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:&nbsp;<span>Are you able to play other games on the computer?</span></p>
<p>A: Not ones that have 3D elements to them, no. 2D games still function, but I don't have many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:&nbsp;<span>What is the make and model of the computer\graphics card driver?</span></p>
<p><span>A: The computer is an Alienware gaming laptop 17. The graphics card driver(s?) is/are Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Q:&nbsp;</span><span>Were you able to see any error message related to graphics card when you tried to upgrade to Windows 10?</span></p>
<p>A: No. This computer started off with Windows 10, and it was working with no fuss or problems whatsoever, and if there were problems, they were usually easily solved by the first or second solution I found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:&nbsp;<span>Are you able to view these games in full screen on the computer screen?</span></p>
<p><span>A: Yes. Unrelated, but yes. At least I could if I could play them, you know?</span></p>
<p>I hope I can get some help for this, and if you ask for more details about the problem, then please check back to see if I replied and gave you your answers. I'm shocked at what I saw here today.</p>

<p>I had the same problem and your article came up in my search. I found that the driver had become disabled and also needed an update. MY first reaction was make sure that the driver was up to date. The NVIDIA Geoforce application
 said that the driver was up to date. But when I went into the device manager, I found the driver to be disabled. The NVIDIA app may not pick up on that and just tell you it is OK. So I re-enable the driver then used Windows to update it. After the update I
 no longer received the acceleration error.</p>
<p>So search for Device Manager in the menu and then go to Display Adapters. You should see your driver there and can check to make sure it is enabled and check for an available update.</p>
<p>Hopes this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - System Repair Triggers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanvargas1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - System Repair Triggers</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I've gone through most of the posts that appear in the community regarding the Windows 10 System Recovery Loop. Along with that, I've noticed the majority of them pertain to upgrading to windows 10. Sadly, none of the solutions listed seem to have been
 able to salvage me from having to do a full reset on my computer at work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past 3 months I've encountered the Recovery Loop about 3 times. Predominantly when windows chooses to restart and update. Here is what is worth noting:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 - clean install:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No Externat Antivirus - Using Widows Defender</p>
<p>- Outside softwares in use: Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition, Zebra Label Designer Pro 2, Acrobat Reader, Chrome, Google Drive, Office 365, and Drobo Dashboard. That's it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I predominantly leave computer to sleep since there is a .bat file that runs every morning copying the files from google drive to the Drobo hard drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have been a big advocate for Microsoft products but over the last decade I feel the quality of Microsoft systems have been in a fiery Nose Dive. Honestly haven't seen a worthy OS since XP which sadly is no longer supported by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grumbles aside, here is my true reason for posting. I'm loosing way too much time in the stupidity of the recovery loop. In the past I've ran a recovery point and Disabled the Early Launch Malware or Disabled the Reboot Failure, and I've managed to get it
 to boot. Thankfully I do get access to the SafeMode so Iv'e backed up my documents that I hadn't backed up prior but I've lost a full business day troubleshooting a system that is meant to be reliable. It appears to be crashing due to running it's own updates
 thus, I would like to know where the triggers are for the System repair so that I can turn them off and just have that screen never come on again. It's a useless tool that is completely ineffective, specially when the majority of the solutions that are found
 IN THE MICROSOFT FORUMS, default to: If none of the tools worked, which seems to be the most common case, and if you aren't a avid programmer that can hack your way through, scorch all your document and reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a waste. If I can't trust that the system is reliable, I might as well change all the SO's in my company to a more reliable option. ****, all the issues I keep reading up on the many bugs making it through past development, onto clients, If it were
 a product of my business, we'd be loosing clients.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I apologize for the inconvenience caused. We are glad to help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur due to incorrectly configured, old, or corrupted device drivers. As well it can be due to corruption in Windows registry from a recent software change.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to deploy Startup Repair which automates common diagnostic and repair tasks of even unbootable Windows installations. If the computer fails over into Windows RE because of a detected boot failure, Startup
 Repair launches automatically. If however, Automatic repair fails over Windows RE too, Startup Repair can also be launched as a manual recovery tool from a Windows RE CD/DVD.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;Note: </span></strong><span>I</span>f that pc does not have the cd/dvd drive then use a bootable usb device for automatic repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Automatic Repair using an installation media</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows from it.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ‘Windows Setup’Page select the‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and‘keyboard or input method’ and click on‘Next’.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer: Create Windows 10 ISO</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;Method 2:&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p><span>I also suggest you that since the issue is occurring after Windows updates, perform System Restore and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to go through the below link and refer to the section “Restore from a system restore point”</span></p>

<h2>            Skype Recording in Version 8</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, I see many threads about Skype not able to do recording and this threads are locked so we can't response to it. Skype version 8 is possible but it seems to be difficult to do it which as below link shows that everyone in the conversation will know
 that you are recording and showed after the chat for you to download within 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to previously the discreet recording but there is a small symbol that shows someone is recording conversation. The new version is not user friendly and it's not happening only in this Microsoft product.</p>

            The ability to record calls was recently added back in Skype 8. As for discrete recording that is not available at this time, possibly due to privacy reasons.
<br />
<br />If you would like to see an aspect of Skype improved:
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi ShumKhunYein,
<br />
<br />Thanks for the feedback.
<br />
<br />You can give the feedback directly to the Skype Engineers to let them know what you think. They may make changes in updates based on it.
<br />
<br />To do that:
<br />
<br />In the app, click on your profile picture, then select Help &amp; Feedback and click Give feedback. This will open the feedback hub where you let them know.

<h2>            USB modem connects to internet but windows 10 seeks ethernet connection</h2>
                    <p>Let's set this out. </p>
<p>1) for various reasons I am unable to provide either ethernet or wifi connections</p>
<p>2) I must therefore use my USB 3G modem (prepaid mobile)</p>
<p>3) The modem connects to the internet. the internet icon clears the cross out and trying to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set up a connection results in a message that I am already conncted</p>
<p>4) Even so, no apps can connect to internet as they appear to be seeking an ethernet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connection</p>
<p>5) Drivers are up to date</p>
<p>6) Running in compatability mode does not fix this.</p>
<p>It seems that browsers and other internet-using apps can't see the modem. Perhaps there is a way to fix this. Does it need to be set as the default modem or what?</p>

</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; Dial-up puts a completely different look to your symptoms, though I still think that the default gateway should not be all zeros.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it won't matter if it is PPP.&nbsp;

</p><p>Well, now that we know that your RealTek driver is not being used, perhaps you should try disabling it?&nbsp; Give Dial-up back whatever overhead uselessly testing the LAN driver may be taking.</p>

<h2>            Does ANYONE know what is going on with IMAP - Windows Live&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows Live has been experiencing issues - there are a number of postings documenting this.</p>
<p>This has been going on for over a month now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know what's going on -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is temporary or not</p>
<p>Can anyone shed some light on these issues - Microsoft?????? &nbsp;You are supposed to be monitoring these forums yet you are silent!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting all kinds of messages -</p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP server not reponding, timing out</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Folders with these names can't be downloaded by your IMAP e-mail program. &nbsp;Junk</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Server Response: Your IMAP command could not be sent to the server, due to non-network errors. This could, for example, indicate a lack of memory on your system.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Unable to send or receive messages for the Msn (xxxxxxxxi) account.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity.</li><li>Moving files per my request - BUT I never made the request</li><li>Your IMAP server hasn't responded in 60 seconds - would you like to wait?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, even when new email comes in I cannot see the actual message!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful to have some information regarding what's happening since my Windows Live was working perfectly for months using the IMAP instructions that were posted earlier by someone named Firedog. &nbsp;Now opening Windows Live isn't helpful any longer
 and I refuse to use Outlook or Office 365. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP PLEASE SOMEONE!</p>

<p>Where and when are you seeing this message? It usually occurs because an IMAP client has a native folder with the same name as one of the IMAP folders. That's why it's important to tell the client (in this case Windows Live Mail) what the IMAP special folders
 are called:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6096ee32-83b8-4b01-ae2e-4ad9f52100fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97b0a837-da88-4e90-9ed3-bf8a25ede799" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of those seeing a message like this are using a basic mail app on an Apple or Android device to access the same mailbox via IMAP. The same applies here: the mail app has to be told which folders are which. Find out how to do so in the documentation
 for the app concerned.</p>

<p>Sorry but the FIX was changing the IMAP server. &nbsp;Something Microsoft didn't think we let us know they were doing. &nbsp;Once the server was changed to&nbsp;outlook.office365.com most of the problems were solved.</p>

            Hi Abdelrahman from your screenshot Chrome has 14 tabs open . . .
<br />
<br />Chrome is extremely resource hungry, while it is showing as using 0.5GB RAM and little Disc, it is definitely the problem from the screenshot you have provided
<br />
<br />From your screenshot - are you also defragging your hard drive in the background - check that to see if it is running a scheduled defrag - that will lock up your hard drive while it is running
<br />
<br />Most Browsers having that many tabs open at the same time will consume a lot of resources

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that the issue doesn`t happen when I upgraded to windows 10 version 1803 - OS Build 17134.48 because I have upgraded about 10 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I`m guessing this issue happened when I have installed the intel card update attached in the screenshot</p>

            As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

    <title>Fallout 3 GOTY Getting Errors On Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johndan0942  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fallout 3 GOTY Getting Errors On Install</h2>
                    <p>So, I got Fallout 3 GOTY recently and with the first try of installing just disc 2, it worked. Every time I'd launch the game after removing the disc and re-inserting it, it'd request for a 1920MB update and scan through already installed DLC or throw up an error. I have tried installing disc 1 then DLC from disc 2 and it still either shows an error, works only on the first launch or randomly deletes a DLC that has been installed causing the start main menu part of the game to crash to the Xbox dashboard. Tried clearing Xbox 360 saves and that didn't work, did a hard reset and that didn't work. I feel like this may be a bug in the Xbox emulation software or an Xbox One OS issue.&nbsp;Any idea's on how to get this working?</p>

                    <p>This blue pop up reoccurs on my screen. &nbsp;I purchased my new laptop end of Feb 2017. &nbsp;It came with windows 10. &nbsp;I then paid for my laptop to be set up for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do i just need to update windows or does it require further action? &nbsp;It asks for my product key which I'm not sure what this is, and also suggests I buy an upgrade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im currently abroad and do not have my original packaging / notes or receipts with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's relevant I have a Levono ideapad bought from best buy. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>If it came pre-installed with Windows 10 it should have the key embedded. Use the following command in Command Prompt (Admin) to find the embedded key.</p>
<p><strong>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey</strong></p>
<p>This will display the key which you can input into the Activation page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new PC with Windows 10 pre-installed shouldn't do this though, the licence does not expire. Did you buy it from best buy with Windows 10 installed. Who did the setup. The window you see suggesting an upgrade is because the licence is going to expire, but
 as I said a pre-installed system by Lenovo would not expire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you can post a screenshot of the message.</p>

            The popup could be a scam. Without seeing it we can't be sure.

</p><p>I understand your concern. I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that in Windows 10, updates are installed automatically every time there is an available update&nbsp;(Unless you’re on a metered connection, in which case the updates won’t download until you opt to get them.).&nbsp;This feature is to ensure that&nbsp;you
 don't have to search for updates online or worry that critical fixes for Windows might be missing from your computer. Automatic update installation is a feature by design therefore, the option to manually control the way updates are installed is not available
 in Windows 10.</p>

            I wish to thank all who tried to help.&nbsp; I have set up my systems to utilize all the methods allowed to minimize data use on win10.&nbsp; This is the only option MS will allow at this time.&nbsp; I hope they realize that automatic settings will not work for everyone
 in the public sector and reinstate optional updates in a simpler format as it was before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enterprise versions can select to opt out of the auto settings.&nbsp; The new Edge browser may be more in line with universal standards for browsers but wouldn't be nice
 to at least look like the old one. <br />

            Hey Jan,
<br />
<br />Windows has a feature to help you out with that by pressing the power button with your own setting! Hit Windows key + I together, and that will bring you into Windows Settings. Go into System on the top left. On the left side of the window, you should see the Power &amp; sleep button. Click that, and under "Related settings", go into Additional power settings. You should see a classic Windows style window named "Power Options". On the left pane of the window, you should see "Choose what the power buttons do". If you prefer that the power button puts your computer to sleep, select "Sleep" in "When I press the power button:". Now every time you press the power button, it should go to sleep.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you can hit Windows key + X together, then press U, then S as the menu cascades.

<br />I hope this has been helpful.
