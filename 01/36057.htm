    <title>Storage Space 100&#37; Busy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drumboots  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Space 100&#37; Busy</h2>
                    <p>This is a bit of a never-ending story. I've posted about this before, and of course there are many dozens of other posts all over the Internet talking about this issue*. I have a storage space composed of 2 x 2TB** drives, configured as a single mirrored
 pool, my "D:" drive. The D: drive frequently goes to 100% busy rendering my PC unresponsive. This happens so often I have pretty much stopped using my PC. This issue has plagued me since I first set up the Storage Space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I say "this issue" but obviously there are probably many different issues all under the "Storage Space 100% Busy" space</p>
<p>
</p><p>**A thought... the disks are Western-Digital "Green" low power Eco drives... maybe that's the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read many of the dozens of other posts, responses, "solutions", FAQs, etc., implemented pretty much every suggestion I could find or that was suggested to me, and still the drive goes to 100% bust pretty much any time any process touches that drive
 for any reason. Just sitting here typing out this post and the drive keeps spiking to 100%. At one point I did run a full chkdsk on the drive and that seemed to improve the situation, though it did not completely resolve the problem, and the issue seems to
 slowly get worse over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My GOG Galaxy client is set up to store games on my D: drive. Galaxy was downloading and installing an update last night for one of my games. Throughout this process the D: was 100% busy, leading to long pauses / stuttering while trying to do other stuff
 on the PC. Maybe my expectations are out to lunch but I don't think I should have to walk away from my PC every time some process wants to do some "work" on the D: drive (Dropbox also uses D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have pretty much given up and I am planning on trashing the Storage Space, though I would very much appreciate any additional ProTips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears you cannot remove a disk from a mirrored pool. <del>Looks like I need to "physically" break the mirror by pulling one of the disks, then I can kill the partition table, put the drive back in, and copy / clone the data from the remaining Storage
 Space disk to the empty disk, then delete the Storage Space.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2TB FireCuda disk I can free up to clone / migrate the Storage Space data to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the wall of text. Super frustrated with all of this. Software based disk volume management was solved ages ago so I feel like this should be much easier.</p>

<p>Hello Yasir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. The thread you linked to is my own previous thread on this issue. The solutions suggested in there have been tried. Nothing seemed to help, except running chkdsk.exe. Running chkdsk did seem to improve things, but only temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example: Right now my D: drive is completely saturated. 100% busy with response times up in the low to mid 1000s of milliseconds. I'm trying to identify the associated processes but the Resource Monitor does not make this easy, though Dropbox and my GOG
 client are both suspect. I just started my GOG client application. The D: drive is saturated and it is taking a very long time for a game to start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a681aa37-c3be-42a6-b383-f24437af57f8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a681aa37-c3be-42a6-b383-f24437af57f8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have given up. I am going to try to figure out how to remove the Storage Space device altogether and just use bare drives.</p>

<h2>            VS 2015 - Disable &#34;PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio are available&#34; prompt</h2>
                    <p>Every time I open a .ps1 file in Visual Studio 2015 it tells me "PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio are available" in an annoying yellow bar that pops up wanting me to install these tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to install these tools, I use a separate editor for PowerShell that I'm quite happy with.</p>
<p>All I'm using Visual Studio for is analyzing changes before checking things into TFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I make this prompt go away?</strong> I'm about to just go back to using Visual Studio 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons why you might be seeing this error, and re-installing or repairing the&nbsp;program isn't likely to help with any of them. Any solution that may be found for one will not necessarily work for any of the others.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, there are major changes taking place at Outlook.com, so you may be suffering the consequences of this. To see whether you are one of those affected,
</p>
<ol>
<li>When viewing your calendar, click the right-most button on the ribbon and select
<em>View account information</em>. </li><li>After signing in to your Microsoft Account and the account <em>Hello! </em>page opens, click
<em>View inbox</em> in the left-hand column.&nbsp;</li><li>Your Outlook.com page should open. In the top left-hand corner, you may see this:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b1a063a-03ed-4668-a743-b5aaae4d5656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b1a063a-03ed-4668-a743-b5aaae4d5656" /></a></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>If you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do</span>, your account has been upgraded and your contacts and calendar will not sync any more. If you also have the same account as a mail account in Windows Live Mail, it won't sync either, because the DeltaSync
 protocol that these functions depend upon isn't supported by Outlook Mail. </li><li>If you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">don't</span>, you have a different problem.</li></ul>
<p>Please respond to say whether your account has been upgraded or not. There are remedies available, but I won't post them until we find out whether the upgrade is the culprit. In your reply, please say whether you have the same Microsoft Account set up as
 a mail account in Windows Live Mail. If you do, it will appear in the folder pane of your mail window (press Ctrl-1 or click the first, Mail icon at the foot of the folder pane). Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. At the top of the <em>Server(s) </em>tab, you'll see the type of account - HTTP, IMAP or POP3. Please give this also in your reply.</p>

<p>You have two free Microsoft choices on Windows 10: the inbuilt Mail app, and the program you're already using. Apart from that, there are probably dozens of other mail clients you could install, many of them free. I'm not sure why you say that Microsoft
 gives&nbsp;you no choices; it doesn't interfere at all in your selection.</p>

<p>I quite understand. The error message you're seeing is displayed by Windows Live Mail. The questions I asked are about Windows Live Mail. I have only mentioned Outlook as in
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com</a>, the service that provides email, contacts and calendar support for your Microsoft Account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understood from your original question that you were using Windows Live Mail 2012 on Windows 10. If that is indeed the case, then please click on the right-most button on the
<em>Home</em> tab of the ribbon and tell me what options you see. This is the button I'm referring to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ff84f49-2af1-4959-b8d2-4a6aca0b1b28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ff84f49-2af1-4959-b8d2-4a6aca0b1b28" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The button will look different in different circumstances, but it doesn't move, and it's visible on every
<em>Home</em> tab - in the Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Feeds and Newsgroups windows. Can you still not see it?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail Contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fleetchief  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Contacts</h2>
                    <p>So when are the programmers at Microsoft, going to put down their Starbucks coffee and sort out the Contact system in Mail.&nbsp; It doesn't use 'People' or the Outlook "Address Book', but maintains its own database somewhere.&nbsp; Problem is that unlike 'People'
 or 'Address Book' it does NOT allow you to delete contacts that are no longer valid, OR correct contacts that have an error in the email address.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if one of your contacts changes his Internet Provider and thus his mailing address, you can't change it.&nbsp; You can add in his new address but then you're stuck with two addresses for the same person because you can't delete the old address. When
 you're my age, in my late 70's, in means I sometimes click on the old address when Mail pops it up and the person doesn't get the email I wanted to send him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is well known, but Microsoft seems unwilling to do anything about it.&nbsp; Every time we get a large monthly cumulative update I hope I will find Mail contacts have been fixed, but no luck so far.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think you'll find that the Mail app does indeed use the People app as its contacts database.</p>
<p>If you have connected contacts such as Facebook or Twitter, then no, you have to edit or delete those contacts within Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can edit or delete contacts perfectly normally.</p>

<p>It doesn't use People.&nbsp; I've just put a person's first letter (r) and Mail gave me *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' and underneath was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I opened People and it only showed the @shaw.ca address, which is correct and nowhere does it show the old @telus.net address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though I deleted the incorrect address in People, it still shows up in Mail.&nbsp; My local expert confirms that Mail keeps it addresses in its own data file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>"I think I may, repeat, may have found a clue as to where the Windows 10 Mail App this auto-complete list is stored.</p>
<p>I typed an email address incorrectly and like you, every time I created a new email it would pop up along with the corrected email address, which I had also typed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there was no obvious way to delete it....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I opened up a command line to <strong>C:\</strong> and typed <strong>findstr /s /i "invalid_email_address" *.* &gt; invalid_email_address.txt
</strong>and let it go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it finished and I looked at invalid_email_address.txt I found the invalid email address, along with other email addresses in a file:
<span><strong>LocalProvider_None_default.txt </strong>in directory: </span><span><strong>C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.People_8wekyb3d8bbwe\TempState\relevantContactsCache\</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I don't know if </span><span><strong>Microsoft.People_8wekyb3d8bbwe</strong> would be the same for everyone, but it should start with Microsoft.People.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First I removed the entry for the invalid email address from the file </span>
<span><strong>LocalProvider_None_default.txt</strong></span><span>, rebooted, but that did not fix anything.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then deleted the file </span><span><strong>LocalProvider_None_default.txt</strong></span><span>, rebooted, and that seemed to have resolved the problem.&nbsp; I no longer have the invalid email address popping up when I address a new email in the Windows
 10 eMail app.&nbsp; But the correct email address does pop up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&lt;Caveat On&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not sure if that will solve all the problems with the invalid email addresses and I have no idea as to what downstream effects there are by erasing&nbsp;</span><span><strong>LocalProvider_None_default.txt</strong></span> as I cannot find a reference
 to what that file is for anywhere.</p>
<p><span>&lt;Caveat Off&gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is just what I have found.&nbsp; Perhaps someone listening in from Microsoft can let us know what that file is for, surely someone knows."</span></p>

    <title>Live mail sent email message import gives wrong info in the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donalhugh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live mail sent email message import gives wrong info in the &#39;To&#39; column</h2>
                    I have a new PC (W7) and use Live Mail with several acccounts, not just msn. I needed to import sent items from my email accounts (not msn hotmail) on the old PC (also W7) to my live mail account. Using the Live mail export and import options, I exported
 the messages from the old PC to a USB stick. But on importing, though all the messages came across, the 'to' column gave my name, not that of the person the message had been sent to. Any way around this, please?

            <p>Thank you! The email accounts that show this problem don't save the sent messages on their servers so the option that you mention in your second paragraph isn't open to me. I have to use the files in the Application Data folder on the local PCs. Could you
 suggest to your development team that it would be a very useful addition if these files could include the name/destination ('To')&nbsp;for the message as well as the subject of the message and of course the message itself.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is a well-known oddity in the import function that occurs in certain circumstances. To correct it,
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder for the sent items.</li><li>Create a new folder on the desktop.</li><li>Select the messages in the imported <em>Sent items </em>folder, drag them out of WLMail and drop them on to the new folder.</li><li>Open the new folder and check (e.g. using <em>Details</em> view and sorting by
<em>Type </em>) that all the messages have the extension .eml . Any message whose subject ends with a period ('.') will probably have the extension ._eml . This has to be corrected*.</li><li>Select all the messages and drag them back into the folder you created at (1).</li><li>If all is well, delete the original imported <em>Sent items </em>folder and the temporary folder on your desktop.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>* To deal with them all in one go, </p>

<li>Shift-Right-click on the name of the new folder in&nbsp;Explorer's navigation pane and select

            <p>Thank you for your interest! </p>
<p>I followed your clearly set out procedure and found that 6 of the 285 imported 'sent' files had the ._eml extension. I changed these to .eml without difficulty. However, on dragging the files (now all *.eml) from the desktop folder to my new folder&nbsp;in WLMail,
 it was disappointing to find that the 'To' column still contained my name, not that of the destination. So either I am not doing this correctly or there is something more subtle going on.</p>
<p>I will try again later - thank you again.</p>

            Correction! The files in my new Sent Items folder now have my name in the 'From' column (which is an improvement) but now there is no 'To' column visible. So some progress but not quite there yet.

<p>I wonder if Microsoft would consider including this procedure in its&nbsp;FAQs on Live Mail or, if it is already available somewhere, make the path to it easier to find. I&nbsp;had a reasonably good look before&nbsp;posting on this forum. Glad that I did and I am very

<p><br />
I don't think MS or any other major software producer will ever add a workaround for a known bug to its FAQ. This particular program has more than its fair share of bugs, and they and their workarounds have all been uncovered by users. No official buglist has
 ever been published. There have even been cases where a bug identified in the testing phase has been squashed simply by removing the feature that it affected.
</p>
<p>Your best bet is to ask here and hope that someone knows how to deal with the particular problem you're experiencing.</p>

            <p>This recommendation did not work.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 with Windows Live E-mail.&nbsp; I created a separate folder in "Documents" named differently than the Windows Live Sent items storage folder, then went to&nbsp;c/Users/user/appdata/local/Microsoft/Windows Live Mail/Storage
 Folders / Sent Items and dragged all of the e-mails into the new folder in the "Documents" directory.&nbsp; Then I viewed the file suffix for all e-mails, they were all as indicated in this question stream ".emi", then created a new folder in Windows Live E-Mail
 using the e-mail software folder creation tools, then went back to the Windows Live Storage Folder Location, opened the new sent items storage folder and dragged all the e-mails back into the new folder.&nbsp; Closed and re-opened Windows Live and the new folder
 still has my name in the "To" column and in the "From" column.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, when I dragged the e-mails into the temporary sent items folder under "Documents", I went into folder properties and selected the "To" column as an attribute and all the
 correct names show up in the "To" column of a normal File Explorer folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get Windows Live Mail&nbsp;"window" display to show the proper "To" name, instead of my name.&nbsp; I will also add, the first column titled "Name"&nbsp;of the temporary&nbsp;folder in the&nbsp;"Documents" directory is a column of hexadecimal numbers instead of normal
 text.&nbsp; All other columns in the temporary storage folder have normal text, e.g. date modified, Type, Size, Title, To, From etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In accomplishing the instructions in the original "Community Help" sequence, I also have a secondary problem, I cannot delete the old Windows Live Mail "Sent Items" Storage Folder.&nbsp; Every time I delete the folder in the Storage Folder location under appdata,
 close and re-open the e-mail software, the e-mail software recreates the folder.&nbsp; If I right click on the folder in the Windows Live E-mail Software window, the "delete" selection is grayed out.&nbsp; So now I also need help to delete the old sent items storage
 folder.</p>

<h2>            Problems, Problems, Problems, Windows 10 I suppose</h2>
                    <p>I'm really so very tired of all the problems I have with Microsoft and windows 10&nbsp;.&nbsp; I'm always having printer problems and I go to Printer Website and follow all their suggestions and usually It comes down to some glitch with 10. I try to change printer
 properties and the computer tells me I do not have administrative authority. When did this happen and why? This does not come from Dell. I've gone through all of this with them. It must be something with Microsoft. There is always something wrong and I feel
 I truly do try each and every time to carefully follow directions to fix this or that and it just seems to be that nothing is ever quite right with Windows 10.&nbsp; Sorry, but that is just the way I feel and I know plenty of other folks who feel the same. I mean
 you get what you&nbsp; pay for, right? Ten was free........I'm just saying. I think I'm ready for iMac for real now. Disgruntled and confused.</p>

<p>If you're finding Windows 10 to be a challenge you should consider a Chromebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Chromebook is much simpler to use than a computer from Microsoft or Apple, since most of the operating system is managed directly by Google so you can spend more time actually&nbsp;<em>using</em> your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computers from Microsoft and Apple are more customizable than a Chromebook, but with that additional flexibility comes additional configuration settings that are simply beyond the ability of many people to figure out. And you may have noticed that computer
 technology is becoming more complicated, not less so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see what Windows will look like in the future, use a Chromebook today. Besides, Chromebooks are a fraction of the cost of a computer running Windows or MacOS.</p>

            Thank you for your input.&nbsp; I won a new iMac so I feel I should at least attempt to grasp the basics of it.&nbsp; I think a change will be a good thing even if it proves challenging.&nbsp; All I've ever worked with is what I have now.&nbsp; Apple is relatively generous
 with their 'in house' free training, etc. so why not?&nbsp; I'm somewhat familiar with the Chromebooks.&nbsp; I do appreciate your ideas. Thanks!

<h2>            win 10 video card driver</h2>
                    <p>I have installed win 10 on 2 computers. My old one with a Radeon 5770 runs all my games fine. My new computer which uses an Nvidia Geforce GTX750 Ti will not. I have tried to update the driver from Nvidia to the latest one but it never installs even though
 it says it has. When 8/6/2015 12:36:27 PMI open device manager I see that the old driver is still being used. I open the events section of the video card and this is what I get.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also rolled back to Win 7 and everything was good. Reinstalled Win 10 and got
 the same problem.</p>

<p>However, many/most of the pages do not contain the word.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I don't think you can add a sub-folder to the SendTo folder.</p>
<p>If you click a file and click the name of the sub-folder, it will simply send a shortcut for the file to that sub-folder.</p>

<h2>            Downloadable content has changed&#58;Storage device has been removed &#40; xbox 360 &#41; Call of Duty Black Ops 2</h2>
                    
<p><strong>T<span>he Answer/Solution!!!!!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>This Should Work for you. i had and old white X-Box 360 and got the red eye of death. so i got the black slim with a 320g hard drive. problem started mainly
 when i downloaded new map pack on C.O.D. 2 I was so pissed to get into a game and soon as i think I'm about to go hard in the next round....ERROR.&nbsp;Downloadable content has changed:Storage device has been removed. And my picture sometimes be all screwed up
 camouflaged in weird colors. What the *%^* ... I Didn't remove anything. Anyway let me tell you what i did, this only applies to you if you have a different console that you started with, a different hard drive/Storage device/ or USB etc.. 1. From a Computer
 you have to register online, the X-Box your now using. (it asked for your serial number etc). all or most of your downloads etc may still be linked to your old device as mine was which was causing the problem. after you register you must log out/Sign out.
 &nbsp;You must do a license transfer on your x-box console, (settings/accounts/license transfer) &nbsp;This can only be done once in every 3 months. On your Xbox unit you have to clear the cache then delete your profile to completely clear your x-box memory or attachment
 to old devices. &nbsp;Don't worry about deleting your profile you won't lose your points or anything you had before..You can also reformat your hard drive(optional) that's what I did because got everything back game related. &nbsp;then power down your X-box. &nbsp;If you
 can give it about 20-30 minutes for X-Box servers/systems to update new console information. its recommended. Power on your unit, sign in you profile, once you place you game in, the system should let you know you have an update. &nbsp;Agree to update and allow
 to install, go to your computer sign into X-Box live go into my account, go to download history. &nbsp;There will be a list of all downloads for the last few years, click on content that you want re-installed on new X-Box. Skip what you have deleted or no longer
 want. &nbsp;You have a limit to how many downloads you can have in your download queue, once your queue is full allow time for several of the items to be re-installed on console before adding more content to the queue. &nbsp;Once you finish this step, go back to your
 console you will see your active downloads full of content being downloaded. &nbsp;Once complete you should be a happy gamer. &nbsp;Be aware if you console active downloads says something like already &nbsp;attached to other device. &nbsp;If it states this it means that your
 X-Box console is not registered properly with X-Box, and you may have to redo steps or call X-Box and let a representative guide you through this.Make sure you have background downloads enabled because if you have as much content as i do, it will take some
 time. anyway i'm back on Call of Duty playing kill confirmed mainly but have not seen that message anymore. HOPE THIS WORKS FOR YOU TOO</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;Always open with&#34; doesn&#39;t work&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<br />
I am trying to choose a program to always open my .lua files with. But it wont work! When I choose the program of my liking and hit "Always open with" and press OK, it opens the file but does not change the always open with choice. I tried selecting another
 program and then select the one I want and hit OK, but still same issue.<br />
<br />
I have even tried to left click "Properties" -&gt; and change "Open with" but when I pick a program it doesn't change. This problem is driving me crazy and happens with all extensions I try to do this with.<br />
<br />
The only thing that works is the default things such as which browser to use etc.<br />
<br />
I would value any help I could get, thanks!
<p>
</p><p>(Plus the windows was freshly reinstalled 2 weeks ago)</p>

    <title>Maximize,Minimize and close bar disappear from Edge browser in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Maximize,Minimize and close bar disappear from Edge browser in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have windows 10 and have been trying to use the new edge browser but when I have multiple tabs opened they will randomly disappear along with the "x" to close the window and the "-" minimize button. All I can see is the current tab I am on with no way
 to click and view other opened tabs. I can use the keyboard option and&nbsp;press "control tab" to scroll thru the opened tabs but&nbsp;I can not see the tabs on my display to click on the tab I want to view. I have to right click on the edge icon select close, it askes
 if I want to close all tabs and I have to select yes and close it all down and start over. When I reopen edge the "x and -" to close or minimize are back and I can open new tabs and view them for a while then they disappear again and I have to start all over
 closing it down again. How do I get the tabs back without shutting everything down and loosing all the tabs I had opened?

            It does it almost daily. It will work for a while and then out of no where all the tabs for the open web pages in the tabs just disappear from the top of the screen. Microsoft Edge is a&nbsp;web browser&nbsp;that came with the win10 upgrade would that be in device
 manager with drivers? I thought that was just for hardware you put on your computer. I do the updates every time it pops up and tells me to download updates. this problem did not start after an update it has been doing it since I started using edge.

            I figured out what was happening. Still don't know why it does it but I had my taskbar at the top and when viewing Edge&nbsp;in full screen the very top of the Egde screen (the part with the tabs)&nbsp;would disappear behind the task bar. Not always as when you
 opened it, it would be below the task bar and I could have 6 or more tabs and it would be fine for a while. Then it would just disappear. I have moved the task bar to the bottom and I'm trying to get used to it there.

            Hi Haris, lots of users are reporting this for the last few days. There is an incompatibility with Dell Support assist and the latest Windows Update
<br />
<br />Hopefully Dell are taking notice of this and will release an update within a few days . ..

            It's a little ironic that you are having a problem with the dell support page.  Try finding another way to contact dell.  Often sites / companies will have an email "contact us' address you can use. 
<br />
<br />You could also try submitting a Feedback to MS.  There is a tiny chance they could contact Dell to help clear up the problem. It is better for MS if Dell is providing support for their own customers ... 
<br />
<br />.

<br />Our AI approach has enabled us to quickly spot issues during deployment of a feature update

<br />We immediately blocked all PCs that could be impacted by this issue from being updated, and communicated to customers within 24 hours, including an initial work around.

            Removing the mail server ie *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or whoever you're using and then re-adding the address in the win 10 mail app is suppose to do the job. works with AOL, but not Yahoo for some reason. Mail was working fine
 and syncing until I change my Yahoo password. Now no sync. The delete re-adding procedure may work for you.

<h3> coachgayle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 stuck in permanent loop, never finishes</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to complete the free upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7. &nbsp;This evening I clicked on the Get Windows 10 icon, and got to the screen that told me the upgrade has been confirimed and downloaded; then I clicked on continue and agreed to the
 license thing, then I got to a screen that said I could set a time for installation, so I chose 9 pm ET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left the laptop plugged in and turned on and left it for 3 hours. &nbsp;When i came back at midnight , the Get Windows icon had disappeared from the active tray and nothing appeared to have been upgraded. &nbsp;I see zero signs of change, and the machine says it
 is still running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started all over. &nbsp;And now this is what happens in an endless cycle: &nbsp;When I click on the Get Windows 10 icon, i get to a screen that tells me that the upgrade has been confirmed and the upgrade has been downloaded. &nbsp;Then when I click on "continue,"
 it goes to a blue screen that says "working on it." &nbsp;It works on it for some time (10 minutes?) and then stops and the windows 10 icon disappears from the active windows tray, and i have to start all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<p>So what is "<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Windows 10 installation media", and what is an ISO image, and why does this have to be so difficult? I want a one-click solution, am not equipped

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Yep, it's still "working on it" half an hour later. &nbsp;Maybe I'll just keep 8.1, except they'll probably stop supporting it, and then charge me to go through

            This is not helpful.&nbsp; The windows 10 upgrade is a download from Microsoft - we didn't receive any "installation media".

    <title>File sharing from Windows 7 PC to snow leopard MAC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms8107242  say:</h3>
<h2>            File sharing from Windows 7 PC to snow leopard MAC</h2>
                    Been trying to file share between a windows 7 pc and an iMac running snow leopard. Have successfully connected to the PC from the iMac using the Go/Connect to server method. From the windows 7 PC perspective, the iMac shows up in network neighborhood,
 but when I double click on the iMac, immediately get an error message - "Windows cannot access ..." then the name of the iMac. This is associated with error code 0x80070035. There is no time delay in this error --- it pops up immediately.<br />
<br />
From the windows 7 PC, I can successfully ping the iMac by name and IP address. The iMac and PC are using the same workgroup name as well. I'm thinking the problem must be on the windows side.&nbsp; From a windows 7 network perspective, under current profile / advanced
 options, my settings are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>network discovery - on </li><li>turn on file and printer sharing </li><li>turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the public folders
</li><li>use 128-bit encryption to help protect file sharing connections </li><li>turn off password sharing </li></ul>
Public profile / advanced settings set up the same way.<br />
<br />
One other thing I did, to no avail, was edit the registry to add a new word (lmcompatibilitylevel) at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
<br />
Not sure what else to do.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; Would appreciate any help. Thanks.

<p>Hello <span><span>ms8107242</span>!</span></p>
<p>Try using these settings on the win7 computer.</p>
<p>Change use 128-bit encryption to help protect file sharing connections to: <strong>
Enable file sharing for devices that use 40- or 56-bit encryption</strong></p>
<p>Also hopefully you are using Windows 7 Professional or above. Change these settings in the Local Security Policy:</p>
<p>It says vista but it is the same for Windows 7.</p>
<p>I found this information from another board somewhere:</p>
<blockquote><strong>The other problem is the Minimum Session Security for NTVLM SSP based Clients.</strong><br />
To get around this:<br />
<br />
1. In Vista, open the Control Panel<br />
2. Switch to "Classic" view<br />
3. Double-click Administration Tools<br />
4. Double-click Local Security Policy<br />
5. Or Secpol.msc<br />
6. Expand "Local Policies" and select "Security Options"<br />
7. Alternate : Type secpol.msc to get editor up then<br />
8. Locate "Network Security: LAN Manager Authentication Level" in the list and double-click it.<br />
9. Change the setting from "Send NTMLv2 response only" to "Send LM &amp; NTLM - use NTLMv2 session if negotiated"<br />
<strong>10. Network Security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP Based (including secure RPC) Clients<br />
11. Change the setting from "require 128 bit" to unchecked (No Minimum)</strong><br />
12. Click OK</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if this works for you. Cheers!</p>

    <title>Error 1059&#58; Circular service dependency and others - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prettydesperate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1059&#58; Circular service dependency and others</h2>
                    I'm having a lot of problems with my computer recently. The most pressing, it seems, is the lack of sound. It just... stopped running one day. I've diagnosed that the Audio Service is not running. I've searched around, checked the services.msc already,
 but...<br />
1) When I try to start the Windows Audio service by pressing "Start the service" n the tab right by the service list, I get the message: "Windows could not start the Windows Audio service on Local Computer. Error 1059: Circular service dependency was specified."<br />
2) Trying to start the Plug-and-Play service, as mentioned in one of the solutions I've found, I get "Error 2: Could not find the file specified"<br />
3) I can't give any system specification, since my "Devices and printers" list contains of... 0 elements. Or at least that's what it's showing me.<br />
4) I've tried the SFC scan, but it detected no integrity violations.<br />
5) I've tried running Fix-It (again, as hinted in one of the other threads), but it simply states, that I don't have a sound card.<br />
<br />
Please, help me! What should I do now?<br />
<br />
NOTE: Since I'm working on an Aspire One netbook, I can't put in any Windows7 DVDs. There's simply no CD drive. My Windows was set up by default as a Windows 7 Starter.

<p><span>As you have already tried few troubleshooting steps and still facing the issue, I would suggest you to
 try performing System restore to an earlier point of time before the issue occurred:</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
thank you for such a quick answer. The problem appeared over half a year ago but as far as I recall there were no recent changes.<br />
<br />
I gave the system restore a shot, but it didn't help. What is more my system crashed during installing the updates while turning off and now there's a new issue: After the computer turns on, the only visible thing is the mouse pointer. I can not log in, turn
 on the task manager, nothing. The mouse and the keybord respond, but nothing appears.<br />
<br />
While using the safe mode with command prompt while turning the netbook on, drivers stop loading at BMLoad.sys, stay like that for five seconds and display the mouse pointer on a black background. Is there a way to save my data? Or is it time to say my goodbyes?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue might have occurred due to graphics card drivers being corrupted. As the computer came pre-installed
 with Windows 7 operating system, I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer for resetting the computer to its original settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 Be sure to contact them and back up any data you want to keep before you begin as there might be a potential for data loss.</span></p>
