<h2>            connecting two monitors to a pc</h2>
                    I'm trying to connect two monitors to an HP. I've used a twin VGA cable but whan I go to the Display page of Setting, only a single screen seems to be detected. What should I do?

            You can not use a splitter and get 2 display icons in display settings. You can not extend desktops for separate screens. All you will get is Mirrored.

<p>How many ports on your PC do you have on Video card??</p>
<p>VGA</p>
<p>HDMI</p>
<p>DVI</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have only one&nbsp;VGA port on your card, you need to buy a new video card with more than one port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, many video cards have 3 ports, VGA, DVI, HDMI or combos of those and also other connection types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But make sure if you get a card with more than 2 connection ports, that the card supports more than &gt;&gt;2 at a time operating&lt;&lt; as many will only allow 2 displays at once. So if you want 3 total displays, make sure card supports it.</p>

            Hello, Tonybulger
<br />
<br />Windows 10 allows you to duplicate, expand and use 2 screens, to use it only you must simultaneously select the Windows + P keys and (once the two monitors are connected) select the option you need
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

</p><p>how do you disable and remove airplane mode. my laptop never leaves the house, so I don't need this feature. my Toshiba laptop keeps going into airplane mode by itself and I can't get it off. I've tried looking in control panel, settings and anywhere else

            I found the solution to this problem at:<br />
<br />
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121227004715AAu7ZM7<br />
<br />
The solution provided by 'shakira':<br />
<br />
go to start menu<br />
search up "brightness"<br />
click on adjust screen brightness<br />
On the side you will see "Panel Open-Power On" click on that<br />
go to keyboard tab<br />
check the option that says "Standard F1~F12 mode"<br />
then it'll say that you have to restart computer click yes to restart now or restart later<br />
When ur computer is done restarting u wont have that problem <br />
<br />
This works.<br />

<h2>            Windows Update searching for updates forever</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi! I'm having trouble with Windows Update on my old laptop with Windows Vista Home Basic installed.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Basically what's happening is it's unable to finish searching updates. I tried Microsoft FixIt (it shows error 0x80070003 in the end and can't fix it no matter how many times I run it) and manually resetting Windows Update components,
 no luck, still searches forever. Strange thing I noticed is that standalone Windows Update packages seem to work for only about a few minutes after logging in, after that even they stop working (installer just hungs on "searching for updates", duh). Is there
 any possibility to fix it? I really don't want to reinstall again, because I did that already and this thing happened (for the first time after many reinstalls). I'll appreciate any help.</p>

            <p>Hi BuIlDaLiBlE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since August 2015 there have been a large number of Vista users posting about Windows Update (WU) hanging at the initial "<em><strong>Checking for updates...</strong></em>" phase.&nbsp; The problem seems to be most severe during Patch Tuesday updates when a large
 number of updates are posted on the MS servers.&nbsp; To date, the only solution I know is to start a manual WU and then leave your computer idle (often for several hours) until WU finally reports that updates are available for download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started a thread in this forum titled <em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/august-2015-windows-update-for-vista-requires-one/1016829d-50d2-4a2b-91bc-5e1591f47c1b?page=1">August 2015 Windows Update for Vista
 Requires One Hour to Run to Completion</a></em> that might provide some useful information, and Jamie1968's March 2016 thread
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/windows-vista-updates-stuck-when-searching/9755f291-afc8-4244-88e1-818dd3b0fb52?page=1">
<em>Windows Vista Updates stuck when searching</em></a> might also be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a very long but informative thread started by ScousaJay over in the VistaForums titled
<em><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/windows-updates/303992-windows-update-just-seems-hang-while-checking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">windows update just seems to hang while checking</a></em> where several Vista users, including myself, are posting.&nbsp;
 That thread will at least give you an idea of the array of unsuccessful fixes people have tried, and if any reliable solution is eventually found I imagine it will be posted there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most affected Vista users report a long hang for "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" but no other obvious problems such as error messages or failed downloads.&nbsp; I'm not sure if your MS FixIt error points to a possible problem with one of your WU components,
 but you might want to run Microsoft's <strong>System Update Readiness Tool</strong> just to see if it finds any issues.&nbsp; MS has download links for this tool for
<strong>32-bit and 64-bit OSs</strong> (Vista and higher) in the support article the
<em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/what-is-the-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What is the System Update Readiness Tool?</a></em> and the WindowsClub article
<em><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/checksur-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CheckSUR: System Update Readiness Tool to repair Windows Update</a></em> has a good explanation of how this tool works.<br />

<p><span>Hi

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can just create an Office 365 Group as the following article shows and then add the people you want to involved in to this Group. Then you can just search the Group by name in the
 search bar in Skype for Business and add the group to your contact list. You will see all the members in the Group are listed under the Group in Skype for Business.&nbsp; The others in the Group can also add the group to their Skype for Business in the same way.</p>

    <title>I&#39;m not sure if my copy of Windows 10 is&#47;was illegal, can I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seagull_2  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m not sure if my copy of Windows 10 is&#47;was illegal, can I keep everything I made &#40;and maybe sometimes published&#41; before previously on what could be an illegal copy or no&#63;</h2>
                    So, a while back, I think a couple years back, someone repaired my computer, and while we were activating I think it was Windows 8/8.1, we might have used a key we found online. After that, I upgraded to Windows 10. So I'm assuming that Windows thinks
 that my copy is genuine because of the upgrade but if it is not, and I went to get a new license key/other method of activation and used it on my system, can I keep the stuff I used to make/publish on the machine? Thank you and I'm sorry if I used a non-genuine
 key. Sorry if the way I worded it is confusing.

            Hey there Seagull! As long as you don't see the "activate windows" on the bottom right corner of your screen, you can be confident your windows is a legit installation. Regardless of that, windows itself does not control what you've done on your computer, and all of your files will remain unaffected.
<br />

            Hi Seagull.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the status and Edition listed at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Have you received any messages about Activation or Expiration?   
<br />
<br />If the PC came with WIndows 8/8.1 then it might have been activated at the factory with an embedded Product Key that can be read by installing ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> and looking for OEM-BIOS key.  If you'd then Upgraded to WIndows 10 it should have a Digital Activation for the life of the PC.  If someone later installed a bogus key then it was unnecessary and foolish, because you can easily reactivate with the Digital License by restoring the default version Product Key.  I can help you do this if you report back results of above.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Seagull 2
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />What version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Home,  Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />What exactly is reported under Activation?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv

            Hi,
<br />unfortunately your words "thinks that my copy is genuine because of the upgrade but if it is not" are totally wrong.
<br />EULA says: Updating or upgrading from non-genuine software with software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation, you do not have a license to use the software.
<br />Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed.
<br />
<br />So the question is: do you have a license? How did you obtain it?

<p>Hi Dave.</p>

</p><p>Sorry I took so long to reply. The edition is Windows 10 Pro. Also some additional info, I reset my computer recently, but I didn't enter any new product keys or anything, I just reset fully (Remove everything -&gt; All drives -&gt; Just remove my files) through
 Windows itself.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 home change from local to administrator</h2>
                    <p>Hi Gurus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 home edition and am having all sorts of trouble to make my account an administrator account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be administrator but for some reason is now a local standard user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I don't have the option to select family and other user when I access accounts in my Windows 10 so I cant update this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being logged in as standard user, when I try any CMD prompts, I get an error not authorised to make this change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I keep going around in circles to try and get this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant make any updates etc which is not good given constant security updates that are coming out quite regularly now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated so I can have my account reflecting administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks - SG.</p>

<p>Thanks for waiting for an answer Sharyn. While doing our research regarding your post, we have found a
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security-winpc/lost-administrator-rights-in-windows-10/4a0cda89-516b-4d5f-a2c2-36e3b8fdb40d">
similar thread</a> about losing administrator rights on the computer. It appears that the Hidden Administrator Account was somehow activated on your computer, although we cannot rule out what might have caused this to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put it in layman's term to avoid technicalities, a Hidden Administrator Account is a built-in account in Windows 10 and other earlier versions of Windows. Before, in the earlier versions, the hidden admin is created as default account. In Windows 10,
 it should have been disabled, just like what you had, prior to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should the solution provided in the similar thread would not work for you, kindly visit the link provided here and proceed with resetting the PC:

<p><span>I understand your concern, well TomTomHOME2winlatest.exe file stores important information on how the program or a Windows service needs to run.
<span>Usually, this error occurs when t</span>he registry key is invalid or damaged. I suggest you to restart your system to see if this error could be a glitch.
</span></p>
<p><span>This can also occur because of incorrect installation or uninstallation of a software, you can try uninstalling or installing that software again
 to see if it can fix the problem. Also make sure the Windows Updates is up-to-date. Type
<strong>Windows Updates</strong> in search bar and select Check for updates from the results. If updates are available, try installing them and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

            Hello Kathleen,<br />
<br />
Windows Hello is a more personal way to sign in to your Windows 10 devices with just a look or a touch. Microsoft brings a multiple features and capabilities to Windows 10 and makes it easier than ever to authenticate yourself on a PC. You can use a Password,
 PIN, Picture Password for logging into your computer. From the Windows login screen, you can just switch between these sign-in or log-in options.<br />
<br />
You can use Microsoft email account based logon or a Local account to access your computer. However, there are some design conflicts that may not allow you to use either of PIN or a Picture Password to log into your system. For example, when you’re in Safe
 Mode, neither of these alternatives work and you need to have a traditional password in that case.<br />
<br />
If you’ve set up multiple sign in methods, such as a password, a PIN, or facial recognition, Windows will offer different sign in methods at the sign in screen, in that case sign-in option must be selected.<br />
<br />
You can configure your Windows Hello settings by following these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Select the Start Start symbol button.<br />
2. Then select Settings.<br />
3. Select Accounts.<br />
4. Then Sign-in options to set up Windows Hello. <br />
5. Under Windows Hello, you’ll see options for face, fingerprint, or iris if your PC has a fingerprint reader or a camera that supports it. Once you’re set up, you’ll be able to sign in with a quick swipe or glance.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

<h2>            I can only print test pages</h2>
                    <p>I had a HP officejet pro 8610 that did not use the instant ink feature and we replaced it with the same officejet pro 8610 that does have the instant ink feature. My husband and daughter both have dells and they can hook up and print with no problem. &nbsp;Me,
 having an HP computer CANNOT hook up and print. &nbsp;The most I can get is a test page - and it says everything is ok with the printer &nbsp;hookup. &nbsp;I have tried HP doctor , also saying there is no problem. &nbsp;I still cannot get anything to print but a test page. In
 the queue it says it printed. &nbsp;What can I do? &nbsp;I can print from my IPhone ok, but not from my HP computer. &nbsp;Help??? &nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. &nbsp;makes no difference.</p>

<h2>            How can I cancel&#47;stop Windows 10 updates &#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is crazy, I can't find the cancel button anywhere and there is no info about the updates like it was on Windows 8 and 7 and all the previous versions..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 8:</strong> I usually saw what sizes were updates and I could hide them, now it's impossible to do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53b29127-6b1f-4f36-9f86-9cf868cf4963" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10:&nbsp;</strong>There is no old update program available, only this touchscreen&nbsp;<strong>Windows Phone OS UI&nbsp;</strong>update program which sucks. Why do I need so huge letters on non-touchscreen laptops, why is there no Windows 10 for power users
 ? On previous update program I could see like 25 updates in one window, but in this new window only 5, so I have to scroll many times to find what update I need and which I don't need.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4871ff14-af17-485f-99db-4d7ca076b1e8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I have to uninstall MS office completely and install it when I need it ? Looks like it's impossible to cancel updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to stop windows update service in services.msc, I hate having all office updates in 100 files, why microsoft can't make them in 1 file ? If I install 100 files I bet they are multiplying in some system32 folder, like it was with previous versions with
 WinSxS folder which had 90 K files...</p>

 a string of numbers and letters) - these are in addition to the system administrator.</span></p>
<p>Could someone tell me how these may have gotten there &amp; how to get rid of all the Users that I did not add?</p>

            You need to differentiate between two concepts:<br />
<ol>
<li><strong>User accounts</strong> . This is what you see in the Control Panel. </li><li><strong>P</strong> <strong>rofile folders</strong> . They get created when first logging on under a given account. They may or may not survive the deletion of an account. It depends on how you do it.</li></ol>
About your specific questions:<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>User-1</strong> . This looks like a profile folder for an account that no longer exists.</li><li><strong>Public</strong> . This is a required system folder. Leave it alone. </li><li><strong>Unknown User</strong> . These are probably folders for accounts that do not exist. Perhaps they were created on another machine.</li></ul>
If the folders bother you then you can do this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Seize ownership of them - see here:<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/24bdf172-2dbc-43b8-995d-a99b6a81413c/</li><li>Rename them by adding the suffix ".junk". </li><li>Wait a week. </li><li>Delete them if all is well, otherwise remove the suffix. </li></ol>

 nothing. Or disabling automatic times or automatic daylight savings. This is excessively frustrating, because although the time is correct in Pacific time zone, it's 3 hours difference from Eastern, and although all sites and apps display "5 minutes ago" and
 such correctly, they also assume the time is 3 hours different. Please help?

<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Type tzutil /l 
<br />Hit Enter to see a list of all time zones. Once you find your time zone, copy the description that is on the second line.

            Hi Monster.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For Time Zone incorrect in Windows 10 see possible fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1046405/windows-10-detecting-the-wrong-time-zone/1046553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1046405/windows...</a>

<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a legitimate copy of Windows 7 Ultimate (Not for ReSale) but when I attempt to install it, when it gets to "expanding Windows files" at about 2% I get the error message "The wrong volume is in the drive. &nbsp;Please insert volume GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD into
 drive E:" &nbsp;and the installation fails regardless of whether or not I click "cancel" "ignore" or "continue".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DVD is direct from Microsoft and doesn't appear to have any scratches or imperfections. &nbsp;Both the 64 and 32 bit discs do this.</p>

            <p>Backed up data &amp; settings to MS Cloud then used Windows Device Recovery process to flashback to WP8.1. Nokia auto updated kernel to "Denim" which gave me a working Call + SMS Filter. (took an hour to download).
</p>
<p>Rejoined WP10 Preview Fast Ring &amp; got OS Build 10.0.10586.71 update.</p>
<p>Call + SMS Filter disappeared??&nbsp; Here's where you just have to chill out for a day &amp; let all the updates &amp; downloads finish.</p>
<p>Apparently Build 10.0.10586.71 replaced Call + SMS Filter with Block and Filter to block unwanted calls &amp; messaging.</p>
<p>Now everything works fine if you follow the instructions exactly during the ROM "flashing" process.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 power management dumpster fire - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaaaaaaaaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 power management dumpster fire</h2>
                    <p>So. The 2/17/2016 super awesome firmware update that was the ONE TO RULE THEM ALL. Has succeeded in making things worse. Without further ado, let's get started...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Things burning in a dumpster fire:</p>
<ol>
<li>Waking the device from sleep after driving from home to work often times greets me with a black screen of despair. The type cover is ever optimistic, as it's backlight as well as the function key toggle operated. Alas with no video, it's a dumpster fire.</li><li>Sometimes, if I let it sit and think about things the video will come on and I can stop swearing about all the money I could have spent on beer if not for this unreliable tablet.</li><li>I should note that once I make it to work and the SP4 has successfully made the screen go, it's fine... UNTIL THE DRIVE HOME WHERE THE DANCE WILL CONTINUE BACK AT STEP 1.</li><li>In addition to the wake up swear menagerie, if the SP4 wakes up, there's a good chance it's been busy burning down the battery. For instance, in the 15 minutes it took for me to drive from work to the car dealer the SP4 burned through 6% of it's battery.
 In connected standby. In the laptop bag</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">What have you done for me lately?</p>
<ul>
<li>I have "gone back to formula" in an effort to separate out any 3rd party software doing it's dance with the Win10 internals.</li><li>Full-stop "nuke and pave" from MSDN ISO. Result =&gt; Dumpster fire from above.</li><li>Back-to-factory "restore from surface image" from Microsoft USB image =&gt; Dumpster fire from above.</li><li>All updates are installed =&gt; Didn't matter, dumpster fire.</li><li>Firmware update success verified =&gt; Meh, dumpster fire.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Oh GOD IT BURNS</p>
<p class="contentStandard">As there has been radio silence ever since the update dropped, or plopped, on us long suffering (outside the return window) Surface Pro owners - one can only assume that Microsoft deems the problem settled. It is not.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Why did I not return it during the window? Well, the majority of the time it was before FRANKENFIRMWARE 2.17.16 was unleashed into it's Gears of War like state of rampage upon the masses. Since then, I've gone through a half dozen
 permutations of re-installation and poking around at possible ways of mitigating the stupid that is the SP4 + Windows 10 combination.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But I've largely stopped. It's unrealistic for users to have to try to put out this dumpster fire. The blame lies squarely into whichever quad on the Redmond campus green-lit this product in this state. Just like on my iPhone, I
 leave every default setting on and if my iPhone dies without the help of Facebook, I can rightly blame the ghost of Steve Jobs for my rage and expect that Apple will sort it out.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The SP4 was the "tablet that can replace your laptop". Unless you need to be able to move it to different locations and have it wake up. Or you need it to not burn through it's battery in it's bag while "sleeping".&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">WILL YOU GET TO THE BLOODY QUESTION ALREADY?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Sure. When can we in the SP4 community get some relief? Additionally, if Microsoft has deemed the matter closed, will Microsoft extend our return window so we can walk away from a broken product?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">My specs don't really matter, but hey here you go: Surface Pro 4, i5, 8GB, 256GB. Fully locked and loaded Windows 10 install.</p>

<p>Are you seeking assistance from knowledgeable members of this forum or is your post simply venting?</p>
<p>If just venting then I wont waste any more time beyond having already read your post.&nbsp; But in your place I would not rely on Microsoft for some magical fix.&nbsp; There are many sp4 owners not having your issues.&nbsp; Draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have an SP4 that since the 2/17/16 update has had none of the issues you describe and has been very reliable. Given that you exhausted pretty much all troubleshooting steps above you should be talking to MS Tech Support for maybe a replacement under warranty.</p>

            <p>Paulo,</p>
<p>You got the point of my post exactly.</p>
<p>The way I see it there are 3 general areas for problem isolation.&nbsp; Hardware, software, and user.&nbsp; 2 of the 3 are correctable.&nbsp; Hardware is not.&nbsp; In this case either get a replacement or seek a full refund.&nbsp; Those who have had multiple replacements would
 be wise to investigate the lemon laws which apply to more then cars and are not limited to 30 days.&nbsp; I know that the US has federal and state lemon laws and that the UK has some very strong consumer protection laws.&nbsp;

            <p>I just wanted to add some support to this post - you are not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update I am experiencing what sounds to be a similar problem to the one that you're reporting, but it can actually be a bit more extreme for me in that there have been times&nbsp;when I press the power button to put my SP4 to sleep, and 2 minutes later
 come to turn it back on only to be met with&nbsp;the black screen. The only sign of life is the keyboard's function-lock light being on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never been patient enough to wait to see if it ever comes back to life (I have given&nbsp;it a minute or two though)&nbsp;- I have to hard reset by holding the power button down for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I type this on my desktop&nbsp;the fan on my SP4 has just kicked in. It's supposedly asleep. Turning it on, nothing looks wrong - no processes running amok and&nbsp;low cpu usage.</p>

    <title>sql server 2008 express will start to extract but won&#39;t launch the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phillip&#64;geremia  say:</h3>
<h2>            sql server 2008 express will start to extract but won&#39;t launch the install wizard</h2>
                    We are trying to install software (Waterlink DataMate 10) that uses MS SQL Server 2008 Express. &nbsp;Even though it is included with the software, SQL Express cannot install and I receive a message saying that it must be installed manually via Windows Update.
 &nbsp;I can't get the installer via Windows Update so I downloaded the file from the proper page. &nbsp;I am installing only the basic database package.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upon opening, the extraction window appears and can see the blue timeline. &nbsp;When extraction is complete I can see that window very briefly appears and then disappears instantaneously. &nbsp;No install wizard or prompts show up and the package cannot be installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We are running Windows 7 and everything should be up to date. &nbsp;However, just to eliminate any possible problems, I did try going through the installation instructions, which includes installed .NET Framework 3.5 and Windows Installer 4.5. &nbsp;The .NET package
 does the same thing as the SQL Express package - extraction (though quickly) and no install wizard. &nbsp;The Windows Installer 4.5 are unnecessary for Windows 7 and cannot be installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did run an MS FixIt app for installing/uninstalling programs. &nbsp;It found a problem with the registry, which it fixed. &nbsp;Nothing changed when I tried to install both the original Waterlink software or SQL Express.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked the list of installed programs in the Control Panel and SQL Server Express is not listed. &nbsp;The account being used is an administrator account. &nbsp;I have also tried downloading and installing other applications just to see if the same thing happened;
 I downloaded Google Earth and Dropbox. &nbsp;At first I thought Google Earth didn't work but then I found the installer file extracted another installer file, which then worked. &nbsp;Dropbox worked right away. &nbsp;It appears the problem is limited to these Microsoft installers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer is a newly built box, built by our IT guy. &nbsp;Unfortunately, he is not always around to fix things and he also had a problem installing the original software (Waterlink DataMate 10). &nbsp;I don't know what other problems he encountered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has any insight as to why I'm having problems installing the SQL package, I would like to get this problem resolved.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thank you!<br />

<h2>            usb ports stop working after plugging in ipad</h2>
                    <p>computer: hp probook 450 g1 (you can look up specs online)</p>
<p>windows 10 pro</p>
<p>so the other day i was backing up my ipad 2. when i plugged it in, windows played the usb connection found sound, but neither windows explorer or itunes could detect the ipad. so i unplugged it, and windows didn't play the usb disconnected sound. when i
 plugged it back in, nothing happened. windows didn't play the usb connection found sound, both file explorer and itunes couldn't detect the ipad. then i tried plugging my usb mouse, nothing happened. all 4 of my usb ports (2 usb 3.0 ports and 2 usb 2.0 ports)
 stopped working. a moment later, cpu usage jumped to 100%. i tried pushing the power button, going to the start menu and choosing shutdown but my pc wouldn't turn off. i tried pressing restart in the start menu but nothing happened. the only way for me to
 shutdown the computer was to cut the power supply, so i removed the battery and unplugged the AC charger. then, i re-plugged the AC charger back in and turn on the computer, and as usual, windows took a LONG time to boot after a power surge. after booting
 up and waiting a minute for the cpu usage to reduce from 100% to about 1-5%, everything was working fine. the 4 usb ports were working again, i tried plugging my usb mouse in and it worked. so i tried plugging in my ipad and the same thing happened. the 4
 usb ports stopped working, cpu jumped to 100%, pressing the power button didn't turn the computer off, and i had to cut the power supply and reboot.</p>
<p>i haven't tried plugging in another idevice or plugging the ipad into another computer. can somebody help me with this problem. and just to be clear, my laptop's performance is now the first priority, and my ipad can go to **** if it wanted to.</p>
<p>please help me fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>update: i tried plugging in my iphone 5s, the same thing happened. But when i plugged my iphone and ipad into my mom's computer (also running windows 10), it works like a charm. please help me fix this problem</p>
