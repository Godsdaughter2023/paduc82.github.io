            Hi Tom,
<br />
<br />In Windows 10, you can zoom everything together, that is about it
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings, in the Scale section add 10% to the current setting and check to see how everything looks
<br />
<br />
<br />If you do not like to use that scale feature:
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

            The simplest way is to hold CTRL Key and use scroll wheel of your mouse to zoom in and zoom out.

<h2>            Merging Files within Different Directories</h2>
                    How do I merge the contents of multiple directories into a single directory?&nbsp; Am using Vista.&nbsp; Is there anything other than cut and paste, cut and paste?

            You can do it with renaming the folders: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5295659/rename-folders-to-merge-them-together-easily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://lifehacker.com/5295659/rename-folders-to-merge-them-together-easily</a>.&nbsp; Here's another article on merging folders (I hope you understand the difference between merging folders and just moving documents - but these three articles will explain that)
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/290657/compare-and-merge-files-and-folders-with-winmerge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://lifehacker.com/290657/compare-and-merge-files-and-folders-with-winmerge</a>.&nbsp; Here's another program that merges several folders into a single folder ( or a single folder into several folders):
<a href="http://prmac.com/tags-tag-folder+machine.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://prmac.com/tags-tag-folder+machine.htm</a>.<br />
<br />
But frankly, it isn't all that much faster (unless you really are merging and I don't think that's what you really mean).&nbsp; If you're just moving files from several folders to one folder, then cut and paste (or drag and drop) is really the only way (but it can
 be faster than doing it file by file).&nbsp; If you open a folder you can go to Edit and Select All and then CTRL-C to copy (or CTRL-X to cut) and then move the entire contents at once to the destination folder.&nbsp; You can't have THAT many folders you want to combine
 (and besides, it's best to keep the files in separate folders so they are easier to find (sorted by some type of criterion - but that's up to you).&nbsp; I generallly find myself with the opposite problem of creating new folders all the time to manage my files
 better.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<h2>            Strange achievement added to my account. Could you remove it please&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>For some unknown reason an achievement has been added to my Xbox Live account. It is for the child's Xbox game Viva Piñata. I don't own this game, have never owned this game, don't even own an Xbox console to play it on and have never done so. Why MS have
 decided to give me this random achievement I don't know, thanks but no thanks. If you could let me know how to delete this game's achievement and its achievement list from my Xbox account please? All the instructions I can find are about doing so with an Xbox
 but I don't have one. I need clear instructions as to how to do this online over the web or through Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8 please. Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi! If an Xbox achievement or Windows LIVE achievement has been added to your account and added to your Gamerscore, it cannot be removed. Although how you got the achievement randomly is quite odd, has the child accidentally purchased and played on the game
 by accident?</p>

<p>Hey B0ngM0ng,</p>
<p>As I'm sure you don't want to hear this but here it goes. You may not remove a game from your acheivment list unless it has a 0 gamerscore. In your case though I would call Customer Support for the simple fact that if you have never played this game you
 be victim to unauthorized access to your profile. Call Support and fill them in if you think someone other than yourself has accessed your profile, they maybe able to remove the game for you. Beaware though if you do start action for unauthorized access your
 account will become locked until the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>I really wish I could have been of more help.</p>

<p>Since I don't own an Xbox, or a child for that matter, it cannot be a kid ordering games on my account. In fact, my purchase history shows I have never bought this game. No illicit charges have been made to my account so there's no suggestion from me that
 my account has been hacked by a preschooler to get one achievement. I do not need such investigated. Far more likely that this is just one of the many account screwups that can happen with MS accounts (been there before...). I cannot have my phone and two
 PCs locked out of my MS account whilst they investigate a supposed preschool hacker. If MS can suddenly decide to add an achievement, they can just as easily decide to take it back again.</p>
<p>How do I approach MS about this without them locking down my digital world on a wild goose chase?</p>

<p>Yes, it is very odd. My account has a completely empty list of Xbox console games (though had Windows and Windows phone games) and if I go to 'game details' from the link on the achievements it just tells me how much they will sell me the game for. All I
 have had added to my account is the achievements for the game with one achieved for renaming a piñata or some such.</p>
<p>If I just ignore this, will all the blank achievements that I can never achieve impact my score/stats? I'm only now getting in to MS gaming with my buying Win8 &amp; WP8 and their being all Xboxed up. I am more used to Steam (never had a problem with Steam).
 I really don't like the way that everything I do on my MS account seems to either be permanent, trigger a massive waiting period, require that I petition overseas support staff or require that I buy an Xbox to change a setting. I wish MS would just outsource
 their account management to Valve as their Steam system is not such a worry when I click an option. The MS ecosystem is generally great, but their account system is shocking. What is the downside of leaving this game's mostly empty achievement list on my account,
 if their is one?</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help chaps, it is dead nice of you all.</p>

<p>I don't think your gamerscore had any impact on anything at all, other than of course your "pride". &nbsp;It doesn't matter if its 0 or 1,000,000. &nbsp;Eveything works that same way as far as xbox live is concerned. &nbsp;The ONLY exception is if you are part of Xbox
 Rewards program, they give you special promotions for gamerscore.</p>

<p>So, are you indicating that having this load of blank achievements on my records will drag down my stats or won't? I don't quite get you. I understand that it won't change how the games I do own play, but part of the fun is seeing what my pals and I 'score'
 and I just want to know if leaving this on the record will become an albatross. Basically, whether it is worth the risk of contacting MS because they may cut me off for my trouble it seems.</p>

<p>I believe you can remove the games that show a gamerscore of "0". &nbsp;It won't effect your stats, its not adding nor taking away from your gamerscore. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 crashes&#47;reboots repeatedly near time of automated scheduled backups</h2>
                    <p><span>I have fully patched 64-bit Windows 10 Pro box on top of an Asus Z97-A motherboard (originally purchased with Windows 8.1 Pro at the end of 2014). I have an older Lacie external 2TB drive I have used for backups for years (under Windows 7 Pro). 8.1
 dropped automated backup but now I’m using it again under Windows 10. (Backup/Restore is Windows 7 based but included again in Windows 10.)
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My machine (crashes then) reboots overnight somewhere between everynight to once a week. As I adjust the time backup starts, I have found the crash time follows. Therefore I believe automatic backup is the cause of the crash. I can run backup manually
 and never see it crash/reboot. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, when I moved backup time to 5am here is some of what I see in event viewer:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6/8 5:00 AM CAPI2 Cryptographic Services failed while processing the OnIdentity() call in the System Writer Object.</span></p>
<p><span>6/8 5:46 AM Service Control Manager A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the WSearch service.</span></p>
<p><span>6/8 5:47 AM DistributedCOM The server {AB...} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</span></p>
<p><span>6/8 6:04 AM EventLog The previous system shutdown at 5:28:19 AM on ‎6/‎8/‎2016 was unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span>6/8 6:04 AM Kernel-Power The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span>6/8 6:04 AM BugCheck The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The bugcheck was: 0x0000001e (0xffffffffc000001d, 0xfffff800b6370001, 0xffffe000a2d62780, 0x0000000000200000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 4aa77e32-854f-471a-9b1b-d31f2b32c8f2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So lets take it back a few days when the backup was at 1AM:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6/6 1:00AM CAPI2 </span>Cryptographic Services failed while processing the OnIdentity() call in the System Writer Object.<br />
<span>6/6 1:50 AM Service Control Manager A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the WSearch service.</span></p>
<span>6/6 1:50 AM Service Control Manager A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the WSearch service.</span></p>
<p><span>6/6 1:51 AM DistributedCOM The server {AB...} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</span></p>
<p><span>6/6 2:08 AM EventLog The previous system shutdown at 1:34:08 AM on ‎6/‎6/‎2016 was unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span>6/6 2:08 AM Kernel-Power The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span>6/6 2:08 AM BugCheck The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The bugcheck was: 0x0000001e (0xffffffffc000001d, 0xfffff800bd580001, 0xffffe001dcef4080, 0x0000000000200000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: dd2e56f5-346a-4e30-b1be-a9b8b0d1a53e.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000001E. This indicates that a kernel-mode program generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when your PC
 is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to check if issue persist in safe mode and clean boot. Follow the methods below and check if that helps.</span><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Boot your computer in Safe Mode with Networking and check if the same issue exists.</p>

Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.</div>

<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform a clean boot and then check the behavior.<br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or
 determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you
 start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you
 from following these steps. </div>
<div><br />
Follow the steps mentioned in the following article.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to&nbsp;the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I suggest you to update the display drivers by following the steps provided in the link below and check if that helps.</p>

            <p>Ok I've been running about a week under Clean Boot and the backups have been running successfully without crashing/rebooting. So now what -- how do I determine which program is interfering with the backups? Below are all the services/startup processes that
 were disabled for Clean Boot. See anything interesting in this list?</p>

            You would need to contact xbox support by going to support.xbox.com and IF your account is eligible they would be the ones to reset your home xbox counter otherwise you would have to wait the one year if you have reached the FIVE time limit in a year.

            <p>Although ostensibly the operating system is Windows it is an ARM processor in the Surface so runs Windows RT. Any software able to run on the Surface has to be written for that platform and none written for previous versions of Windows will&nbsp;work&nbsp;on it. This
 is exactly the same as the fact that Windows software will not run on an iPad, Andriod tablet or even natively on a Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To a certain extent it is a separate issue but in addition Windows RT will in the main only allows software to be installed via Windows Store in a similar way that other tablets are also limited. There is an exception where companies create their own line
 of business application which can be "sideloaded". This is being done to ensure software publicly available is written and tested to meet a standard that is fit to be published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Surface is a "real" computer in that it can run any program written for it, if you need the functionality of legacy software then you will have to wait for Surface Pro next year or look at alternative offerings from 3rd party manufacturers.</p>

<h2>            Unable to turn BitLocker on after windows 10 clean install on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I did a clean windows 10 install on my SP3 from a system image( my SP3 start getting slow and I had plenty of installed ****). As I wanted to format drive C prior to installation(I've done this before) a message appeared asking me to turn
 BitLocker off from control panel in order to proceed further. I did it and installation went smoothly with&nbsp; no issues. As I start installing regular staff a notification popped in&nbsp;saying that BitLocker is turned off, I&nbsp;opened &nbsp;control panel to turn it on but
 it did not happened. I've tried many things, visiting&nbsp;various forums with no luck. My SP3 works fine otherwise, no problems, just this BL issue. Here are shots of the message I get when trying to turn BL on, and my partitions. I would appreciate it if you
 could help me in this regard : )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi David, 
<br />
<br />Let's click start, and type troubleshoot, and then launch the troubleshooter. Select "playing audio" and see if windows can fix the problem. 
<br />
<br />Right click on the volume icon on the taskbar, and look at your options. You should have volume mixer, and about 3/4 others. Go into these, and make sure none are disabled or muted. 
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t fix the sound issue. Click start, and type “device manager” - find “sound” and expand it. Right click on high def audio driver, and uninstall. Reboot, and see if you have sound.
<br />
<br />Give these a shot and let me know!
<br />- C

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>please go to settings&gt; update&amp; security&gt; troubleshoot&gt; select hardware and devices and select troubleshoot and scan for hardware changes and restart the system after installing all the drivers . It will install the drivers and configure your system to set
 everything to default. After that check if your songs is working or not. I hope it will solve the issue permanently.</p>

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />The latest Windows update seems to have a bug in it, lots of users are reporting loss of audio after the latest Update 
<br />
<br />The fix is to go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the audio device drivers they recommend, those will be compatible with your PC, unlike the ones installed by Windows Update . . . 
<br />
<br />From listening to other users, it seems Windows is reporting you have Intel HD Audio, but the driver you need is a Realtek driver from that Support Page . . . 
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating the support page for your PC, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<ol>
<li><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you receive any error message when the computer shuts down?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>When exactly does the computer shut down? Is it when you try to make video call?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you uninstall all the driver software related to the web camera from the computer and later reinstall the latest
 driver for the web camera from the Logitech website and check if it helps.</span></p>

            <p>the only changes i can think of are just the download of computer updates.</p>
<p>there is no error messages when the computer shuts down</p>
<p>i can access the program the camera is on but it shuts down as i try to access the camera for a call</p>

            I had a problem with the logitech c270, everytime the PC would try and use it it would shut down , the solution was to use the drivers that are automatically installed by xp when the camera is first connected via the USB port , unfortunately this means
 you can't use any of the features provided by the logitech software but the camera worked perfectly fine for the job I'd bought it for which was Skype.

    <title>Changing Primary account to secondary account on a family gold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krazyknight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Primary account to secondary account on a family gold membership</h2>
                    
<p>So, because of the new ToS and the fact that I live so far away, my sister and I want to remove my account (the primary account) from the family gold subscription.&nbsp; I want to give her the PRIMARY mantle and let her and her kids have the family gold sub.&nbsp;
 At this point, I would just revert to buying my 12 month subs again.&nbsp; Here's the issue....I cannot find a way to transfer the power to her.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue?&nbsp; Is there something that can be done remotely (via PC and my online account or through my xbox) so I don't have to travel to her house?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for any information.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span><br />
<br />
<span>You have two choices, you can either cancel the membership and Xbox Support will be able to refund you the money spent to purchase it on another account (this can only be done&nbsp;</span><span><strong>if it's been less than 30 days since you have purchased
 the Gold Family Pack</strong></span><span>).</span><br />
<br />
<span>If it's past the 30 day's, then you will have to wait for the account to run out. You will need to make sure automatic renewal is turned off so the subscription does not renew and you will be able to move the account after the gold family pack ends on
 another account.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Other than those two options, there is no way to change the primary account on the gold membership.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Too many steps to connect to a VPN in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kqj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too many steps to connect to a VPN in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This is not regarding setting up a VPN connection. It is about the routine it takes to connect and disconnect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, the connect and disconnect operations are available directly on the popup menu when you click the network icon in the system tray, much like for WiFi connections. You simply click on the VPN and click Connect/Disconnect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, this convenience is gone. When you click on the VPN on the network popup, it will open up the Settings window. There you can connect and then close the Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to quickly connect and disconnect to a VPN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Select Command prompt Admin and type the command below. </p>
<pre><code>rasdial "<strong>VPN NAME</strong>" /disconnect

            <p>Can't believe that after switching from ooooold Windows 7 where opening VPN connection was a breeze now I have to do several clicks and go to network preferences to connect to VPN. That's not called progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Command prompt: I understand that you want to help... but... seriously ? Only viable solution is to report this and modify it, typing or cluttering desktop with shortcuts on is not really the way I want to open VPN connection.</p>

            I agree. Windows 10 should be more convenient, not less.&nbsp;In the popup menu, there is already a link to the settings window. So&nbsp;clicking on a&nbsp;VPN that&nbsp;opens the settings window feels like a bug. Please report this. Thanks.

    <title>Windows 10 UEFI Setup stuck.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rollingtides_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 UEFI Setup stuck..</h2>
                    Hello, I am installing windows 10 TH1 on my Dell Inspiron 3521 laptop. My HDD is GPT partitioned and my BIOS is configured to run UEFI boot with Secure Boot. I made a bootable disk of GPT partition and FAT32 format via rufus. Each time I try to install
 windows onto the machine the setup gets stuck at Copying Files (0%) during the windows installation. I've tried to format the HDD using diskpart and also tried upgrading the BIOS to A14 from A12 and also resetted the BIOS setting by removing the cmos battery.
 On the other hand I can install windows into a MBR partition, using legacy mode. But I need my laptop in UEFI mode only. Can anyone help me out here? What am I missing?

            Hello, Thank you for your reply on the query. I am performing a clean install and the ISO has been downloaded using the media creation tool which is provided. Also The setup runs perfectly fine when run on a different machine or even when it runs on the
 same machine using Legacy boot mode. I really doubt it's an issue of the copy of the windows 10. I also tried to install windows 8.1 under UEFI mode. The same issue is caused. I am literally out of options so as to what to do. I have tried almost everything.&nbsp;

    <title>User Settings Lost During Update, Can&#39;t Access Encrypted Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> displayname310  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Settings Lost During Update, Can&#39;t Access Encrypted Files</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>During an XP (Professional) update a few weeks ago, my computer ran out of disk space and it seemed to hang.&nbsp; So, I powered the computer off - not sure if I had a choice.&nbsp; When I got it back up, it forgot everything.&nbsp; Lost all my settings BUT the user account/password
 still worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It started a new My Documents tree in Documents and Settings (same account but with .DESKTOP1 at the end) on the disk and I can get to the old files with no problem -- until today - I realized all my encrypted files can no longer be accessed!</p>
<p>It has been so long ago since I did the encryption so I can't remember where/if I kept the key.&nbsp; If it is on my computer, where would it be?&nbsp; What file type should I look for?</p>
<p>It seems unless I find that, there is no way to get the files back?&nbsp; Would there be a way to fix the account so things are back to normal again?&nbsp; Can I use System Restore to do this?</p>
<p>I read another post that said McAfffe messes things up sometimes.&nbsp; I don't have that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To access the encrypted files, you may try to create an Encrypting File System (EFS) recovery agent key if you have not already created one for your
 machine.</span></span></p>

<p>What happened was that you ended up with a corrupted profile and when Windows noticed that at startup it generated another profile for you so that you can log into the machine.&nbsp; IMHO the biggest drawback to the Encrypting File System (EFS) is that Windows
 manages the keys for you while maintaining transparent access to your encrypted data.&nbsp; That's fine, but when Windows fails, so does the access to your data.&nbsp; Chances are that you never did back up your encryption keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your encryption keys are themselves
 stored encrypted in your old user profile -- that would be the ntuser.dat file in your old folder.&nbsp; Your best chance to access your files would be to log into your old profile...&nbsp; and you're right, the best bet you have at this point in time is to do a&nbsp; System
 Restore to a date before this problem happened.&nbsp; It should restore your old user profile and with any luck you would be able to log into your original profile after the restore.&nbsp; I recommend you perform the System Restore in Safe Mode to prevent interaction
 with anti-virus programs that can cause the restore to fail.</p>

<p>Once you regain access to your files, be sure that you manually back up your encryption certificates.&nbsp; The following article will show you how and I consider it mandatory reading for anyone using EFS.&nbsp; Note the paragraph "Why you must back up your certificates":</p>

<p>Myself, I avoid EFS in preference to the freeware <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Truecrypt</a> in which I maintain control of the key via a passphrase (other options are available).&nbsp; I have had several Windows systems shot out from under me over the years and have never lost any encrypted data.&nbsp; It will also work on XP Home.</p>

<p>Hi JW,</p>
<p>I think my computer got messed up mid October.&nbsp; I had decided to get a new computer so I was not too worried about restoring.&nbsp; It was not until recently I found out the encrypted files are no longer accessible.&nbsp; When I went to System Restore, the earliest
 retore point was AFTER the failed Windows Update.&nbsp; So I guess that is a deadend?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>A Recovery Agent will only help you if one was in place when the Encrypted files were created.&nbsp; The default for Windows XP is not to have a recovery agent.</p>
<p>Chances are that your old files are history unless you saved some of the profile data that was in the old profile folder.&nbsp; At a minimum, you will need your old Secure ID (SID), your old password, and enough of your old "ntuser.dat" file to contain the certificates.&nbsp;
 If you think you have this data, then the AEFSDR program might be able to recover some of your data.&nbsp; I think there is a free download that will decode the first 100 or so bytes of a file if it can.&nbsp; Otherwise, you're probably SOL.</p>

<p>Thanks JW and Debleena.&nbsp; There was not much under the old profile - the only ntuser.dat was the new one and the one for All Users.&nbsp; I went through all my backups and did not find it&nbsp;on any (since I usually don't&nbsp;copy files from there&nbsp;other than Favorites).</p>
<p>I thought I had backed up the certificates at one point on a floppy but could not find it.&nbsp; Just as I was about to give up, I was able to restore these files from a backup&nbsp;on a USB drive.&nbsp; Apparently the "sync" program provided by that drive unencrypted
 these files before encrypting them and writing them to its own file structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That backup was over a year old (I run it and put it in my safety deposit box) but I got most of the files back.&nbsp; Just lost some files in the past year but not a terrible deal considering what I thought I lost was years of bank statements and tax records.</p>
<p>I definitely learned a lesson here.&nbsp; I have backups after backups and put them in very safe places but I neglected the most important thing.&nbsp; Just glad the "tuition" was not too high.&nbsp; This was definitely the best Christmas gift :-)</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help!&nbsp; Now I just have to figure out what new computer to get.&nbsp; This one is 8 years old and, instead of rebuilding everything, I think it is time.&nbsp; Hate shopping for a new computer.</p>

<h2>            How can I export, transfer my MSN folders to Apple Mail &#63;  thanks</h2>

<p>Can anyone explain to me how it is done. </p>
<p>I found on the internet instructions that say;&nbsp; </p>
<p>1) allow Windows Live Mail to synchronise fully so that all your online folders and their contents are now on my Windows machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (do not know how to do that and would appreciate detailed instructions)</p>
<p>2) From the file menu EXPORT your messages as Windows Live Mail format&nbsp;on a flash drive. (Once the synchronisation is done in point 1,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will my messages be in&nbsp;Windows Live Mail format ?&nbsp; if not, how do I do it ?)</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Insert flash drive in Mac and select IMPORT from Apple Mail File Menu.</p>
<p>4) Select Apple mail as the type of mail folder you are trying to import.</p>

<p><span>Does anybody have any suggestion on tweaking the settings for a Motorola SBG6782-AC. I was sold on the info and reviews of this Gateway. We have a TWC Ultimate 50/5 Mbps plan and that baby
 is pushing some Mbps. BUT....we keep loosing Xbox live connection during game play. Even have one Xbox &nbsp;hard wired to a 50" Ethernet cable in the other room. The laptop is also dropping signal running wireless in that same room(1 wall separation). The Xbox
 in this room running wireless and it is buffering just to get through a game trailer. UPnP is enabled but I have not changed any other factory settings yet....Please Help this is frustrating!!!</span></p>

<p>I had the same issue with the exact router combo. I switched back to my motorola sbg 6580 and now have no issues at all. I tried all types of different settings, DMZ host, port forwarding, turning firewall off and still had issues with the 6782-ac. For some
 reason I could never get that router to stay open NAT. I'm not sure if it's the firmware for that router causing the issue or what but the 6580 has all the same settings as the 6782-ac except MoCa which should not have anything to do with a NAT issue.

<p>I really appreciate your answer and this baby is going back to Best Buy for a trade in tomorrow! We have tried everything trick in the book with the exception of opening up the router itself. Great looking router and worked real well with my desktop but
 wireless was a whole different animal. &nbsp;It really had some good reviews, but it seems like it might be a little to advanced for Xbox live. &nbsp;Did you have to make any adjustments with the 6580 or was it plug and play? Thanks again and I will let you know how
 the 6580 works out!</p>

<p>The default UPnP is disabled so I did enable that even though it worked fine with it disabled and set up my xbox IP to DMZ host. You could try it without DMZ i just did that to make sure I wouldn't have any port issues. I hated to take back the 6782 as well.
 it's a great router but I think you are right just too advanced for xbox live. Good luck!</p>

<p>On the xbox console go to system, then network settings, click onto your router, then click configure network, now here you will see where it says IP Settings, IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Gateway. Write down what the Subnet Mask and Gateway are because
 you will use the same thing with those 2 sets of numbers. Click that section and it will ask for you to choose automatic or manual. Choose manual your current IP will be something like 192.168.0.2 first change that to something like 192.168.0. 110 or anything
 around that. Now you will have to put in the Subnet and Gateway which you will use what you wrote down. Now go back and it should have the IP you entered plus it will say manual in that tab now. Below that you will see the tab DNS Settings you need to enter
 these 2 which you can use 8.8.8.8 for primary and 8.8.4.4 for the secondary DNS. Now you have a static ip for your xbox that will never change.
</p>
<p>Now you have to login to your router if you don't know how to do this let me know. For now I will assume you do. Once logged in go to the advance tab then go down to DMZ Hosting then you just put in the IP Address that you made up for the xbox and click
 apply. Then you are set up. Also under the advance tab click on options and check the box that says UPnP enable. Let me know if you have trouble

<p>Generally, UPNP will make no difference if you <strong>have</strong> the Xbox in DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). Since DMZ opens every single port, or Exposing to the internet.</p>
<p>UPNP's function is to automatically open ports for a device requesting a certain action. Since DMZ opens every port, there is no room for UPNP to function to benefit the Xbox.</p>
<p>I have a Motorola SBG6580 gateway. Last time I checked, I wasn't able to make a static IP address from the Xbox's Networking settings, as I got connection errors. If you also get a connection error, you can try<strong> Method 2:</strong> A&nbsp;alternative way
 to create a static IP address, use DHCP Reservation.<strong> (DHCP Reservation can</strong>
<strong>be found on the Basic tab, then click DHCP</strong>) It will ask for the Xbox's MAC address (this can ensure that the modem will connect the Xbox to the Static IP address you create) You can create your own IP address, as long as it is in this format
 192.168.0.x.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = any single digit number or a (2 digit number if you have to) However, just as what littleweasel74 said, you can&nbsp;use "192.168.0.2" for the Xbox, Just make sure no other device is using that IP address, otherwise you will get a IP Address
 conflict error on the Xbox. Now as for the Host name, just type Xbox 360.</p>

<p>YOU GUYS ARE GENIUSES!!! &nbsp;Thank you so much. &nbsp;For me, Method 2 worked: &nbsp;Method 2: A alternative way to create a static IP address, use DHCP Reservation. (DHCP Reservation can be found on the Basic tab, then click DHCP) It will ask for the Xbox's MAC address
 (this can ensure that the modem will connect the Xbox to the Static IP address you create) You can create your own IP address, as long as it is in this format 192.168.0.x. &nbsp; &nbsp;x = any single digit number or a (2 digit number if you have to) However, just as
 what littleweasel74 said, you can use "192.168.0.2" for the Xbox, Just make sure no other device is using that IP address, otherwise you will get a IP Address conflict error on the Xbox. Now as for the Host name, just type Xbox 360.</p>
<p>I know NOTHING about computers but I was able to follow your instructions and get this *** cable modem/router to work with my Xbox One. &nbsp;I had so many other things plugged into the router like a Time Capsule and Phillips Hue lighting, etc.... &nbsp;They apparently
 were all arguing with each other at the DHCP level. &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>
