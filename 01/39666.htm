<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the network settings is one of the possible reasons why you are having a blank page when using the Virtual Agent. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the
<strong>Windows </strong>key, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press the <strong>
Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Do you have a third-party security software installed?</li><li>Which browser are you using? Have you tried to use a different browser?</li><li>Are you having the same issue when browsing a different website?</li><li>Have you tried connecting to a different network and check if you will still encounter the same issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you are using Internet Explorer, I would suggest you run it in safe mode and check if the issue persists. This mode will turn off any program add-ons and some extensions not required for the basic running of the browser. You can follow the
 steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start </strong>button and type '<strong>cmd</strong>' into the search box.</li><li>Type <strong>cd/</strong> to get a blank C: prompt.</li><li>Type in <strong>"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" -extoff</strong> (where C: is your local drive).</li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>

    <title>Explorer BEX failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidk03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer BEX failure</h2>
                    Recently I've been experiencing a rash of Windows Explorer failures, code BEX.&nbsp; When I've remembered to catch the screen image details, the offending program module has always been the same one.<br />
<br />
The circumstances lead me to suspect Explorer might be sensitive to specific conditions, so I'll outline the config first:<br />
The PC:&nbsp; motherboard with an AMD athlon 5600+ dual core processor running at 2.7ghz, 4Gb RAM and 4 installed HDD (SATA interfaces).<br />
The OS:&nbsp; Win 7 Home premium Sp1 with all the critical updates installed (typically the morning after patch tuesday every month).<br />
<br />
What's happening.<br />
I use one of the HDD installed as a first 'catch' repository for photos and videos.&nbsp; Some of those files I then selectively move to one of the other drives for specific processing (photo and video editing, on different drives).&nbsp; The hardware configuration enables
 this to be in a pipeline fashion with minimum HDD head positioning latency, and thus file transfers are pretty fast.<br />
<br />
The failures are occurring - not all the time, but often enough and sometimes several times a day when this file transfer is going on - usually at the start of a transfer operation that may involve 15 to 20 files, between 250 and 600Mb total.&nbsp; When the application
 re-starts, and I repeat the transfer that failed, it goes OK, and generally the ones after it as well.<br />
<br />
Windows reports the failure code data as follows:<br />
Explorer fail&nbsp; BEX<br />
explorer version 6.1.7601.17514<br />
application time stamp 4ce796f3<br />
module atiumdag.dll_unloaded<br />
<br />
I searched the explorer fail BEx items in the database, but none fit these specifics.&nbsp; I did note that MS recommended:<br />
- the OS is up to date - done.&nbsp; SP 1 installed and patched monthly after patch tuesday.<br />
- anti-virus is updated daily, and the system is virus free - done.&nbsp; I run the AVG 2012 internet suite.&nbsp; In addition to the daily quick scans, the system gets a whole of system AV scan every wednesday.&nbsp; That occurs after the monthly patches if any are applied,&nbsp;
 and after the monthly patches are applied the MS monthly root kit removal software also runs.<br />
- a memory test.&nbsp; Done - no faults reported.<br />
<br />
So, the question(s)....<br />
Is explorer sensitive to repetitive, in total large, fast, file transfers?<br />
is there a history that fits these conditions?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for a fix???<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
atiumdag.dll is the ATI video driver so check with ATI Support, their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any<br />
known issues. Update the video drivers - if no newer if may be necessary<br />
to revert back to an older stable version.<br />

<strong>Issues that affect IE also affect Explorer, they are closely tied <br />
together. So this needs to be approached from the IE perspective <br />
</strong><strong>first &nbsp;and then if needed a broader general approach. This trouble-<br />
shooter is for iE and the next message is&nbsp;for General Performance.<br />
<br />
</strong>Often BEX errors are caused by Toolbars such as Google, TrendMicro <br />
and others. Are you using any 3rd party toolbars in IE? Cause and fix is <br />
same for Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? <br />
Include any you have EVER had on this machine including those you <br />
uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which causes issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - <br />
does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore&nbsp;Advanced <br />
Settings&nbsp;and then click RESET - APPLY /&nbsp;OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;- click Reset all zones - <br />
APPLY / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - <br />
does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is <br />
no longer needed but Java still installs it and it causes issues - you ever <br />
update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible <br />
problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with <br />
programs that do not look right. Permitted are usually OK and "not <br />
permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about <br />
it here. (If you can't run Windows Defender use the methods in the<br />
next link below.)<br />

<br />
Could be a BHO - SpyBHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs <br />
no install, download, UnZip and run. Also not all BHO's are bad, some run <br />
toolbars and features you have added.<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect <br />
malware&nbsp;UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. <br />

What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
And wow, lot of information there.&nbsp; <b>Action synopsis</b> - changed a driver, and that changed the failure response.&nbsp; Explorer still failed, but doing a different job and with a different reported module.<br />
<br />
Browser.&nbsp; IE8 is installed (came with the upgrade to Win7) and the security patches etc that windows update publishes have been applied, but its not my primary browser.&nbsp; I use Firefox for most things.&nbsp; Which sort of made effort focussed on IE rather pointless.<br />
<br />
Application Toolbars in the browser.&nbsp; One installed (AVG security search) - sometimes you can't avoid that, but none are enabled.&nbsp; I try to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
Anti-Virus.&nbsp; I use AVG 2012.&nbsp; It was installed immediately after the Win 7 upgrade.&nbsp; I've tried the AVG 2013 version that has a look of windows 8, and it was an absolute disaster:&nbsp; installed and ran OK on day 1, but thereafter as each day progressed the boot
 got slower and slower.&nbsp; After about 4 days one of 3 machines using it just jammed up - would not boot.&nbsp; So I reverted to 2012 using safe mode to uninstall, and was very particular about registry clean outs etc. before reinstalling 2012 (worked well) and firing
 off an irate broadside at AVG.<br />
<br />
Some more background on usage of Explorer when it fails.<br />
The files I'm moving around are mostly camcorder files.&nbsp; Generated by the camcorder, they exist as a hexadecimal based 8.3 filename (eg MOV05A.MOD), and created in a series of folders like PRG001, PRG002 etc.&nbsp; Each folder has generally 64hex files in it starting
 at 001, and numbering upwards. So there may be/usually is a mov05A.mod in each folder.&nbsp; An 8Gb SDHC card will hold 4 or 5 folders each filled with this sort file/filename. Used with an editor that just uses the filename, when there may be 4 or 5 versions of
 that name on the drive - is a disaster of 'where is it?' waiting to happen.&nbsp; So after the file move to the editing drive, the files at least need re-naming to identify their sequence - say, the mov05A in folder prg001 becomes 1mov05A&gt;&gt; right click on the name,
 select rename, press home, type1 and return.&nbsp; next file . . .&nbsp; Doing quite a few hundred of these and its gets to be fairly quick.<br />
<br />
So, the most obvious thing - driver update.<br />
You mentioned the video driver.&nbsp; I've checked this for other reasons and usually use the control panel/system/device manager page to do it.&nbsp; The update driver response has been 'no newer one available'.&nbsp; And I believed it.<br />
<br />
Following the response suggestion I went to the ATI driver site and downloaded the check and install item.&nbsp; It found a "legacy driver" and downloaded/installed it.&nbsp; 100mb of code.&nbsp; As a comment, the system/device manager pages could do a much better and more
 informative job of this.&nbsp; Re-booted the PC and resumed the file move and name task.<br />
<br />
No further problems with BEX mode file copy fails (moved over 100 files), so the driver update seems to have fixed that issue.&nbsp; However in 70minutes of renaming files (per example outlined) explorer failed code BEX 4 times.&nbsp; The reported failing module was:<br />
StackHash_a7aa - 3 times<br />
StackHash_0a9e - once.<br />
<br />
Further thoughts?&nbsp; For example, the failure occurs after a lot of repetitive tasks in quick succession.&nbsp; Is there any history of a memory leak?<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with ATI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask about known<br />
issues in their forums. Always check for drivers manually! MS is far behind certifying<br />
drivers and most manufacturers do not even&nbsp;submit all versions of their drivers for
<br />
certification. So running Update Drivers from Device Manager or using Windows Updates<br />
is not sufficient. And you need to actually ask support and in the forums as this could be<br />
a known issue with possible solutions. There is no doubt that the ATI driver is involved<br />
in the issue. What is not known is whether it is the total or only cause.<br />
<br />
Issues that affect IE also affect Windows Explorer and vice versa, so you have to look at both<br />
even though you use FireFox. If AVG or anything installed a Toolbar or add-on into IE or<br />
Windows Explorer that would affect BOTH of them. <br />
<br />
AVG could easily be the cause. Only way to know is to fully uninstall it and then run the AVG<br />
Removal Tool to prevent troublecausing remnants.<br />
<br />
Also check with FireFox Support and their forums. <br />
<br />
Use the Clean Boot Method to see if that helps troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Check Event Viewer to see if there is any helpful information there.<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the Event&nbsp;or&nbsp;BlueScreen (BSOD) to with-in
<br />
a second or so&nbsp;of the time of the Event or BSOD to provide more information as to possible
<br />
cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the Event or&nbsp;BSOD.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Good troubleshooting is very methodical and skipping steps because you think they do<br />
not apply will usually cause the efforts to be fruitless. Starting at the beginning and working<br />
in a logical manner toward the end is what usually reaps the rewards.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>To do incremental backups you'll need third-party software. There are very many programs that can do this. Search the web, read the reviews, try a few and pick one you like. One good example is
<a href="http://www.backup4all.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Backup4All</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start, think about what kind of incremental backup schedule you would like. For example: If you like to backup once a day, you could do a full backup on Sunday and incrementals from Monday to Saturday. Or, if you like to backup more frequently,
 you can do a full backup every night and incrementals throughout the day.</p>

I tried the above strategy but it didn't work. I see in the app home, people, and settings on the bottom. I just want to see an active list, not the whole list. Did someone update the app and take the active list away? I really want to fix this.

    <title>Download issues on Xbox 360 slim using 32gb flash drive. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Download issues on Xbox 360 slim using 32gb flash drive.</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Xbox 360 slim which only has a 4gb hard drive. I bought a 2.0 USB flash drive which has a storage space of 32gb and I tried installing GTA V using the download disc. The download reaches the end and in the bottom corner of the screen it says installing
 7876/7876 mb. When it gets to the end the screen just freezes and it doesn't load anything and does not say the download is completed.</p>
<p>I tried exiting and going to the storage device to see if the game has downloaded and it shows that there are 4 files under the GTA V game section. Two files have been corrupted and they both are roughly 2gb each. I've already tried clearing the cache, deleting
 everything and starting over but I still get the same result. Any ideas on how I can download the game?</p>

<p>Honestly, I'd suggest investing in a bigger HDD for your console. I've tried this in the past, and the hassle just isn't worth it. Get a bigger HDD and you'll be fine.</p>

<p>I said it once, and I'll say it again. and one more time if I have to. If you want to game to work the way it suppose to with no problems, get yourself an XBOX 360 hard drive. if you don't care for the campaign and don't mint a problem here and there, get
 yourself a 3.0 16GB flash drive. and a regular USB, more than likely, the game will not work.</p>
<p>GTA5 is not the only game that is like that. most games now days require an XBOX 360 hard drive.</p>

                    <p>I am running windows 8 and have just created a Microsoft account and want to change my existing user account (administrator) from local account to use my new Microsoft account. I have clicked on 'Change to a Microsoft account' entered my existing password
 and then the e-mail address for my microsoft account - I then get the error message 'Sorry we can't connect to Microsoft services at this time'. I tried this yesterday and again today with the same error. I have checked my internet access and can go directly
 to login.live and login to my Microsoft account without any problems. I also tried creating a new account with my microsoft e-mail address but got the same error. Can anyone help?</p>

            Thanks for your response.
<div><br />
<div>I first tried the steps you suggested but none worked. Then I uninstalled Norton 360 and I was able to change to a Microsoft account. I have now reinstalled Norton 360 but presume I will have similar problems if I want to change any other user accounts
 from local to microsoft accounts. It's a work around but not a solution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why does having Norton 360 running prevent this user account change and are there settings that I can change without jeopardising my system security to make them work to together - I thought Windows 8 and Norton 360 were supposed to be compatible! Any
 assistance would be appreciated.</div>

I suggest you ask Norton.&nbsp; It would seem that maybe there is a bug in their product.&nbsp; Alternatively it may be a deliberate thing on their part to help you avoid the automatic connection of your PC to the cloud.

<h2>            Recovery Error &#59; 10-Fa11-045D</h2>
                    My OS is Vista Home premium&nbsp;which was preinstalled in Toshiba PC when I bought it. The Vista installation disc did not come with the PC. When I had a problem with&nbsp;PC, I used &lt;Windows anytime&nbsp;upgrade&gt; CD&nbsp;to boost the PC and to do the clan installation of
 OS. Instead of upgrading, I just installed the same version of Vista whch my PC initially had.&nbsp; It seems like this CD wiped the initial OEM code that my PC had. Even if I used the recovery tool,&nbsp; it does not work, saying&lt;Error 10-Fa11-045D&gt;. The PC crashed
 often. &nbsp;I contacted Toshiba but they just told me to replace the hardware. If anyone knows how to fix it???

<h2>            Invisible Control Panel on Windows 10 Taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I have a minor -- yet annoying -- issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while, I had Control Panel pinned to my taskbar, since I was experiencing issues (all of which are of course fixed). Recently, I had decided to unpin it, but an invisible icon remained.
<a href="https://i.gyazo.com/958f9eb42d6816be085fe7a080e24ceb.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
This is what it's doing.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried pinning to try and unpin it again, but it simply creates a new icon that gets unpinned,&nbsp;<a href="https://i.gyazo.com/bb9c2a8ce05b90adc7ce9a3447a403e4.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">like this.</a></p>

<h2>            оборудование устройство</h2>
                    Купил и установил PCI карту с USB 2.0. В магазине сказали, что драйвер не нужен. Но система не распознала устройство. Нашёл и установил драйвер для PCI\VEN_1033&amp;DEV_0035&amp;SUBSYS_00351033&amp;REV_43<br />

PCI\VEN_1033&amp;DEV_0035&amp;CC_0C03<br />
Система распознаёт устройство как NEC PCI - USB открытый хост-контроллер и драйвером довольна: пишет, что драйвер - лучше не надо (IT8211_Win7_x86), но
<span style="font-weight: bold">флешки не опознаёт</span>. Что нужно делать, и где лежит проблема. WIN 7 ASUS P5WD2 Выяснил, что всё же некоторые устройства распознаются: телефонная карта и сканер. Этот факт делает ситуацию, на мой взгляд, ещё более странной
 и запутанной: чем этому адаптеру флешки не нравятся. В портах USB 1 эти флешки распознаются.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">После очередной перезагрузки перестал распознаваться сканер.
<br />
</span>Телефонная карта памяти продолжает распознаваться, фотоаппарат не распознаётся.

    <title>Verifier BSOD with DEVICE_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION with no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rg_tech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Verifier BSOD with DEVICE_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION with no indication of what driver was at fault</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my ASUS Q500A laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. &nbsp;I am having a problem with unexpected stops after a random period of processing and am trying to use Verifier to diagnose it without much success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the unexpected stop doesn't happen for 1-3 hours, with Verifier running I always get a BSOD. &nbsp;At this point, what occurs is one of two options. &nbsp;If I have Intel RST drivers running, Verifier detects IASTORA.SYS. &nbsp;If I replace that driver with STORAHCI.SYS,
 the BSOD indicates a detected violation without an indication of why. &nbsp;In that case alone, I get a dump. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I configure Verifier, it always lists drivers of either DUMP_IASTORA or DUMP_STORAHCI. &nbsp;From what I understand, this is a dump filter meaning it's experience problems with both drivers depending on which is installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background. Both SFC /SCANNOW and&nbsp;DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealh run clean. &nbsp;All drivers have been individually updated to current levels using Device Manager. &nbsp;I have minimized all third party software to that that I absolutely need for
 now. &nbsp;I have minimized all services and tasks to that that I need. &nbsp;These problems occur with nothing attached to the laptop except an external mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help understanding what is going on here and how I can fix this problem. &nbsp;I basically have two questions, or more. &nbsp;What is happening when the BSOD catches a violation with no driver information and takes a dump? &nbsp;How can I solve the driver problem
 so that it is not experiencing these errors using IASTORA or STORAHCI? &nbsp;Thirdly, is this related to my core problem of unexpected stops or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've worked on this for days. &nbsp;I would surely appreciate the help!</p>

<p>Do not know what you used to get iastor or storahci but as you can see from the files you mentioned and the diagnosis from WinDbg it is Symantec.&nbsp; IMHO SYmantec should not be installed on any computer.</p>

            <p>The Symantec that is installed is System Recovery 2013, the (currently Veritas) backup and recovery product. &nbsp;The drivers in question belong to it. &nbsp;As it turns out, Windows 10 requires an upgrade to 2013R2. &nbsp;I've obtained the upgrade which should resolve
 the problem with its drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reference to Windows Defender, I believe you must be referring to the Norton products, not Symantec. &nbsp;The Norton products are their personal line and the Symantec products are their business line, FYI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I happen to run Norton 360 and wouldn't choose anything else, as a matter of fact. &nbsp;It has utility far beyond antivirus and compares favorably to other products. &nbsp;But, as you mentioned, that's IMHO only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, an upgrade to Symantec System Recovery 2013R2 should resolve the problems with its drivers. &nbsp;It won't solve the question of IASTORA/STORAHCI. &nbsp;Whether or not it resolves the unexpected stops remains to be seen, but it can't hurt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I certainly appreciate your assistance in any and every case! &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            As to where I obtained IASTORA/STORAHCI: &nbsp;STORAHCI is the standard Microsoft driver. &nbsp;IASTORA is the Intel manufacturer's driver. &nbsp;Both were obtained/upgraded using Device Manager as needed. &nbsp;Thanks.

<h2>            ms wireless Mouse 4000 problem</h2>
                    I have a microsoft wireless mobile mouse 4000 installed on windows 7 - 64. The mouse is brand new. The pointer bounces all over the place, disappears and freezes. I replaced an order microsoft mouse that required 3,4,5,6 left clicks to open a file. I have
 run numerous virus scans and uninstalled and reinstalled the mouse driver.

<p>thanks for the reply. It is up to date.</p>
<p>Not sure what is going on but after initiate&nbsp;<span>Remote Procedure Call Locator, it is partially solved, at least I can create the system image.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But now if I choose any other drives in backup options, it will popup 0x</span>80070002 status_wait_2, with no detail description. Briefly, now the backup only works when only the system image (in my case, the EFI partition,
 partition C and partition D) and user libraries are selected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guess so.</p>
<p>Would you mind telling me anything you know about any alternative option? Would the file history serve as something that is feasible to backup the entire drive? I`ve tried some paid thirdparty software but that`s just not better than the backup and restore.</p>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Which folder are you referring to in the&nbsp;live mail?</p>
<div>
<p>- Did you make any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</p>
<p>- Have&nbsp;you installed all pending updates?</p>
<p>- Are you&nbsp;using a local account or the Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For issue with start menu not working, I suggest you to refer the below methods and see if it resolves the issue.</p>
<div>
<p><br />
Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps:</p>
<div><br />
a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open Charms Bar.</div>
<div>b. Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.</div>
<div>c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</div>
<div>
<p>d. Type ‘sfc /scannow’ without quotes and hit enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div><strong>2.</strong> If you have deleted this folder by mistake then you search for this folder in the recycle bin.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3. </strong>Sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to Microsoft account&nbsp;to check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>4. </strong>To Search for anything, anywhere refer to this article:</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 wakes automatically from sleep mode</h2>
                    I've been having problems with Windows 7 64 bit Professional waking automatically from sleep mode. If I put the computer to sleep and come back several hours later, it is always awake. I tried disabling the ability of the network adapter, mouse, and keyboard
 to wake the computer, but it still wakes on its own. I also ran "powercfg -devicequery wake_armed" in CMD and it doesn't display a single device. Is it possible for a running program to wake Windows, and if so, is there a way to figure out which one? I want
 Windows to wake only when I push the power button.

            You are seeing a bug reported many times by some users. They are all using ACPI and 'chipset' drivers that need updating for Win 7 to successfully use the sleep function.

                    <div>For some reason W8 gives me this feeling like it's easier to accidentally share things I don't want to like through Apps and things eventhough I don't have anything like twitter, facebook, instagram etc or even a
 MS Outlook email.<br />
<br />
Besides setting up a Local account instead of a Windows account to disable skydrive cloud sync to enable logging into a W8 PC from any W8 PC, are W8 and 7 equally the same after that in terms of accidentally sharing things or amount of digging into explorer
 making sure everything's disabled?<br />
<br />
When I format XP, I opt out of the homegroup network when it asks, but I still have to disable simple sharing. I'm asking about privacy for the homegroup and the internet for W8 VS W7 (W8 apps, etc, I don't know).<br />
<br />
When formatting W8 and 7, must I create some sort of account (even the Local one) with a password that basically puts a name on my computer? With XP, I don't have to make any account when formatting.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            You have to make a user account when installing XP... Although some OEM installers did automate this process.<br />
<br />
Every share thing in Windows 8 isn't automatic, it's a manual command by opening the Charms bar, clicking Share, then where you want to share to. That's three very distinct steps that can't be activated by accident.<br />
<br />
Local account is equivalent to local account on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Dunno why you're disabling Simple Sharing though. It doesn't do what you seem to think it does. Disabling it doesn't turn off file sharing, it unlocks the more complex permission system used by corporations. No folders are shared by default, so it doesn't really
 matter anyway.<br />

            <p>I think I was using a large corporation OEM XP hence never needed to make any account when installing, It might ask, but I just skip it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For simple file sharing, I was going by this and read it as if I was sharing some folders eventhough I opt out of the homegroup/network. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307874/en-us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to disable charms anyway, so anything besides that? I'll just make a Local account instead of a Windows one so I don't have to worry about the cloud and then everything else is the same as W7 in terms of digging into explorer to make sure nothing's
 accidentially shared?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Yeah, that sounds like a customized XP installer that automatically made an account.
<br />
<br />
Again, you're overthinking. The Homegroup is the most blatant sharing feature and you've already turned that off. If you set all the networks you connect to as Public, then file sharing remains off since Windows by default doesn't do file sharing over networks
 set as a Public network.<br />

            <p>When I format XP, it asks if I want to be on homegroup, and I check No, but it still says under that "make this computer a member of the following workgroup: HOMEGROUP or something it says' as if even checking No will still put it on the 'following group',
 so I replace HOMEGROUP with jumbled letters thinking that will omit me from any other computers on the router that might have chosen WORKGROUP also?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I almost spent double for W7 Retail to be allowed to install it on new motherboards but will likely get $100 OEM W8.1 and install on new mobos. The whole W8 portable device OS movement is kind of evil to me - makign it more mainstream to use portables way
 more than seldomly, giving everyone radiation tumers and 4G lte turning trees brown and stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think what I meant about accidentially sharing is Windows and particularly W8 with all the apps and stuff, basically&nbsp;forcing me to make an account that might share things publicly without me really knowing eventhough I don't have twitter/FB/etc, just because
 it's good for specs and business for MS to say 'we have X amount of users and content' sort of how it's like impossible to get an imposter&nbsp;FB profile&nbsp;removed because I think&nbsp;they want to say they have X amount of users and content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            And I'm telling you, as a Windows 8.1 user, that just doesn't happen. Any sharing of anything, files, information to social networks, etc. is a very very deliberate action on the user's part. You literally cannot be unaware of sharing anything.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;You already have a Microsoft account - you post here on it. If you want to use apps from the store, you can and you will use your MS account for purchases and downloads. Windows 8 has privacy controls and every app that has the possibility of sharing sensitive
 info has privacy controls dictated by the operating system. You can turn off location services. You can prevent apps from using your account's name and picture and so on. Heck, you can even block Skype from using the microphone!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you already don't use social networks, then you don't really have anything to worry about about sharing to them. If you don't want apps to use your info, adjust your privacy levels. Questions are asked during setup about how you want your PC to work and
 share. If you want to adjust them, don't skip them. It's that simple. <br />
<br />
It's certainly not evil to make things easier for people who want this and to downscale Windows to portable devices. The work done on Windows 8 has made Windows better on normal PCs. I enjoy lower memory use and more efficient power usage on my desktop as well.

            <p>I didn't realize untill you just mentioned it that W8 apps might share things like android apps, location, name, etc. If not&nbsp;disabling that, I'll probably delete all the apps possible&nbsp;which are&nbsp;probably all useless to me and should free up the&nbsp;CPU a bit.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>As I see it you are being really over the top about worrying about sharing stuff.&nbsp; As Entegy says, nothing gets shared unless you say so.&nbsp; Your comment "W8 apps might share things like android apps, location, name, etc." is not a correct interpretation of
 the situation.&nbsp; Modern apps are actually much more strictly controlled about what they are allowed to do than old style desktop apps that can basically do anything they like.&nbsp; A modern app must declare in its manifest what resources and services it intends
 to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the more sensitive of these,&nbsp;when you install the app you are asked to confirm that the app is allowed to use these resources (e.g. location).&nbsp; Using a resource like location is not the same thing as sharing your location.&nbsp; An app can use your
 current location to provide relevant information to you without ever sharing your location with anyone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, deleting all the apps possible will save only a tiny bit of disk space, and save absolutely NO CPU.&nbsp; The apps don't have to be on your start screen, so all you'll achieve is an annoyance some time in the future when you change your mind and have to
 re-install an app.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So my advice is, unless you work for NSA :), chill out about sharing, let the machine take care of your security, and enjoy your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p><br />
