<h2>            Epson Printer, No ink levels via wifi</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 64 bit and just purchased a Epson TX550w printer. Connected via USB all works well. But connected Via Wifi the status monitor will not show the ink levels and states there is a communication error. I have talked extensively to Epson and
 reinstalled and reconnected the printer via Wifi, but this does not fix the problem. They have suggested that it is a windows issue. Can anyone help??

<p>Hi Savan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have solved my issue. I got a new printer out from the shop but still had the issue.</p>
<p>I reinstalled all drivers/software off the Epson website, but still had the issue.</p>
<p>I had a look at the disk supplied (that states that it is not compatible with windows 7) and decided to download the epson network utility. And this solved the issue.</p>
<p>Savan I appreciate your time in trying to solve my issue</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing Randomly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing Randomly</h2>
                    As of updating to Windows 10, even after a completely clean install, with anti-virus software, I'm getting random freezes. For about a minute or two I can't do anything. No error messages, just frozen. I can most of the time move the mouse, but not click
 on anything. Frequently YouTube videos will freeze up, and when I try and reload the page the whole OS freezes. I have a higher end PC, so I HIGHLY doubt this is a CPU bottleneck. (AMD FX 8320, 8 GB of RAM, AMD R9 290.) I've made sure nothing is running and
 it can still freeze. This only started happening after the update to Windows 10. I've ensured all my drivers are up to date.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Ocean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
</span>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

</p><p>Is there a way i could send you the file for help, it's annoying i come form a perfect install of 8.1 which NEVER EVER CRASHED OR FROZE to win 10 which bugs all the time...</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">netsh winsock reset didn't work neither, i feel stuck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another harsh thing is that i do not have a real key number for windows 10 activation which could help me make a clean install, since i had first a windows 8 license when the update
 to 8.1 came, i remember i took me an entire day to find a work around when i had to reinstall 8.1 since there was no 8 image and my 8 key would not activate windows 8.1 (not to tell i don't understand why it was so difficult for microsoft to register who had
 passed form 8 to 8.1 and keep their keys as possibly activating 8.1, but that's another matter)... Now on i have neither 8.1 key nor 10 key available else than my original 8 key...</span></p>

            <p>Another thing I tried before the freezing stopped was uninstalling my antivirus, I was running Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also saw a repeated error in the Event Log referring to a service that could not start because another service that depended on it was disabled. &nbsp;I recall it was Net. Tcp Port Sharing Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm uncertain which of these steps solved my freezing, but it hasn't happened since. &nbsp;The symptoms were identical. Speculating here, but maybe it was re-enabling the service followed by netsh winsock reset, followed by reboot that solved it.</p>

            Same for me. Windows 10 is freezing after a random period of time, mostly a few minutes, and the only way to work with the computer is to reboot. I think I will downgrade back to Windows 8.1 for now, until Windows 10 becomes more mature.

                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7 I had no problem with my Memorex external DVD drive (model MRX-550LEv1).&nbsp; However, now when I plug it in it doesn't function and I get the following error message when troubleshooting:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa1d4a0a-ce32-4cd3-83d1-5cc9d682d55f" /></p>
<p>Upon contacting Memorex support, their response is:</p>
<p>"Windows error codes from 1 to 10 could be related to the drive itself, but<br />
error codes from 11 to 45 are related to the operating system, for which we<br />
suggest to contact Microsoft"</p>
<p>So how can I fix this corrupt driver?</p>

<p>Everything is pretty much normal now except I cannot reinstall Digital Image 2006. I had it installed before the refresh, but it will start and then says that Widow explorer wont install on a 64 bit system. There is no explorer on the disc. This is a program
 I used frequently and I'm at a loss as to a fix as I am not well versed in Win 10. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<br />If that does not work, you might want to consider setting it up in a virtual machine in a compatible version of Windows:

            Hi Craig,
<br />
<br />Your best option is to completely uninstall Digital Image 2006, restart your system and then reinstall Digital Image 2006.
<br />
<br />This should fix any issues that have arisen with the system reset . . .

<p>I had the same problem. Start.ex kept trying to install or upgrade Microsoft Explorer 6.0 and then failing. I tried all the compatibility modes without success. I'm installing from a copy of my&nbsp;<span>Digital Image 2006 disk
 on my hard drive.</span></p>
<p>By sheer stubbornness I found a way to do it. Instead<span>&nbsp;of clicking on "setup.exe" I used:</span></p>
<p>C:\ "wherever you have it" \Microsoft Digital Image 2006\PIP\Pod\<strong>POD.MSI</strong></p>
<p>You probably could find POD.msi on the CD as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on <strong>POD.msi</strong> and it installed easily on my Windows 10 64 bit pc. It had always worked on other computers until a recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it works for you.</p>

    <title>So I can&#39;t do anything computer-related with my computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex puskar  say:</h3>
<h2>            So I can&#39;t do anything computer-related with my computer.</h2>
                    <p>Yeah, I'm going to skip the formalities because I've made several attempts to contact Microsoft support directly and have waited since day 1 of Windows 10 being open to the public to get these incredibly obvious and daily task ruining issues solved.<br />
<br />
First I'd like to explain my experience. After talking to a person who could not use English and obviously had no experience in the IT field whatsoever for nearly two hours, his only real solvent was for me to contact my computer manufacturer for the back-up
 disk of Windows 7. He completely ignored my real issues and told me my problem was that I did not activate Windows 10. My god, the anger I had at the time was so immense. I could get my three year old to give better tech support in a more timely fashion with
 better English. So to break it down for everyone who might say "Maybe you didn't activate Windows 10 lol" I have had it running since the first day Windows 10 was open to be used by the public as a free upgrade from my earlier Windows 7 OS. I have used Cortana
 (though the feature is extremely buggy and bothersome). I have attempted to use the app store (though I couldn't actually install any of the applications because an error popped up) and I enjoyed the neat little "modern" design at the start screen (especially
 since I'm left waiting here for over ten minutes each time due to the god-send that is Windows 10). So please save me the **** and do not bother responding or reading further if you do not 1. Speak English and 2. Have at least High School education and
 basic knowledge of the field you work in.<br />
<br />
My problems are listed below. I would like some kind of fix beyond taking weeks to get a back-up from my manufacturer for a computer I need for work. And I'd like all of these reported as I am certainly not the only one to have them. While I'm here, I may as
 well say that that just might be due to recruiting your support team from the mental health clinic in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Major insane issue with opening and running executeables, Java files and oh golly gee willy wonkers the command prompt and task manager. Basically what happens is a few weeks ago I had a problem where right-clicking anything inside of a file would bring
 up a never-ending loading icon, then gray-out and freeze the screen and activate a back-up for the desktop as desktop icons are moved. This became a bigger problem when the issue spread to right-clicking or activating just about anything. I can not open the
 installer for the latest version of Java. I can not even use System 32. I thought, you know, being such a train-wrecking problem, that a multi-billion dollar company might be able to fix it within two months. But, welp, guess not. Here's some screen shots
 of error messages I get about 5-10 minutes after whatever I was helplessly trying to open crashed and exploded:&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/c3a8d3259586eabc5042d2e678cfe9c1 ----&nbsp;https://i.gyazo.com/7b8898d39d2650ded13c7d433f5f26b4.png<br />
<br />
2. Less-severe but highly annoying problem with shutting down. I kid you not, every single time I attempt to shut down my computer, I am given a message saying that it's waiting on some kind of a system task. After about 30 seconds, it will go back to the desktop
 screen. I have the option to click "shut down anyways" but I was not really prepared for having to wait an extra ten minutes just to shut down my computer. And it took me about three days to figure out why I would return to find my computer still on after
 I "shut it down." I have a friend who works in an office who had this problem. RIP to his company's power bill.<br />
<br />
3. App store is useless. I do mean useless. There's about three reasons to get Windows 10, and I get that it's free, but when two of these reasons are unusable, you'd figure there would be some form of attempt to fix them after two months from a public release?
 Oh well. So my problem here is literally my first sentence in this paragraph. The App Store is useless. I open it up, works fine. Then I go try and install or download an app. Unable to do it. No download. No message. No error. I click and nothing happens.
 I figure, oh gosh, they'll fix that in a jippy, huh? I don't necessarily "need" the app store on my computer, but it would certainly help if such a visible problem were to be fixed.<br />
<br />
4. Cortana is pretty useless. Not a problem, just an opinion? Oh don't worry, I'll get to that eventually. Everyone was expecting Cortana to be some kind of an answer to Siri. You can imagine our disappointment when we found it was pretty much just a schedule-keeping
 version of Clippy with a voice. My problem? Whenever she pops up, she has a habit of going "through" any application. Say I'm watching a video in Fullscreen mode or playing a game. She'll come up and you'll go, "Why is my cursor showing through?" You'll click
 and instantly regret it as whatever you're doing is still going and you're at the desktop because Cortana wanted to bother you again. And if you're on it daily, it can get pretty damn annoying. I already have pet mice that do a lot of squeaking. I don't need
 something else to scold.<br />
<br />
5. Music playing system is pretty weird. I absolutely prefer the old media player to this one that is covered with advertisements like that one idiotic rapper that makes it so you have to minimize the player in order to concentrate on anything at all. I know
 this one isn't a bug, but it is certainly something that should be fixed.<br />
<br />
Now the last piece of my post. Microsoft, you have become kind of an ****. There's all of those sketchy things in the agreement that could impose on users privacy. There's not being able to get any support whatsoever that is competent and English-speaking.
 There's releasing an OS that is infested with an unholy amount of bugs and claiming any frustration is undeserving since it's free (xDDDDDD). That's just the problems I personally have experienced.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Fix my problems without being an imbecile (that means you have an IQ of 26-50), speak proper English without using messages that are copy-pasted figuring it's the same issue (like not being able to activate the OS) when it absolutely is not. After that's
 done, I want these problems to be reported to someone who can fix them beyond a personal scale because the hundreds, thousands (and beyond) of people who have these same problems need it fixed. And petty excuses like "it was free," "contact your manufacturer,"
 and "hurr-durr" will not help them.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>1. iBuypower 64-bit with Windows 10 home, AMD-FX 4300 Quad-Core processor, 8 gigs of RAM and I don't think you need to know my power supply or video card (though for some reason you guys needed my address - not sure why that is).<br />
2. (Appropriate English is logged-in, not "are you log-in?") Yes I am logged into my Microsoft account.<br />
3. (upgrade) I clicked the notification at the bottom-right of my screen the day it was made available to the public. I have stated this before.<br />
4. I'm not using anti-virus software.<br />
5. The screenshot I provided only required copy-pasting. I do not need a tutorial on how to do this as an "insert image" button is clearly over-head. I didn't think that that was necessary as support would definitely have to be intelligent enough to copy-paste
 the link to see the image, right? (That's your queue to do as I just stated)<br />
<br />
Question 1: I don't know why every answer I get seems to be either sending me somewhere else or claiming it isn't Windows 10 that is causing the problems. I have no third-party application that could cause this type of problem. Judging by the colossal amount
 of other bugs with literally every single Windows 10 feature, I have concluded that it is, in fact, the Windows 10 OS that is causing the problem. Now what happened with the clean boot? Well, you'd figure that since I stated that I can't open command.exe or
 the Task Manager (even though you told me further down to open Task Manager in order to "solve" one of my many issues) and that I (again, clearly stated before) cannot open .exe's that, oh I don't know... maybe asking me to open up a .exe to fix the problem
 where I can't open .exe's might not help much.<br />
<br />
Now let me just say here. It's painfully obvious that you cannot understand my issue. This may be due to your inability to speak/read English well. I'd have no problem with that if it did not affect my daily life and was not, well, your job to be literate.
 You have skipped the majority of everything I have said in the 15 minutes it took me to type up my post. Your little solvent to use a .exe to fix a problem where I can't open .exe's (msconfig.exe needed to perform a clean boot) is pretty much the same thing
 as my earlier chat where I told the support guy all of my issues with Cortana, the app store, and other Windows 10 features and he understood from that that I didn't activate Windows 10. It truly is mediocre and disappointing when I could get more help by
 walking up to someone on the street with my problems than with support from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: "</p>
<p><span>To Launch&nbsp;<strong>Task Manager,</strong>&nbsp;use the&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</strong>&nbsp;key sequence, or by running&nbsp;<strong>taskmgr.exe</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Now right click on the program and click on&nbsp;<strong>end task</strong>."<br />
<br />
Are you actually kidding me now? Did you just skip over where I said I couldn't open Task Manager or any .exe? Do you get paid for this?<br />
<br />
Question 3: Lol. So uhh, I downloaded the troubleshooter and I was like "Wait, this isn't one of those things I clearly said I couldn't open, is it? He can't be that incompetent, right?" "Oh... Whelp."<br />
<br />
Question 4: "Try the above steps" which above "steps" do you want me to try? The one where I run a .exe to fix the issue where I can't run .exe's? Or running Task Manager when I said I couldn't run it? Or... well, you get the point. I cannot "try the above
 steps" when I cannot try the above steps.<br />
<br />
Question 5: Windows Media Player. I mean, I thought that was obvious. Yeah so, me and just about everyone else much rather using Windows Media Player than Groove Music because the idea of music does not include having a bunch of random idiots stare into your
 soul.<br />
<br />

<span>I really shouldn't have to talk to people labeled as support if you cannot perform your task. Do NOT bother responding. Get someone who speaks my language and understands basics like when I use Windows 10 features, my problems with Windows 10 is probably
 not going to be that I can't activate Windows 10. And that the best way to solve being unable to open .exe's is probably not solvable by opening a .exe<br />

<ol>
<li>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</li></ol>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am using windows 10 on dell laptop, I was getting message for long that system updates available. I just created a restore point and installed the updates which required restart. But on restart after the Dell logo it goes to Systemsupport and shows message&nbsp;<span>"
 New USB device (LGD AIT touch controller 1FD2:5001)was installed</span><span>." and I can do nothing from there. Have restarted and tried boot option by clicking F12 and have tried choosing boot management&nbsp;and other options
 that lead to same message window. Can you please help to fix it. I am not able to find a way for safe boot mode or any method to get pass this message so I may restore system prior to the updates.</span></p>

<p>Thanks Aditay for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using dell inspiration 5559,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On pressing F12 I can see the options in screenshot attached here.</p>
<p>For choosing any option except&nbsp; BIOS Setup it leads to the same screen with message&nbsp;<span>" New USB device (LGD AIT touch controller 1FD2:5001)was installed</span><span>."&nbsp; screenhot attached here.Touch scree of the laptop had stopped working
 long ago but I never bothered.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now this system update has lead me to this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am not sure even if I create a boot drive will it be accessed and which option should I chose to boot from the usb drive I create.Second how can I find the key to enter later. I wish to repair instead of reinstalling the window all the way.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>

<p>The device Installation was damaged and in an attempt to rescue the device I installed Windows 8.1 which I originally only wanted to install to USB Flash Drive in the first place. The Device is run on internal USB System and a complete System delete was
 the consequence of installing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Which Windows 10 Version is compatible with this kind of System?=?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,mc</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine the right Windows 10 version for your Surftab, you may contact your device manufacturer to get the most accurate answer. Since these types of devices has pre-injected operating system to their motherboards only the manufacturer themselves would
 be able to tell you exactly what version of Windows 10 your device originally had.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to post more concern for us to be able to assist you further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>Hey Matthias thanks for brining this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is the email is still a Microsoft account so we suggest signing into
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account.Microsoft.com</a> with the email and password. Once its signed in, look into an
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12407/microsoft-account-how-to-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account alias</a> to possibly swapping out the emails. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes!<br />

<p>I am sorry it did not work, the next thing to do is contact a microsoft support agent directly at support.xbox.com/contact_us . Once you get in contact you might be able to provide enough information about the account to get it fixed, just follow their instructions.</p>

<h2>            Skype age verificiation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I use skype (paid &amp; free) frequently, but was locked out due to incorrect birthday a couple of weeks ago. I cannot verify using a credit card since I live in the UK (the website seems to allow US addresses only). How can I access my skype account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

<h3> reubensady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for iOS won&#39;t make calls on new iPhone</h2>
                    <p>I've recently moved from a Samsung Android device to an iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the Skype iPhone app, signed in and attempted to make calls as per normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, went I hit 'call' nothing happens, the icon goes dark for a moment like it's trying to make a call, and then it becomes highlighted again as if the call has been rejected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustratingly, I can still make calls as per usual on my old Samsung and the Android Skype app. It works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing? Has anyone else encountered this issue?</p>

<p>It is a Japanese region only game. Most likely it is a 1000 GS game, but unless you have a Jap console while in the Japan region, you can't get it.

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/general_discussion/f/341/p/23664/Reply.aspx/this" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>&nbsp;post over at TrueAchievements, the game will
 not be released on disc here in the US.&nbsp;I just purchased it and the game has 1000GS that can be obtained. So far, it's a lot of fun, but it has horrendous slow down when there's a lot happening on the screen.

<p>Deathsmiles 2 dose not have a disc release it's only available on Games On Demand. &nbsp;The game supports achievements 1000GS, but it's all in Japanese except the menu screens so will half to get a translated list of the achievements online or something. I bought
 it like the first day it was available for Games On Demand, and if you liked the first one then I would recommend it get it. It's even better then Deathsmiles.</p>

<h2>            How to Restore Windows 7 after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I stumbled around and put Windows 10 on my computer but I do not like it and would like to restore or reinstall Windows 10. A bit of history.....I'm 85 and trying very hard to understand and handle all this new computer language. Believe me, it's not easy.
 {DON'T GROW OLD.IT'S THE PITS} Can I do this and can you possibly give an idea of the easiest way to go about it?</p>

<p>This is something to check into doing before such a large jump it's amazingly easy to use and all you need is a couple devices</p>
<p>An external hard drive enclosure and another hard drive to put the full system onto</p>
<p>Then you need some cd's only one really to create a system restore WinPE disk to restore the system image stored on the second hard drive

<p>
Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you re-build and get all your data back, seriously consider this:</p>

Prevent Windows 10
</p><div>
<p>December 27, 2015</p>
<p>Microsoft has turned a decades-long respected process — Windows Update —&nbsp;into a malware distribution system.&nbsp; It is for all intents and purposes forcing innocent and content&nbsp;Windows 7 computer users into “upgrading” to its new Windows 10 version.&nbsp; It promises
 to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and leaves your computer virtually unusable and requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition on
 their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a completely new and very different Windows.&nbsp; Nothing like anything you have used before.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is primarily an advertising/sales vehicle.&nbsp; That’s the keen motivation and reason it is free.</li><li>By adopting Windows 10, you sacrifice any privacy — essentially, anything on your computer is Microsoft’s and its partner’s to use as they see fit.</li><li>Windows Update becomes non-optional.&nbsp; You, as owner of your system no longer have control over what happens to your computer.&nbsp; Microsoft will re-make Windows (on your computer) into what serves its purposes without asking your permission or opinion.</li><li>Windows 10 as a system is still full of un-fulfilled promises and bugs.&nbsp; Many of your programs will not run on Windows 10.&nbsp; In fact, the “upgrade” process removes some.</li></ol>
<p>So, if you like Windows 7, and most do very much so, I advise you to reject Windows 10 for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that
 long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have advised my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month, about a week after&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update
 except for ones specifically labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, Security updates only will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, not a single update that was not security, was something that improved Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control and the responsibility
 of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed, enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC</li></ol>
<p>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download an “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more than annoying.&nbsp; It goes way beyond that.&nbsp; It is underhanded, dishonest and just plain wrong for Microsoft to do this.&nbsp; There is no offer to accept or refuse.&nbsp; There is no informed consent.&nbsp; There is not even an idea of what it is&nbsp;your getting
 and what the result is if you change your mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of updates that if already installed should be removed:</p>

<h2>            Why does Xbox LIVE cost so much extra, compared to what it used to&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We were told it was because you can get ESPN and Netflix and deals on games, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But most of the time what you have to do is pay extra to get those things, and the deals on games are typically nothing more than petty stuff almost no one wants (although rarely it is good). Either way, this is almost nothing compared to what PSN+ gets,
 and they pay just about the same rate as Live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Has Microsoft shown any plans to change it? Because if the X1 lasts as long as this generation it will be around 500 dollars paid just in membership fees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its price tag is debatable depending on who you ask, I am happy paying the $60 a year, and I only use the online gaming portion, so I find it just fine. &nbsp;On the other hand, all these features tossed in for someone who already pays for those services, is
 just getting another way of using it so to me it seems redundant, so I can see where you are coming from too!</p>

<p>I was okay with it when there were less advertisements. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the guy who will sign in and complain about seeing an advert... I just think that since we pay $60 a year for the service, that wouldn't be so needed. Businesses like to
 make money I guess.</p>

<p>I would welcome a free Xbox LIVE, I am not denying that, but a price tag on anything is justifiable to some. &nbsp;MS has offered a product that I am overall happy with so I will gladly pay for something I enjoy. &nbsp;When I am no longer satisfied with their services
 and products, I will cease to support. &nbsp;I have a ps3 and rarely use it due to the design of their controller, petty I know but I am the consumer so again, support products I enjoy. &nbsp;PC and wii-u, no comment as I have never used or cannot justify the constant
 upgrade. &nbsp;Those other platforms have their supporters, I just am not one of them. &nbsp;Simple really.</p>

<p>I was in a party with Yo Def when BEASTmmb told him about said adapter. As far as the price of XBL is concerened, if your paying full price it is your own fault. I have a 30 XBL sub card that hasnt been used yet that any thrifty shopper could get for $34.99</p>

a. Go to the Boot tab<br />
b. Select the boot entry you want to delete.<br />
c. Click the Delete button and then click OK.<br />
<br />
<b>Important:</b> Make sure to be logged in to the Windows 7 partition you want to keep when performing these steps so you don't delete the good installation by mistake.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

<br /><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4088776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Sea...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the following:
<br />2018-03 Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2016 (1709) for x64-based Systems (KB4088776) 
<br />
<br />Repeat the same steps for the other two updates:
<br />KB4088785 - Microsoft Update Catalog
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4088785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow instructions to install manually:

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<h2>            Windows 10, .wmv mp4 don&#39;t play in TV and Movie player</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I did the Windows Update to bring my system to Windows 10. All my videos played in Windows 8.1 just fine. I tried to re-install the codecs from Windows Downloads, but that didn't work. The TV and Movie player would play&nbsp;the audio but not the video.VLC
 played did so I know they weren't corrupted. My mp3's played just fine in Music player.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I have so far rolled back the update successfully. The videos again played perfectly and without skipping. So I am again trying the install and making sure everything is playable again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>None of the my mp4 files play on Windows Media Player while on Windows 10;</p>
<p>The Movie and TV Player only plays the sound but not the video.</p>
<p>I even installed Cyberlink Power DVD Ultra 14 and it doesn't play the mp4 files at all either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was fine with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did Windows 10 removed the mp4 file support?</p>

            Okay, so I haven't heard from Microsoft about this issue. But I did do a clean install, reformatted the settings to include mp4 playback in the video player. Still same results. So I installed VLC media player. VLC has worked flawlessly. Playing all the
 same videos and movies as before. So since I have not heard about the supported format being stopped or discontinued, I would recommend using VLC.&nbsp;

            I had the same problem, could hear sound but no video since I updated to Windows 10, Didn't realise the problem was down to the format of the video as I download them from my windows phone (obviously not Windows 10). I've just downloaded the VLC Media
 Player and MP4 videos are playing fine now. (Don't know how many forums I have searched to find the answer though - like looking for a needle in a haystack). So many thanks for the above solution!!
