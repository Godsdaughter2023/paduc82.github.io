</p><p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span>Do&nbsp;you get any error message when you are trying to print?<span>&nbsp;
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Since the issue occurs after upgrading to the latest Build the issue might be occurring due to an outdated or corrupt driver.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you that this model doesn't have driver for Windows 10. So I&nbsp; suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the driver in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode:</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Download the latest printer drivers from the <strong>manufacturer’s website</strong>.
<br />
&nbsp;2<strong>. Right-click</strong> on the setup file and click on <strong>"Properties".</strong><br />
&nbsp;3. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>"Run this program in compatibility mode”</strong> and select
<strong>previous Operating System</strong> from the drop down.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;4. Click on <strong>‘Apply’</strong> and click <strong>‘OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the below link for reference.</span></p>

            <p>Turn out, my problems is with the LPT cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I change the LPT cable, to LPT to USB <br />
( the product i use is similar with this :&nbsp;http://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Parallel-Printer-Adapter-CB-CN36/dp/B00IDU0T1Y/ref=pd_sim_sbs_147_3?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=514ut8jjTJL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&amp;refRID=1CNYSBDHJYZ9R4AEYX81 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my lx 800 works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's funny, coz that 'LPT to USB' that i used, was not working before in previous build :D.</p>

    <title>Unable to Launch Applications from Windows 10 Search - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Launch Applications from Windows 10 Search</h2>
                    <p>Recently the start menu on stopped working altogether. The only "solution" to this problem was to create a new account. In the new account, I am
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>unable</strong></span> to launch applications via the Windows search bar. The search bar
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>does</strong></span> find the application and display it in the search results list, but neither pressing the enter key or left clicking on the application cause the application to launch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to resolve this? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing issues with Search Bar. Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check if that helps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> <strong>Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.</strong><br />
Follow the below steps:<br />
&nbsp;1. Open Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;2. Select Troubleshooting.<br />
&nbsp;3. Click on Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.<br />
&nbsp;4. Run the Troubleshooter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists,&nbsp;I would have run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Click on 'Start'.<br />
&nbsp;2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt Window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:<br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, <br />
and then press Enter.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the DISM tool, but unfortunately it did <strong>not </strong>resolve the problem; I still can not launch applications from the search bar by pressing enter or left-clicking on application icon.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><strong>Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Click on 'Start'.<br />

&nbsp;3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt Window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:<br />

and then press Enter.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>To restate and clarify the issue, the search bar does return and display appropriate search results, however pressing enter or left-clicking on the return results (which are apps) does not cause them to launch.&nbsp; Any other suggestions? Thanks</p>

<p>I had the same issue. The search DID find the apps, but could not be launched by hitting Enter or left-clicking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 DID WORK for me though. In the troubleshooter I ticked the box that said "issue not listed here". I wrote my issue, and it did the same thing again with admin rights. I ticked the box "issue not listed" one more time. Wrote my issue one more time.
 Then it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently it gave me some permissions that were lost during a reboot (or something). And now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helped anyone.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Intel USB 3.0 device drivers</h2>
                    Intel USB3.0 devices only work at USB2.0 speeds on Windows 8/8.1, because the MS drivers are not compatible. &nbsp;Rolling back to Intel Windows 7 drivers fixes the problem, using the method described in the link below. &nbsp;Will it be necessary to overwrite the
 drivers on Windows 10 for the same reason, or has Microsoft finally acknowledged that the default drivers are not fully compatible....??<br />

            Hi Chris, I haven't yet upgraded my Win8.1 PC to Win10, so I don't know if I'm going to have the same problem with Intel USB3.0 ports as when I upgraded from Win7. &nbsp;The problem you describe (USB2.0 speeds) is exactly the same. &nbsp;For the record, some hardware
 just doesn't work at USB3.0 speeds, when plugged into certain USB3.0 ports. &nbsp;In the article below, it comments that they no longer advise the procedure for Win8.1, however it fixed the issue for me. &nbsp;Give it a try on Win10 and let us know how you go. &nbsp;I bet
 plenty of others are having the same issue -maybe some don't even realise it!<br />
<br />
Hope this does the trick!<br />

            I had a slightly different problem where the device driver was not getting installed. I think that simply running USBDeview fixed the issue.

<p>
</p><p>I tried using Disk Cleanup, but it only cleaned up 8 MB. I do have WinDirStat, but the problem is I don't know which files are safe to delete. As I keep looking up each file and seeing whether or not they're important, it's almost impossible to find just
 one file I can delete without the need to worry. I tried looking everywhere for a solution, but I can't find anything helpful. What do I do?</p>

            Hi Ryoko, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB (29.1GB usable) of internal storage ask the exact same question on Community every day. . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you approx. 10GB more space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and
drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If
 a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the 
default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem.</span></p>

<p><b><span>To reinstall Windows</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you want to reinstall Windows with a clean installation—possibly to restore the default Windows settings—here's how to do it. (If you're having a problem with Windows,
 first see What to do if Windows won't start correctly, which explains how to use the Windows installation disc to fix problems without completely reinstalling Windows.)</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows, even if you're reinstalling Windows on a hard disk partition. A clean installation replaces the current
 version of Windows and also erases all personal files.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn on your computer, insert the Windows&nbsp;Vista DVD or CD, and then restart your computer. If you are asked to press a key to start (or "boot") from DVD or CD, press
 any key. When the Install Windows page appears, go to step 2.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the Install Windows page does not appear and you're not asked to press a key to start from a CD or DVD, you might have to specify that your computer use its
 DVD or CD drive as the startup device. This means that you need to set the DVD or CD drive to the first startup device in the basic input/output system (BIOS). To learn how to do this, see
Start Windows from a CD or DVD. After you have selected your DVD or CD drive as the startup device, restart your computer, and then start Windows from the installation DVD or CD as previously described.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Install Windows page, follow any instructions that might appear, and then click Install now.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Get important updates for installation page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and help protect your computer
 against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get installation updates.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Type your product key for activation page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.
</span></li><li><span>On the Please read the license terms page, if you accept the license terms, click I accept the license terms.</span>
</li><li><span>Follow the instructions on each page. On the Which type of installation do you want? page, click Custom.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Where do you want to install Windows? page, click Drive options (advanced). Select the partition where you want to install Windows, and then click Format.
 This erases all files on the selected partition, so you can install Windows on a clean partition.</span>
</li><li><span>When the format is complete, select the partition you just formatted as the place where you want to install Windows, and then click Next to begin the installation.
 You might see a compatibility report.</span> </li><li><span>Follow the instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Be sure to enable existing, or install new, antivirus software after the installation is complete.</span></li></ul>

<h2>            How can I fix error 0x80004001&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a USB drive so that I could copy the recovery option of my windows 10 onto there for further protection just in case something happened to my laptop and the installed recovery option didn't work. I looked up "create a recovery drive"
 and I clicked "next" until it started loading, only that after loading for a little bit, it would fail, stating "We cant create the recovery drive" and right below that it said "A problem occurred while creating the recovery drive", but it didn't specify what
 error occurred, it only gave me the option to "Finish". After that, I went to "file explorer" and later clicked "this pc" on the sidebar, where I got a view of "Recovery (D:)" and the "USB Drive (E:)",&nbsp; so I just tried copying and pasting the recovery file
 into my USB drive only for a message to pop up saying that unexpected error occurred and if it were to happen again to use the error code to search for help.&nbsp; The pop-up also mentioned "Error 0x80004001" and gave me the op

            Hi  Leslue, if that recovery Option does not complete, your best option is to clean install Windows 10, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            What you should do, is first download the ISO file using Media Creation Tool, then use another tool such as Rufus to make a bootable copy. Here is how you do that:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />MAKING A BOOTABLE COPY USING RUFUS:
<br />
<br />You can download Rufus, for free.
<br /><a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading Rufus, connect your thumb drive, launch Rufus application, click in the Device list box then choose your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click in the list box then choose your partition scheme. If you select the ISO, Rufus will automatically select the appropriate options for you. Next, click in the File system list box, then choose FAT32. If your thumb drive is larger than 32 GBs, choose exFAT.
<br />
<br />Leave the default Cluster size then enter a label for your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click the choose disk image icon, browse to where the ISO file is located, select it then click Open.
<br />
<br />Click Start to copy the files to the thumb drive.
<br />
<br />If you have any files on the thumb drive, they will be deleted.
<br />
<br />Wait while the files are copied to your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Close when complete
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, then launch setup to begin the installation. 
<br />
<br />STILL NOT ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE ISO FILE?
<br />
<br />Download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<h2>            &#34;Enter Network Password&#34; pop-up won&#39;t stop appearing, how do you stop this&#63;&#63; Outlook 2007 checking aol account.</h2>
                    OK, I know that this question has been asked before here and other places but I have tried many things and still cannot get it to stop.<br />
<br />
I am using Outlook 2007 to access my aol email account. Up until recently it has been working fine with none or very few problems. All of a sudden this week, the "Enter Network Password" window keeps chronically popping up with all the fields populated already,
 but you have to click ok to make it go away. This would happen once in a blue moon in the past, maybe once every 3 weeks to a month and then not happen again for a while. But as of this week, it is happening about once every 5 minutes to an hour all day every
 day. (Happened twice since I started typing this so far.) To say that this is incredibly annoying doesn't even begin to describe it! To further annoy me, I have a rule set up in Outlook where certain emails get forwarded to my work address while I'm not home,
 and when this box pops up here at home while I'm at work, nothing gets forwarded, nothing happens anywhere since I'm not there to click ok on the darn box!<br />
OK, to cut to the chase, I have Windows XP here with Outlook 2007, and I have it checking my aol email. All settings have been checked and tested and are the exact same as when it was running fine. Some other things that may help to know, I have McAfee Antivirus
 on the computer and a Belkin F5D8235-4 N+ Wireless Router. I've had the McAfee AV for many years with no problems and I have had the router hooked up since November 2009 with no problems up until now that is.
<br />
Here's what I have tried so far, all have failed to help at all: (I figured I would tell you what already has been attempted and did not work so we don't waste time on them.)<br />
1. Created a new Outlook profile. Did not stop the pop-ups.<br />
2. Ran Outlook in safe mode so non-Microsoft services wouldn't run. Did not stop the pop-ups.<br />
3. Backed up registry and removed user account information from the "Protected Storage System Provider" subkey, then re-entered password options. Did not stop pop-ups.<br />
4. Disabled email protection in McAfee. Did not stop pop-ups. (Just got another one! Ugh.)<br />
5. Rebooted/Restarted router. Did not stop pop-ups.<br />
I'm currently at the "I got nothin'" point as to what should be tried next.<br />
Does anyone have any idea what it can be aside from what I've already tried?<br />
I am totally at wit's end here and it's driving me crazy. Anyone have some ideas??<br />
Jim.<br />

            Update for me.<br />
Since I changed my mail-checking&nbsp;intervals from 5 to 10 minutes, there was vast improvement in this problem. For quite a while it virtually disappeared, it was just like the good old days when it pretty much never happened.<br />
A couple of days this past week the problem came back with a vengeance, just&nbsp;as bad as&nbsp;when it was peaking when I started this thread. But I went onto google and found a lot of internet chatter hinting that it appeared to be a network-wide aol issue at their
 end, since many people nationwide were having the same problems. So it sounds like I would've been getting the pop-ups regardless.<br />
It seems like for about the past week, aol themselves have been having significant problems with their email systems based on internet feedback out there from other customers, therefore it's making this problem much more difficult to troubleshoot since now
 you don't know exactly what the root cause of the pop-ups is until aol gets their end of it solved. I can definitely tell you that raising the time intervals for send/receive from 5 to 10 minutes did seem to go a very long way towards solving the problems
 with the pop-ups. Even though I'm still getting them, here and there, I think the ones I have been getting lately have been due to problems at aol's end more so than mine, based on other aol user's feedback. I'm hopeful that I might be at the end of the tunnel
 regarding this issue but thanks to what's going on at thier end (aol) I can't say for certain yet. I'll keep you posted.

<h2>            Restore legacy sticky notes.</h2>
                    I recently did a fresh installation of my windows (build 1803 re-installation), and instead of backing up the .sqlite file for the sticky notes, I backed up the StickyNotes.snt file found in&nbsp;%AppData%\Microsoft\Sticky Notes. How can I restore my sticky
 notes using this .snt file. I have tried all the solutions found <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/1a506139-79ec-45ae-82ab-b6b0d90abe0f/microsoft-sticky-notes-importing-legacy-sticky-notes?forum=win10itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;but nothing seemed to work. Restoring with a renamed .snt file in Legacy folder just gives me fresh new sticky notes when I open the app.&nbsp;

            Hi Thai.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you check C:\windows.old for Appdata folder after unhiding System files in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; View &gt; enable Show Hidden Files  , approve security box, Apply, Save.?
<br />
<br />You'd only have the folder if you didn't do the cleanest possible install.  In the future follow this tutorial which covers absolutely everything that needs to be remembered to back up so that nothing is left behind:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also never keep notes you must keep that are not Saved.  OneNote can do this by autosave as you write them and immediately sync to all your other devices.  They have a desktop reader too.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I do not have windows.old folder (even with the unhide option) , as I did a complete fresh re-installation of my windows and C:\ drive was wiped during the process. I can sort of read my notes with the .snt file by opening it as
 notepad, but it will be really difficult to restore close to a hundred of notes in such messed up format. In the future I will definitely consider using OneNote, but for now I would really like to find a way to restore my old sticky notes.</p>

            completely reset the sticky notes app beforehand, then attempt the restoration again.
<br />
<br />1) Close Sticky Notes.
<br />
<br />2) Go to Start &gt;  Settings --&gt; Apps &amp; Features --&gt; Sticky Notes --&gt; Advanced Options then Reset.
<br />
<br />3) Go to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbw\LocalState
<br />
<br />4) Create Folder within \LocalState called "Legacy"
<br />
<br />5) Copy the Notes.snt to the Legacy folder and rename it "ThresholdNotes.snt"

            Thai, this is why I removed backing up the .snt file from the Clean Install tutorial:  because it is not stable and reliable.  I only recommend copying the notes into Notepad to save them during a reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried locating the latest file location for the .snt file and inserting them there?  They move it almost ever version.  I gave up on tracking it.  It is not worth messing with.  But you may need to find it to try inserting the file, although they may have blocked that too.

<p>Hello All.<br />
</p>
<br />
I have my Sticky Notes.snt file but no matter how long I have been finding and trying, all the procedures available only worked in the version before the Windows 10 build 1803, I even tried with many computers the very same procedure (all with build 1803),
 but it does not longer work, what only gets is that new stickynote with the welcome message.<br />
<br />
I can say there are only 2 options available:<br />
- Recover your data in a PC with windows 7 - 8.1 and copy all the info to a notepad file<br />
- Wait for a windows update or a windows support member opinion.<br />
<br />
Sorry not to be able to help :(

</p><p>Clearly the earlier reply doesn't understand what you are trying to say so </p>
<p>i'll make an attempt for clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the instructions that mention creating the LEGACY folder then placing the </p>
<p>renamed stickynotes.snt file there and renaming it to Thresholdnotes.snt</p>
<p>work well with Win10 build 1709 as I've done several.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This method does NOT work for some unknown reason in Win10 build 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working this issue with no luck also. I was able to circumvent by </p>
<p>doing the first conversion on my 1709 build then had the user the plum.sqlite</p>
<p>file I had. not a practical solution and for the stickynote users it can be a big deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>while I haven't found the answer its just an example of the user coming in last</p>
<p>when it comes to upgrades etc. </p>
<p>I'll keep looking.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">Hi,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>From the description I understand that you have two users on your computer but on the Login Screen you are getting 4-6 profiles with the same user name repeatedly and you want to delete all those extra
 account from your login screen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>I would suggest you below methods to perform and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Method 1: </span>
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>You may check how many User account is present in the location “Control Panel&gt;User Accounts&gt;Manage Accounts” and if it is present, you may try deleting it. Follow these steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard and select “Control Panel” from the list.</li><li>In the Control Panel window, click on the option “View by” on the top right corner of the window and select “Large icons” from the drop down menu.</li><li>Now, click on “User Accounts” icon</li><li>On the “User Accounts” window, click on the link “Manage another account” and check if the “Other User” account is available in the “Manage Accounts” window.</li><li>If there are more accounts with the same name available, you may click on it and select “Delete the account”.</li><li>You may select “Delete files” from the next screen.</li><li>Click on “Delete Account” and check if it is still shown in the “Manage Accounts” window.</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Method 2:
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>You can remove the user option from the logon screen through Registry also:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Click start---Run-- Type “regedit”---click OK</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In Registry Editor, find the below path:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>If the userlist keys you want to hide do not exist, create a DWORD registry value and name it as the name of user you want to hide. (For example: create a DWORD named user1). Set this value date to
 “0”, thus the user will hide on welcome screen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tells you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow
 these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the

<h2>            Registry Error Stop Code 0X00000051</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife opened up her computer yesterday and got the blue screen of death with the following message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Registry Error: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop: 0x00000051 (0X00000001, 8B226008, 0X012CB000, 0X00000368) </p>
<p>
</p><p>We can boot in safe mode. Her operating system is Vista SP2 with Norton security.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS Version: 6_0_6002</p>
<p>Service Pack 2_0</p>
<p>Product 768_1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have not installed any hardware in quite some time and to her knowledge she has not installed any software or new drivers recently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon searching the internet I find a variety of details to the first part (Stop 51) but all the numbers after differ so I'm unsure if I have a similar issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to trouble shoot or resolve? I have saved all of her files to an external, so I can reformat if necessary.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks! </p>
<p>

 norton and all appears to be working. </p>

 have chapter points in them.&nbsp; If I can add them it will make it easier to move around in the movie on a DVD player.</p>

                    Hello everyone and happy Sunday. &nbsp; Does anyone kn<span>ow of a reputable website where I can learn how to
</span><span>create installation media for</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Windows 8</span><span>? (</span><span><b>not</b> 8.1</span><span>).
 &nbsp;I did not get a chance to upgrade to 8.1 and my Win8 OS has been diagnosed by Dell as being corrupted so needs a reinstall. &nbsp;I'm assuming I can't try an upgrade to 8.1 when the base OS is corrupt, but would appreciate advice on that as well. &nbsp;</span><span>Many,
 many thanks in advance for wisdom from this community. &nbsp;</span>

<p>If you don’t have an external hard disk, you can use a thumb drive with enough hard disk space, minimum 8 GBs and create a recovery drive or set of recovery discs.

<p>You can also do the same for your apps and drivers. </p>

            Thank you so much for the quick reply. &nbsp;When I clicked on Dell Backup and Recovery, I said yes to the window that asked "Do you want the following program to make changes on this computer?" and then ... nothing happened. &nbsp;Attempted a few times and no program
 started. &nbsp;Below is what is in the log which was located in Program Files, Dell Back Up and Recovery log. &nbsp; I would be so grateful for any solutions on what to do next. &nbsp;Thank you in advance!&nbsp;

<h2>            1809 update BUG&#58; UPS monitoring over USB is broken</h2>
                    <p>I have an USB-connected UPS by the vendor named "FSP".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UPS is presented for monitoring on the PC as USB HID device, hardware ID = USB\VID_0665&amp;PID_5161</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Monitoring was OK for years with the small program called "UPS Assistant".<br />
</p>
<p>But, after 1809 update, UPS Assistant does not work anymore, it says that it cannot open the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a couple of other UPS software titles (like WinPower) - and no one can open the device of the UPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The devnode for the UPS is present in the Device Manager with OK status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to uninstall the devnode and then re-create is with "Scan For Hardware Changes" - no luck, nothing changes. The devnode is re-created, it's status is fine, but the monitoring software cannot open it and cannot work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to connect the UPS to the laptop with Windows 10 1803 and install UPS Assistant there - it works!</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            DISM &#47;cleanup-image not working</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm running Win 7 SP1, and trying to reclaim some space from the bloated winsxs folder (about 20GB !), using the DISM command.
<br />
However, when I run <br />
<br />
dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /spsuperseded<br />
<br />
I get: <br />
<br />
Error 87<br />
The cleanup-image option is unknown<br />
<br />
Digging further in the dism.log, one of the log entry states:<br />
DISM.EXE: No providers were found that support the command(cleanup-image).<br />
<br />
Any idea what I am missing or doing wrong ?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Nick<br />

            <blockquote>I installed SP1 on top of a Win7 base.<br />
<br />
And yes, I had previously run the Disk Compact tool, all options on, desperately trying to reduce the size of the OS footprint. But that produced minimal results, hence I gave DISM a go.<br />
<br />
I don't get it: the winsxs directory is about 20Gb, and overall, the Windows directory is 39Gb. My SSD is only a 64Gb one, and I'm afraid at this rate there will come a time when I'll run out of space just because of Windows updates.<br />
<br />
Is there really nothing out there to help diagnose/fix this insane consumption of space by Windows?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Windows 7 on a 64GB drive doesn't work well.&nbsp; In my experience you need at least 128GB and for most people - 256GB or more.</p>
<p>Of course - I say this and sit happily with my 64GB SSD on this very machine.&nbsp; I only have about 15GB free, but I have quite a large Outlook mailbox.&nbsp; My C:\Windows\ folder (Windows 7 Enterprise, 64-bit) has 70159 files&nbsp;in 15072 folders containing ~17.7GB
 of data.&nbsp; While the C:\Windows\winsxs directory is a good chunk of that at 42734 files in 10689 folders containing ~6.41GB - it's not near the size of your 20GB.&nbsp; If you highlight all the files and folders in the root of my C:\ drive other than "Windows" and
 "Users" I have 37070 files in 5283 folders that take up ~13.1GB.&nbsp; My "C:\USERS\" folder competes quite nicely at ~12.6GB - with ~12.5GB all under my one user account and ~6.78GB of that being Microsoft Outlook PST and OST files for four different email accounts.</p>
<p>So the question is - what did you do differently than what I did?</p>
<p>I don't know.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I installed using media for Windows 7 *with* SP1 integrated.&nbsp; However, when I run the command I have recommended dozens of times before...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\system32&gt;dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /spsuperseded</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version: 6.1.7600.16385</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image Version: 6.1.7600.16385</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Pack Cleanup can't proceed: No service pack backup files were found.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operation completed successfully.</em></p>
<p>It works fine for me and politely lets me know that I don't have any service pack files to remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... If you open an administrative command prompt and type in:</p>
<p>dism /?</p>
<p>And press enter... What do you get?</p>
<p>I get:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my curiosity would be the version of your DISM.EXE and if you can use the /? command line variable to get as far as I did above.&nbsp; Your Windows installation *is* taking up way too much space - since essentially you and I are using a similar sized system
 drive (64GB SSD) and I have all sorts of things installed other than just Windows (Office 2010, DVDFab 8, a couple of different web browsers, the normal suspects for Internet plugins, my antivirus and antimalware utilities and quite a few other things) on
 the same drive and have a decent sized folder related to nothing more than email (more than 10% of the drives total space is taken up by email related files) and I still have 15.4GB free of 59.5GB total.&nbsp; All that and your Windows directory supposedly takes
 up all but 5GB of my whole system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for clarity - when I run the very thing I asked you to run...</p>
<p>OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also may want to be in the c:\windows\system32 directory in your administrative command prompt.&nbsp; Just in case you have other issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - did you go crazy with the updates and the LANGUAGE PACKS?&nbsp; Or did you not install any you don't need?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do the following at the same command prompt:</p>
<p>dism /online /get-packages &gt; c:\temp\packages.txt</p>
<p>and then open the c:\temp\packages.txt (you may need to create a C:\temp\ directory first) and see how many lines you have in that file&nbsp;in total (word-wrap off, status bar on, scroll down to the bottom and put your cursor on the last line and read the number
 of lines in the status bar) - what is it?</p>

<h2>            HELP&#58; .exe files open in Windows Media Player</h2>
                    Yesterday, I did something with my computer, and now it opens every .exe file in Windows Media Player; this pretty much means I can't do anything anymore. When I rightclick&nbsp;a .exe program, it doesn't say "Open with..". SystemRecovery doesn't work either.
 Please help me fix this problem

<h2>            Where to find Windows 10 Screen recorder</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title:</strong></em> Windows 10 Screen recorder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Windows.</p>
<p>I am a user of Windows 10.</p>
<p>But I am having difficulty. I am wanting to use a screen recorder for my computer and I heard about a pre-installed one for the windows 10. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to find any screen recorder and Cortana was unable to help me find anything, for I am
 afraid that if I download the wrong thing, a virus will sneak its way into my computer.</p>
<p>I ask of you to please help me figure out how to get to the screen recorder.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>This post was not helpful.</p>
<p>I have been trying to locate my Step Recorder's recorded files and cannot find them anywhere on my pc, or the cloud - where do I find my own recordings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you guys actually design these things, do you beta test them before releasing them?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to be able to search for my audio files with a file name, unfortunately the only option for searching are the ones you give, and none of those options are for audio files.&nbsp; And no, I did search under music files too and no they're not there
 either - and since Step Recorder doesn't allow me to name my files or give me the option of saving them to a location I want (it does it automatically), there is no way I can find the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.!</p>
<p>

            <p>I am guessing you're referring to a different program when saying "Step Recorder" than what this post and Sangeeta Sarkar's reply were referring to. The built-in tool is called "Microsoft Steps Recorder," and it only records steps you've taken on your PC
 during the time you've told it to record. It does not record any video or audio. It records screenshots of what you are doing on your PC and provides a text explanation of each different thing you've done throughout the recording. When you're done recording
 the necessary steps, you stop the recording by clicking "Save" and then you choose where you want to save the file you've created and what that file should be named.&nbsp;It's a really useful tool for teaching someone else how to do something on a PC, not a tool
 for making video/audio recordings.</p>

</p><p>I've used this the dvd maker before about 3 years ago and made some beautiful dvds, but i do not recall having this issue of not being able to add my music/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its rather silly to have a program to make dvds but restrict its use on which songs formats it can use, most people nowadays have an itunes acount thus using the music from there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite upset that i cannot use my itunes music on my dvd, we should not have to surf the net to look for a program to convert the files into an appropriate format for dvd maker.&nbsp; come on microsoft, neither do we want malicious virus and malware to damage
 our pcs, laptops by downloading from the internet. </p>

</p><p>In general, please don't add to an old thread.&nbsp; In this case, the original question and response are over 6 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in response to your particular issue, you do not need another program to do what you want because iTunes itself is able to convert your music files.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open iTunes and right-click a song in your library.</li><li>Select "Get Info" from the popup menu</li><li>Click the "File" tab</li><li>Make a note of the file's location, which is shown at the bottom of the window:<br />

</li><li>Close the "Information" window and with the song still selected, click the "File" menu, select "Convert" and then select "Create MP3 version"</li><li>When the conversion is complete, you'll find the MP3 version in the same location as the original version.&nbsp; In order to tell which is which, you should make sure that file extensions are displayed.&nbsp; To do this,
<ul>
<li>In Windows Explorer, click Tools and then Folder Options</li><li>Select the "View" tab and then scroll down to "Hide extensions for known file types" and UNcheck the box if it is checked.&nbsp; Click OK.</li></ul>
