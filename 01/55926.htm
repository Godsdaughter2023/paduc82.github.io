<h2>            Student Windows 10 - asking for a product key</h2>
                    <p>Hey I downloaded the free version of windows that students get!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps coming up with the "activate windows - go to settings to activate windows" watermark in the corner and directs me to entering a product key! Because this is the free student version I didn't get a product key so don't know what to do! It's not letting
 me do a lot of things now&nbsp;</p>

            I didn't know there was a free version unless it is supplied by your college/university. Where did you download from. The only free "upgrade" was during July 2015 to July 2016.

<h2>            Intel wireless AC 7260 does not work after upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Spectre ultrabook. It has an&nbsp;Intel AC 7260 wireless adapter. It worked fine with Windows 8.1. It stopped working when I installed Windows 10. Shows up in device manager but does not find networks. Googled. Tried multiple drivers. Went to Intel
 site. Went to HP site. Did not find anything that helped. I even bought an Insignia USB to Ethernet adapter to try as a workaround for now. But even that adapter did not work with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally had to roll back to Windows 8.1 and everything started working again. This is a shame because I liked what I saw on Windows 10. I am watching for a fix so I can try again.</p>

            <p>I was able to work around the problem. After reading other postings on Intel's website, I saw one that I decided to try. I uninstalled Cisco VPN on Windows 8.1 before upgrading. Then, when I upgraded to Windows 10, the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Intel

            I too had the same issue. I had to rollback to Windows 8.1 in order to regain Wi-Fi functionality. I can safely say that ,as suggested by forums, unistalling Cisco VPN client in before upgrading to Windows 10 alleviated this problem in my case.<br />

<h2>            I cant Install&#47;Uninstall Intel&#174; Driver Update Utility Error 0x80070641</h2>
                    <p>Hello there well my problem its pretty much like the title says so i got this intel driver update utility already installed on my pc but its an old version so i cannot update my drivers with that,so i download the new version and all that but when i try
 to install it says i need to remove the previous version 1st so i try to uninstall that thing via control panel but then in the middle of the uninstall process it keep saying "a previous installation for this product is in progress.You must undo the changes
 made by that installation to continue" &nbsp;then it give me an option to yes or no and i press yes but it pops the same message over and over like 3 or 4 times then it give me this " 0x80070641 you have no access to Windows Installer Service" so... i read on old
 comments about why not to try a 3rd party program to remove it like revo uninstaller and i try but once i open it the thing stop working :D so i end up uninstalling that thing i even end up thinking ok maybe i have to check if i really dont have access to
 that windows installer by uninstalling other programs that i dont use on the pc and they got uninstalled normal,so... i went to intel and they say its a problem of the windows installer so here im i hope some1 can help me out with this in case not i assume
 i can manually download the drivers updates but i wish i can uninstall that intel driver "Utility" thing if its not working . anyways thx alot and im sorry for my bad english :c &nbsp;(its not my main lenguage).</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why you are getting this error message while trying to install a program. To assist you with your concern, we suggest you to boot your computer in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> and try uninstalling the old program. After uninstalling it successfully, you may also try to install
 the newer version of that program while in <strong>safe mode</strong>. Running on
<strong>safe mode</strong> will start Windows using a limited set of files and drivers that may help us identify what's causing this error message.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we suggest you check the Windows Installer service settings. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>services</strong> in <strong>Cortana</strong><strong>'s</strong> search field and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>The Services window will open, scroll down to <strong>Windows Installer</strong> and
<strong>double click</strong> on it.</li><li>The <strong>Properties </strong>window will open, on the drop down menu (<strong>Start up type</strong>) select
<strong>automatic</strong> &gt; <strong>OK </strong>and close windows.</li><li>Reboot PC and check.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If the startup type is already set to automatic, switch it to manual first, press apply, and then switch it back to automatic.</p>
        </p>

<p>We appreciate your response. If the option to configure the startup type is greyed out, this means that you are not logged in as an administrator on your computer. You may only make such changes in your computer if you are currently logged in as an administrator.
 Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type in <strong>services</strong> in <strong>Cortana's</strong> search field.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Services</strong> and select <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></li><li>Follow steps 2 - 4 on the post above.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the startup option is still greyed out, you will need to make sure that the account you are using has administrator rights. You may refer to this article to know more on how to log on as an administrator:

<p>Sometimes it can take the enforcement team a little while to lift the ban due to how many they have in a day, so please give it a few more hours.</p>

<p>
</p><p>She did a recent Windows Up-date and since then the 'BitLocker Recovery' has been on the screen from startup.</p>

</p><p>Gone all through the process of trying to get the 48 digit code and end up with Microsoft telling there has been no key stored to the Microsoft account of hers. She has no paperwork or usb with the original code stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They said:-</p>
<p>'If you previously had a recovery code, it is no longer valid. Use this new code instead.'</p>
<p>'Your new code is *****-*****-*****-*****-PJ6RT'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot enter this code into the Bitlocker Recovery screen, only numbers can be entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem I have is that she has her School study work and photos on the pad which she cannot afford to loose as she has her finals coming up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way of getting the 48 digit key.</p>
<p>

                    I5 processor on a Gigabyte Ultra Durable 3 GA-P55M-UD2 motherboard.&nbsp; Windows upgrade found it compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; Windows 10 ran fine, including the November update, until an install of an nvidia driver for my GeForce 9500 card froze my system.&nbsp;
 It freezes on a black screen on boot or anytime the driver is installed.&nbsp; NVidia tech support has not been overly helpful.&nbsp; The last message was that they did not see Windows 10 being supported on the GA-P55M-UD2 motherboard.&nbsp; That may be but Windows 10 did
 run fine until the NVidia driver update.&nbsp; I've tried older versions of the driver and encounter the same issue.&nbsp; At this time I do not know if the real issue is the NVidia driver, Windows 10, or the mother board.&nbsp; Given the amount of issues others have had
 with NVidia drivers I suspect that the issue is some sort of a disconnect between NVidia drivers and Windows 10 but I have no way to prove this.&nbsp; Since UBUNTU runs OK, with the disp

<p><span>Hi everyone,</span></p>
<p><span>Ever since Sunday morning I have been having trouble using any apps on my Xbox one. Such as, Netflix, Pandora and YouTube and I can't open settings or even the recommended games
 that they suggest. Basically nothing will open and I don't know why!! Oh yea, I also can't play any blurays. When I put a bluray disc in it will load but I can't watch it. I have tried unplugging everything and even turning the Xbox off for a significant amount
 of time. When I got home today I hooked everything back up to no avail. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>wingsgurl4314 ,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This is usually resolved by performing a reset on your Xbox Console. To do this with the console powered on, hold the power button for about 10 seconds. The Xbox will shut off very quickly. After that power the Xbox back on. Expect this boot up to take a
 bit longer than normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps! Post back if this resolved your issues and click answered!!! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>All but one of the dumps you uploaded were from 0x124 bugchecks; Unfortunately, the pshed.dll (Platform Specific Hardware Error Detection) file on your system does not have public symbols published, so it is not possible to get the data structures required
 to extract more details from the dumps. &nbsp;If you can upload c:\windows\system32\pshed.dll from your system to SkyDrive, that may help in getting symbols that can lead to additional details. &nbsp;That said, you do seem to have a hardware problem, probably processor
 or motherboard. &nbsp;Try some of the following, but you may wind up checking into replacing some hardware. &nbsp;<span>Ensure that the system has adequate
 cooling and ventilation. Test RAM, reseat RAM and the processor if you can. &nbsp;<span>If
 the BIOS is the latest, consider reverting to a previous version and see if that helps. &nbsp;Else, update the BIOS. &nbsp;Also double-check BIOS settings; perhaps, note current settings, reset the BIOS defaults, and then adjust those settings you know are necessary

<h2>            Windows 10 Updates failing to install multiple times&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates KB3194496 and KB3194798 keep downloading/installing and then failing, stuck in a constant cycle of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken to 4 separate windows tech chat reps and none have solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update downloads and installs fine when within windows update, but once you click restart that's when it goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop will begin restarting and configuring windows updates, gets to 9% then hangs for a while before the laptop restarts. Upon restart a disk check runs and then the configuring windows updates screen appears again. Gets to the same 9% then hangs before
 restarting again, on reboot laptop runs a disk check again before windows configuring screen appears saying update could not complete and undoing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same process happens everytime and been through it many times. All previous windows updates have installed with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help solve this frustrating and draining problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having the exact same problem, the update would take hours to installs then roll back. I must have tried 10 times and resigned myself to reinstalling Windows. When I tried to do an inplace upgrade of Win 10, it failed saying it couldn't install
 Windows 10 and didn't give a reason code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmagic/windows10-couldn't-update-system-reserved-partition.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it fixed all my problems and the install occurred extremely quickly. At first I couldn't believe but then I checked the install history and sure enough it says it installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck, hope it works for you</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 Matchmaking and voice chat</h2>
                    <p>Several issues which are more than likely related</p>
<p>first of all we have checked any and all possible settings/configurations on our end.</p>
<p>All involved parties have checked their teredo settings (able to connect + open NAT type)</p>
<p>All involved parties have set their IP as DMZ adress to prevent any issues related to firewalls or routers blocking matchmaking.</p>
<p>All involved parties have deleted their microsoft account and reinstalled it.</p>
<p>All involved parties have done a clean install of windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>isues 1:</p>
<p>We are experiencing extreme delays (up to 5mins or more) before we are able to connect to eachothers convoys.</p>
<p>After finally getting in a convoy we attempt to a Ranked Team Adventure, if we do not get a match on the first try, only the convoy leader will get the following prompts to join the ranked team adventure. All other convoy members are no longer included in
 the matchmaking.</p>
<p>We have so far been unable to get into a single ranked team adventure with 2 or more convoy members after uncountable attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>issue 2:</p>
<p>While the option for voicechat is prominently included both within the settings and interface of the game,</p>
<p>noone is able to hear other parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable for a AAA title.</p>
<p>but before we blame the Game Devs for something that is out of their control, we believe it is an issue with Teredo.</p>
<p>Please look into these issues ASAP because they are putting of a lot of players from getting into a game that would otherwise be great.</p>
<p>If any further info is required please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>Hi first of all thanks for the quick reply</p>
<p>Secondly, we have already exhausted every single bit of documentation that microsoft has provided.</p>
<p>The issue is NOT and i repeat NOT on our end. Unless you wish to direct me to registry entries which might be causing issues.</p>
<p>Whithout knowing in detail how the backend of the matchmaking i believe the issue to be indicative of either insufficient servercapacity or a networking issue withing the matchmaking protocol.</p>
<p>I wrote out all our performed steps to show you that it is highly unlikely to be an issue on the end user side.</p>
<p>Seeing as these issues are already widely reported on several community forums and impact such a wide variety of players (with varying setups)from all over the world, just increases the odds of these issues being on your end.</p>

<p>HI, I regret to tell you that no so far I haven't found a way to get in-game chat working. All forums/posts I have come across which deal with this issue just come to the conclusion that there is no way currently to get it up and running client side. The
 best I have come up with is looking/applying for parties on the Xbox app and then joining those. Also there's several discord servers up and running which circumvent having to use the Xbox app for talking altogether.&nbsp; Either one of these options will most
 likely be your best bet to get an actual semi-normal multi-player experience going(you know, multi-player where you can actually talk to someone you are playing with) seeing as this issue is not limited only to forza horizon 4 and I doubt it will be fixed
 by MS. feel free to add me if you feel like having a couple of races</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Temporary Internet Files cannot delete</h2>
                    Each day I check my C drive file size and each day it is getting smaller, I do a Disk Clean-Up and it is showing large amounts of Temporary Internet Files which will not delete and they increase daily.&nbsp; today it shows 31gb, I have tried moving the Temporary
 Internet File Location to a different drive, which removes them from the Disk Clean-up but does not free up any space on C drive. I do not use Edge or IE I use Google Chrome. I need help as I am running out of disk space&nbsp;

<p>Hi <strong>David</strong>,<br />
<br />
Normally, this issue with deleting temporary Internet files may occur if there are preserved website data. Can you tell us if you're getting any error messages when trying to delete the temporary files?
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest that you uncheck the<strong> Preserve Favorites website data</strong> box in the
<strong>Delete Browsing History</strong> and check if it helps. To do this, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Press <strong>Shift + Ctrl + Delete</strong> on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Preserve Favorites website data</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Constantly getting disconnected and signed out of online games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sm0kes56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constantly getting disconnected and signed out of online games</h2>
                    
<p>Lately every time I play a game online I encounter problems within a few minutes. Most of the time I get signed out and kicked to the dashboard, other times ill get error messages from the game saying ive been disconnected. The games will always boot up
 fine but ill inevitably be disconnected&nbsp;or signed out&nbsp;within a few minutes. It happens with every game.</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>&gt; Resetting my wi fi</p>
<p>&gt;resetting Caches</p>
<p>&gt;re-downloading games</p>
<p>&gt;turning the firewall off my wifi</p>
<p>&gt;my wi fi isn't blocking any mac or Dns addresses </p>
<p>The wi fi signal isn't bad, and I can use apps on my xbox like Netflix and youtube with no problems at all.</p>
<p>Any one got any other ideas what I can try?</p>
<p>im on the verge of throwing it out the window with frustration.</p>

<p>not saying it is although it could be someone trying to hack wifi keys</p>
<p>its a small peace of software that lists all wifi networks in its range including hidden networks</p>
<p>once they start attacking the wifi, the attack will try to disconect what ever you have connected wireless to your router</p>
<p>everytime it gets a client to disconect from the router the client try's to reconnect and when it does the attacker steels parts of your encrypted wifi network key in an attemp to decrypt it and gain your password.</p>
<p>i used Kali linux to attack my own networks in order to buildd the strongest security for my home nettwork.</p>
<p>The sad thing is its easy to do and quicker than you may think when using multi AMD graphic cards to decrypt the pass key</p>
<p>my advice is to make a long password using lowercase, uppercase, numbers and other char's for example:</p>
<p>Y$tR*Rf&amp;D!d%w"a9&amp;6^2)6£4</p>
<p>a pass key like this would be ultra hard to decrypt, it would take quite a few cards to decrypt it in say less than a week.</p>
<p>the bad news is, does not matter how strong the pass key is because the other software used to keep kicking you off your router is the pain in the A$$
</p>
<p>i rarely use wifi tthese days.. </p>

<h2>            How to disable Store payments to phone bill&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the store, I have saved my credit card number for purchases, but when I buy e.g. apps using my Lumia 950, the charge goes on my phone bill. That's unacceptable as this is my company phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On other hand, I need some work-related chargeable services like the Valopilkku app to book a taxi.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I keep the private Store purchases of apps and other content&nbsp;from mixing with work-related payments?</p>

            <p>Yes, can purchase an upgrade to Windows 8. In order to do the installation, you will need to boot to the Windows 7 desktop:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.
</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model. </li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

</p>
<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system&nbsp; </p>

<br />
<br />
I bought the PC with Win7 installed and the company provided me with discs - I have now unfortunately lost the discs.<br />
<br />
The PC does not boot up at all, I get a black screen basically directing me to repair, using the original discs.<br />
<br />
the company I bought the PC from tell me I that they do not have any replacement discs to provide me with and recommend I download an ISO file and burn that to a DVD and use that.<br />
<br />
The only place I can find to do this is digitalrivercontent.net but I am not sure if this is actually an 'official' site and am hesitant to use it without MS confirming that it is.<br />
<br />
the basic problem is that had a perfectly legit Win7, have lost the discs and seem to be at a dead end getting the PC back up and running and I don't want to take any dodgy shortcuts, I'm even willing to pay to get new discs but I don't want to simply buy a
 whole new lot of windows unless it is totally necessary.<br />
<br />
I didn't do any sort of back up (yes I know...I'm an idiot!) but I did install a shiny new HDD which I am happy to put a new set of windows on but I would really rather just get the original back up and running tbh<br />

(The steps are the same, except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><br />
Note: Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p><br />
====================== <strong>Keyless</strong> <strong>Install</strong> ================================</p>
<p>How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to: 'Type your Windows product key', do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p><br />
During this 30 day grace period you can try resolving your problems.&nbsp; <br />
After you are satisfied all problems have been resovled then activate Windows.</p>
<p><br />
====================== Device Drivers =================================</p>
<p><br />
Go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p><br />
If there are Windows 7 drivers, then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, USB, Graphics, Webcam, Etc., and so on.</p>

            <p>You can download the ISO from the links provided in J W Stuart's post, but unless it was a retail version of win7 from MS that was provided with the PC its still not going to work, allthough if it was an MS oem version that was origonally provided you may
 be able to convince the Activation centre to activate the installation.</p>
<p>And yes Digital River is an authorised scource, they are MS digital distribution centre</p>

    <title>Unstable Internet Connection Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mik mit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unstable Internet Connection Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>My internet connection drops several times a day. Sometimes it's stable for as much as a day but it's not unusual for me to lose the connection within minutes of booting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read and tried all the fixes I can find in this forum and others including flushing DNS, resetting winsock, resetting the winsock catalog, releasing and renewing the IP, running the troubleshooter (that tells me I have an invalid IP configuration) and
 rebooting. Rebooting is the only thing that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Studio XPS 8100 x64, 8 gb RAM,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Broadcom Netlink Gigabit Ethernet</p>
<p>Directly connected (not wireless)</p>
<p>IP Address 192.168.1.2</p>
<p>Subnet mask 255.255.255.0, 64</p>
<p>DHCP Enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a wireless adapter that I've disabled but connecting via wireless yields the same disconnection results. Once internet connectivity is lost, trying to enable and connect via wireless doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The router is Linksys and works fine. Resetting it doesn't do anything for the connection and my wireless android devices work fine when the Dell has lost connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that I tend to lose connection the most when there's some sort of streaming video going. I've had shockwave crash several times but I understand that's common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use both I.E. and Chrome with Chrome being the preferred browser. It doesn't seem to make any difference which browser I'm using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Malwarebytes paid subscription and it's up to date. I do get a message now and then that the root kit detector couldn't be installed and the system will need to be rebooted to enable rootkit detection. I have malicious website protection enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem seems very similar to many of the other posts I've seen on the internet but so far, none of the indicated solutions have been effective. It seems to have begun malfunctioning shortly after a Windows update but I can't really be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very troubling in that it seems to be a problem at the OS level and it makes it very difficult to work. Any ideas? I'm frustrated enough to spend some time going through a multi-day process to see if I can get it resolved. Thanks in advance for your
 help.</p>

            <p>Are there updated Network Adapter drivers available from the manufacturer or OEM?&nbsp; I have seen "Broadcom" constantly mentioned in similar posts.&nbsp; I almost suggest that you dump that make of Network Adapter and purchase and install another make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How long have you been suffering this problem?&nbsp; Has it been there since Windows 8.1 first installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is it the type of fault that can be easily diagnosed by using "Safe Mode with Networking", or by Clean Boot?&nbsp; If it is random then those methods may be hard to use.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Linney.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know if safe mode will help. I've been connected for 12 hours now. Working for days in safe mode just to see if it fails may not be helpful in that the diagnosis may not help in that it would likely give me the same diagnosis I get in a regular
 boot. The network configuration is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the device manager, the driver is the latest available. I've tried updating it several times and it says there isn't a more recent driver. I know that can be incorrect sometimes but don't know how to fix that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran W8.1 for nearly a year without any connectivity problem. Very odd. Then I got a blue screen and had trouble rebooting. I haven't had a blue screen since and it seems like it was a month or so after that when the connectivity problems started. I don't
 remember the blue screen message but I looked it up and the information was non-descript. In other words, there were multiple possible causes from a temporary glitch in RAM to a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may try a different network adapter card or maybe a clean boot. Of course, the clean boot may not reveal a problem but at least it would eliminate a software conflict. In looking at the services enabled, I noticed a couple of Intuit updaters. I uninstalled
 Quicken because it didn't work with my bank but the updaters remain. These could also be from TurboTax but I do recall the connectivity problem being right around the time I removed Quicken. I'll disable those services and see if I have any further problem.</p>

            <p>For me the answer was moving back to a previous version of the Broadcom driver. Sadly, I have automatic updates on and included drivers in that protocol. It updated to a higher version though the correct version was a previous one. I took it back to the
 Broadcom driver&nbsp;15.6.0.10 and that seems to have solved my problem with Windows 8.1. I have also noticed that some have taken it back to the Windows 7 version. Sad that an automatic update would break Windows 8.1 but it did. Someone is not paying attention
 and correcting problems. Hopefully, this thread will wake someone up at Microsoft and Broadcom. At least look into it guys. I have had internet access for over 24 hours now without interruption with this driver where I was getting between 1 minute and 2 hours
 with the "newer" version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also of note, the failure usually occurred during some sort of video process, be it Flash Player or some of the MS technology like Silverlight. Now that I've reverted to this version, Silverlight no longer works with Amazon video.
<br />
<br />
Clearly, there is a problem with software and driver technologies that MS and Broadcom need to address. Sadly, there are many people suffering from automatic updates without access to the proper corrective technology. MS needs to provide free upgrades to functioning
 technology.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Forgot Xbox Live Account Email&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bite that apple  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forgot Xbox Live Account Email&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I would only like a level 'S' to respond to this please.</strong></span></p>

<p>Well, I'm just going to explain what I need so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to steal an account, but it's going to be a bit of a story, so here I go.</p>
<p>A few years ago (like 7 or so) when account thieves were lurking around the Xbox world, I fell into one of those traps and my account was stolen. When I found this out, I of course called Xbox Customer Support about my situation (and back then when accounts
 were stolen, it took a month or two to get the accounts back) I was extremely bored so I ended up creating a new account for the time being. So while I was playing on my 'new' account, the last DLC (map pack 3) came out for Call of Duty: World at War came
 out, and because all my friends were playing it, I wanted to play it really badly, so I bought the DLC on my 'new' account, and when my main account was finally returned to me, I was actually able to play the DLC without having to rebuy it for this account,
 which was quite nice.</p>

<p>Now we come back to this year. My 7 year old Xbox broke, and I needed to buy a new one so I ended up getting it and using the Data Transfer Kit to transfer all the content from my old HDD to the new internal Xbox S 360 HDD, everything went well. Now today,
 I became so bored that I just started playing some of my older games, and I put in World at War and began playing multiplayer (with all the fun killing modders) and it said that I didn't have one of the map packs, so I ended up putting some 'research' into
 this, and later remembered that I I downloaded it on an account that I don't remember the email/password to, but I do remember the gamertag used when buying this DLC.</p>

<p>Now because I have been on xbox live for quite some time, I do know what typical things would be asked and such, someone is going to most likely say "Have you tried to use the content transfer system?", yes I have and that didn't work, it still said that
 I didn't have the DLC. What I can do is give the Name of person using the account, and&nbsp; Street City, State, and zip code, what I can't do is give a secret answer or last 4 digits of credit card information (at this time, I don't believe email accounts were
 required to have a "secret question and answer" so this most likely doesn't apply). So I know this won't get me anymore, so what I was thinking (not sure if this would work) but I have the Gamertag name, and my original Xbox 360 Serial number if this can get
 me anywhere?</p>

<p>So to sum this up:</p>
<p>I want only a level S person to answer this, and I would like him to answer my simple question of: "Can I retrieve my old account with just the gamertag, and serial number of my xbox 360, and or any information with 'Name of person using the account, and&nbsp;
 Street City, State, and zip code'</p>

<p>I do understand that you are wanting an S ranked person but just in case they are buisy allow me to help you out with this.
</p>
<p>First it will not be able to recover it with just a Gamertag and serial number. (The serial number is used mainly for hardware issues. )</p>
<p>Second, like springer stated, if you call up live support with the gamertag-provide them with enough information to get into the account they will be able to assist you further in recovering the account. However, it does sounds like you may run into some
 blocks trying this. </p>
<p>If you call support and find that you can not access the account there is really not much else you can do without the email address. Usually there are ways they can try and escalate the issue but without the account name to fill out an account recovery form,
 it kind of puts you in between a rock and a hard place. </p>
<p>Again, I know I do not have an S but I hope you find this useful while you wait.

<p>Basically, with the gamertag known, they will be able to see what the email is, but you will need to follow recovery steps if you don't have all the credentials for it.</p>
<p>If it was an email that doesn't exist any more, it will be a rough road.</p>

<p>Hey there Apple! While I'm flattered you want one of us Agents to respond, Springer here has all the right moves. If you are unable to recover your account, and the steps at
<a href="http://xbox.com/forgot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/forgot</a> don't help, contacting an account agent directly (phone or chat) would be the only way to get help on this. Please let us know how that goes, thanks!

<p>If you call they may be able to ask a secret question, my boyfriend's account was set up 7 years ago, when our console broke we only had the option of a security question for a password reset, and we never even signed into the email account on a PC. At some
 point it asked to create a security question, if you can pass it with support you may be able to have them help you with the email, or if you only have used a few emails (or back then they required you to have a hotmail/live account the same reason we had
 the problem) you can figure it out and reset it by process of elimination. Go to account.live.com, enter in the emails you've made, if it says MSA is invalid, then you know it's wrong, if it goes to password reset options, your on the right path.

</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I would only like a level 'S' to respond to this please.</strong></span></p>
<p>Well, I'm just going to explain what I need so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to steal an account, but it's going to be a bit of a story, so here I go.</p>
<p>A few years ago (like 7 or so) when account thieves were lurking around the Xbox world, I fell into one of those traps and my account was stolen. When I found this out, I of course called Xbox Customer Support about my situation (and back then when accounts
 were stolen, it took a month or two to get the accounts back) I was extremely bored so I ended up creating a new account for the time being. So while I was playing on my 'new' account, the last DLC (map pack 3) came out for Call of Duty: World at War came
 out, and because all my friends were playing it, I wanted to play it really badly, so I bought the DLC on my 'new' account, and when my main account was finally returned to me, I was actually able to play the DLC without having to rebuy it for this account,
 which was quite nice.</p>
<p>Now we come back to this year. My 7 year old Xbox broke, and I needed to buy a new one so I ended up getting it and using the Data Transfer Kit to transfer all the content from my old HDD to the new internal Xbox S 360 HDD, everything went well. Now today,
 I became so bored that I just started playing some of my older games, and I put in World at War and began playing multiplayer (with all the fun killing modders) and it said that I didn't have one of the map packs, so I ended up putting some 'research' into
 this, and later remembered that I I downloaded it on an account that I don't remember the email/password to, but I do remember the gamertag used when buying this DLC.</p>
<p>Now because I have been on xbox live for quite some time, I do know what typical things would be asked and such, someone is going to most likely say "Have you tried to use the content transfer system?", yes I have and that didn't work, it still said that
 I didn't have the DLC. What I can do is give the Name of person using the account, and&nbsp; Street City, State, and zip code, what I can't do is give a secret answer or last 4 digits of credit card information (at this time, I don't believe email accounts were
 required to have a "secret question and answer" so this most likely doesn't apply). So I know this won't get me anymore, so what I was thinking (not sure if this would work) but I have the Gamertag name, and my original Xbox 360 Serial number if this can get
 me anywhere?</p>
<p>So to sum this up:</p>
<p>I want only a level S person to answer this, and I would like him to answer my simple question of: "Can I retrieve my old account with just the gamertag, and serial number of my xbox 360, and or any information with 'Name of person using the account, and&nbsp;
 Street City, State, and zip code'</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live account muted.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was playing COD:AW on Xbox One and opened dashboard by mistake and accidentally changed a setting on my &nbsp;Xbox Live account where it muted everything in game except for voice chat and made the game laggy I cant even play. I checked the console settings
 and the game setting everything seems to be normal, Its something that is wrong with the xbox live account. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</p>

<p>Xbox One, I tried making a new Xbox Live account but that one had the same problem to I guess its a problem with the system and not the account.
</p>
<p>The problem is the connection in multiplayer is 1 bar so its really laggy but if I disconnect from internet and play campaign It has the exact same lag. so its not the internet.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Khaled_shitos, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to know that you are facing an issue to use any Flash drives on your system.</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p>You may refer to computer manufacturer website and try installing the latest version of Chipset drivers.</p>
<p>If Windows 8 drivers are not available, you may install Windows 7 drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span>a. Download the drivers from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click on the driver and click on <b>‘properties’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the <b>‘compatibility’</b> tab and check the box <b>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</b> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on <b>‘Apply’</b> and click <b>‘OK’</b> to install it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>You may try running the Hardware and Device troubleshooter and check windows updates for driver updates.
</p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<strong><span>a. </span></strong>Press <strong><span>Windows Key +R</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>Control Panel.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>b. </span></strong></span>Type<strong><span> troubleshooting </span>
</strong>in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.<br />
<strong><span>c. </span></strong>Click on <strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong>, click on
<strong><span>Hardware and Devices.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>d. </span></strong></span>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>After running the troubleshooter, check in Windows updates if any drivers’ updates are available for the device. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. At the Start screen, type <b>Windows Update</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>b. Click or <b>tap Settings on the right side of the screen</b>, and then select
<b>Install optional updates</b> from the left results.</span></p>
<p><span>c. When the Windows Update control panel opens, click on “<b>Check for Updates</b>” on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Prakhar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur with other USB devices connected to the system?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried to uninstall all the USB devcies controller and chipset drives to the latest version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try installing the&nbsp;lates version of Chipset drivers from <span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4132&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=5358557#N1047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>HP Support Website</font></a><font color="#000000">
</font></span>and also install the BIOS updates.</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Important: Modifying BIOS (Basic input output system)/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot
 guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</font></font></span></p>
<p>Also check for and install the avialable Windows Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            yes it occurs with other usb devices too(pen drive,external mouse, external keyboard).issue occurs in all 3 usb ports .once it occurs ,it doesn't matter to which port i am connecting my usb devices or how many usb devices i am connecting simultaneously,
 it won't work,the issue is resolved only when i restart.
<div>how should i install BIOS update properly?how would i know they are correctly installed?and what should i do in case if CMOS settings are incorrectly installed?</div>

<h2>            Venting about Windows backup</h2>
                    <p>original title:&nbsp;Windows 7 Backup Utterly ___ useless...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no question, just venting.. <br />
<br />
I have a failing hard disk in&nbsp;my newly installed PC with Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; Windows has informed me of a SMART error this morning and that I should backup immediately..
<br />
<br />
I already knew this but the Volume Shadow Copy Service won't run.&nbsp; Therefore the entire Windows Backup feature is utterly useless and fails.&nbsp; There is no help or solutiions for getting the VSS to run again. KB Articles are useless also.&nbsp; Help is usless - it
 says "Check to see if this is a legal copy, and open help, and something else that is useless.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks Microsoft for creating yet another unreliable and useless product for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm getting pretty sick of Microsoft's marketing products as Microsoft is little more than a marketing company now.. The development talent has long gone..&nbsp; and the product quality
 is reflecting that.<br />
<br />
How pathetic to create a backup system that is dependent on a service. <br />
<br />
I can't wait until there's an alternate computing platform in which to get my work done.&nbsp; Not Apple though.
<br />
<br />
Anyone know of some imaging software that works with Windows 7 and doesn't depend on one of it's services?
<br />
